At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Waste Management first quarter, 2014 earnings release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator instructions) I will now turn the call over to Ed Egl, Director, Investor Relations. Okay, Mr. Ed Egl, you may begin your conference. Ed Egl : Thank you, Jenisha. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us to our first quarter, 2014 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Fish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Trevathan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information. During the call you will hear forward-looking statements which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today\u2019s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. David and Jim will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume which unless otherwise stated are more specifically references to Internal Revenue Growth or IRG from yield or volume. Additionally any comparisons unless otherwise stated will be with the first quarter of 2013. During the call, David and Jim will discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS or Earnings Per Share. David and Jim will also address operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin as defined in the schedule for today\u2019s press release. For purposes in the past and into the prior period [ph], our first quarter 2013 EPS, income from operations margin, operating EBITDA, and operating EBITDA margin have been adjusted to exclude items that management believes did not reflect our fundamental business performance were not indicative of our results of operations. These measures in addition to free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release foot note and schedules which can be found on the company\u2019s website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures. This call is being recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning at approximately 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today until 5 :00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 8.

Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, David Steiner. David Steiner : Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our fourth quarter conference call we said the January results indicated the strength of our business. That strength continued in February and March and lead to a strong start into the year. The momentum in our yield and cost control programs continued throughout Q1. Our field operations teams also did a great job of managing the effects of the severe weather that probated the quarter. As a result, we are in $0.49 per share, an increase of more than 22% when compared to the first quarter of 2013. We saw good improvement in all areas, income from operations, operating EBITDA, margin and free cash flow. We\u2019re encouraged by the strong start and we expect the momentum to continue as we are heading in our seasonal upturn. Our yield programs continue to drive our margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal yield was 2.6% which is the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential yield improvement. The effect of low inflation rates on our CPI based contract are certainly a headwind, but we overcame that headwind to drive yield to its highest level in three years. Core price increased to 4.2%, a year-over-year improvement of 100 basis points and the highest level we\u2019ve ever seen. Each of our lines of business had positive yield except C&D which was impacted by higher price Super Storm Sandy time we received in 2013. Average rates per unit for MSW, commercial and industrial are also the highest rates that we\u2019ve ever seen. When compared to the first quarter of 2013, average rates increased 5.6% in the industrial line, 4.9% in the commercial line and 4% in our MSW line. This is a tremendous accomplishment by our team. As we\u2019ve repeatedly stated, we need yield at about 2% to see margin expansion. And we will execute our yield program to continue to drive that expansion. Clearly this has some effect on volumes. But the tradeoff remains very positive. Turning to volumes, in the first quarter, volumes were negative 1.8% which is an improvement of 40 basis points from the fourth quarter. The losses in our commercial volumes improved to 30 basis points from the fourth quarter. But I wouldn\u2019t yet call that improvement of trend. Roll off volumes were down about 200 basis points from the fourth quarter, but we would expect those losses to moderate as we enter our seasonal upturn. Our landfill volumes, particularly special waste, were strong in the first quarter. However, they were offset by declines in the collection lines of business. As we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re not focused on getting the most volumes, we\u2019re focused on getting the best volumes. We\u2019re looking for the best mix of yield and volume to drive income from operations, dollars and margin. Jim will give more details, but despite negative volumes, overall income from operations grew more than 13%, and our income from operations margin grew 140 basis points. Operating EBITDA increased about 7%, and operating EBITDA margins increased 100 basis points. Our traditional solid waste business has performed very well in the first quarter. We saw a strong income from operations and margin improvement in our commercial, industrial, landfill and transportation lines of business. And our overall traditional solid waste income from operations margin, grew 50 basis points. Our recycling operations drove a little less than one set decline in our earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2013. This decline is due to the 1.8% drop in average commodity prices for the quarter and weather related operating challenges. We\u2019ve seen our operating cost improved as we tighten our enforcement on contaminated loads and modify the methods for calculating rebates to customers. We\u2019re also engaged in broad based efforts with our recycling customers, consumer brand owners and others to educate them of the evolving recycling in commodities markets and how to reduce contamination. Overall, we still expect to achieve our recycling guidance of flat earnings per share when compared to 2013. Turning to our waste energy business, in the first quarter operating results were essentially flat when compared to 2013. But overall results benefited from a spike [ph] in electricity prices in the quarter, driven by the cold and the normal winter [ph]. In April, we\u2019re seeing electricity prices moderate as warmer weather has arrived on the East Coast. So we expect earnings from our waste energy operations to be similar to 2013 in the remaining three quarters. Looking at free cash flow, the first quarter of 2014 is the highest free cash flow quarter since 2008 at $484 million, driven by our strong results in working capital management, supplemented by $166 million of divestitures, primarily our waste energy joint venture in China. So 2014 is up to a strong start. And we have the momentum to achieve our four-year goals of adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and $2.35 per fully diluted share. With the strong first quarter free cash flow, we now expect 40 to free cash flow [ph] between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. As we move to the second quarter and see the seasonal upturn, we will likely refine the various elements of our guidance in connection with our second quarter results. But for now, we\u2019ve demonstrated that our field and corporate managers can execute our pricing and cost control program. And through their efforts, we\u2019re confident we can achieve our goal. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim, to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. Jim Fish : Thank you, David. As David mentioned, we had a strong performance in all aspects of our income statement. Our revenue grew 1.8% in the first quarter to $3.4 billion. Strong yield and acquisition revenue were the main drivers with volume declines and a negative foreign currency translation yielding revenue growth. The effects impact on revenue was approximately $17 million. We continue to see improvement in all our cost lines. With respect to operating cost, operating cost as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to 65.7%, an increase $23 million in the first quarter, both [ph] associated with recently acquired businesses increased almost $30 million and were partially offset by improvements in disposal on labor cost [ph]. SG&A cost improved $15 million to $375 million, and improved as the percent of revenue by 70 basis points to 11%. With the strong results in the first quarter, we expect us to achieve our full year SG&A goals. Turning to cash flow, for the first quarter we generated $484 million of free cash flow, an increase of $136 million when compared to 2013. We accomplished this in part by growing our net cash provided by operating activities, $7 million to $584 million, improving working capital and by maintaining discipline on capital spending. We grew free cash flow despite over $100 million of headwinds from the payment of our annual incentive compensation and the maturity of interest rate swaps related to a plan senior note issuance. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $266 million, the same amount that we spend in the first quarter of 2013. We also had some divestitures in the quarter, most notably we monetized our investment in China for about $155 million. Even if you exclude the divestiture proceeds, our free cash flow, up $318 million was still the highest free cash flow since 2008. Looking at internal revenue growth, we continue to execute on the tradeoff between yield and volume to determine the best mix in order to maximize income from operations, dollars and the margins. Our strategy worked in the first quarter just as it did for the full year 2013. For the total company, in the first quarter, our collection and disposal yield was 2.6% with volumes declining 1.8%. This lead to income from operations growing $55 million, margin growing 140 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $49 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 100 basis points. Looking at the commercial and industrial lines of business, the yield and volume tradeoff worked well. In both cases, strong yield results offset volume declines resulting in commercial income from operations growing more than $6 million, and margin growing 50 basis points. In industrial, income from operations grew almost $7 million and margin expanded 110 basis points. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion in industrial. So yield above 2% in those lines of business drove margin expansion despite negative volumes. This did not hold true in our residential line where yield was 1.1% driven by low CPI. In addition, we lost a few contracts that we saw \u2013 where we saw competition significantly lower price the levels that were below our required return on capital. We expect to see margins improved as our cost control programs drive down operating costs and as we add new residential contracts at acceptable returns. In the landfill line of business for the first quarter, we saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield. Total landfill volumes increased 3.8%, combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes were positive [ph] 7.9%. And MSW volumes grew by 0.9%. C&D volume declines 2.2% primarily due to a tough Sandy comparison. This lead to income from operations growing $11 million which is the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, and margins grew 130 basis points. Finally, looking at our other financial metrics at the end of the first quarter, our weighted average cost to debt was 4.9%, and our debt to total capital ratio was 62.8%. So pulling away portion of [ph] our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate in the first quarter was 29.6% due to a non-cash adjustment to our differed taxes from state tax law changes. This benefited us by a positive $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter. Our year-over-year benefit was a positive $0.02 per share. For the next three quarters, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 35%. Our first quarter results have started 2014 on the right path. We are encouraged by the results which we could not been achieved without the hard work of our employees. I know they are focused on making 2014 a successful year, and I thank them for that. And with that Jenisha, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : (Operator instructions) We\u2019ll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roaster. Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse. Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse : Good morning. Thank you. Just \u2013 hey, good morning. Just a question on the volume side, do you have a sense of how much of your volume loss is self-inflicted in, in terms of walking away from low margin business versus other competitors in the market as being more aggressive? And then separately on the volume side, is the \u2013 is the spring slow down within housing going to push out some of the commercial new business formation in your business? What\u2019s your view on those two topics within volume? David Steiner : Yes, Hamzah, on the first one, I don\u2019t think the slowdown in housing will push it out. As you know, we\u2019ve been waiting for that commercial volume to see significant improvement. I don\u2019t think that that one quarter slowing down, when the housing starts, our re-sales will have an effect on that. On the other one, you\u2019ll have to look at the various lines of business, right? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that in the residential line of business and in the industrial line of business, we walk away from low margin business. There is absolutely no doubt about that. On the commercial side, there is just not a lot of growth. And our strategy is that we aren\u2019t going to chase volumes because if we chase volumes and because there\u2019s not a lot of growth, we\u2019re going to have to take those volumes from someone else. And that\u2019s just not something we\u2019re willing to do. We\u2019re not willing to go out and grab volumes at a low price because if we do that, that\u2019s what starts the downward spiral in price. And so, when we see those volumes pickup, we fully expect to get our fair share of that. So I would tell you that that we walk away from residential and industrial business that\u2019s low margin. When it\u2019s low margin, it\u2019s generally low return on capital. And so, we\u2019re making a good business decision to walk away from it. On the commercial side, I wouldn\u2019t say that we are intentionally walking away from business, I would say that we\u2019re more focused on retaining the business that we have than going out and trying to get new volumes with low price. But once we see the rising tide, when we see those commercial volumes pickup, we fully expect to get our fair share. Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse : And then just on pricing, could you \u2013 could you give us your thought process in putting up the pricing bonus structure? You put a pricing gate [ph] in place a couple years ago, and then it went away. How prominent is this pricing gate [ph] that you\u2019ve set up? And should we expect \u2013 is this a signal to the market that you\u2019re more disciplined and you were not disciplined previously? How do you \u2013 how should we think about these pricing gates [ph] coming in sporadically and then maybe going out at certain times? David Steiner : Yes, I think \u2013 look, Hamzah, I think everybody knows that the strategy at Waste Management is that you\u2019re always better off getting yield over volumes, right? And so, we\u2019re always going to be a yield-focused company. Now, you can get yield in a lot of ways. You can have the gate [ph] which that you mentioned which is sort of a hammer if you will, you can have \u2013 look, we meet with our folks every month to see how they\u2019re doing, and you\u2019ve got that as sort of an honor on it [ph]. And then you can also put in place an incentive program. You know, look, when we saw \u2013 when we saw the yield go down dramatically in 2012, we knew we had to do something dramatic. And so, we weren\u2019t going to just rely on meeting with folks every month and saying obviously your job is expected to be driving yield, we wanted to get a little bit more incentive. So we decided to make it a positive incentive. And as you can see what we\u2019ve \u2013 look, we\u2019ve quadrupled yield since we put that in place. If that\u2019s what we have to do to get it done, it is a great tradeoff for all our shareholders, I can guarantee it. So there will always be something that we will do with respect to yield. Either we\u2019ll put in place a gate, we\u2019ll put in place an incentive program or we\u2019ll make sure that we have our focus on it so that our field mangers focuses on it. We will always do that. And so, we\u2019re going to use those three \u2013 combination of those three things to continue to drive yield. Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. And just lastly, I\u2019ll turn it over, maybe for Jim. Could you help us understand the \u2013 why you are not raising earnings guidance but free cash flow guidance is going up? Is that all asset divestitures or maybe give us a little more color on the delta between that? Jim Fish : Yes. So couple of questions there, Hamzah. And I think the reason we\u2019re not raising free cash flow guidance is because while we were pleased with the quarter, this is the first quarter. And so, we\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll refine our guidance in the second quarter. The \u2013 when you think about free cash flow, I think that was question was kind of the components of free cash flow, and I think that\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re getting at is which pieces of it are sustainable and which are not. Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse : Right. Jim Fish : You know, if you think about free cash flow and break it down to its component parts, CapEx was essentially flat, it was based \u2013 exactly flat actually. And then EBITDA was up $49 million driven by a nice quarter for weedy [ph], driven by some core business improvements and driven by SG&A, cost controls. And then the other piece, the other big mover there outside of divestitures which was almost exclusively the Chinese divestiture, the other big mover was cash flow from operations. And we had about $100 million \u2013 $106 million to be exact of headwind there from the termination of the \u2013 or from the core starting swap [ph] and then from the bonus payout. And so, working in the right direction there was DSO and DPO [ph] which were better by a day and five days respectively, so year-over-year. And I think we have some room to improve there. So I would argue that that\u2019s \u2013 the quality here is pretty strong. Most of what I\u2019ve talked about, I would argue is sustainable with the obvious exception of the onetime asset divestiture. David Steiner : Hey, Hamzah, I think the important thing is that we did $318 million without divestitures which is the highest we\u2019ve had since 2008, and that\u2019s with $100 million of headwind. And the beauty of it is those $100 million of headwinds or first quarter headwinds, they don\u2019t recur in the second and third and fourth quarter. So we had a great first quarter despite the headwinds. We won\u2019t have those kind of headwinds in the \u2013 to three quarters [ph]. So obviously we\u2019re very optimistic about free cash flow. But as Jim said, we\u2019ve always said, whether it\u2019s a good winter weather or a bad winter weather, it is hard to judge a full year by the first three months of the year. So we like to see the seasonal upturn before we make a call on how the full year is going to play out. And so, we thought that\u2019s what the \u2013 we thought that\u2019s what would be prudent to do right here which is to say, let\u2019s see what the seasonal upturn bring in the second quarter, and we\u2019ll refine the guidance as appropriate. Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, great. Thank you. David Steiner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Market. Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market : Good morning. David Steiner : Good morning. Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market : Question for you guys on landfill pricing and volume dynamics. Before you release on an active landfill base is it looks like volumes were up by about 3.4%. One, can you guys give us a sense on yield for those landfills? And then two, you had a peer that reported landfill volumes up, I believe it was 90% earlier this week, can you just help me bridge the gap there? I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s a function of just geography or maybe if you\u2019re seeing a little bit less volume here because of your pricing strategy as well? David Steiner : Yes, look, the landfill volume it\u2019s driven those big numbers but when it happens for us, I got \u2013 I won\u2019t speak to other companies. But when we get those type of big numbers, it\u2019s generally special waste jobs. And you got two things going on there, you got year-over-year cost, right? If we had a great special waste quarter last year, it\u2019s harder comp. And then you got the fact that those special waste jobs are jobs that they vary from season to season. So what I would tell you is that we are very encouraged by the landfill volumes, we still see a very strong pipeline. So we\u2019d expect them to be positive for the full year. From a pricing perspective as we said, look, price doesn\u2019t particularly matter as much as special waste, and then C&D as it does and MSW. So when we look at the \u2013 at the yield components, we look at MSW, when we look at the average unit price so that \u2013 in the MSW line, we grew at 4%. So we\u2019re well on our way to getting what we\u2019ve said is sort of that 5% to 7% price increase in the landfill, at 4% we\u2019re well on our way to getting there. Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market : Perfect, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And, David, I want to practice [ph] this question by just saying, I think that pricing discipline out of you guys is critical. But I\u2019m just curious when you started your pricing strategy about a year ago, were you expecting your peers to buy into raising rates? And then maybe what\u2019s your view on sustaining the strategy if the waste recovery continues to be relatively slow, is this something that you could stick with to this magnitude for another year or two? David Steiner : Yes, look, I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t speak to what we \u2013 what we expect or we don\u2019t expect that of our competitors. All I could tell you is what we\u2019re going to do. And it goes back to what I said earlier, look, when you got sort of stick pie [ph], there\u2019s only one way you can get volumes. And that is to go out and steal them from someone else. And we\u2019ve seen what happens when we do that. Look, we\u2019ve done that in the past where we steal volumes from someone else, what do they do? They steal them from us. And before you know it, you have a downward ice spiral. And you all have heard me say it a million times, it\u2019s a two to one or three to one tradeoff. You can get 1% of price and lose 2% to 3% of your volume and you\u2019re still ahead of the game. And so, you just can\u2019t chase that downward spiral because you can never get enough volumes to make up for the drop in price. So you\u2019re not going to see that strategy change for us. Now, look, will we rather have more volumes? Absolutely, but what I\u2019m saying is when we get more volumes it\u2019s not going to be because we\u2019re going out and steal them at a lower price, it\u2019s going to be because that everyone is getting more volumes, and we fully expect to get our fair share of the increase in volume. And so, what we\u2019ve seen is that the \u2013 we think the economy has moderated. We don\u2019t expect to see the volumes improved dramatically, but we don\u2019t expect to see them decreased dramatically either. And obviously we\u2019re going to see improvement during the second quarter with the seasonal upturn. So I would say that we have a sort of a muted sense of optimism on volumes, but that \u2013 you\u2019re not going to see us change our strategy because it\u2019s a strategy that drives shareholder value. And that is we\u2019re always going to favor yield over volume. Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market : Right. Just one quick one, Jim, can you remind us what the flow through is for that $27 million variance for electricity? Jim Fish : Well, so most of that electricity was from rates, Joe. In fact, I would say it was \u2013 it was exclusively from rates. Our kilowatt hours were actually down slightly due to some permanent plant shutdowns, reduced load and some operating changes. So I would say that that\u2019s a top line benefit we saw was exclusively from rates. And so, that ends up flowing through the bottom line. Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market : Great. Thanks for your time guys. David Steiner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Wunderlich. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: Hey, good morning, David, Jim and Jim. David Steiner : Good morning, Michael. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: So I need a little clarity because there\u2019s numbers being thrown around and I\u2019m \u2013 I mean, I may be confused myself. In your release, you show \u2013 and the data point I think is a terrific one you show. But you show having done 21.3 million tons at the landfill and 14 versus 211 and then at \u2013 a year ago, and 211 has Sandy in it. So to get to the \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s just about 1% which I thought was great given the Sandy comparison, but everybody is talking about 3% or better, help me understand how I\u2019m understanding volume at the landfill as I could. David Steiner : Yes, look, Michael, as you know, when we look at internal revenue growth, we don\u2019t look at it on a tonnage basis. We look at it \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of different mix issues that go into it. And so, when we\u2019re giving those numbers, you\u2019re looking at mix and price. And then when we look at, at least at C&D, I\u2019m sorry. When we look at special waste, we put all of it into volume because you can\u2019t really pull out the price. And so, you might get some lower deviations there, but when we look at, we say, the numbers are obviously indicative of the trend, and I think you hit the nail on the head. The trend is obviously positive, particularly given the Sandy comparisons, particularly given that so many of our operations were shut down during the quarter, but the landfill trends are clearly positive. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: Okay. So the 3.8 when that was given earlier, that\u2019s actually the revenue growth or is that how you \u2013 I just want to \u2013 I actually think it\u2019s great that you showed the 1% volume the way you\u2019ve put it in the chart given all of the headwind issue you just described. David Steiner : Right. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: So what I\u2019m \u2013 I just \u2013 David Steiner : You know, the 3.8 is the total growth from volume. But again, with special waste because special waste prices and transportation cost move around a lot, we don\u2019t split out price and volume and special waste, we put it all into volume. So that excuse the numbers a little bit. But again \u2013 Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: [Indiscernible] David Steiner : [Indiscernible] but directionally you can see they\u2019re both \u2013 they\u2019re both positive directionally. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: Perfect. So the follow on to that would be, do you ever recall [ph] out of the 211 that\u2019s total tons and that you showed in disposal, how much of that was Sandy? So in reality, the landfill in 1Q \u201814 weather aside saw better than a 1% volume growth, tons [indiscernible]? David Steiner : Yes, that\u2019s absolutely right [ph]. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: Okay. And so, the next question would be, if you were looking at who\u2019s driving us the scales, do you have a sense that this is more construction or it\u2019s actually maybe more commercial? And where I\u2019m getting to is are we starting to see that secular recovery of volume in the container, the commercial it\u2019s somewhere out here in the next quarter or two starts converting into that operating leverage from service intervals. David Steiner : No, I think that\u2019s right. I think if you ask our folks on the field, they\u2019ll tell you that special waste and C&D are where they see this real strength in the pipeline. Obviously MSW has been strength now from many quarters in a row. But I think what they\u2019ll tell you out there, very optimistic is about special waste and \u2013 about special waste and C&D. You know, I mean, look, the reality is that you had a lot of pent up demand felt [ph] particularly in the Northeastern and Midwest, you had a lot of pent up demand built up during the winter, and you see a little bit of that. But we also think that we\u2019re seeing a secular pickup obviously in the construction industry. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: Okay. On the free cash flow \u2013 and I appreciate that you\u2019re being clear that you can add or subtract the asset sale number that do to calculation. But on a \u2013 if I look at it on a cash from up less [ph] capital spending approach, what does it take for this business to do $1.5 billion on those metrics? And \u2013 because asset sales come and go, where is the leverage without getting help from volume? This is you running the business better, how \u2013 where do \u2013 where do we see that? Where should we look for that as we progress? And how quickly could you get it? Jim Fish : Boy, how quickly can we get it? I don\u2019t know. I think we\u2019re making pretty good progress here. If you exclude \u2013 what you\u2019re excluding that divestures piece which we look at that as well. And then you \u2013 then you get to the progress we\u2019re making on working capital. David, and I both have kind of have touched on that today. And we still have some room there, Michael, be or so improved by really only a day, and DPO [ph] by five days. So fairly pleased with the improvement of DPO [ph], but not necessarily pleased with the improvement of DSO. And both of them still have room for improvement. So I would argue that that\u2019s an area for continued improvements. The EBITDA \u2013 $49 million in EBITDA, and growth there is strong in light of kind of before we faced [ph] in the winter season. Our woody [ph] business did a nice job of offsetting the weather impact in our core business. But our core business still grew which I think is an important thing to mention. Our core business grew, and we had \u2013 look, we have some challenges, and we didn\u2019t \u2013 we didn\u2019t mention it in our scripts because we just don\u2019t want to blame anything on the weather. But we felt pretty darn good about the growth in EBITDA when at the same time we were shut down in Houston for a couple of days, we were shut down at Atlanta I think for four days in a quarter. So that clearly was some impact on the operation. But it does speak to a couple of things, and that is \u2013 that\u2019s Jim Trevathan and his team did a nice job of pulling some cost out when we knew we were going to be shut down. So I think back to your original question though, hard to say when exactly we will get to a number in the 15 range excluding divestitures. But I sure think we\u2019re on the right path with our cost control program, with our yield program and then continued work on CapEx discipline and working capital. David Steiner : Hey, Michael look, just to add to that, from a sustained $1.5 billion point of view and you said, talk about it without volume. The reality is you can\u2019t get there without volume, right? I mean, look, we can \u2013 we said that a million times, we\u2019ve said once which is you can\u2019t get margin expansion unless you get 2% yield, right? And so, if you don\u2019t get the yields, you have no chance in getting there. You can\u2019t get there on cost alone, right? So you got to get above 2% yield or else you have not shot at getting there. So we\u2019ve done that. We\u2019ve driven our yield up to 2.6%. You know, if we \u2013 if we got back the money the money that we lost from the lose volumes which is mostly intentionally lost volumes, we\u2019re there, right? And so, I would tell you that from a sustained long-term point of view, $1.5 billion happens when we see our commercial volumes turn back to flat, when we stop seeing the leakage of cash from lost volumes. Now look, you can\u2019t have \u2013 I think you need it too [ph]. So you can\u2019t \u2013 right now like I keep saying, in this fix volume environment, you can\u2019t have both. You can\u2019t have both 2.6% yield and 2.6% volume. We did that \u2013 remember we did that in 2012, we had positive volumes and 1% price. We all saw what that got us. That doesn\u2019t get you $1.5 billion in free cash. It doesn\u2019t get you margin expansion. So what I would tell you, Michael is you can\u2019t look at this without volumes, you got to look at it as the right mix of price and volumes. And until we see that commercial pie start to grow so that we can get back to flat volumes, you\u2019re going to see us generate somewhere between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. Once we get \u2013 once you see those volumes starting to turn, that\u2019s when you get $1.5 billion plus. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: Okay. So to that end, on the landfill side of your business, do you feel good about the nature of the pricing that you\u2019re instilling discipline in that commercial collection market by the private guy as supposed to subsidizing their ability to approach you [ph]? David Steiner : Yes, look, again, you\u2019ve heard me talked about that a million times. That\u2019s absolutely critical to the long-term strategy. And yes, I feel \u2013 I actually feel very good about that. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: And do it about it in the sense [ph] that the market is starting to follow as well as supposed to you \u2013 David Steiner : No, look, again, we \u2013 look, we don\u2019t pay attention to what the market does frankly because what the market does is not going to influence what we do. We are going to do what we do because we \u2013 because look, I\u2019ve been here 10 years and I\u2019ve seen it both ways. I\u2019ve seen us play the volume game and I\u2019ve seen us play the price game. And there\u2019s only one way that we can grow the bottom line and that is by playing the price game. So I\u2019m encouraged by it because we go through a monthly and a quarterly review with each of the folks that re managing those businesses, and we have started to ask them tell us about your top 10 customers and what are we doing with price. And so, we\u2019re seeing what we\u2019re doing out in the field. And so, I\u2019m encouraged because we\u2019re sitting down with those folks and actually seeing the results. Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich: Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions. David Steiner : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Sbrogna of Macquarie. Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. David Steiner : Good morning. Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie: It was just \u2013 it was great to see the yield in your collection and transfer business continue moving higher. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk as you guys have a little bit in the past about some of the things you\u2019re doing to retain the volumes without lowering price. And then if you can maybe kind of assess how successful you think some of these programs have been? David Steiner : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And frankly, it\u2019s where the bulk of our focus is right now because the reality is that most customers whether it\u2019s solid waste or cable or telephone or water service or electricity, most customers don\u2019t switch just because you put a 3% price increase on them. They understand that everybody has to get price increases to see their \u2013 because their cost base goes up. And so, they get it. So they don\u2019t leave you because you raise the price. But if you raise the price and then have a service issue, that\u2019s when they leave you, right? So if your cable repeatedly goes out, that\u2019s when you start going and looking for another provider. And so, we need to be 100% focused on providing that best service to our customer and not give them a reason to leave. We\u2019ve done the studies, everyone says, well, your leave you over price, we\u2019ve done the study. They don\u2019t leave you over price. That is not the number one reason they leave you. The number one reason they leave you is leave you with service issues. And so, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve dedicated a lot of human capital and a lot of technology to making sure that we can have the best service. And so we were glad to see that as we went through the pricing progress in 2013, our churn rate did pick up. We were glad to see that in the first quarter of 2014, the churn rate actually moderated and was down sequentially from the fourth quarter so we\u2019re encouraged by that. But look, we still have a long way to go. Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And just one more if I can. With the stronger free cash flow it doesn\u2019t look like you guys bought back any shares in Q1 but instituted the $600 million buyback last quarter, can you talk about your appetite for buy backs here given the stronger free cash flow? Jim Fish : Yeah, you\u2019re right. We didn\u2019t buy back any shares in Q1 but I would expect to see us back in the market buying shares sometime in Q2. Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie: Okay. And can you just remind us, there has been some talk about extending the bonus appreciation. Can you just remind us on what that headwind is and what that can potentially add to free cash flow if that is reversed in 2014? Jim Fish : So we estimated it about $70 million to $80 million was the headwind. So obviously, if that law changes, if we get the extenders then we would see that reversed. But for now, we\u2019re expecting to see about $70 million to $80 million of headwind as a result of no-bonus appreciation. Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie: Yeah, understood. Nice job. Congratulations. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk [ph] of Wedbush [ph]. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: Good morning. David Steiner : Good morning, Al [ph]. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: Just to follow, David, on a lot of the price-to-volume discussion, if you\u2019re prepared to continue the dial [ph] on the price and implement that, what expectations should you have for investors in terms of the volume comp, in terms of \u2013 are you getting to a point where you\u2019re going to annualize that and therefore volume declines will be getting closer to flat or should we start to still see some of these, the numbers that you\u2019re posting down 2%, 3%? David Steiner : Yeah, well, that\u2019s a great question, Al [?], and it goes back to one of the things I said in the script which \u2013 if fundamental to our strategy, which is, we aren\u2019t looking for the most volume. We are not the company that you\u2019re going to \u2013 if you want the company that\u2019s getting the most volume, you need to look somewhere else. We\u2019re going to be the company that gets the best volume, right, the best volume mix that can get us the highest income from operations dollars and margins. And so, I would certainly expect to see as the economy continues to improve, I would certainly expect to see those volumes get better. Now, having said that, remember, in the second quarter as Jim mentioned, we lost a couple of resi contract that folks bid at prices that we weren\u2019t willing to go to. And then, we have our largest national account that quite frankly was a low single-digit margin and someone came in and undercut the price on that even though ours was low-single digit and we weren\u2019t going to go there. We said \u2013 look, we\u2019d rather not have the work than have the volumes. Oh, we lose that volume starting April 1 so you\u2019ll see a little bit tougher comp in the second quarter. The good news is we lost that volume, it came with virtually no earnings. And so, we\u2019ll take that tradeoff every day. We now can redeploy those trucks to going out and getting a higher margin business which from an earnings point of view will be accretive to us. And so, look, that\u2019s our deal, is that when we lose volumes \u2013 and I\u2019m not telling you we\u2019re 100% perfect because we\u2019re not perfect by any stretch. But the intention is that when we lose volumes we want to lose those volumes that are lower margin and then take those assets that we freed up and go allocate those to higher margin business. That\u2019s how you get the best volumes rather than get [?] to the most volume. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: Right. Your competition is telling us you are 100% perfect, so I\u2019ll have to correct them on that, okay. David Steiner : Well, I wish we were but we\u2019ve got a long way to go. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: All right. Fine. Okay. David Steiner : See, what I would tell you, Al, is my folks out in the field are perfect. I\u2019m nowhere near. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: Okay. That\u2019s probably what they were saying, sorry. Fair enough. I appreciate the color. What about, I mean, maybe you don\u2019t want to share this given the nature of the call but where are you seeing \u2013 I won\u2019t say the perfect volume or the incremental dollar volume that you want to get but where are you focusing or where are we looking for the incremental volume to come from? Even if on a [indiscernible] basis you\u2019re down as a company. David Steiner : Right. Again, you\u2019ve got to sort of look at it by line of business. And what I would tell you is that on the landfill side, we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are, right. On the collection side, again, on the residential side, we all know what\u2019s going on there. It\u2019s a lot of capital that you\u2019ve got to invest and so we have to look at that purely from a return on capital point of view. And so we\u2019re not going to bid contracts that are low return on capital. But we\u2019ve certainly want to retain the contracts that we have. On the industrial side, I would tell you that generally we\u2019re going to get better margins on permanent roll offs than we\u2019re going to get on temporary roll offs and we\u2019ll allocate dollars there. On the commercial side, look, there\u2019s a lot of volume to be had if you want to go after these large school districts for example. But we\u2019ve had very little school district business because we see competitors coming in at a $1 to $1.50 a yard and we\u2019re just not going to go there. And so, what I would tell you is that we know where the higher margin customers are and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to fish. We\u2019re not going to go fish just to put our cans out. We\u2019re not going to go take a school district at $1 a yard. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: Okay. Jim Fish : I\u2019ll have one quick, one addition there is that when you think about volume that we like, our energy services volume is volume that we like. It\u2019s been a good growth story for us. March was the strongest month from a revenue standpoint and from a margin standpoint, but particularly from a revenue standpoint that we\u2019ve ever had. We were up 25% year-over-year for the quarter even with a little bit of weather impact there. I mean, it was awfully cold in North Dakota and still with that we saw a 25% top line growth in that business. It\u2019s good business for us. In addition, I think the \u2013 we expect that EPA at some point will promulgate coal ash disposal standards and we\u2019re well-positioned there to help that industry manage its coal combustion byproducts. So that will be good business for us as well. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: Right. Just \u2013 thanks for that color, Jim. To clarify though, where are those businesses being reported by line of business or \u2013? Jim Fish : Yeah, are you talking about energy services, that all flows just through our core business. David Steiner : And through the industrial line on the collection side, generally \u2013 Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: Yeah, okay. David Steiner : \u2013 through the special waste line on the landfill side. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: All right. Can you \u2013 you brought up a good point about coal ash. Can you just give us an update on what\u2019s your expectations are there on regulation and when do you expect to hear? David Steiner : Yeah, I believe the EPA has a court order to issue something by the end of the year. So we would expect that because we\u2019re well positioned, we would expect that sometime in kind of the 15, 16 period we\u2019ll start to see this materially move the needle. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: So is that the relationship with utility customers and because of landfill and the expectation that this will be Subtitle D disposal or Subtitle C? David Steiner : Yeah, I don\u2019t think anybody believes it will be Subtitle C but there\u2019s a number of things that they\u2019re looking for including beneficial reuse, including management of their own landfills as a number of them have landfills. We can help them manage their landfills. And then, of course, if they care to take it offsite we can obviously handle that as well. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: All right. Okay. Thanks. Finally, one question here. Your asset sale on the JV in China I think would maybe prompt the question on international and, David what\u2019s the plan here in terms of maybe growth or a refocused organization in terms of outside of North America. David Steiner : Yeah, and look, I think you hit the nail on the head. The word would be refocused, right, I mean, look, when we went to China, we had a spectacular partner there, Shanghai Chang Pal [ph] the parent company and Shanghai Environmental Group, the subsidiary that we directly work with was a great partner. In fact, even though we took out our equity investment in China. We actually will continue working with them providing technical services. So we\u2019ll still provide them people over there. We just thought that it was a better use of our capital. The other thing about the Chinese market is that it\u2019s a fast-growing market but it\u2019s also a very competitive market, and we just thought that we could better redeploy the capital into our core business in the United States. Now, we still have a waste energy project being built in the United Kingdom, and we\u2019d expect to continue to see a growth in projects over there. But look, I think you hit the nail on the head. We\u2019re completely refocused is on our core solid waste business in North America and we were pretty pleased to see the improvement. Now we got some good benefit from Wheelabrator in the quarter. They had a spectacular quarter, but we all know that was drive by electricity prices that primarily by electricity prices that are going to moderate as the weather warms up. So we\u2019ll take that additional capital. We\u2019ll refocus on the core business and as Jim said we\u2019ll use that free cash flow to go off and buy some shares this year. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: Right, and just a follow up on that one. The cash that you get, are you allowed to repatriate that back here or as \u2013 need to be deployed? David Steiner : Yes. Now, we repatriated the full $155 million back here. Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush: Thank you, guys. David Steiner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis : Hi, good morning. Jim Fish : Good morning, Corey. David Steiner : Good morning. Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis : I\u2019ll try to keep it really brief. I think you\u2019ve talked in the past about having \u2013 about your analytics behind your pricing. Can you just talk \u2013 and I realize there\u2019s difference by customer and market. But can you just talk about how close you are in the field to what you believe the optimum is based on your analytics? David Steiner : Yeah, gosh, Corey, I would tell you, we\u2019re nowhere close to the optimum. I mean, we have so many customers that they are spread out fairly quickly. So I would say that if you look at it from a customer-by-customer basis, we\u2019re nowhere near the optimum. But if you look at sort of like the overall strategic implementation of the pricing plan is out in the field, our folks out in the field completely get it. Do we make mistakes? Look, we made plenty of bids where we thought we were going to earn x and we ended up earning y. So we\u2019re nowhere near perfect, but they all get what the strategy is and frankly they\u2019re doing a great job of implementing it. Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis : So then, to follow up on Al\u2019s question about kind of that price-volume tradeoff, I assume the optimum is not on a company wide basis to have 10% yield and negative whatever it would be volume, how close to just \u2013 at a high level that we can see how close are we to what you think the optimum is where you would still be growing, maximizing operating income what would the price volume look like? David Steiner : Yeah, again, in this current \u2013 if you look at a business environment that isn\u2019t growing, I would tell you that I think we\u2019re right about there, right? If we\u2019re going to see above 2% yield, it would be very difficult for us to have positive volumes. It\u2019s just the nature of that beast. And so, if you believe that there\u2019s not going to be any volume growth ever again, then I would tell you, we\u2019re pretty close to optimize. What we need to see in order to get to the optimization of the overall business is we need to see volume growth. And we\u2019re seeing that volume growth in the landfill, that\u2019s encouraging. We\u2019re starting to see that growth get a little bit better despite the first quarter I would say on the industrial side and then commercials stubbornly remains sort of stuck in that negative 3% to 5% range. Jim Fish : Corey, I would add that as a matter of course, Jim Trevathan has monthly calls with all of the areas and we regularly look at income from operations by line of business. And so we are assessing whether we\u2019ve pushed too hard. We\u2019ll look at specific areas in a specific line of business within those areas and determine whether is income from operations declining in the phase of very heavy price increase and very heavy volume loss. And that to us would indicate that maybe we\u2019ve reached that kind of point of diminishing returns. But I would also add that we\u2019ve seen very few of those, I mean, I don\u2019t know exactly where we are but we\u2019ve seen very few of those, there\u2019s a couple of them but for the most part we still think we have room there to move ahead on price. David Steiner : And, Jim, I would add, we have a couple that are in question but they\u2019re MSAs, they\u2019re not entire areas. Jim Fish : Right. David Steiner : They\u2019re not one of our 17 areas. It may be one MSA that we\u2019re taking a harder look at. Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. David Steiner : Certainly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft of Gabelli & Company. Tony Bancroft \u2013 Gabelli & Company: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for getting my call. Just a quick question on \u2013 back to JV monetization. Now, are you planning on \u2013 I know you\u2019re saying you\u2019re looking \u2013 you\u2019re getting out China but is there \u2013 if there is a potential opportunity over there that looks good, would you potentially go back in to \u2013 to try to grow more in China or what\u2019s your sort of long-term outlook with that? David Steiner : Yeah, I think everybody has seen sort of a little bit of a moderation in what\u2019s going on in China from a growth perspective, right? I mean, three years ago, China was sort of the dot com of its time. It was growing so fast and obviously we\u2019ve all seen that growth moderate over the last few years. But it\u2019s a great point. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m glad of two things. One, that we still have a great relationship with our joint venture partner. And two, we\u2019re going to be continuing to provide them service over there because that will give us not as big a toehold as we have when we were helping them build plants but it\u2019ll still give us a little bit of toehold over there so that if there is an opportunity, we\u2019ll be able to spot it. Now, I would tell you, I don\u2019t see any of that on the near-term horizon but with China being such a large part of the world economy, I think it would be foolish to say \u2013 we never want to go back to China, and I\u2019m actually glad that we\u2019re maintaining the relationship with our partner over there. Tony Bancroft \u2013 Gabelli & Company: Yeah, thank you. And then just to sort of jump back to some prior questions about long-term growth in lines of businesses. In five years, where is sort of the next focus, not so much on your organic operations in trying to fine tune those but, I mean, you mentioned about energy waste doing so well. You\u2019re a huge asset owner in most of the basin. Do you have any thoughts on that and I know we\u2019ve talked about it before but maybe there\u2019s been quite a bit of growth recently. Is there anymore focus on that? David Steiner : Yeah, I think that clearly energy service, this area where we have some longer term visibility and I wouldn\u2019t say that about maybe the overall macroeconomic climate. I couldn\u2019t tell you what the economy is going to do in the US and the rest of North America past 2015. But energy services sure looks like that as a growth engine not only for the economy but for us specifically for the next 5 to 10 years. So we think energy services and environmental services are two of those growth areas that you\u2019ve asked [ph] about. Jim Fish : And then to dovetail on to that, look, the energy services is all about fracing and energy, that low natural \u2013 and natural gas pricing. That low natural gas pricing as you can see is going to drive billions of dollars of infrastructure investment in the chemical corridors and in other areas. And so it\u2019s going to generate a tremendous amount of M&I, manufacturing and industrial activity. And so we certainly think that when you look at the energy services, not only do you see the growth there but you see the adjacent growth as people try to take advantage of low energy pricing. Tony Bancroft \u2013 Gabelli & Company: Got it. Thank you. And, I guess, just, I\u2019ve got to ask you. If that business grew large enough, is there something that you want to sort of maybe sort of expose [ph] on your quarterly reporting or maybe do something more like spin-off or is there anymore \u2013 is there any strategic thoughts about that. David Steiner : Yeah, well, we generally don\u2019t look at that until it reaches 10% of our revenue. So I would love to be able to report it. If it\u2019s a good business, high margin, my guess is that you\u2019re going to see great growth but you won\u2019t see that kind of growth where we\u2019d say \u2013 okay, let\u2019s go split it off separately. Tony Bancroft \u2013 Gabelli & Company: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. David Steiner : Certainly. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Barbra Alborene [ph] of Morningstar. Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar: Good morning everybody. Jim Fish : Good morning. David Steiner : Good morning. Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar: Regarding recycling, I know that you\u2019ve mentioned this little meta site [ph]. Have you been successful in charging customers penalties, well, I suppose [indiscernible] a very customer friendly terms so maybe I\u2019ll rephrase that. Have you been successful at increasing fees for contaminated recyclables or is this more a matter of educating customer still to give you less of them at the get-go? David Steiner : Yeah, it\u2019s a combination of both. We\u2019ve done just that and not all of our contracts allow us to do that, but where we\u2019ve been allowed contractually to do that, we\u2019ve done just that. But long term, you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head, long term, it is an education. We\u2019re all better off if the consumer knows how to separate it so that we don\u2019t have the contamination to begin with. The consumer doesn\u2019t want to be penalized or the customer doesn\u2019t want to be penalized for contaminated loads and we certainly don\u2019t want to have those higher operating costs from contaminated loads. So the short-term solution is to say we\u2019re going to charge you. The long-term solution is to educate the consumers and our customers. Jim Fish : Barbara [ph] I might add that as Dave mentioned, not all of our contracts allow for that charge for contamination, but as renew contracts, we are absolutely adding it to contracts that we\u2019re protected and also the customer is protected and know what to expect from our charges. Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar: Got you. Would you be willing to share a percentage? How many of these contracts have from renewal actually accept the terms that allow for a surcharge or fee on these contaminants? David Steiner : Well, I can tell you 100% are the ones that we renew. Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Okay. David Steiner : But I think we\u2019d all be guessing if we told you what percentage have not allowed \u2013 look, I\u2019d be shocked and you can follow up with that and he\u2019ll follow up with our recycling folks. But I would be shocked if a large customer did not allow some level of contamination clause into the contract. Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar: Got it. Got it. Jim, as you work with your field teams to help them educate customers, are customers getting it or is this still a challenge that you guys are working through? I would imagine that in some cases, in some larger \u2013 even some smaller customers are just not really that quick on the uptake. So what do you do with your field team to help move that process along? David Steiner : Yeah, look, again, the customer in this instant ranges from a sort of a small customer with a small business to a large national account to large municipalities. So all customers are different, but, look, the large customers that make up the bulk of the fiber market absolutely get it. They understand, look, they see what\u2019s going on with demand on China. They see what\u2019s going on with commodity prices. And more importantly, they see what\u2019s going on with investment in recycling and infrastructure, right. I mean, we\u2019re not investing in recycling and infrastructure and as far as we know nobody is making big investments in new recycling infrastructure. So they understand that if you\u2019re a large city or if you\u2019re a large national account, you\u2019ve got to make this a long-term sustainable business model in order to drive the investment so that you can drive more recycling. And I think they absolutely understand that. Like anything though, markets don\u2019t turn on a time, right, so it\u2019s going to take some time for that to seep through the market and see sort of a long-term systemic change in the way folks do business in recycling. Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar: All right, sounds good. Thanks very much. David Steiner : Thank you. Operator : I will now return the call back over to Mr. David Steiner for closing remarks. David Steiner : Well, thank you all for joining us. We certainly want to thank all of our field employees who did a phenomenal job working through a challenging first quarter.

Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, David Steiner. David Steiner : Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. We had a very good quarter, and we\u2019ll talk in detail about our results, but first I wanted to discuss the news in today\u2019s press release announcing that we have signed a definitive agreement to sell our Wheelabrator waste-to-energy business to Energy Capital Partners for $1.94 billion. As we have said before, our waste-to-energy business has two distinct components. The tip fees that we receive on the front-end, and the payments for energy on the back. We did not view the energy payments as strategic and we do not have the depth of energy expertise that Energy Capital Partners has. Consequently we have entered into a waste supply agreement from the front-end, where we will use our expertise to fill up the plants for seven years just like we do today. But we will no longer have the volatility of the financial results related to Wheelabrator electricity sale. We use the proceeds from the sale in a way that is most accretive to earnings and creates the most shareholder value. We\u2019ll do so by buying back shares, or doing acquisitions in our core business if they\u2019re more accretive and to create long-term shareholder value. We\u2019ll do all of this while maintaining our strong balance sheet. Wheelabrator is a high performing organization that reflects the quality of the people, our friends and colleagues that operate it. I want to thank Mark Weidman and the entire Wheelabrator team for their hard work and dedication. They made our waste-to-energy business successful and we anticipate that the business will continue to be successful under Mark\u2019s leadership and ECP\u2019s ownership. Returning to second quarter results, the solid performance that we saw on the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter. Once again our yield and cost control programs drove growth in both our income from operations and operating EBITDA and led to expanded margins in our traditional solid waste business and our overall business. In the second quarter, we earned $0.60 per share, an increase of over 10% when compared to the second quarter of 2013. In addition we saw nice improvement in net cash provided by operations and free cash flow. Through the first six months of 2014 our employees have executed on our business plans and we\u2019re encouraged by the strong results. We expect that this performance will continue throughout the remainder of the year. Our yield program continues to be a significant driver of our margin expansion. For the second quarter, our collection and disposal yield was 2.3% which is the fifth consecutive quarter of yield above 2%, it is down slightly from our Q1 yield primarily due to increased revenue and the anniversary of the implementation of our regulatory cost recovery fee in 2013. Our core pricing remains very strong at 3.9%, a year-over-year improvement of 10 basis points. Each of our lines of business had positive yield with the exception of landfill C&D. In the landfill MSW line same-store average rates increased 5.1% and through the second quarter nearly 90% of our contracted third-party landfill customers have received a price increase. The remaining landfill customers either perform event work or have restrictions that limit price increase opportunities. When compared to the second quarter of 2013 same-store average rates in both the commercials and industrial lines increased 4.4%, and we saw a 3.1% increase in our residential line. This has had some effect on volumes particularly with regard to national accounts and residential contracts but we continue to see the trademark as positive as the operating margin in our traditional solid waste business was up 50 basis points. Turning to volumes, in the second quarter volumes were a negative 1.4% which is an improvement of 40 basis points from the first quarter. More than 50% of our volume decline came from several low margin, but large national account losses. In the second quarter we saw a positive landfill and transportation volumes more than offset by declines in the collection lines of business. Despite negative volumes overall income from operations grew more than 9% and our income from operations margin grew 120 basis points. In addition operating EBITDA increased more than 5% and operating EBITDA margins increased 120 basis points to 25.6%. When we issued volume patterns at the beginning of the year, we expected volumes to be around a negative 1% for 2014. Through the first six months volumes have declined 1.6% and we now expect that to be about the run rate for the remainder of the year, with the change being primarily attributable to the continuing impact of lost national account business. Our recycling operations also performed better in the quarter, adding almost $0.01 in earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2013, despite a 2.1% decline in average commodity prices. The efforts that we have put in place to improve our enforcement on contaminated loads and modify the methods for calculating rebates to customers are paying off. Operating cost in the recycling line of business improved almost 8%, primarily due to lower rebates and reduced labor costs. Turning to our waste-to-energy business, in the second quarter operating results were essentially flat when compared to 2013. We did not change our full year EPS or free cash flow guidance as a result of the proposed sale of Wheelabrator. But if the deal closes before the end of the year, it could have a minor impact on earnings and cash. On average our waste-to-energy operations would produce about $0.015 of earnings and $10 million in free cash flow per month. We expect that this transaction will close sometime in the last two months of the year, in which case the effect on this year\u2019s earnings and free cash flow would be minimal. Our solid first half performance on yield and cost controls makes us confident that we can meet or exceed our full year earnings growth goals. But first and foremost our Company operates to generate cash flow and when we combine our yield and cost focus with our focus on capital discipline and working capital we expect to see strong cash flow in the second half of 2014. Consequently we expect to meet or exceed the 1.5 billion high-end of our free cash flow guidance. I\u2019m now going to turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results and the sale of Wheelabrator in more detail. Jim Fish : Thank you, David. Before discussing the details of our second quarter results I want to provide some additional information on the sale of our Wheelabrator business. After normal transaction adjustments to the sales price, we anticipate receiving about $1.85 billion in cash once the transaction is finalized late this year. With our basis in Wheelabrator we will pay no taxes on the transaction and it should generate a capital loss of approximately $300 million that we can utilize over the next five years. Our base Wheelabrator divestiture model assumed a partial use of proceeds to maintain leverage neutrality with the majority of the proceeds going to share repurchases. The diluted EPS accretion in that model is about $0.02 per share for 2015. Of course, we will look for reasonably priced core businesses to replace the $220 million of Wheelabrator EBITDA, if they are accretive to the base model. In either case, we would selectively retire debt to the extent necessary to maintain our strong balance sheet and our target leverage ratio of about three times EBITDA. On the share repurchase front, we\u2019d anticipate it that we would in the market repurchasing our shares in the first half of 2014. However, we suspended share repurchases while the Wheelabrator transaction was pending. Now that we\u2019ve announced the transaction we have entered into an accelerated share repurchase program to spend the full amount of our previously announced $600 million authorization on share repurchases. We will fund the $600 million on August 1st, and we\u2019ll see an initial delivery of approximately 9.6 million shares representing 70% of the shares expected to be retired. The actual number of shares repurchased will depend upon the volume weighted average price of our stock, less a discount during the repurchase period which we expect to be three to six months. Turning to our second quarter results. Our revenue grew 1% to $3.56 billion. Strong yield and acquisition revenue were the main drivers with volume declines and a negative foreign currency translation muting revenue growth. The foreign exchange impact on revenue was approximately $14 million. We continue to see improvement in all our cost lines. Operating cost as a percent of revenue improved 90 basis points to 64.6% and improved $10 million in the second quarter. Reduced cost at our recycling facilities and the sale of an asset improved the cost of operations, $41 million, and we were partially offset by increased cost related to recently acquired businesses. SG&A costs were flat when compared to the second quarter of 2013, at $353 million and improved as a percent of revenue by 10 basis points to 9.9%. We are still on target to achieve our full year SG&A goals. Turning to cash flow, for the second quarter we generated $447 million of free cash flow, an increase of $100 million when compared to 2013. We accomplished this by growing our net cash provided by operating activities, $10 million to $555 million, by improving working capital and by maintaining discipline on capital spending. The growth and net cash provided by operating activities was muted by an increase of over $70 million in cash taxes primarily related to the repatriation of accumulated cash from Puerto Rico operations and the expiration of the bonus depreciation allowance. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $208 million, a decrease of $27 million from the second quarter of 2013. We also divested our Puerto Rico operations and other assets in the quarter, for about $100 million. Year-to-date 2014, we\u2019ve generated $931 million in total free cash flow and $665 million excluding divestiture proceeds. This is the highest free cash flow we have ever generated through the first six months of the year, puts us on-track to meet or exceed the upper-end of our full year free cash flow goal of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, despite a planned to pickup in capital expense, in the second half of 2014. Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company, in the second quarter our collection and disposal yield was 2.3% with volumes declining 1.4%. This led to income from operations growing $48 million, operating income margin growing 120 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $48 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 120 basis points. Our collection line of business continues to see the benefit of the yield volume trade-off. Both our commercial and industrial yields were 4.2%m while residential was 1.6%. Overall collection yield was 3.2% with volumes declining 4.1%. This led to income from operations growing $7 million and margin expanding 10 basis points. The industrial line of business drove the growth in income from operations, but that growth was muted by continued declines in the residential line where we lost two profitable franchised contracts. In the landfill line of business for the second quarter, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield, just as we did in the first quarter. Total landfill volume increased 3.9%. Combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes were positive 2.1%, MSW volumes grew by 4.4% and C&D volume grew 11.5%. MSW yield rose 2%. This led to income from operations growing $9 million which is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth and margins grew 20 basis points. Finally looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the second quarter our weighted average cost to debt was 4.79% and the floating rate portion of our total debt was 12% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate in the quarter was 44.7% primarily because foreign cash accumulated in Puerto Rico was repatriated to United States upon divestiture of the operations. For the next two quarters we expect our tax rate to be approximately 35%. We\u2019re encouraged by the results for the first six months of the year which put us on-track to meet our full year targets. The strong momentum in our pricing and cost controls sets us up nicely for the second half of 2014 and positions us for continued success into 2015 as we look to redeploy the proceeds from the sale of Wheelabrator. I would be remised if I do not thank our employees for their hard work, because of them 2014 has been successful so far and we\u2019re looking forward to continued improvement with their help. I would particularly like to thank the employees of Wheelabrator. They have been valuable teammates. We take pride in running a great and safe business. I know they will continue that success under the ownership of ECP. And Jenisha with that we\u2019ll open the line up for questions. Question: and: Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital. Scott Levine :  Congratulations on the quarter and the sale of Wheelabrator there and I guess my first question here is in the press release announcing the sale you mentioned the fact that there are some targets out there that you\u2019re interested in. And that there is a good sized pipeline, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of larger acquisitions with the exception of RCI, out of you guys recently but a little bit more color on what you see out there and additional thoughts with regards to the timing at which point you might look at deploying capital for buybacks versus M&A a bit more color on your investment plans and do you see them for the proceeds after the deal closes? Imperial Capital :  Congratulations on the quarter and the sale of Wheelabrator there and I guess my first question here is in the press release announcing the sale you mentioned the fact that there are some targets out there that you\u2019re interested in. And that there is a good sized pipeline, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of larger acquisitions with the exception of RCI, out of you guys recently but a little bit more color on what you see out there and additional thoughts with regards to the timing at which point you might look at deploying capital for buybacks versus M&A a bit more color on your investment plans and do you see them for the proceeds after the deal closes? David Steiner : Scott generally what we\u2019re looking at is as you can well imagine are sort of those smaller tuck-in acquisitions. And obviously you\u2019ve got to in order to spend the kind of money that we\u2019re selling this Wheelabrator business for, we\u2019re going to have to put together quite a lot of those. So it will take time if we\u2019re going to replace that EBITDA. As we\u2019ve said to the extent we can\u2019t do that we would buy back shares. The whole theory of the transaction was that we didn\u2019t want to do a deal that wasn\u2019t going to be accretive to earnings and so we used this base case of 100% of proceeds going to debt pay down and share repurchase as our base case. The good news is that that\u2019s accretive and to the extent that we can buy businesses to tuck them in that would replace the EBITDA that\u2019s a net positive for us. So we\u2019ll be looking at that over the next few months as we move toward a closing and then I will expect Scott that once we do close it at the end of the third quarter mid fourth quarter we\u2019d have a much better defined plan as to how much of those proceeds we can actually deploy into new businesses. Scott Levine : And then as my follow-up, I think Jim had mentioned that you\u2019d lost a couple of profitable franchised contracts during the quarter. Maybe a little bit more color regarding the competitive landscape and your commitment to pricing, I am assuming that continues. But is the environment becoming more or less competitive a bit more color on the operating environment and pricing there? Imperial Capital : And then as my follow-up, I think Jim had mentioned that you\u2019d lost a couple of profitable franchised contracts during the quarter. Maybe a little bit more color regarding the competitive landscape and your commitment to pricing, I am assuming that continues. But is the environment becoming more or less competitive a bit more color on the operating environment and pricing there? Jim Fish :  Look the residential line of business is always very competitive because they are large contracts, sort of just like the national accounts. I would characterize the pricing environment as fairly stable. Look there is really only two things that we can look at to determine the pricing environments and that is the discussions with our local managers and publicly reported statistics. And I don\u2019t think there is any doubt that in the last 12 months to 18 months we\u2019ve seen some of our larger competitors favor volume over price. That\u2019s not something that we traditionally have done and obviously that has cost us volume. But overall I\u2019d say that when you look at all the competition out there that it\u2019s fairly stable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Sbrogna of Macquarie Capital. Derek Sbrogna :  So maybe one first on the core, the landfill pricing, I missed on your landfill pricing you mentioned of positive 5.1%. Does that include any of those contracts which are linked to CPI and maybe give us a sense I know you guys have talked about on the overall business about 40% of the contracts being linked to CPI. But maybe give us a sense of what that is on the landfill side, just to get an understanding of how much of that business is versus competitive markets versus what\u2019s linked to CPI? Macquarie Capital :  So maybe one first on the core, the landfill pricing, I missed on your landfill pricing you mentioned of positive 5.1%. Does that include any of those contracts which are linked to CPI and maybe give us a sense I know you guys have talked about on the overall business about 40% of the contracts being linked to CPI. But maybe give us a sense of what that is on the landfill side, just to get an understanding of how much of that business is versus competitive markets versus what\u2019s linked to CPI? David Steiner : Yes, when we look at landfill contracts, there is really two things. It\u2019s not just CPI. There is also, a lot of those contracts will have just a standard price increase in it. So just to use an example, it might be a $30 contract, and it goes up to $32 the following year, 34. So it won\u2019t have a specific CPI related, but it will have a specific price increase. So a large portion of our contracts would have those types of price escalators in them and what we have said is that we are going to look at those contracts as they renew, and we are going to get higher price increases and then to the extent that we have volume that we can raise price on. Immediately we\u2019re going to look for 5% to 7% price increases. We\u2019re really just started to turn all of our focus to the landfill pricing over the last six months. I would tell you that we are sort of in the second or third inning on that project, there\u2019s still a long way to go. Derek Sbrogna : Got it, that was helpful. And then maybe one on Wheelabrator, this as we have talked about it over the last couple of years about potential sale. Can you maybe talk about the timing, I mean why now and have you been in negotiations for a while for sale of this asset and maybe just a little more color around that please? Macquarie Capital : Got it, that was helpful. And then maybe one on Wheelabrator, this as we have talked about it over the last couple of years about potential sale. Can you maybe talk about the timing, I mean why now and have you been in negotiations for a while for sale of this asset and maybe just a little more color around that please? Jim Fish : Look as you know, there has been rumors out there for probably two years that we have been looking at the sale of Wheelabrator. But it needed to be the right partner for us. We feel like we found the right partner. It needed to be the right waste supply agreements for us and we feel like we\u2019ve crafted a good supply agreement with ECP. So it was not so much around, when the timing was, but when we could get the various features of the agreement together, that satisfies both us and our -- and the partner that we are selling to. David Steiner : And I would tell you that Jim led the negotiations for the transaction. And from Jim\u2019s point of view, I can promise you that he thought the negotiations lasted a very long time because he spent a good portion of his time literally over the last six months getting this deal done. Jim Fish : My wife\u2019s point of view as well. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, pretty close. It\u2019s Amit Mehrotra here from Deutsche Bank. Congrats guys, you had a nice quarter and congrats on the announcement as well. First question is on pricing. Could you just comment on maybe in terms of what inning you guys are in with respect to pricing growth, and if we look out this time next year we will be talking about the ninth straight quarter of 2% plus yield and just as a follow-up to that. What level is the company willing to see, volume comps get more negative to get to the same level of price and mix growth? Deutsche Bank : Thanks, pretty close. It\u2019s Amit Mehrotra here from Deutsche Bank. Congrats guys, you had a nice quarter and congrats on the announcement as well. First question is on pricing. Could you just comment on maybe in terms of what inning you guys are in with respect to pricing growth, and if we look out this time next year we will be talking about the ninth straight quarter of 2% plus yield and just as a follow-up to that. What level is the company willing to see, volume comps get more negative to get to the same level of price and mix growth? David Steiner : Yes. When we look at the price volume trade-off, I will tell you that that I would expect that next year you\u2019ll hear us say it\u2019s the ninth straight quarter of over 2%. Now as we talked about, you saw it go from 2.6 to 2.3. That\u2019s really more mathematical things than anything else. It\u2019s the anniversary and has some various fees. So it\u2019s not an indication that we\u2019re going backwards in pricing. It\u2019s really more just an indication of mathematics, but you should see that above 2% for the -- certainly the near future and I would expect well through 2015. When you think about the volume trade-off, you got to look at it in various lines of business right. When we look at it, we say what are those lines of business where we can get volumes without affecting the pricing dynamics in a market? And we are going to focus more on those volumes than we would on other volumes. And so we want to be a little bit more circumspect and how we manage our volumes. We think that going into 2015 we should see some easier comps and we should see the volume start to stabilize. And look, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always said. That this model really starts churning once you can get both, yield over 2% and positive volumes. I would hope that in 2015 we can see that reality for the first time in many years. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the sale announcement, can you just update us on the cost plan that you guys have in place in terms of the 100 basis points reduction on a run rate basis by the end of \u201916. I\u2019m assuming that would need to be recalibrated given the divestiture and that impact on the sales level? Deutsche Bank : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the sale announcement, can you just update us on the cost plan that you guys have in place in terms of the 100 basis points reduction on a run rate basis by the end of \u201916. I\u2019m assuming that would need to be recalibrated given the divestiture and that impact on the sales level? Jim Fish : Yes I think, if you think about the cost piece, what we are mostly talking about with Jim Trevathan and his team is on the core side of our business and that is ongoing, and we feel like we are making progress there as you saw in our results. It won\u2019t be affected in terms of absolute dollars. It could be affected in terms of basis points, just simply because of the smaller business here. But I think the main point is that when we look at cost control, whether it is on operating cost or SG&A, we feel like we\u2019re making very-very good progress, with still additional progress to go. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse. Hamzah Mazari : Just a question on the supply agreement, could you give us a sense of how that supply agreement is structured with Energy Capital Partners? How long does it last for? And specifically what we\u2019re looking for is, does this impact your ability be strategic on disposal pricing given that waste-to-energy plants are like landfills in your disposal network? Any color there would be good. Thanks. Credit Suisse : Just a question on the supply agreement, could you give us a sense of how that supply agreement is structured with Energy Capital Partners? How long does it last for? And specifically what we\u2019re looking for is, does this impact your ability be strategic on disposal pricing given that waste-to-energy plants are like landfills in your disposal network? Any color there would be good. Thanks. David Steiner : So Hamzah look the intent of the negotiation of the waste supply agreement was to replicate what Waste Management and we have in place today. And I think we\u2019ve done that, ECP\u2019s primary interest in the waste supply agreement was volume certainty and both sides worked hard to crack an agreement to provide that volume certainty. But it also allows us to optimize our operation. For example our landfills as you know are a critical piece of our business and we\u2019ll continue to bring tonnes in those landfills while at the same time fulfilling the volume commitment. And I don\u2019t know whether that answers your question specifically but I think we feel good about the fact that we have crafted a waste supply agreement that satisfies both parties, needs. Hamzah Mazari : Okay. I can follow-up offline on that that is fine. And then on the volume loss, could you give us a sense of how much more low margin business do you have in your portfolio? It seems like over the last couple of years we\u2019ve been pruning that, now we have a pricing gate. Are we near the end of pruning of low margin business and we should expect the pricing gate to come off once that process is done? Any color on that, thanks. Credit Suisse : Okay. I can follow-up offline on that that is fine. And then on the volume loss, could you give us a sense of how much more low margin business do you have in your portfolio? It seems like over the last couple of years we\u2019ve been pruning that, now we have a pricing gate. Are we near the end of pruning of low margin business and we should expect the pricing gate to come off once that process is done? Any color on that, thanks. David Steiner : Yes again Hamzah you\u2019ve got to look at it by line of business. I would say that on the commercial line our primary focus is going to be on maintaining the customers that we have, right. We\u2019ve said it many times that some customers will leave for price and those customers are going to leave, but everybody else you got to make sure that you have a high level of service to maintain them. So our core strategy on the commercial side would be to provide the best service and reduce the churn rate. On the roll-off side obviously as you see temporary roll-off improved throughout the country with residential and commercial construction going up, we would expect to get our fair share of volumes there. And so I would expect that we\u2019ll see the volumes on the roll-off side turn positive in 2015. And on the residential line we probably still have some residential contracts that are low margin contracts, you should see those start to be called out or re-priced throughout 2015. So it depends upon what line of business you\u2019re looking at and how we\u2019ll approach it that sort of talked about what we\u2019re going to do on each of the three collection lines. Hamzah Mazari : And just last question I\u2019ll turn it over. Are there any other adjacencies that you would like to get into? It seems like there maybe a little bit of medical waste still in the portfolio but the rest of the adjacencies are gone, is energy services a bigger vertical that you want to get bigger in? Thanks. Credit Suisse : And just last question I\u2019ll turn it over. Are there any other adjacencies that you would like to get into? It seems like there maybe a little bit of medical waste still in the portfolio but the rest of the adjacencies are gone, is energy services a bigger vertical that you want to get bigger in? Thanks. David Steiner : Yes clearly we would look to get bigger in energy services it has been a good growth business for us. We\u2019d expect that growth to continue and we\u2019d like to get bigger there. On medical waste, I think it\u2019s been well documented that they\u2019re a very strong competitor that does a great job of keeping everybody out of that business. And so we\u2019d expect that business frankly to not be as much of a growth area as we thought it would be in the past. And so when we look at the growth areas we\u2019re really looking at our manufacturing and industrial business and our energy services business. Jim Fish :  Hamzah that energy services business continues to grow at a 25%, 30% cliff for us, it still is relatively small compared to the size of the overall business but certainly a nice growth engine. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey :  First on the pricing, thinking about the second half of \u201914 will there be any notable impact from the flow through of the CPI, as it sort of flows through pricing in the back half versus the first half of the year? Goldman Sachs :  First on the pricing, thinking about the second half of \u201914 will there be any notable impact from the flow through of the CPI, as it sort of flows through pricing in the back half versus the first half of the year? David Steiner : Yes the CPI will likely be a little bit lower in the back half of the year than it was in the front half of the year given the performance of CPI and the fact that a lot of our contracts reprise on July 1st. But again what we\u2019ve always said is if CPI is lower we just have to go out and get those pricing dollars from other places. And so we\u2019d expect that to continue in the back half of \u201914. Alex Ovshey :  Got it David and I am not sure if I missed any incremental comments you had on bonus depreciation, but our another competitor talked about the potential for it to be retroactively extended before the year-end. And I am curious if you have any thoughts around whether that potentially could happen? And if it does, what would be the impact on Waste Management\u2019s cash flows? Goldman Sachs :  Got it David and I am not sure if I missed any incremental comments you had on bonus depreciation, but our another competitor talked about the potential for it to be retroactively extended before the year-end. And I am curious if you have any thoughts around whether that potentially could happen? And if it does, what would be the impact on Waste Management\u2019s cash flows? Jim Fish : It\u2019s hard to predict what the government is going to do I guess. But certainly could happen and we\u2019d be happy if it were extended. But the impact for us is substantial, it\u2019s probably close to $80 million a year, so it\u2019s substantial on part of when you look at cash flow from operations part of the headwind was the expiration of bonus depreciation for the quarter it was worth about $20 million. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box :  Nice job on the recycling front, offsetting some commodity weakness, I think clearly a step in the right direction. Can you just give us a feel for if this is the beginning, and we should continue to expect lower rebates and lower labor expense, or if this is maybe more of a one-time true up and we should continue to see things kind of at this level? KeyBanc Capital Markets :  Nice job on the recycling front, offsetting some commodity weakness, I think clearly a step in the right direction. Can you just give us a feel for if this is the beginning, and we should continue to expect lower rebates and lower labor expense, or if this is maybe more of a one-time true up and we should continue to see things kind of at this level? David Steiner :  Yes, I know. This is definitely the beginning and so you know it\u2019s a combination of things. It\u2019s continuing to manage our contracts and the rebate structure, it\u2019s continuing to look at our cost structure and driving costs out, and then it\u2019s also rationalizing the plants where we don\u2019t have volume. They have done a nice job in the first half of 2014. We would expect that to continue through the back half of 2014 and then as we have always said all along, this thing really starts to cook if we see the commodity prices turnaround. We\u2019re not forecasting that for the back half of the year, but we would expect to see continued benefit year-over-year from our recycling operations for Q3 and Q4. Joe Box : Understood. And then on the residential side, I think, David you mentioned potentially calling some contracts, or re-pricing those contracts, I\u2019m just curious of what\u2019s your sense on the competitive environment for the residential business and maybe the appetite for some of your smaller peers to be bigger in this business has that changed at all over the last couple of quarters? KeyBanc Capital Market : Understood. And then on the residential side, I think, David you mentioned potentially calling some contracts, or re-pricing those contracts, I\u2019m just curious of what\u2019s your sense on the competitive environment for the residential business and maybe the appetite for some of your smaller peers to be bigger in this business has that changed at all over the last couple of quarters? David Steiner : I\u2019m not sure that has changed dramatically. Look, we\u2019re always going to be the higher priced provider in the residential line of business. I can give you a perfect example of sort of a service price dynamic. We had a contract that we lost in Pennsylvania. We lost it clearly on price. And the contract went away. And what the municipality found out is that that they had dramatic service issues with the new provider. They came back to us and then they said we need you to taking this contract back. We said, we will take it back but it\u2019s going to be at our price. And they said, that\u2019s perfect, and then we said, that\u2019s great, don\u2019t worry, we will handle it from here. So it just goes to show that when you look at residential business, service matters. And when we look at the residential line of business, we\u2019re not looking to win every bid. What we\u2019re looking to do is to renew our current contracts at that current or higher rate because of the service that we provide and the partnership that we have with our communities for many-many years. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Corey Greendale : Just a couple of clarifying questions from the responses earlier, someone asked earlier about the 5.1% growth in MSW pricing. Is that including all of your MSW volumes, so that includes your long-term contractual stuff which suggests that you are pricing on the gate rate of significantly higher than 5.1%? First Analysis : Just a couple of clarifying questions from the responses earlier, someone asked earlier about the 5.1% growth in MSW pricing. Is that including all of your MSW volumes, so that includes your long-term contractual stuff which suggests that you are pricing on the gate rate of significantly higher than 5.1%? Jim Fish :  That\u2019s right. That\u2019s exactly right. Corey Greendale : So can you just help us to -- a little bit so like what percent of the overall volume are you able to raise price at any given year and what is the increase at the gate rate? First Analysis : So can you just help us to -- a little bit so like what percent of the overall volume are you able to raise price at any given year and what is the increase at the gate rate? Jim Fish : Yes. Given that those contracts are generally 3 to 5 years you are seeing sort of anywhere from 20% to 30% of the volume that we can affect. And now remember that 5.1%. I don\u2019t want you all to think that that\u2019s across the board 5.1%. There is some mix in there, right, because all that is doing, is taking a look at same-store sales, but there is absolutely no doubt. The folks sitting around this table are looking at landfill pricing every month and every quarter, and making sure that we are touching the customers that we can touch. As we mentioned we get 90% of our landfill customers in the first half of the year. The other 10%, it\u2019s not that we let them slide on pricing. It\u2019s that they are either event work or they have contracts that prevent us from doing it. And so we\u2019re going to take the same approach on landfill pricing that we took on the residential pricing which is we are going to move that price up and it may end up costing us some volume. But when you look at the overall competitive effect on our overall business both collection and landfill, driving that landfill price up is positive for the entire business. Corey Greendale : Yes. And you talked about the various impacts on volume you haven\u2019t kind of called that one out, does that suggest that you\u2019re not seeing a substantial volume impact from the higher landfill pricing? First Analysis : Yes. And you talked about the various impacts on volume you haven\u2019t kind of called that one out, does that suggest that you\u2019re not seeing a substantial volume impact from the higher landfill pricing? Jim Fish : Yes so far it has been, actually I would say the landfill pricing environment has been probably as good or better than the environment on the collection side, right, because as we have seen our pricing increases we have not seen a dramatic loss of volume, we are hoping that will continue. Obviously, look, we can\u2019t do anything other than what we can do. But the price environment has been fairly stable there. Jim Trevathan : This is Jim. As part of our answer honestly to our volume decline on the collection side is to raise prices on landfill side. We have talked about it a lot but that is a critical component and we\u2019re not -- I wouldn\u2019t say we are happy with the volume decline on the collection side. But we\u2019re pleased with what we are seeing on the landfill side. But pricing is critically important at those landfills to help us with our volume decline collection wise as is customer service. But when you look at collection pricing, and I know your question was about landfill pricing but they are in a related we are just simply not going to turn the coin over that price volume coin that\u2019s on the price side right now, we\u2019ll be smart about it and -- but we\u2019re not going to turn that coin over because it\u2019s detrimental to our results. Corey Greendale : Got it and then I had a follow-up question on the Wheelabrator proceeds. So by my calculation you are still around 3 times levered even without paying down anymore debt after you lose the $220 million in EBITDA. So how should we think about how much you are going to deploy into paying down debt immediately versus how much cash you will sit on for potential acquisition? First Analysis : Got it and then I had a follow-up question on the Wheelabrator proceeds. So by my calculation you are still around 3 times levered even without paying down anymore debt after you lose the $220 million in EBITDA. So how should we think about how much you are going to deploy into paying down debt immediately versus how much cash you will sit on for potential acquisition? David Steiner : Well I think you\u2019re probably looking at where we were at the end of the quarter and we were a bit low there kind of artificially low with respect to leverage at the end of the quarter the reason for that is that because we hadn\u2019t had any share repurchase year-to-date we ended up using that to pay down our revolver. So a more normalized leverage ratio for us is 3% than as a consequence when you do divest that $220 million worth of EBITDA. Our calculation is we probably need about 400 million in debt pay down in order to maintain that leverage neutrality. Corey Greendale : Thanks for that clarification. First Analysis : Thanks for that clarification. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael Hoffman :  If we could get a little clarity, sense of when you think the timing is for Wheelabrator? Stifel, Nicolaus:  If we could get a little clarity, sense of when you think the timing is for Wheelabrator? David Steiner : It\u2019s a bit hard to predict because it\u2019s a function of FERC approval and that really is the biggest time controllable hurdle at this point. But in talking through this with ECP, we believe it\u2019s somewhere within kind of three to five months probably closer to three to four. Michael Hoffman : So would you share with us then the year-to-date EBITDA, so inclined to pull it out of a model and model the business without it? What am I am I look at year-to-date at EBITDA? Stifel, Nicolaus: So would you share with us then the year-to-date EBITDA, so inclined to pull it out of a model and model the business without it? What am I am I look at year-to-date at EBITDA? David Steiner : Well on an annual basis the EBITDA as we said is about 220 million and really there is not a heck of lot of seasonality, there was a little bit more this year because of the real cold winter. But typically the volume is pretty static the price fluctuates a bit with your stronger electricity pricing quarters being Q1 and Q4. But I\u2019d straight line it for your analysis. Michael Hoffman : So can you help me with the 220, because if you I take the 10-K data add back the charge, it gets to 171 million? So what\u2019s the difference between 171 and 220? Stifel, Nicolaus: So can you help me with the 220, because if you I take the 10-K data add back the charge, it gets to 171 million? So what\u2019s the difference between 171 and 220? David Steiner : I\u2019d have to look at that Mike. Michael Hoffman : And then was this shopped or was this is a privately-negotiated transaction? Stifel, Nicolaus: And then was this shopped or was this is a privately-negotiated transaction? David Steiner : What was the question again? Michael Hoffman : Was it shopped was the deal -- was this is a fully marketed? Stifel, Nicolaus: Was it shopped was the deal -- was this is a fully marketed? David Steiner : While we didn\u2019t do a per se a process on it but we had interest from at least one other company where they actually send a non-binding letter of intent to us. And we went through quite a bit of work with them and came up with a number that was a fair amount lower than the 1.94. And then of course last year we -- probably no secrets to anyone but we had conversations with Covanta at that point as well. So I would say that that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t formally a process pretty close. Michael Hoffman : And then if could talk about the pricing environment, when you think about the 5% number you have used around the landfill side or the 3 plus in the collection. How would you frame the per cent rollback trend at this point? Is it worsening, stable or getting better. And I ask you in the context of volumes have been on a reasonably good positive trend, the market volumes. And how is that flow seeing sort of rollbacks? Stifel, Nicolaus: And then if could talk about the pricing environment, when you think about the 5% number you have used around the landfill side or the 3 plus in the collection. How would you frame the per cent rollback trend at this point? Is it worsening, stable or getting better. And I ask you in the context of volumes have been on a reasonably good positive trend, the market volumes. And how is that flow seeing sort of rollbacks? David Steiner : Yes. We had a big jump up in rollbacks in 2012, since that time we basically held our rollbacks below 20%, and you saw the same thing this quarter. So I would say from a rollback perspective what you\u2019re seeing is very much stability. When you\u2019re turning something around you see a very low number, we turned it around literally on a dime and when you see someone turn something around that fast, you wonder is it sustainable? And what we found on the rollback side that is sustainable and so I\u2019d expect that to continue at below 20% into the future. Michael Hoffman : And your churn rates are running at about 11.5%? Stifel, Nicolaus: And your churn rates are running at about 11.5%? David Steiner : Yes the churn rate obviously it\u2019s affected by the national account loss. But if you take out the national account loss, you\u2019re looking at sort of 10% to 11% type churn. Michael Hoffman : And then are you at this juncture and it would appear you\u2019re not replacing a 100% of your churn, you are replacing much of it but not all of it. Is that an accurate observation? Stifel, Nicolaus: And then are you at this juncture and it would appear you\u2019re not replacing a 100% of your churn, you are replacing much of it but not all of it. Is that an accurate observation? David Steiner : That\u2019s correct. Michael Hoffman : If you were to replace 100% of the churn and probably would drive rollbacks, that\u2019s wide math effectively.  Stifel, Nicolaus: If you were to replace 100% of the churn and probably would drive rollbacks, that\u2019s wide math effectively. David Steiner : No I think that\u2019s right. Michael Hoffman : And then on the landfill I just want to make sure I understood correctly on the landfill, the pricing issue, this is revisiting a strategy on collection be aggressive of our price now, let's bring a strategy to landfill, let's be aggressive on price and that's a newer initiative beginning about now? Did I understand that correctly? Stifel, Nicolaus: And then on the landfill I just want to make sure I understood correctly on the landfill, the pricing issue, this is revisiting a strategy on collection be aggressive of our price now, let's bring a strategy to landfill, let's be aggressive on price and that's a newer initiative beginning about now? Did I understand that correctly? David Steiner : Yes I mean we\u2019ve always known that the landfill pricing is one of the keys to a long-term pricing program on the collection line of business. As I\u2019ve said before when you are going through the worst economic recession that you had, at least in our lifetimes, and you are losing volumes fairly faster, but the landfill is a little hard to go in and drive a pricing program. As we have seen the economy recovers, we\u2019ve seen the volumes come back. It\u2019s a little easier to be more aggressive with the landfill. And we have done just that, and we would expect that to continue. Michael Hoffman : So this is a great way to force discipline into the market to the independents. Have you seen any evidence that that is also helping your churn and your rollbacks that you are forcing them to absorb the single biggest costs they have? Stifel, Nicolaus: So this is a great way to force discipline into the market to the independents. Have you seen any evidence that that is also helping your churn and your rollbacks that you are forcing them to absorb the single biggest costs they have? David Steiner : I would say, we certainly haven\u2019t seen any ripple of that from pricing throughout the market. Those small competitors, in the regional, even the national competitors that might not be integrated in the market, there is always going to be a healthy amount of competition in every markets we serve. So I\u2019m not sure that that if they can have that dramatic an effect, but to the extent that it will have an effect over time, it will be over time. We are certainly not seeing any effect currently. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Redding of BB&T Capital. Charles Redding : Just a quick follow-up on the front-end load side, is it overly optimistic to expect some margin lift here from increased contribution? Are we simply just at a point in the recovery where we can't do that? BB&T Capital Markets : Just a quick follow-up on the front-end load side, is it overly optimistic to expect some margin lift here from increased contribution? Are we simply just at a point in the recovery where we can't do that? Jim Fish : Are you talking about related to the transaction? Charles Redding : No, on the commercial side in terms of collection volumes? BB&T Capital Markets : No, on the commercial side in terms of collection volumes? David Steiner : Yes. We have to get better with our system. It\u2019s what I talked about earlier that the big leverage that we\u2019ve got in our business is really on the commercial side, because the density, the route density makes such a difference in there that you do have to look at from a contribution margin point of view. So as we look at our business what we are going to try to do is look at those lines of business where we can pick up volume without affecting the market place and then we\u2019re also going to look to start adding some density into our commercial wraps. Now again we are not going to do it in such a manner to upset the competitive dynamics in any particular market. So, it\u2019s going to take a period of time. Certainly as we see the economy improve and as we see the commercial business get better across the country that will give us more of an opportunity to go and take our fair share of the growth. We\u2019re not looking to grab market share here. What we\u2019re looking to do is to get our fair share of the growth. So as you start to see those volumes grow, you should see our volumes in the commercial line get better. Charles Redding : That's helpful. And then in terms of the overall recovery, is it possible to see better commercial volume without housing? Are the two simply tied together such that you couldn't get better volume there? BB&T Capital Markets : That's helpful. And then in terms of the overall recovery, is it possible to see better commercial volume without housing? Are the two simply tied together such that you couldn't get better volume there? David Steiner : Yes, look, long-term. I have always said that what you\u2019ve got going on in the economic recovery is, you got housing starts for the first 18 months, we\u2019re sort of what I call it tuck-in housing. There was not a lot of new developments going up. It was tear downs and rebuilding houses. What you see in last 18 months, you started to see some big take downs of large property [swaps] and you\u2019ve seen new development, particularly in places like Texas, Florida, California, you are starting to see new housing development. What comes along with housing development is commercial business, the new gas station, the new restaurant, the new gas, the new grocery store, and so. You absolutely need to see a sustained housing recovery to see a robust commercial volume recovery. I think we\u2019re on -- you all see just like I do. The housing starts number are sort of going in fits and starts over the last year. But I would say that as we go around and talk to our market, the trajectory is clearly up. You\u2019re starting to see more and more housing developments, you\u2019re starting to see more and more businesses that might have gone out of business during the downturn, reopened. And so I would expect that throughout 2014 and particularly in the 2015 you should see those commercial volumes grow. Again, it\u2019s not going to be everywhere. This is a geographic game for us. You\u2019re not going to see commercial volumes grow as robust in some places as others. But in those places where it is growing we want to make sure that we get our fair share growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini of Morningstar. Barbara Noverini : Hi, good morning, everybody. You mentioned that national account losses are partially responsible for the acceleration of volume declines past your original guidance. So are you working through your national account contracts in a similar manner as the rest of your business from a pricing perspective? And secondly, are these contract losses also affecting your recycling volumes? Morningstar: Hi, good morning, everybody. You mentioned that national account losses are partially responsible for the acceleration of volume declines past your original guidance. So are you working through your national account contracts in a similar manner as the rest of your business from a pricing perspective? And secondly, are these contract losses also affecting your recycling volumes? David Steiner : Yes. They are not so much affecting our recycling volumes, but they are more so affecting just our traditional collection volumes. But it\u2019s exactly right. As we look through the national accounts, the largest one that we lost was a low single-digit margin contract. And so we\u2019re treating our national accounts business sort of just like we treated our residential business, 6 to 10 years ago which is we\u2019re not going to -- we always say, we\u2019re not doing this for practice and we don\u2019t need a lot of practice doing this. So we\u2019re going to make sure that we get a fair price on those national account businesses and we\u2019re not going to keep a national account just to maintain volume. The largest account -- the largest one that we lost again was a low single-digit margin business. For the full year we expect that we\u2019ll lose about $100 million of annualized revenue, of that annualized revenue about two-thirds of it will be very low single-digit margin. And about two-thirds of it has hit to June 30. So the pace of that volume loss will accelerate a little bit in the back half of the year but again you won\u2019t see a dramatic earnings hit because it was very low margin business. Barbara Noverini :  I know we've been asking you this about every line of business today, but what [inning] are we in the reviews of your national account businesses? Morningstar:  I know we've been asking you this about every line of business today, but what [inning] are we in the reviews of your national account businesses? David Steiner : Look we know exactly what we want to do in our national account business. So I would tell you that from a planning point of view we\u2019re in the eighth inning, from an execution point of view I would tell you we\u2019re in the third inning. So there is still a lot of room to manage those contracts, we plan to do that over the next few years but we know exactly where we\u2019re going with it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft of Gabelli. Tony Bancroft :  You mentioned growth in the energy services as sort of the next step. How much would you say looking five years out will be organic versus acquisitive growth and if there is acquisitive and if there are -- are there any large service Energy Service acquisitions that you have been looking at, or are out there? Gabelli & Company:  You mentioned growth in the energy services as sort of the next step. How much would you say looking five years out will be organic versus acquisitive growth and if there is acquisitive and if there are -- are there any large service Energy Service acquisitions that you have been looking at, or are out there? David Steiner : We haven\u2019t been looking any at this point but most of our growth has really come organically, we\u2019ve done a few very small acquisitions in our energy services business. But we do consider part of our core and there was an acquisition out there that looked like it was priced properly. Operator : I would now turn the call over to David Steiner President and CEO of Waste Management for closing remarks. David Steiner :  Thank you. Clearly we had great performance from our Waste Management employees in the quarter. As Jim said I think we\u2019d be remised without recognizing our colleagues at Wheelabrator who have done a phenomenal job over the years and we don\u2019t view this as an end of a relationship but as the beginning of another long-term relationship. We are still going to be the primary provider of volume to the Wheelabrator plant. So this will be a change in the relationship but it\u2019s been a great relationship and we expect that great relationship to continue. As we look at the rest of the year as Jim mentioned we\u2019ve got FERC approval which could take anywhere from three to five months. The good news with that is that it gives us three to five months to really develop a plan on what we\u2019re going to do with the proceeds from the divestiture. So I would expect that at the end of the third quarter we\u2019ll have a fairly well defined plan that we can talk to you all about how we\u2019re going to split those proceeds between purchasing tuck-in type of businesses and doing share repurchases. All of which we think is going to be a very positive driver for us at the end of 2014 and driving into 2015. So once again we look forward to the future and we\u2019ll talk to you all end of the third quarter. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s Waste Management conference call.

Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, David Steiner. David Steiner : Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. We saw strong results in the third quarter that are a continuation of what we saw through the first six months of the year. Yield and cost control programs driving strong improvement in our core business. We saw growth in our income from operations, operating EBITDA and margins in both our traditional Solid Waste business and our overall business. In the third quarter we earned $0.72 per share an increase of over 10% when compared to the third quarter of 2013. When we started the year we had high expectations for our performance and through the first nine months we have met all of our expectations. Our employees have executed their business plans exceptionally well this year and we recently took additional steps to align the corporate functions to the needs of the field to further drive performance.  This should service-well as we begin to look forward to 2015. Jim will discuss the financial benefits of our corporate realignment, but I\u2019d like to touch on the strategic implications. We realized that growth and everything else in our business occurs on the frontlines, with support and oversight from our corporate teams. So our reorganization ensures that our corporate and field teams are aligned and working together and focuses our field and corporate resources to drive performance. Our corporate teams will work with the field to improve operations in our business by targeting volumes that support our yield focus and reducing costs. The corporate and field teams will have joint accountability in achieving these goals. We think of this is an expansion of the 2012 reorganization, where one of the main outcomes was a more direct line of sight from corporate to the field. Turning to our Waste Energy business, Jim will give you more detail on the results of operations, but I wanted to give you an update on the sale and use of proceeds. The transaction is progressing as we anticipated. We should receive Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval and close on the transaction at the end of this year or early in 2015. Regarding the use of proceeds our philosophy has not changed. We would prefer to replace the $220 million of divested operating EBITDA at attractive multiples. As we recently announced, we entered into an agreement to acquire Deffenbaugh Disposal which will enable us to replace a portion of that operating EBITDA. Our agreement limits what we can say now, but once the transaction closes we will provide additional financial details. We are certainly excited about the deal because Deffenbaugh is a very well-run company with both collection and disposal assets and with an excellent market position in Kansas City where we currently have virtually no presence. This transaction is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and is expected to close later this year or in the first quarter of 2015. We\u2019re still looking at other potential targets, but if we do not find assets at reasonable prices, we use the proceeds to repurchase our stock and maintain leverage neutrality. If we do purchase shares, we would likely begin at the end of the first quarter of 2015, after the exploration of our current accelerated share repurchase program. Returning to our third quarter results, our yield program continues to be a significant driver of our margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal yield was 2.3%, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of yield above 2%. Our core pricing remains solid at 3.8%. When compared to the third quarter of 2013 same-store average rates in the commercial line of business increased 5.2%, industrial increased 4% and we saw a 2.5% increase in our residential line. This has had some effect on volumes particularly with regard to lower margin national accounts and residential contracts, but we continue to see the trade-off as positive as the operating margin in our traditional Solid Waste business was up 60 basis points. Volumes in the third quarter were a negative 1.3% which is an improvement of 10 basis points from the second quarter and the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. About 100 basis points of the 130 basis points decline came from lost low margin national accounts. In the third quarter, we once again saw positive Landfill and transportation volumes more than offset by declines in the collection lines of business. Despite negative volumes the Company\u2019s income from operations grew more than 3% and our income from operations margin grew 60 basis points. In addition, operating EBITDA increased and operating EBITDA margins increased 30 basis points to 26.6%. Our recycling operations also performed better in the quarter despite an average OCC commodity price decline of 17.1%, reflecting our continued focus on enforcement of restrictions on contaminated loads and modifications to customer rebate structures. We\u2019ve seen three successive strong quarters in 2014 and we expect the strength to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2015. We are confident that we can meet or exceed the analyst consensus of $0.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter. A $0.60 fourth quarter would lead to full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.41, $0.06 above the high-end of our previous range. Cash flow has also been strong through the first three quarters and we expect that we will also exceed the 1.5 billion high-end of our free cash flow guidance. As we did last year, we may look at ways to invest some of this excess cash flow by pulling forward some 2015 spending into 2014. In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with the results so far in 2014 and expect that momentum to continue into 2015. We will be judicious with our use of proceeds from our Wheelabrator divestiture as we look to replace $220 million of operating EBITDA using the proceeds to create long-term shareholder value and not merely to create short-term earnings. This will likely have a negative effect on earnings and cash flow in the first half of 2015 as we look to offset the loss of $0.18 of EPS and $120 million in cash flow from the divestiture of Wheelabrator. Given the timing of the transaction, it\u2019s unlikely that we would close on the purchase of new businesses or shares before the end of the first quarter of 2015. So we would not replace the $0.05 of earnings that Wheelabrator produced in the first quarter of 2014. However, with respect to our core Solid Waste operations excluding Wheelabrator, we will continue to drive margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth and we will invest the Wheelabrator proceeds so that we can continue that growth well into the future. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results and the reorganization of corporate SG&A in more detail. Jim Fish :  Thanks David. I\u2019ll start by discussing our SG&A, which improved $3 million to $346 million when compared to the third quarter of 2013. We have a goal to SG&A cost as a percent of revenue being below 10% and for the second consecutive quarter, we achieved this goal. SG&A cost as a percent of revenue were 9.6% in the third quarter. During the quarter we took steps that are intended to better align our corporate leadership staff, cost with the need of the field operations, which resulted in approximately 650 positions being eliminated and a restructuring charge of $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter. This is a natural progression from the 2012 restructuring of our field organization, which focused on more directly aligning our corporate and field leadership with the elimination of the geographic group functions and empowering our customer facing employees. The anticipated saving in excess of $100 million annually from these actions implemented in 2015, but the main reason for this action is to better align and thus strengthen our corporate and field teams to execute our strategy. We will see the full run rate benefit of labor savings, starting in the first quarter of 2015 while the non-labor savings about 20% of the total savings should be realized throughout 2015. We plan to be at the full run rate of our savings as we start 2016. Turning to our third quarter results, our revenue declined 0.5% or $19 million to $3.6 billion. The price volume trade-off continues to generate positive results. However, the divestitures of our operations in Puerto Rico and a portion of Eastern Canada and a negative foreign currency translation led to a negative revenue comparison in the third quarter. The divestitures affected revenue by $24 million and the foreign exchange impact on revenue was approximately $12 million. We were pleased with the improvement in our major operating cost lines. Operating cost as a percent of revenue improved 40 basis points to 63.8% and approved $26 million in the third quarter despite a negative $5 million impact from the accounting effect of lower 10 year treasury rates on our environmental remediation reserves. The operating cost improvement was primarily driven by improvements in both our Solid Waste and Recycling operations. On the Solid Waste side, we were able to fix labor cost down as our volumes declined. In the Recycling we saw the benefit of continued focus on enforcement restrictions on contaminated loads and modifications to customer rebate structures. Turning to cash flow, for the third quarter we generated $418 million of free cash flow which is very strong but down slightly when compared to 2013. The difference was driven by an increase of $58 million in cash taxes due mostly to the exploration of bonus depreciation and the repatriation of earnings from the divestiture of our operations in Puerto Rico. Our capital expenses for the quarter were $307 million, a decrease of $16 million from the third quarter of 2013. We also had $53 million in the divestiture proceeds primarily from the sale of certain assets in our Eastern Canada markets in the quarter. Year-to-date 2014 we\u2019ve generated $1.3 billion in total free cash flow and $1.03 billion excluding divestiture proceeds. This is the highest free cash flow we\u2019ve generated through the first nine months of year since 2007. It puts us on-track to exceed the upper-end of our full year free cash flow forecast goal of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company, in the third quarter our collection in disposal yield was 2.3% with volumes declining 1.3%. This led total company income from operations growing $20 million, operating income margin expanding 60 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $5 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 30 basis points. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of the yield volume trade-off. Our commercial yield increased 50 basis points sequentially to 4.7%. Our industrial yield was 3.5% and residential was 1.4%. Overall collection yield was 3.2% with volumes declining 3.6%. The volume change was a 50 basis point improvement from the second quarter and as David mentioned most of our volume loss was related to the low margin, the loss of low margin national account business. This yield and volume led to income from operations growing $3 million and margin expanding 60 basis points. The industrial line of business including Energy Services drove the growth in income from operations. In the Landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the third quarter just as we have all year. Total Landfill volumes increased 4.2%. Combined Special Waste and revenue generating cover volumes were positive 4.4%, MSW volumes grew 5.7% and CMB volumes grew 15.3%. MSW yield rose to 1.6%. This led to income from operations growing $16 million which is the sixth consecutive quarter of growth and margins grew 130 basis points. Our Waste Energy operations were essentially flat in the third quarter when compared to the third quarter of 2013. Since we moved the business to asset-held-for-sale status the suspension of the depreciation expense added $0.01 per share. The sale is progressing as we anticipated. We still believe we\u2019re on-track to close the transaction in late fourth quarter, or early first quarter. David already discussed the use of proceeds, but I want to reiterate, that we\u2019ll be disciplined with the use of that cash to create long-term shareholder value. Finally looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the third quarter our weighted average cost of debt was 4.92% and the floating rate portion of our total debt was 16% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 32.1% compared to 34.3% in the third quarter of 2013. The rate was lower than our expected rate of 35%, due primarily to state audit settlements and adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes resulting from the filing of our 2013 returns. This benefited the quarter by approximately $0.03 per diluted share. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 35% for the fourth quarter. The results through the first nine months of the year put us on-track to exceed our full year targets. We are looking forward to the continued improvement in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015 now augmented by our recent corporate actions. And as always I want to thank our employees for their hard work. They\u2019ve made the first nine months of 2014 very successful. And with that Rashay let\u2019s open the line for questions. Question: and: Operator :  (Operator Instructions) And your first question is from line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Corey Greendale : First of all I appreciate all the detail in the script about the Wheelabrator impact and the timing and the cost savings. My first question, I know it is early to be talking about 2015 but can you just give us some sense of how you're thinking about the price volume environment going into 2015? Do you expect assuming economic conditions remain stable kind of a similar trend in 2015 as we are seeing in 2014? First Analysis Securities : First of all I appreciate all the detail in the script about the Wheelabrator impact and the timing and the cost savings. My first question, I know it is early to be talking about 2015 but can you just give us some sense of how you're thinking about the price volume environment going into 2015? Do you expect assuming economic conditions remain stable kind of a similar trend in 2015 as we are seeing in 2014? David Steiner :  Yes, it\u2019s a great question Corey. When we look at 2015 I think everybody recognizes what we have done with our yield program over the years. As I think everybody knows in 2013 we had a very strong incentive plan to drive yield above 2%. In 2015, we are likely to go back to where we were from 2007 to 2010 where we have what we call the pricing gate. So that folks have a substantial portion of their bonus at risk if they don\u2019t get their pricing targets. And there is one think I can tell you is that our pricing target will be over 2% for 2015. With respect to volumes, it\u2019s a little early to call but I would say Corey that the trends, look this is not going to change overnight. I think what you have seen during 2013 is a very slow progression towards that volumes for us I don\u2019t expect that to dramatically change but the signs that we are seeing from a volume point of view are positive than we have seen frankly in the last three years or four years. And so I would expect the volumes to continue to improve but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see them turn positive at least in early 2015. Corey Greendale : Okay, and given what you are seeing now in price, you sound relatively -- I know David, knowing you that you are never going to be totally happy with this, but it sounds like you are generally happy with where the yield is. Why you are thinking about putting the pricing gate back in place and what you expect to be different when you do that? First Analysis Securities : Okay, and given what you are seeing now in price, you sound relatively -- I know David, knowing you that you are never going to be totally happy with this, but it sounds like you are generally happy with where the yield is. Why you are thinking about putting the pricing gate back in place and what you expect to be different when you do that? David Steiner :  Yes look, you are absolutely right Corey we can always do better on the other hand as you well know that 2%, 2.3% yield can translate into 8% to 10% price increases across certain customer bases because we have some restricted customers. But look I think everybody knows that the one year in recent memory that we sort of fell off on yield was 2012 and we said that\u2019s not going to happen again. Now we have a lot of confidence in our field managers doing the right thing. And we have a lot of oversight of our field managers to make sure they do the right thing, but I have always been a believer that you need to support those price programs with some type of carrot or stick. In 2012 we didn\u2019t do that we saw what happened. We had a great carrot for the last two years folks are going to do very well by getting their pricing targets. Next year we are going to go back to a little bit more of if you will of a stick. I would say Corey I am not concerned about these folks not getting their core price targets, but having those guardrails in place through the incentive plans supports the program. Corey Greendale : And just one more left quickly if you're willing to talk about this. In 2015 with all the moving pieces between Wheelabrator and potentially charges and the cost savings and the bonus depreciation, can you just give us a directional sense of where you expect free cash flow to go in 2015, whether you expect it is going to be up from 2014? First Analysis Securities : And just one more left quickly if you're willing to talk about this. In 2015 with all the moving pieces between Wheelabrator and potentially charges and the cost savings and the bonus depreciation, can you just give us a directional sense of where you expect free cash flow to go in 2015, whether you expect it is going to be up from 2014? David Steiner :  Yes Corey I guess the way we\u2019d talk about 2015 at this point because you are exactly right, there is so many moving pieces what are we going to do with the divestiture proceeds and when is the divestiture going to close. And so when we look at it we say okay we have got $0.18 of EPS and $120 million of free cash flow that assuming Wheelabrator, would it be gone on January 1st that\u2019s going to be gone in 2015. So what we are doing right now as we are saying let\u2019s make sure we do the right thing with the proceed but then let\u2019s take a real good look at the core Solid Waste business and make sure that what we are doing in the core Solid Waste business is driving that double-digit earnings growth and driving free cash flow growth. So you should absolutely see free cash flow growth in the core Solid Waste business next year. Obviously you would see that much stronger if we saw bonus depreciation for 2015. Operator :  And your next question from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk : I want to focus on the volume topic here. We just posted another 1.3% decline. You have arguably have anniversaried the pricing story. What fundamentally is not going on in the end markets -- in your end markets -- that that volume can't get closer to positive sooner than exiting 2015? Wedbush Securities : I want to focus on the volume topic here. We just posted another 1.3% decline. You have arguably have anniversaried the pricing story. What fundamentally is not going on in the end markets -- in your end markets -- that that volume can't get closer to positive sooner than exiting 2015? David Steiner :  Yes well, let\u2019s look at the various lines of business. Obviously let\u2019s start at the Landfill. The Landfill volumes have been positive for quite some time and we would expect those to continue to be positive in 2015. Those volumes are highest margin and have a great return on capital so if we\u2019re going to have volumes growing anywhere that\u2019s where we want them going is at the Landfill and we have seen that in the last two years we expect to see that into 2015. On the collection side, you have got the Residential line of business which generally is our lowest margin, lowest return on capital and we\u2019ve been pretty judicious in not bidding those residential contracts particularly because they take so much capital, not bidding those residential contracts at a lower margin. So, you\u2019d expect to see volumes down there. On the commercial side that\u2019s -- and so my point is that on the residential side, look would we love to have more volumes on the residential side? Yes. Are we going to get more volumes by dropping price and lower margins just to get volumes? Absolutely not, when you look at the industrial side, the industrial side actually started to turn fairly well for us, I would not be surprised to see the industrial volumes turn positive in 2015 and again those are great margin, great return on capital volumes. So the only area where I\u2019d say, I\u2019d like to do a little bit better is on the commercial side. As you all know, when you get commercial volumes you can get great incremental margins because of the route density that you create with commercial volumes but again we\u2019re not going to go out and get commercial volumes by giving up price. And so, to see those commercial volumes we\u2019ve seen sequential improvement all year and that\u2019s a good thing to see those commercial volumes turn you\u2019ve got to get sort of sustained housing starts and sustained new business starts. We have started to see that in 2013, I\u2019d expect to see that continue in 2015 but again we\u2019re not just going to go out and throw a bunch of sales on the street and drop pricing to get new commercial volumes because if we do that as the largest in the business that\u2019s going to have a dramatic effect on our pricing program it\u2019s what I said in the script. We\u2019re going to go after volumes that don\u2019t have a dramatic effect on our yield program. There is a lot of great volumes we can get at the Landfill and Energy Services on the industrial side that are going to be high margin volumes for us, we don\u2019t need to go after low margin commercial business by dropping price or low margin residential business by dropping price and so we view that price volume trade-off as very positive, we expect to see it continue to improve in 2015 and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive margin expansion for us. Jim Fish :  Al I might give a little additional color too to what David said about the industrial line of business, that as I mentioned in my script that\u2019s the line of business that shows a lot of the energy services impact, it happens to be one of the few areas in the overall economy where we feel like we have really good long-term visibility even with declining oil prices, we happen to be in our strongest presence in energy services is in basins where the production cost for the E&P companies happens to be the lowest so we\u2019ll be in the last to feel the downturn there. But we like the prospects for energy services, it\u2019s been growing at -- revenue has been growing at about a 20% clip. We are going to be on-track to be 225-250 in revenue this year and we think we can continue to grow that at a fast pace. Al Kaschalk :  Thank you for the color, Jim. Is there any additional update on the M&A environment as it relates to that particular secular change? Wedbush Securities :  Thank you for the color, Jim. Is there any additional update on the M&A environment as it relates to that particular secular change? David Steiner :  Yes, there is always assets for sale because the multiples are fairly high as you know we did a couple of transactions in that field fairly small transactions but that would be, that would absolutely be one of the places where we would look to invest some of the proceeds but again whether it\u2019s energy services or hazardous waste or core solid waste, we\u2019re not going to overpay for the business just to use the proceeds right. The way we look at it AL, is we have got sort of a base case of buy back shares and leverage neutrality that would be slightly accretive with the use of proceeds. If we can do better than that by investing in businesses we\u2019ll absolutely do it but we\u2019re not going to invest in businesses where we have to pay a higher multiple than our own stock I mean the reality is we\u2019ve two choices, buy our company or buy another company and we would never buy another company at a higher multiple than we can buy our company. So, we\u2019re going to be fairly judicious in how we look at these acquisitions and if they occur that\u2019s great, if they don\u2019t occur, we still think we can buy our stock pretty cheap. Al Kaschalk : Okay, thank you. And then finally if I may, just a follow-up on the pricing story, or the pricing gate, I don't understand maybe if there is a -- it comes across that there is a change in how you're going to approach the market. Maybe that is a misinterpretation or understanding on my part but why are you altering at least the cadence on pricing here, or reinstalling for lack of better word a pricing gate? Wedbush Securities : Okay, thank you. And then finally if I may, just a follow-up on the pricing story, or the pricing gate, I don't understand maybe if there is a -- it comes across that there is a change in how you're going to approach the market. Maybe that is a misinterpretation or understanding on my part but why are you altering at least the cadence on pricing here, or reinstalling for lack of better word a pricing gate? David Steiner :  Yes, no offense Al but I think that is a misunderstanding with where we\u2019re going with the pricing program. Al Kaschalk : That's fair. Clarify it for us, David. Thank you. Wedbush Securities : That's fair. Clarify it for us, David. Thank you. David Steiner :  Look, I would say it\u2019s I think everybody on this phone and certainly everybody at Waste Management would say that the pricing programs are my sort of core focus, right and again look, I have total confidence that our field managers are going to do the right thing and I have total confidence that that the staff here at the corporate office are going to ensure they do the right thing but anytime you have something that\u2019s that important like our pricing programs, you have got to have everything in your company directed to making it happen. And so having confidence in the field managers is great but that\u2019s not everything we can do, having confidence at the corporate teams are going to support them is great but that\u2019s not everything we can do. You got to have the compensation programs aligned also. And that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about, and say look, the yield program is the most important thing that we do at Waste Management. So everything we do from the compensation programs to the oversight to the field managers everything we do is going to be structured to ensure that we drive that yield above CPI and above 2%. So it\u2019s really just if you will, an insurance policy to make sure that everybody understands that this is going to be the most important thing that we do. Now having said that we do want to improve our volumes but we don\u2019t want to improve our volumes at the price of reducing our yield focus that\u2019s what happened in 2012. We said look, we want to get volumes, and we went out and got some low margin volumes and some lines of business that affected our yield programs but also got us positive volumes at low margins. We are not going to do that again. Where we\u2019re going to look for volumes our places where we can get good high margin volumes but not have those volumes create a competitive dynamic in our markets such that the market says wow they\u2019re going to lower price in order to get volumes and we think there is plenty of places where we can do that in the manufacturing and industrial sector, in the energy services sector. We can go after good high margin volumes without affecting pricing for example at the commercial line. Operator :  And your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Macquarie. Adam Baumgarten : Could you just give us an update on the progress of some of the various cost initiatives you have had over the last couple of years? I'm just trying to see going forward how much more we should still expect in cost savings from those programs outside of the $100 million you announced today.  Macquarie: Could you just give us an update on the progress of some of the various cost initiatives you have had over the last couple of years? I'm just trying to see going forward how much more we should still expect in cost savings from those programs outside of the $100 million you announced today. David Steiner :  So a couple of different approaches here, one is operating cost where we felt like we made a lot of improvement on operating cost both on recycling and on core operations and we will continue to work those cost down Jim and Puneet Bhasin and their teams are spending a tremendous amount of time in the field as developing some real efficient operations. And really on the recycling fronts it is no state secrete here that commodity prices have not been good to us over the last two years. So we\u2019ve had to approach it -- I guess the good news is there, that it\u2019s forced us to approach it from a cost standpoint. We\u2019ve done that we saw a bit of improvement year-over-year in Q3 and so once commodity prices do return to a more normalized levels we think we\u2019re in a great position in the recycling line of business. SG&A costs, yes, we took about $100 million the long-term run rate will be about $100 million, about 80% of that is labor, 20% non-labor. The labor piece will come out in kind of -- about 10 million of it will come out in Q4 and we\u2019ll be pretty much done with that labor piece in Q1 of 2015. Then the non-labor has a bit longer tail to it but that will all come out by second half -- for the most part it will be all out by the end of Q2 of next year for a total of 100 million impact overall. Is there additional SG&A savings out there, we\u2019re always looking but I think what we\u2019ve done in 2012 predominantly consolidation in the field and then in 2014 with more closely aligning our SG&A to fill our strategy. I think you probably see at this point going forward trying to just hold labor cost flat. Jim Trevathan :  Jim, I might add for Adam\u2019s benefit. Adam, on the collection side of the business we now are on about 25% of our collection companies that we are certified. They have the technology, the onboard computer in place. They also have the culture and the accountability process and the dollar improvement to their P&L that\u2019s hitting the bottom-line and you saw that in that 60 basis points improvement in operating margin. We\u2019re progressing through the 400 or so collection companies and should complete that effort in next year. So you\u2019ll continue to see that improvement in OpEx as a percentage of net revenue as we rollout not just the technology but the culture of the accountability and get the dollar value out that initiative. Adam Baumgarten : Okay, great. So what kind of run rate are we at for some of the other programs you have announced in the past, such as the routing and logistics and the back-office stuff? Is that sort of what you just spoke about, that that is still a work in progress, or are we at that full run rate? Macquarie: Okay, great. So what kind of run rate are we at for some of the other programs you have announced in the past, such as the routing and logistics and the back-office stuff? Is that sort of what you just spoke about, that that is still a work in progress, or are we at that full run rate? Jim Trevathan :  Well Adam that\u2019s what I just mentioned, Jim Trevathan again. We are at about a 20%-25% of the 400 collection companies but the others are in the process of implementation. We are not starting them all fresh and new as we finish the one, that process is underway and going on at the other 75%-80% of the location. So it is a process that about a year we think a year or so left in the implementation process. Jim Fish :  Also on the lines of David\u2019s conversation about bonus and pricing, a big component of our bonus the field\u2019s bonus is tied to a huge component and a half of it is tied to operating cost. So there is certainly carrot out for them if they improve on operating cost we saw as we mentioned the 30 basis point swing this quarter which we were pleased with, but don\u2019t feel like we are done. Adam Baumgarten : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on the acquisition side, have you seen seller expectations on the solid waste side come down at all over the last few months or so, or is it still pretty high? Macquarie Research : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on the acquisition side, have you seen seller expectations on the solid waste side come down at all over the last few months or so, or is it still pretty high? David Steiner :  Yes I would say that you really haven\u2019t seen it comedown. But again look I feel about that sort of how I feel about the economy nothing we can do about it but we are going to take a particular approach to it. And the approach we are going to take is that, when we are buying core solid waste type of operations, we know those operations very well, we know exactly what we can do with them when we tuck them into our operations what cost synergies we can get. And so we can get a real good idea of what that company is going to look like once we bring it into our company and integrate it. And again there is one business but I know better than any business we can buy and that\u2019s ours. And so it basically comes down to a pretty simple fact, why would I pay anymore than our current multiple frankly I can\u2019t imagine we would pay our multiple. We would pay substantially less than our multiple for any business that we don\u2019t know as well as ours. And so when it comes to acquisitions is seller expectations are too high we have certainly proven in the past that we are willing to walk away from those. But I think there is going to plenty of targets out there that we can look at where we can get that great post-integration synergy that we can hopefully replace some or all of that $220 million of Wheelabrator EBITDA. Operator :  Your next question is from the line of Scott Levine with Imperial Company. Scott Levine : So, on the volume side I think you mentioned, I don't know if it was Jim, 15% growth in construction and demolition. I was hoping maybe a little bit more color regarding the outlook for C&D, also special waste, the pipeline there and maybe some additional thoughts on coal ash and how that opportunity is potentially progressing? Imperial Capital : So, on the volume side I think you mentioned, I don't know if it was Jim, 15% growth in construction and demolition. I was hoping maybe a little bit more color regarding the outlook for C&D, also special waste, the pipeline there and maybe some additional thoughts on coal ash and how that opportunity is potentially progressing? Jim Trevathan :  Sure. Keep in mind when we talk about C&D it\u2019s a small percentage of our overall revenue we increased it substantially in percentage terms 15.2% but it is still as an overall small piece. However, we like the direction, a lot of that came from parts of the South where we are seeing heavy construction, Florida and Texas to name a couple. So we think that\u2019s -- to the extent that this housing recovery and the recovery in general are intact and don\u2019t start to retrace their steps. We think C&D will continue to show nice improvements year-over-year. Special wastes is for us is a bigger category it includes energy services it includes manufacturing and industrial type waste, we feel very good about that, so we feel like the various entry in that line of business are higher than they would in a business like commercial it\u2019s tougher to get into next on an ExxonMobil refinery if you are not already in there and we have been in there for 30 years than it is to get into a small restaurant. So we like the special waste category and that is a real growth opportunity for us going forward. I can\u2019t say exactly what the expectation is for the whole waste stream in terms of percentage growth in 2015. But I will tell you that that as I mentioned earlier energy services which is a component of that will continue to grow nicely at 20 plus percent over the next several years. And then coal ash the promulgation of coal ash regulation is coming out here in December, hard to say exactly what that will mean to us but we have had a number of conversations with big public utilities that they are starting to take aggressive steps to remediate and ultimately they like working with big companies like Waste Management, so we feel good about the cool ash opportunity. There really are going to be a couple of different approaches that those utilities might take. One would be moving coal ash to a Landfill we think it will be subtitle D and subtitle C. Second would be asking somebody to come in and actually manage and operate their Landfills for them a lot of them have onsite Landfills and then the third would be some type of beneficial reuse clearly that would be their preference and we can help them with all three. So we like the opportunities across the special waste stream. David Steiner :  Jim I might also add for Scott\u2019s benefit on the hazardous waste side we have got facilities that really support our industrial DM&I sector, we have added to the rail capability we have got projects getting to move here in the fourth quarter by rail into a couple of our hazardous waste sites and that is an advantage that we offer to our customers. Scott Levine : And then one other thing on the volume side before turning to price, I think you mentioned that you are still seeing 100 basis point drag to reported volume from lost national accounts. Can you remind us how that headwind, when might that taper off and maybe just your thoughts on the national account business in general at this point in time? Imperial Capital : And then one other thing on the volume side before turning to price, I think you mentioned that you are still seeing 100 basis point drag to reported volume from lost national accounts. Can you remind us how that headwind, when might that taper off and maybe just your thoughts on the national account business in general at this point in time? David Steiner : Yes, it should taper off sort of midyear next year and when we think about the national accounts frankly we think about them by splitting them depending on what kind of container they have out back right. So, if you have a compactor out in back we can\u2019t create a lot of route density and so we\u2019ve got to look at that sort of on a standalone basis right and we are not going to bid those large compactor accounts at a low margin. When you look at front-end container national accounts you can create a lot of route density and so the ability to make good money on those is a little bit higher because you can, the incremental cost to service them is much lower than servicing a compactor customer. And so when we look at our national accounts, we\u2019re not going to bid anything at a low margin but we would be willing to accept a lower margin on a front-end customer than we would on a compactor customer because we get such benefits out of the route densification. Jim Trevathan : Dave one other point that for national account customers that we see real clear differentiation again are those manufacturing and industrial national accounts where our service offering whether it\u2019s solid waste business or special waste or hazardous waste add real value add to it our balance sheet and those guys like us and we expect to grow in that sector. Scott Levine : One last one on pricing just very quickly, if you could remind us how much CPI linked pricing business is a percentage of your total revenue and where CPI was running right now, would you think that would be a headwind or a tailwind into 2015 if current trends remain constant? Imperial Capital : One last one on pricing just very quickly, if you could remind us how much CPI linked pricing business is a percentage of your total revenue and where CPI was running right now, would you think that would be a headwind or a tailwind into 2015 if current trends remain constant? David Steiner : Yes, we\u2019re sure looking for the day when CPI becomes a tailwind for us instead of a headwind right. About 40% of our business is CPI-linked and when we say CPI-linked remember that that can be all over the Board, it can be 100% of CPI can be some kind of localized CPI it can be a percentage of CPI but when we look forward I\u2019d tell you we aren\u2019t going to build our yield programs around CPI, it always amazes me that folks say well we would have gotten excellent yields if it wasn\u2019t for CPI, we take a little bit of a different approach. We say we\u2019re going to get x dollars of price despite CPI and so when we look at our pricing programs we say how many dollars are we going to get out of our pricing program to drop to the bottom-line if get 0% from CPI we\u2019re going to find those dollars somewhere else. And so, you\u2019ll never hear us sort of say that CPI is a drag on yield look that is the fact of life what we get paid to do is to drop certain amount of dollars to the bottom-line and if we can get those dollars from CPI that\u2019s great but if we can\u2019t get those dollars from CPI we\u2019re going to get those dollars somewhere else. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Jim Fish, a little housekeeping first. Fourth quarter, what is the starting share count in the fourth quarter because if I read everything correctly you have spent $600 million and bought back stock in 3Q. What is my starting share count? Stifel Nicolaus : Jim Fish, a little housekeeping first. Fourth quarter, what is the starting share count in the fourth quarter because if I read everything correctly you have spent $600 million and bought back stock in 3Q. What is my starting share count? Jim Fish : I think it\u2019s 463 million. Michael Hoffman : Okay, and -- sorry, say again. Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, and -- sorry, say again. Jim Fish : I will verify that but I think it\u2019s 463 million. Michael Hoffman : And is there a plan to buy back more in the 4Q, or you did it, you did the $600 million and then --? Stifel Nicolaus : And is there a plan to buy back more in the 4Q, or you did it, you did the $600 million and then --? Jim Fish : No plan to buyback more in the fourth quarter we\u2019ve the $600 million ASR which 70% of it took place at the initiation of that so no plans outside of that $600 million ASR. Michael Hoffman : And then you made a comment I think it was in your prepared remarks around D&A and about Wheelabrator and I think that then explains what my question was going to be that D&A was down yet your Landfill volume was up, so that is Wheelabrator as a percent of revenues. So what is the trend line, is it 9.1 is the way to think about it? Stifel Nicolaus : And then you made a comment I think it was in your prepared remarks around D&A and about Wheelabrator and I think that then explains what my question was going to be that D&A was down yet your Landfill volume was up, so that is Wheelabrator as a percent of revenues. So what is the trend line, is it 9.1 is the way to think about it? Jim Fish : 9.1 on I would say that, that\u2019s hard to say but think that\u2019s probably about right. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Alright, now getting into the meat of this, on the price gate, David, I guess there is some confusion about what a stick means versus a carrot from your perspective, so --? Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. Alright, now getting into the meat of this, on the price gate, David, I guess there is some confusion about what a stick means versus a carrot from your perspective, so --? David Steiner : There is no confusion out in the field that Michael about what it... Michael Hoffman : Well, so just for our benefit. The carrot, clearly we tease you with a number but the stick in this case is it an all or nothing meaning if everybody wins or everybody loses, or is it very individual? Stifel Nicolaus : Well, so just for our benefit. The carrot, clearly we tease you with a number but the stick in this case is it an all or nothing meaning if everybody wins or everybody loses, or is it very individual? David Steiner : Yes the way we\u2019ve looked at it Michael is that when you got 17 areas like we\u2019ve got right, if 10 of the areas hit their target and 7 of them don\u2019t hit the target and the company doesn\u2019t hit the target guess who doesn\u2019t win, the shareholder doesn\u2019t win and we don\u2019t pay our folks including us unless the shareholder wins and so you\u2019ve got to do both out in the field we\u2019ve got to hit it from a corporate point of view and you have got to hit it at the local point of view. And look the only way our shareholders win is that the -- a shareholder doesn\u2019t care if 10 out 17 hit the target if the company doesn\u2019t get the target. And so what we\u2019ve always done and said the company has to hit the target and you have to hit the target in order to not be penalized on your bonus. Michael Hoffman :  Okay. And in the past this has been very focused around collection but you alluded in 2Q about disposal and subsequent public appearances by the company at various forums have talked about it, what is the mix between Landfill and collection in that gate? Are you distinguishing the two so that you incentivize both areas of focus? Stifel Nicolaus :  Okay. And in the past this has been very focused around collection but you alluded in 2Q about disposal and subsequent public appearances by the company at various forums have talked about it, what is the mix between Landfill and collection in that gate? Are you distinguishing the two so that you incentivize both areas of focus? David Steiner :  No, we don\u2019t want to overcomplicate the gate, right. And so what we\u2019re doing in 2015 and I think as everybody on the phone knows that our reported yield number is a very good approximation of where we\u2019ve gone with pricing but the real number that we look at is the core price number because that is the measure of how many dollars drop to the bottom-line from pricing remember what core price is. That is our price increases across all customers minus rollbacks and plus our fees and surcharges as in the fuel surcharge. And so those are the dollars that drop to the bottom-line. So when we do it we\u2019re going to do it based on core price because that again it doesn\u2019t matter what our yield is if we don\u2019t drop dollars to the bottom-line. Our shareholders don\u2019t get rewarded unless we drop dollars to the bottom-line. So what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to set a target just like we have over the last few years. We\u2019re going to set that core price target both at the company and at the local level and that\u2019s the number that we\u2019re going to use as part of the gate. Jim Fish :  Michael, my guess is that part of your question is related to MSW pricing there and Landfill pricing in general. If you look at MSW pricing over the last eight quarters where we\u2019ve been in the -- on the yield side, we\u2019ve been in the 1% to 2% range. This quarter was 1.6% and I\u2019m talking about MSW now was 1.6% kind of in the upper-end of that range. With volume over that same period of time being somewhere between flat and positive 5%, the eight quarters prior to that so 2011-2012 yield was between flat and 1% in MSW and volume was between negative 5% and flat. So we\u2019ve essentially seen a doubling of yield in the MSW line which is what we really look at it most closely when we\u2019re looking at Landfill pricing. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Fair enough. On volume, can you talk about your weight per yard trends and also the dollar per yard trends in front-end loader? Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. Fair enough. On volume, can you talk about your weight per yard trends and also the dollar per yard trends in front-end loader? David Steiner :  Yes, the weight per yard is have been fairly steady but we have seen Michael, when I talk about the volumes I talk that -- again I don\u2019t expect to see a dramatic turn but I\u2019m much more optimistic that we continue to see progress than have been in the past. On the commercial side we have seen service increases, outpace service decreases for the last three quarters and five out of the last six quarters and then what we\u2019re talking about before, commercial volumes follow construction. So when you see high C&D volumes and you see improving industrial volumes the next step is you\u2019re going to start to see improving commercial volumes I think you have written about this quite a bit and I think you\u2019re absolutely right that I would expect that in 2015 again we\u2019re not going to see a huge dramatic turn but we\u2019re certainly going to see good steady progress on those commercial volumes. Michael Hoffman : Okay, great. Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, great. David Steiner :  Michael, by the way the other thing, when I talk about commercial volumes you\u2019ll always hear me talk about commercial volumes. I think the large companies have to look at this as, what we do in commercial volumes especially entire market and so if you go out and you just drop price to get volumes across your commercial base everybody else is going to follow you and before you know it again the price war on the commercial side and everybody starts losing money. And so when we look at our commercial business we say let\u2019s make sure that what we\u2019re doing in the commercial business is improving our volumes but not upsetting the pricing dynamics in the market. So what\u2019s the best way to do that quit losing your current customers, right, I mean if you\u2019re not stealing a customer from someone else you can\u2019t upset the market dynamic. So Jim Trevathan has put a task force together to make sure that our good customer service gets great. So that -- and the best way for us to grow our commercial volumes would be to retain our current customers and I\u2019d expect to see that occur in 2015. Michael Hoffman :  So more defense of the business as well? Stifel Nicolaus :  So more defense of the business as well? David Steiner :  Look, more defense of the business without using price right I mean we\u2019ve defended the business before by doing, using rollback and we don\u2019t want to go there. We want to defend the business by providing value to our customers. And so what you\u2019ll see in 2015 I think is an improving economy. Again when volumes are growing look, the way you upset a competitive dynamic is by going out and stealing everybody else\u2019s business. And we\u2019re big enough across the country that if we do that we\u2019re going to upset the competitive dynamic. So the best way to do it is to go get volumes when there is growing volumes right, when there is growing volumes we can take some new customers and get our fair share of the growth and that\u2019s not going to upset the market dynamics. When we keep more of our current customers that set the market dynamic and so now that we have seen the economy start to improve we are starting commercial volumes grow. I think we can make good progress on commercial volumes without upsetting the pricing dynamic. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Fair enough. Switching gears to recycling, you have all talked about this peak to trough $200 million profit hit, half of it was price, half of it was in your control. Can you talk about where you are in that part you control? You clearly have made progress in 2Q, 3Q but where are we in that $100 million, how much is left to recapture by running it better? Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. Fair enough. Switching gears to recycling, you have all talked about this peak to trough $200 million profit hit, half of it was price, half of it was in your control. Can you talk about where you are in that part you control? You clearly have made progress in 2Q, 3Q but where are we in that $100 million, how much is left to recapture by running it better? David Steiner :  Yes I will take a shot at it and then maybe Jim you can add because really that\u2019s operating cost question Michael. It\u2019s half operating cost and half coaching of our customers to get them to improve the quality of what they bring us. I mean if they are bringing us trash in the front-end it eventually goes out the back-end as trash but we incur cost to process it. So part of that is an education process with our customers to help them understand that that\u2019s what they bring us has to be truly recyclables and not just what they call diversion of materials. The other side is operating efficiencies and I think we have made some nice improvement on operating efficiencies we have look at how many lines we should run at various plants what\u2019s the most efficient way to process recyclables. Really that was the sole improvement for the quarter it was not in pricing because as David mentioned OCC pricing was down 17% for us. The good news is as I said we are forcing ourselves to tackle this on the OpEx side as well as the coaching of our customers. Jim Fish :  And Michael what I would add that there is some residential contracts that don\u2019t have the parameters that we look for today in that contract that restrict the amount of residue for example detain the material, so that\u2019s the parameter that gets to the Jim\u2019s coaching if you will but part of it just a contractual issue as those contracts expire and we are able and if we have the industry following we are able to get the right kind of pricing and cost controls in place and waste the constituency of the waste material is right that lower the OpEx. So those two issues are tied together to add more color the Jim\u2019s statement. If I were picking an inning I don\u2019t think we are quite at the midpoint but we are approaching the midpoint maybe it is 25% to 50% of the way there of that 200 million. Obviously the pricing commodity side of it where we can\u2019t affect but the 100 million we can. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So it\u2019s 25% to 35% of the 100 million is kind of. Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. So it\u2019s 25% to 35% of the 100 million is kind of. David Steiner :  Just one component perhaps on the OpEx side we look further a long but on the other side probably in that 25%-30% range. Michael Hoffman : Okay fair enough. There's another piece of this, which has been interesting, too, where you're going back and trying to get a processing fee. I think you have I think its Philadelphia you have talked about in the past recently, where this really made a meaningful difference. Where are we in the success of some of that activity? Stifel Nicolaus : Okay fair enough. There's another piece of this, which has been interesting, too, where you're going back and trying to get a processing fee. I think you have I think its Philadelphia you have talked about in the past recently, where this really made a meaningful difference. Where are we in the success of some of that activity? David Steiner :  Philadelphia is a great example Michael. We have that business it had a lot of material in it that was just not recyclable the contract expired we bid it at a profitable level with all the parameters that we have just talked about in mind, we lost it to the other competitor in the Philadelphia area and lost that volume but we picked up volume from third-party haulers that that recycler had in their mix and we are making money at that plant. So it\u2019s a great example of that issue. But we are making the money on that third-party volume is coming because we could price it correctly. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then last item for Jim Fish. So as I think about free cash flow, if I end the year this is net of divestitures, so 1.25, I take out Wheelabrator that is 120 if I am using a $100 million as the baseline for the risk, I'm getting $80 million of it in 2015, so I get that $80 million back. And then next component should be there's got to be some growth, there is ongoing operating leverage and then there's working capital. Is that the right way to think about it? And then lastly, I would really like to hear what you are doing on the working capital collecting your money faster and paying your bills slower. Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. And then last item for Jim Fish. So as I think about free cash flow, if I end the year this is net of divestitures, so 1.25, I take out Wheelabrator that is 120 if I am using a $100 million as the baseline for the risk, I'm getting $80 million of it in 2015, so I get that $80 million back. And then next component should be there's got to be some growth, there is ongoing operating leverage and then there's working capital. Is that the right way to think about it? And then lastly, I would really like to hear what you are doing on the working capital collecting your money faster and paying your bills slower. Jim Fish :  So the second question first here on working capital. Working capital was down slightly for the quarter. We showed some improvement in DSO of a half day versus Q3 of \u201913 but not the same improvement that we showed last year on the DSO front. Last year we showed a day and a half improvement. So I still think there is quite a bit of opportunity on DSO. On DPO we did show nice improvement in DPO on how quickly we pay we improved that by 2.1 days less value to improving DPO than improving DSO, but both are very valuable to us and we are moving in the right direction. I would have preferred to move a little on quicker on DSO than we did but I still think we have got both of those as improving opportunities going forward. Free cash flow is there is couple of things that affect free cash flow. As we think about 2015 and while we are not prepared obviously to give a number but we know that the cash taxes related to repatriation of Puerto Rico earnings that will not recur in 2015. So that\u2019s somewhat of a tailwind if you want to think about that that way. And then I think still TBD on what happens with bonus depreciation we didn\u2019t have it obviously this year, there is rumors that we will have it next year but we are not counting on it. I still think though that\u2019s and then of course the big impact on free cash flow will be divestiture of Wheelabrator so as David mentioned that\u2019s 120 million in cash in free cash flow that goes away call it January 1, 2015. So we\u2019re going have to kind of reorient everyone to think about 2015 whether it\u2019s EPS or free cash flow or EBITDA any of those financial metrics think about it excluding Wheelabrator as we go through a process of replacing, we\u2019ve said we want to replace at reasonable prices the EBITDA and free cash flow and if we can\u2019t then we\u2019ll go about it with other means by way of share repurchase and leverage neutrality. David Steiner :  And remember Michael on the re-org, we\u2019re basically getting four months of benefit in 2013 from the re-org so you get basically -- 2014 you get basically 8 months of benefit next year. So, it won\u2019t be $100 million next year to be a little less than 100. Michael Hoffman : Right, I think Jim mentioned you're getting $10 million of it in the fourth quarter but if it is $100 million I'm playing with, I've got 90 million next year and there's sort of $15 million or $20 million of that's the non-labor, the rest is labor. Stifel Nicolaus : Right, I think Jim mentioned you're getting $10 million of it in the fourth quarter but if it is $100 million I'm playing with, I've got 90 million next year and there's sort of $15 million or $20 million of that's the non-labor, the rest is labor. Jim Fish :  Yes, I\u2019m just going year-over-year. Operator :  Your next question is from the line of Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box :  Yes, David, just a follow-up for you on the competitive dynamics. We are going on our second year of volume recovering in the industry and with commercial picking up now we've pretty much seen all the way streams get better. I'm just curious in your historical context, do you think that 2015 is the year where maybe some of your peers start to get behind pricing and we see a nice step-up there? Or do you think that we are probably looking at just a continued slow recovery and just overall industry pricing? KeyBanc Capital Markets :  Yes, David, just a follow-up for you on the competitive dynamics. We are going on our second year of volume recovering in the industry and with commercial picking up now we've pretty much seen all the way streams get better. I'm just curious in your historical context, do you think that 2015 is the year where maybe some of your peers start to get behind pricing and we see a nice step-up there? Or do you think that we are probably looking at just a continued slow recovery and just overall industry pricing? David Steiner :  Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I think an improving volume and improving volume environment is always good for pricing right, whether you\u2019re selling widgets or garbage. And so I do think that what you\u2019ll see is more rational pricing behavior I do think what you\u2019ll see is the larger companies saying that it\u2019s a little easier to take the risk on loosing volumes by using price and we all know that you get a much bigger affect on the bottom-line from price than volume and so yes, I would say that as you see the volume environment improving you should see the pricing environment stabilize. Joe Box : Not to put words in your mouth, probably more of a slow recovery than a step function up? KeyBanc Capital Markets : Not to put words in your mouth, probably more of a slow recovery than a step function up? David Steiner :  Well look I can\u2019t control what anyone else does, I can only control what we do and to the earlier question we\u2019re pretty good at 2% to 2.5% yield. We don\u2019t have to do we can still improve don\u2019t get me wrong, but we know how to get that 2% to 2.5% yield. Now it\u2019s time for us to say okay, how do we get that yield, we\u2019re not going to give up on that yield but how do we get that yield and stem some of these volume losses. Frankly I think some of our competition is in a position whether they need to do a better job of getting higher margin volumes and focusing more on price because I think that look I think that we all know that what helps bottom-line and so we\u2019d always say as I think you\u2019ll see more balance in the overall industry where everybody is doing a little better on volume but everybody is doing better than 2% yield but again I can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re going to do I can promise you what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re not going to go below that 2% yield sort of that 3.5% to 4% core price we\u2019re not going below that no matter what effect it has on volumes but what I\u2019m saying is I would expect the effects for us on volumes to be better in 2015 than it was in 2014. Joe Box : Great, I appreciate that. Maybe changing gears to the restructuring real quick. I completely understand the need to align corporate with some of your customer-facing employees. Can you maybe just walk through an example of the type of position that was eliminated, or maybe some of the various efficiency gains that you guys are pursuing that will help align the Company? KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great, I appreciate that. Maybe changing gears to the restructuring real quick. I completely understand the need to align corporate with some of your customer-facing employees. Can you maybe just walk through an example of the type of position that was eliminated, or maybe some of the various efficiency gains that you guys are pursuing that will help align the Company? David Steiner :  Yes, when we look at the reorganization and look what we did these were very good folks a lot of them been with the industry a long time very smart all doing good things for the company but what you find when your organization we call it the funnel one person sends something out to the field and says I need you to work on x and if that was all that went out to the field, the field wouldn\u2019t be distracted life would be good the problem is when you\u2019ve got 30 people doing that 30 things goes out to the field and all of a sudden the field gets distracted because they have too many things coming at them from too many directions we sort of call it the funnel. If there is too many things going in the funnel and heading out to the field so when we did the reorganization we said we\u2019re not going to look at it from a people point of view, we\u2019re going to look at it from a function point of view. And when you look at it from a function point of view if it\u2019s not driving one of what we call our five swim lanes and those as you can imagine revolve around customer service and pricing and cost but if it\u2019s not driving one of our five swim lanes if that function is not driving it, then it is a function that we can do without for now. It\u2019s nice to have not a must to have and so that\u2019s the way we looked at it, we looked at it frankly from a functional point of view how do we make sure that everything that we\u2019re doing at corporate is driving performance out in the field rather than slowing down performance out in the field and that was the philosophy we took and I think what you\u2019ll see is that, that philosophy will lead to much more alignment between our corporate staff and our field operations. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Charles Redding with BB&T Capital Markets. Charles Redding : Just a brief follow-up on national accounts, is it fair to assume that this segment does give you some degree of visibility with respect to forward expectations and what are you seeing fundamentally in terms of spending trends among the larger customers? BB&T Capital Markets : Just a brief follow-up on national accounts, is it fair to assume that this segment does give you some degree of visibility with respect to forward expectations and what are you seeing fundamentally in terms of spending trends among the larger customers? David Steiner :  Yes look and again as Jim Trevathan pointed out, those national accounts expand a lot of different types of businesses from front-end container to compactors to industrial clients. But I\u2019m not sure that you see a dramatic change from those large national accounts. Those large national accounts are just like us, which is we\u2019re looking for ways to drive down costs through efficiency. And so when we work with large national accounts what we try to tell them is you can look at this based on price if you want but the way we look at it is we\u2019re going to start out with the particular price and then we\u2019re going to figure out how to save you money. So for example if you take that compactor customer, if our competition is picking up that customer three times a week and we\u2019re picking them up once a week it\u2019s going to cost us a lot less to do it. So how do we figure out, how to pick up that container when it\u2019s full rather than picking it up when it\u2019s half full. And so when we deal with national accounts our view is look we want that help you save money but we can help you save money while we continue to make money. If you can\u2019t take a national account view that what is going to cut the price and make less money. That\u2019s what we will not do because that this doesn\u2019t work for our business. But what we can do to find ways for each of those types of customers the front-end container, the compactors, those large industrial companies we can find ways where we can make the margins we want to make and they can lower their cost. So for example the manufacturing industrial customer to buy recycled materials like metals that help them lower their overall cost and we can do that better than anyone. So when we approach those national accounts we do look at it as how we do save them money, but how do we save them money while maintaining our profitability. Charles Redding : And then quickly in terms of fleet spend, does the drop in crude really have any impact on the current appetite for C&G and I guess if not, is there a price on crude that might impact how you kind of approach future purchases? BB&T Capital Markets : And then quickly in terms of fleet spend, does the drop in crude really have any impact on the current appetite for C&G and I guess if not, is there a price on crude that might impact how you kind of approach future purchases? David Steiner :  Yes right now that differential is still over $1.5 and so I would say it doesn\u2019t affect what we\u2019re doing on fleet purchases. And as you have seen oil has come down a little bit short but natural gas has come down also. We\u2019re still a long way away from the stepping point where we\u2019d say we want to be diesel. But even with neutrality this is also about our customers. Our customers are demanding a cleaner truck and clearly natural gas is going to be cleaner than diesel. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey : I wanted to ask about the acquisition landscape. You talked about the multiples that the folks are asking. Can you to put a little more color around where the relevant ranges are for multiples? And then I think you implied that they see elevated. What do you think is driving that because looking at the underlying fundamentals in the business, CPI is pretty low and so that is tough for pricing and volumes are still sluggish and what is sort of driving that elevated multiple for deals out there? Goldman Sachs : I wanted to ask about the acquisition landscape. You talked about the multiples that the folks are asking. Can you to put a little more color around where the relevant ranges are for multiples? And then I think you implied that they see elevated. What do you think is driving that because looking at the underlying fundamentals in the business, CPI is pretty low and so that is tough for pricing and volumes are still sluggish and what is sort of driving that elevated multiple for deals out there? David Steiner :  Yes, it\u2019s not just an elevated multiple it\u2019s also that folks are doing better just like us, everybody is doing better from an EBITDA point of view and so the valuations have gone up both from a performance point of view and anytime that you\u2019re in an improving market and folks have a lot of confidence going forward on their business. But it comes down to this, what we\u2019re trying to do is to buy their business at trailing earnings and if they\u2019re looking forward in the future and saying gosh trailing earnings, I\u2019m not sure if those earnings are going to get much better, so trailing earnings looks good to me they\u2019ll sell out a certain multiple. If they say gosh, those forward earnings look really good to me they will sell in different multiple. So for example we aren\u2019t buying businesses in the recycling business but there is not a lot of people feeling greatly confident about their recycling business and that\u2019s going to drive to a lower multiple, because they say, look, I\u2019ll take five to six times for my business because I don\u2019t see my EBITDA going up dramatically over the next five years. On the solid waste side it\u2019s a little bit different I think people are seeing EBITDA going up and if you look at it from just discounted cash flow model point of view, if you think your business is going to get a lot better over the next five years you\u2019re going to want to hire multiple for your business. So it\u2019s really just pure sort of finance and what you believe about the market going forward. And so I still think back to the original part of the question, I still think that we can buy good local businesses at call it a post synergy number of five to six times EBITDA as you are buying larger sort of regional type of competitors that multiple is going to be a little bit higher because you get a bigger slug of business with one transaction but post synergies I would expect those to be in sort of 6 time to 7.5 time earning, 6 times to 8 times earnings -- EBITDA I am sorry. And so anytime you can buy a business at 5 times to 7 times EBITDA or 6 times to 8 times EBITDA you are buying at a below our current market multiple and that makes it accretive to our shareholders. Alex Ovshey :  And just one last question for me on the collection volume side, it's been asked a couple of different ways but had a little bit of a follow-up there. So as I look at the last four quarters I think specifically that commercial collection volume number has been down 3% to 5%. So the fourth quarter of \u201814 would really be the first quarter where we are going to be comping material volume decline in that segment. So how are you guys thinking about commercial collection volumes going forward? Is the expectation that you should see the volume erosion moderate there even as you pursue your pricing initiatives? Or is the expectation that we will continue to see that 3% to 5% volume decline in the commercial collection business as we go forward over the next 12 months? Goldman Sachs :  And just one last question for me on the collection volume side, it's been asked a couple of different ways but had a little bit of a follow-up there. So as I look at the last four quarters I think specifically that commercial collection volume number has been down 3% to 5%. So the fourth quarter of \u201814 would really be the first quarter where we are going to be comping material volume decline in that segment. So how are you guys thinking about commercial collection volumes going forward? Is the expectation that you should see the volume erosion moderate there even as you pursue your pricing initiatives? Or is the expectation that we will continue to see that 3% to 5% volume decline in the commercial collection business as we go forward over the next 12 months? David Steiner : Yes, and again look it would be very easy for me to sit here and say to you all we are going to see that commercial volume turn positive we could do that tomorrow, the problem is in order to do that we have got to put a lot of feet on the street, take a lot of business from a lot of people, and we all know what\u2019s going to happen to the competitive dynamic if we do that. And so we are taking a little bit more of a measured approach towards the commercial business, and that is let\u2019s make sure that we get our fair share of growth and let\u2019s make sure that we don\u2019t lose our customers that we can reduce the churn rate. And if we can do that we can get volumes without upsetting the competitive dynamic, now that means that the turn in commercial volumes is slower than it would be if we put a 1000 sales people on the street and started trying to upset competitive market dynamics. But I would absolutely believe that we are going to see that trend I would be disappointed if we see that trend coming out of 2015, still at the negative 5%. We haven\u2019t put pencil to paper to see do we believe it\u2019s going to go below that negative 3% but I certainly expect the trend line on that to be positive throughout 2015. Operator :  Your next question is from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar. Barbara Noverini :  Can you just give us a quick reminder of how the organizational structure of the recycling business might have changed as a result of your restructuring actions, how is the field and corporate level responsibility for the business shifted, and where does recycling fit into these lines of sight that you have described? Is it a more integrated way of managing the business than it might have been pre-2012? Morningstar:  Can you just give us a quick reminder of how the organizational structure of the recycling business might have changed as a result of your restructuring actions, how is the field and corporate level responsibility for the business shifted, and where does recycling fit into these lines of sight that you have described? Is it a more integrated way of managing the business than it might have been pre-2012? David Steiner :  Yes, so what we did with the recycling operations is right now I think we all know that the biggest challenge in our recycling operations is an operational challenge. How do we make sure that we continue to make money when we are getting contaminated load. So what we did with recycling was we didn\u2019t do anything at the field level the responsibility of the field level didn\u2019t change. At the corporate level we said this is really a process improvement organization that we have here at the corporate level. And so let\u2019s run it like that. And so we took our recycling operations and we basically put them under the gentlemen Puneet Bhasin who is running our operating programs. So whether it is driving efficiency in our routing system or driving efficiency in our recycling plants they are both about driving efficiency. And so we basically took that operating portion and put it under our operating officer. The ultimate responsibility remained in the field, the ultimate responsibility for the profitability of that recycling facility remained down the field. Operator :  We will now turn the call over to our CEO, David Steiner for closing comments. David Steiner :  Thank you all for joining us. Just as in Houston we are starting to see the good weather from a weather point of view, we are starting to see very good weather from our business point of view. I would tell you that given the state of our business and given the way that we have aligned our organization I think everybody in our company is more optimistic about 2015 than we have been in many years. So we look forward to having you all on our fourth quarter conference call where we will tell you about our expectations for 2015. Thank you.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2014 was a very good year for us. Our primary goals for the year were to continue to drive core price and focus on cost controls to drive growth in earnings, margins and free cash flow. We exceeded all of our goals, and we expect the momentum that we created to carry over into 2015. In 2014, we achieved our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. And our traditional solid waste business grew income operation and operating EBITDA, and expanded margins in both of these measures. For the full year of 2014, we achieved earnings per share of $2.48 and had total free cash flow of $3.4 billion. If we adjust free cash flow for divestiture proceeds and an approximate $210 million overpayment of taxes, we produced approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow. During 2014, we set the stage for increasing shareholder value by selling our Wheelabrator operations and operations in Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada for proceeds of about $2 billion. Those assets, primarily Wheelabrator, accounted for about $0.18 of earnings per share and $231 million of operating EBITDA in 2014. In 2015, we expect to be able to enter into acquisition agreement to replace most, if not all, of that amount. However, we will be disciplined in our approach to buying an asset. We want to buy assets that fit within our business at prices that are accretive to our current trading multiple. We believe that by being patient and disciplined we can replace the divested operating EBITDA at a multiple of about seven times, which would leave us about $400 million of proceeds from our Wheelabrator divestiture to apply the share buybacks or other accretive tuck-in acquisitions. Combined with our strong operating free cash flow, we believe that we can apply significant cash to both of these areas, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Although we believe that we will identify acquisition targets by midyear, given timing uncertainty of both negotiations and any necessary regulatory approvals, our guidance assumes that we will not close any acquisitions in 2015, other than the previously announced acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal and our normal tuck-in acquisitions. We will also hold off on any significant share repurchases until we get a better feel for which acquisitions we'll be able to close and at what price. We would expect that by midyear, we'll be in a good position to begin to buy back shares, and we would expect to buy back enough shares to at least offset any 2015 dilution. Of course, we'll buy back more if we cannot identify attractive acquisition targets at reasonable prices. Turning back to our operations. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. At the beginning of 2014, we expected yields to be approximately 2% for the full year, and we exceeded that target. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4%, with yields of 2.3%. We've now seen seven consecutive quarters with yield of 2% or greater. Each of our lines of business had positive yield for the full year, with the exception of landfill C&D. For the full year, core price in the commercial line of business was 6.2%; industrial was 8.1%; and we saw 1.8% in landfills. This has had some effect on volumes, but we continue to see the tradeoff as positive, as the operating margin in our traditional solid waste business was up 130 basis points. Our pricing team in areas have done a fantastic job, and they have plans in place to continue that success in 2015. For 2015, we expect that internal revenue growth from yield should again be 2% or more and for core price to be about 3.8%. Core price is more representative of our pricing activities because yield includes geographic and waste stream mix. Ultimately, we're focused on using price to drive dollars to our bottom line and core price best estimates the bottom-line impact of pricing. At 3.8% or higher, core pricing will once again drive margin expansion in 2015. As for volumes, we're starting to see some underlying positive trends. For the full year, our volume was a negative 1.4%, right about where we expected it to be. However, since the fourth quarter of 2013, we've seen a sequential improvement in volumes, culminating with the fourth quarter being the best volume quarter of 2014 at negative 0.8%. We also saw volumes in every line of business improve sequentially from the third quarter of 2014. We certainly are encouraged to see movements in the right direction. For instance, volume losses in both commercial yards and residential owned service gradually improved during 2014. While we're not ready to say that 2015 will have positive volumes, we do see improvement in 2015 such that volume should be between a negative 0.5% and flat for the full year. Of course, as recent storms on the East Coast demonstrate, our first quarter volumes can be affected by weather, but underlying trends have improved. So the price and volume trade-off continues to be very positive for the full year as the company's income from operations grew more than 10% and our income from operations margin grew 190 basis points. In addition, operating EBITDA increased 4% and operating EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points to 25.9%. We achieved those results despite a negative $0.02 per share impact to 2014 EPS from foreign currency translation, due to the impact of the strengthening dollar on our Canadian operations. On the recycling front, our operations performed well in the face of declining commodity prices. For the full year, our recycling line of business increased about $0.03 per share when compared to 2013. This improvement was driven by better operating cost performance, offsetting a more than 5% decline in OCC prices. Our managers did a great job managing their rebates and costs, as commodity prices declined throughout the year. Until recently, we had expected our recycling operations to remain flat in 2015. However, the recent slowdown in Western U.S. ports has had a dramatic effect on the movement of commodities overseas. We would join with others to encourage the federal government to take a more active role in the slowdown, which is not only having an effect on commodity prices, but on the entire U.S. economy. Lower demand out of China has also affected commodity prices. In the last few weeks, we've seen another drop in commodity prices such that we now expect recycling to have a negative effect on 2015 earnings of between $0.03 and $0.05 per share. That assumes that we do not see another drop in commodity prices, and given current uncertainty in the market, that's certainly possible. In the face of weaker commodity prices, we must continue to take actions to ensure the viability of recycling over the long-term. Jim will talk about some of the specific actions to improve our recycling operations. Turning to free cash flow. Our 2014 guidance was $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, and we generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in 2014. However, we had two fourth quarter events that we would adjust out to get a more normalized free cash flow number. First was our sale of Wheelabrator; second, we overpaid about $210 million of 2014 cash taxes that will directly reduce 2015 cash tax requirements. Jim will go into more detail, but absent these actions, 2014 free cash flow would have been about $1.4 billion. We expect that free cash flow will once again be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion in 2015, as we continue to focus on disciplined capital spending and driving earnings growth in our core business. Cash flow could be even higher if we're able to close any acquisitions to replace our Wheelabrator EBITDA, other than Deffenbaugh. So 2015 will be a transition year in which we continue our pricing and cost efforts, while focusing on redeploying our Wheelabrator proceeds. Nevertheless, our guidance of full year adjusted EPS of between $2.48 and $2.55 represents an increase of between 8% and 11% when 2014 is adjusted for divestiture earnings, which is in line with our long-term target for EPS growth of between 8% and 12%. Free cash flow is expected to be robust. And our redeployment of Wheelabrator proceeds will set the stage for accelerated earnings and free cash flow growth in 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2015 outlook in more detail. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, David. I will review the results for the fourth quarter and expectations for 2015. First, SG&A cost discipline has been a major focus for the company in the past year. At the beginning of 2014, we expected that SG&A dollars would be flat when compared to 2013 and that SG&A margin would improve. The results for SG&A in 2014 were better than we expected. I'm pleased with the overall results as SG&A costs for the full year improved almost $40 million to $1.43 billion and improved as a percent of revenue by 30 basis points to 10.2%. For the fourth quarter, SG&A costs were $376 million, essentially flat compared to 2013. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs rose 20 basis points to 10.9%. In the fourth quarter, we saw approximately $18 million in SG&A savings from our third quarter restructuring. These savings were offset by increases to long-term incentive compensation accruals and certain legal settlements. These settlements not only affected SG&A, but they also reduced free cash flow by almost $30 million. Without these accruals, SG&A expense as a percent of revenue would have been 10.3% in the fourth quarter. Based on preliminary information, for January we saw SG&A expenses improve $10 million when compared to January of 2014 on a base of $124 million. This is a good start to the year. And for 2015, we anticipate saving $60 million from the restructuring and thus we expect SG&A as a percent of revenue to be below 10% for the full year. Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow. Without the divestitures and overpayment of cash taxes that David mentioned, free cash flow would have been about $1.4 billion. The $210 million of tax overpayments is composed of two parts. First, because passage of the tax extenders legislation was after our fourth quarter estimated tax payment had been made, the approximately $60 million cash tax benefit of bonus depreciation was not reflected in our cash tax calculations for 2014. The $60 million will result in a cash tax reduction in 2015. The remaining $150 million of overpayment relates to comparing our actual tax provision to the payments made throughout the year. Our estimates changed late in the year because of the close date of the Wheelabrator transaction and the impacts from impairments. Therefore, we ended the year in an overpaid position. This will be a free cash flow benefit in 2015, but will be largely offset by free cash flow from divested operations. For the fourth quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders through our dividend. For the full year 2014, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders, consisting of $693 million in dividends and share repurchases of $600 million. Our board has indicated its intention to increase dividends in 2015 by 2.7% to $1.54 per share on an annual basis. This is the 12th consecutive year of increasing the dividend. For 2015, our anticipated annual dividends will result in approximately $700 million being returned to our shareholders. We also have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase $1 billion of our shares. However as David mentioned, our preference is to replace the divested operating EBITDA from Wheelabrator at attractive multiples before we repurchase shares. We believe we can accomplish this in 2015. At a minimum however, we would expect to be in the market repurchasing shares in the back half of the year to offset dilution. During 2015, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion and free cash flow in 2015 is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 3.9% and yield was 2%, with volumes declining 0.8% for an organic revenue growth of 1.2%. This led to total company income from operations growing $54 million, operating income margin expanding 190 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $34 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of the price/volume tradeoff. Our commercial core price was 6% with yield of 3.9%. Our industrial core price was 8% with yield of 3.7%. And residential achieved 2.1% core price and 1.1% yield. Overall, collection core price was 5.1% and yield was 2.8%, with volumes declining 2.5%. The volume change was 110-basis-point improvement from the third quarter. This core price and volume led to income from operations growing $16 million and margin expanding 130 basis points. In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter, just as we have all year. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year for the eighth consecutive quarter, up 1.3% from Q4 of 2013. This also was the highest fourth quarter MSW rate that we've seen since 1998. Total landfill volumes increased 6.4%. Combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes were a positive 8.9%. MSW volumes grew by 6.5% and C&D volume grew 17.7%. This led to income from operations growing $13 million, which is the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. Margins grew 80 basis points. Turning to recycling. As David mentioned, we need to further our current actions to ensure the long-term viability of recycling. When we look at recycling, we look at three phases : inbound product, processing, and outbound product. With respect to inbound product, we will be more aggressive in setting contractual limitations on contamination levels and impose contractual remedies for contamination in excess of such limitations. Contamination above 10% leaves to higher processing costs, and we need to continue to get assurances from our customers that they will either give us clean material or compensate us for higher processing costs. This will ensure that we only pay a rebate for the net volumes produced and not pay our customers for residue. Glass has always been a difficult commodity to recycle and an economic challenge. Unlike other recycled materials, recycled glass must compete with an abundant supply of virgin materials. As a result, glass recycling does not provide the same environmental benefits to the society and it's always been financially challenging for recyclers. In addition, glass is difficult to handle, hard on equipment, and as of today, only one company takes recycled glass for MRFs, so our options are significantly limited. With most commodities, we get paid to deliver recycled materials. Glass is the only commodity where we aren't paid for the outbound product. We actually have to pay to send it to a processor. We certainly recognize that our cities and communities want to divert glass because it is the second largest recyclable by weight. But given the many challenges associated with glass, we need to charge extra if a customer wants to recycle. Next, with respect to processing costs, we need to take a stronger stance to ensure that we recover our full processing costs. Processing costs increased due to circumstances beyond our control like the Chinese Green Fence. We need to recover those costs. So as we've said in the past, our strategy in pricing our recycle business is to recover our processing costs before we split the commodity value. Our contracts will also contain force majeure language to cover increases in processing costs beyond our control, and if our processing costs are higher than the commodity values, our customers will have to pay for the difference. With respect to outbound volumes, we need to ensure that our customers are paid their rebates based upon the rate we receive per tons sold and not on an indexed price that may or may not reflect reality. Finally, we need force majeure language for issues like the current port slowdown that can affect prices for commodities. These actions will support the long-term financial viability of recycling, which will not only benefit Waste Management, but will also benefit the environment and our customers by motivating us to continue investing in our recycling assets. Moving now to operating expenses. These expenses improved by $97 million in the fourth quarter and $110 million for the full year. For the full year, $50.5 million of savings were for costs associated with recently divested businesses. On a component cost basis, fuel costs for the year improved by $47 million. As fuel surcharge levels declined with diesel prices, it will have a dampening impact on revenue, but will continue to benefit margins. As a percent of revenue, operating expenses in the fourth quarter improved 170 basis points to 63.1%. For the full year, operating expenses as a percent of revenue improved 90 basis points to 64.3%. In 2014, our focus on improving operating costs saw significant traction, and we expect that improvement to continue into 2015. Finally, looking at our financial metrics. At the end of the fourth quarter, our weighted average cost of debt was 4.91%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 9% at the end of the quarter. The decline in the floating rate portion of our debt from the third quarter relates to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Lastly, in January, we redeemed three series of senior notes with a weighted average coupon rate of 7% and paid the related make-whole premium. We used proceeds from the Wheelabrator divestiture to fund this transaction, pending consideration of potential debt refinancing options. The reported effective tax rate was approximately 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 23.6% for the full year. The rates were lower than our expected rate of 35%, primarily due to the tax implications of divestitures. The tax benefit from divestitures is removed from our as adjusted results. We did include in our as adjusted earnings per share a $0.02 per share tax benefit from adjustments to accruals and related deferred taxes and audit settlements. Adjusting a recorded rate for such items would have resulted in a rate of approximately 33%. In conclusion, 2014 was a very good year for Waste Management, as our employees did a great job of focusing on pricing, cost and cost controls. And for that, I want to say thank you. We were also able to successfully divest several operations in the year, which serves to both refocus the company on the core business and generate significant proceeds. As David mentioned, we will look to put those proceeds to work in 2015 with the intention of replacing the Wheelabrator operating EBITDA by early 2016. We're excited for continued growth in 2015 and look to accelerate that growth into 2016 and beyond. And with that, Janisha, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Alex. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: On the cost saves, you talked about $60 million benefit on the SG&A line. Is there any target for the cost of goods line for 2015 and expected cost saves from the cost initiatives you have in place right now? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the cost of goods sold line, we certainly have seen an improvement in that line as we've taken some aggressive steps, but I don't have an exact number for you there, Alex. I think we can get something to you though. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But the key, Alex, is that as we manage those rebates better, our cost of goods sold as a percent of the commodity price that we achieve continues to improve. And so, we would expect that to continue to improve in 2015. As Jim said, we got to take some steps to really fix the recycling business because if you look at not just at Waste Management, but across the entire recycling industry, you're seeing a divestment in recycling assets. And so, for the benefit not just of Waste Management, but I think for the viability of recycling in the United States, we have to have some core fundamental changes that Jim described to make the business long-term viable. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Makes sense, David. And on the Deffenbaugh acquisition, can you say when you expect that to close? And what you expect the contribution should be to the 2015 earnings number? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. We'll give the contribution number once we actually close it. And we would expect to be able to close it likely within the next 30 days. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thank you. I'll turn it over. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Joe. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So Jim, thanks for the rundown on the recycling business. I guess I'm just curious what your guys' views are on the market. If you look a couple years out, let's say hypothetically, commodity prices remain at this low level. I know a lot of operators are kind of intermingled with their businesses. So if you start to see guys really struggle in the recycling space, what is this space look like a couple years from now and how does that impact you? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So Joe, as David mentioned in his script, I mean, we've done a good job of compensating for some of this price declines. In fact, he said that we just recently changed to this 3% to 5% negative guidance and that was because for the month of January, we felt pretty good about compensating for what was, at the time, about a $10 decline in pricing. We've seen an additional decline in February and hence the negative guidance for recycling. As far as what it looks like going forward, boy, we have not been real successful in projecting the outlook for recycling over years. So the only thing we can do to control that is take an aggressive stance on changing these contracts and then take a tough stance on cost control. Projecting the commodity price is something we haven't been very adept at. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Joe, again, look, the viability of recycling is, at its core, very simple. You sell the commodity for a certain price, right. In the past, what the industry has done is said we'll sell the commodity for a certain price and then whatever our processing cost is we'll be able to pocket the difference. The reality is as commodity prices have come down, you got instances where our processing cost is higher than what we are selling the commodity for. And so you can't have the business model where it says we'll sell the commodity, split the proceeds and hopefully cover our operating costs. The way we're changing the contracts is to say : look, we are going to recover our operating costs, whatever those might be and however those might be affected by things that we can't control like the Chinese Green Fence. So we're going to recover our processing costs. And if we're able to sell the commodity for more than our processing costs, then we'll split the proceeds with the customer. If our processing costs are higher than what we can sell the commodities for, we're going to have to charge our customers in order to recycle. And that's the only way that we can make recycling viable for the long-term. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Joe, we might add one other quick point and that's that the commodities that are being recycled over the long-term we think need to change. An example is the substantial city in Pennsylvania that just announced not recycling glass in the future. They recognize that the value of recycling the material is just not just positive. There's no real market for it, and they've decided not recycle glass. They made that announcement earlier this week. So that's a positive sign for us. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. I appreciate the color on that. Can you guys talk about your coal ash business, maybe how it's different versus some of your other peers? And then I've seen a couple of awards for coal ash to be shipped to some of your landfills. I'm just curious what the quoting pipeline looks like right now for coal ash? Are utilities starting to look at remediating old surface impoundments outside of South Carolina and North Carolina? Or is it still too soon to start thinking about that? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. It's really too soon. We need to really try to put numbers around the coal ash. But what I'd tell you, Joe, is that we saw this coming three years ago, two-and-a-half years ago when the regulations were first proposed and we've been out in front of customers trying to work on solutions ever since. And so, we're not new to the party here. We've been doing it for a long time. We've developed those customer relationships, and so we would expect to do \u2013 I mean, to the extent that there is revenue generated from the new coal ash regulations, we would expect to get more than our fair share. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for the color, guys. Take care. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Hey, good morning. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: First, I had more of a historical question. So you touched on the cost of ops. I'm not sure that I have a complete grasp of why the cost of ops was down so much. So I know that press release cites divestitures. I think Wheelabrator wasn't divested to the very end of the quarter. So could you just maybe elaborate a little bit on what drove the strong improvement in cost of ops both on a dollar basis and as a percent of revenue? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I think there were a couple things that drove the cost of operations down. First of all, we've taken a tough stance on \u2013 but the right stance to take on managing labor in operations. That will continue going forward. We've used some routing technology and that has started to bear some fruit. Additionally, of course, as everyone knows, fuel prices affect the cost of operations. And so while you see it coming off of the operating expense line, you'll also see it coming off the top line in the form of a fuel surcharge. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Corey, Jim Trevathan here. We're about halfway through at implementing our, what we call, service delivery optimization : the onboard computers that we put on all of our routed trucks and getting the value out of those through the routing tools that Jim mentioned. And the labor reductions, we've done a much better job recently at getting both labor and routes out as volume changes have occurred. And you see the results of that, in addition to fuel. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: So Jim or Jim then, if you look at the 2015 guidance, you said you expect SG&A to be below 10% of revenue. Can you get some sense of what cost of ops assumption is baked into the guidance? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Gosh, cost of operations, look, I think for 2015 operating costs, we expect that we will be able to continue the progress we've made in 2014. I don't see a big increase in OpEx as a percent of revenue. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, we would expect to see some modest improvement in costs as a percent of revenue. The big issue that we've got is volume, right. I mean, I think you all know that the ability to leverage costs from new commercial volumes is dramatic. We haven't seen commercial volumes turn positive. So we would expect to see some modest improvement in cost of operations as a percent of revenue, but we'll really see that improve as we start to see commercial volumes pick up in 2015 going through 2016. And then, we'd also expect to continue to see improvement in our operating costs at the recycling line. So we'll see some modest improvement in operating costs. As Jim said, we'll see some good improvement on SG&A. So we should see that 100 basis point plus improvement to margins next year. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Okay. Great. And then, David, to your point on volume, first of all, I think you made a comment about storms in the East. Does that suggest that we should be expecting a somewhat softer than the trend line on volume in Q1? And then, the comment you just made about lines improving on the commercial side. Does that suggest that you think overall volumes could go positive at some point during 2015 and then in 2016? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see at the back half of 2015 that we start to see the trend line turning positive from a volume point of view. Probably not till later in the year, but given what we've seen from the economy and housing starts, I wouldn't be surprised to see that at all coming out of 2015 and into 2016. With respect to the first quarter, no look, we see volume reports on a very frequent basis. You've seen a little bit of a drop-off in volumes, but as you know, sometimes those volumes bounce back real quickly in March because of the weather. So no, we're not trying to say that we will definitely see down volumes in the first quarter. But given what you all, particularly up on the East Coast, in Boston and other parts of the East Coast, what you're going through, we just wanted to make sure that everybody understands that you really can't judge the full year by first quarter volumes. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yes. Understood. Thank you. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Al. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: I just wanted to follow up on the volume question. It just strikes me as, I don't know if it's sending out a warning sign or what, but you guys are collecting trash, so I don't think, the weather has never stopped you before, so what's behind the comment, David? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There is absolutely nothing behind that comment, other than the fact that we say it every year, which is when you start to see the seasonal uptick from March through June, we'll get a real good feel for the prior question, which is will we see positive volumes in the back half of the year. But the only point we're making is that we're not going to make any assumptions on full year volumes based on the first quarter because the first quarter always has a weather impact. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. And then on the volume side again, just what's ticking higher better than your expectations? Because I would have thought the volume guidance range would have been a little bit wider than 50 basis points to flat. In other words, closer to the down 1% to flat. So what's ticking up for you? And obviously, it showed up in the fourth quarter as well. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Look, when we look across the various lines, let's take them one line at a time. On the commercial line, we're seeing net service increases improve. We're seeing pounds per yard improve. And I think we're seeing generally sort of overall economic improvement, whether it's new business starts or new housing starts. And so we've been waiting for the pick-up in commercial volumes for a long time. And I guess for the first time in the last three years, what I would say is we're pretty optimistic they're going to improve. Now, we're not going to try to say they're going to turn positive in 2015. But we haven't said in three years that we're pretty optimistic that they're going to improve in 2015. On the industrial line, again looking at the general economy, looking at housing starts, that's all good. A big part of our industrial line is our energy services, and I think everybody would acknowledge that energy services is a big question mark for 2015. But we've done a spectacular job in energy services of increasing our market share where we have assets. And so, we expect to see increased market share at least partially offset some of the volumes on the industrial line of business. So we're fairly positive there. On the residential side, we've lost a lot of residential contracts in the last few years, some of those intentionally, some of those not intentionally. And so the contracts that we wanted to lose on the residential side, we've basically gone through those. And so we should start to see some year-over-year at least a decline or an improvement in the rate of decline on the residential line. And then finally, looking at our national account business, again the national accounts that we wanted to lose, we've lost. We've got some, what I'd call, low-margin national accounts that we'll still look at in 2015, but we would expect our national account volume to begin to stabilize and grow toward the back half of 2015. So what I would say is that overall, we're very optimistic that we're going to see an improvement in volumes. Look, you're absolutely right about the 50 basis points. Is that a narrow range, yes, it's a narrow range. But what we really wanted to impart was that we're seeing volumes moving back closer to flat. And again going back to the prior question, we would expect them to actually start to turn positive toward the back half of the year. And so we gave that narrow range because we didn't want people to think they were going to turn positive, so you've got to start out with flat. And we wanted people to know that we think they're improving. So we didn't want to say negative 1%. So the point of going 50 basis points, I think it's a great question. The point is we wanted to impart that we're seeing improvement, but we're not ready quite yet to call positive volumes for 2015. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Al, I think the fact that a lot of that volume growth is coming on the collections side of the business highlights why it's so important on operating expense to really make sure that we continue with the efforts that Jim has put into place to really improve our operating expense as a percent of revenue, because as you know from 2014, really for us not a great year on collection volumes, a decent year on landfill volumes. But collection volumes come with a bit higher operating cost as a percent of revenue. So it is very important for us that we continue those efforts on the OpEx side. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: And that was, sorry Jim, that was to drive or recover collection volumes to gain the operating leverage, was that the point? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. As we see collection volumes start to improve, which was what we've seen with 110 basis point improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4, we need to make sure that we have all of the pieces in place operating-wise to control costs. Collection volumes have a higher operating cost, variable operating cost than do landfill volumes. So we feel good about going into 2015 with those pieces in place. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And finally, if I may, I don't know if I heard correctly what the benefit in Q4 was on fuel, but what maybe have you baked into 2015 whether that's a dollar volume or a dollar level or versus margin benefit? And then secondly in regards to that, how do you expect the competitors to react, particularly in the highly competitive markets, on this lower fuel price because isn't that simply an incentive for them to perhaps even lower price? So do you see that as a particular option? And then finally, I think, David, congratulations to you on this past weekend's performance. Thanks. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So setting aside that congratulations, let me address the \u2013 we beat you to it. Let me address the first question, Al. Look, as far as fuel goes \u2013 I mean, look, large price declines as we've seen recently, large price spikes, put us into an under-recovery or over-recovery position. Large price declines put us into an over-recovery position. But over time, our fuel surcharge program fully recovers cost increases for us. So for the most part, we're generally agnostic with respect to the price of fuel. In 2015, we expect there would be a slight benefit to margin, maybe 10 basis points from lower fuel cost. But for the most parts, we would expect that that fuel surcharge, which has a lag to it, will catch up and we'll be in kind of a full recovery position where we aren't over-recovering or under-recovering depending on the direction of fuel. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And to the competitive question, I think generally what we've seen in declining fuel markets is that the competition doesn't generally take that as an opportunity to go out and lower price. They take it as an opportunity to improve their bottom line. And the other part is that, for the most part, our largest competitors also have a fuel surcharge, so it shouldn't have any difference to them whatsoever. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you, David and Jim. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Jim, just at a very high level, can you just kind of bridge the $2.4 billion in pro forma operating cash flow to the midpoint here in 2015 to $2.7 billion? I mean, I'm just kind of looking for the big puts and takes. I mean, presumably, you've got a drag from commodities, FX, but then you do have some offsets with Deffenbaugh, the tuck-ins, internal growth, the cash taxes, et cetera. But just trying to help us understand the components of that $300 million? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. So as you said, there's going to be a number of pluses and minuses there. On the minus side, as we talked about, we've got some recycling challenges potentially. We have a little bit of added capital expenditures versus where we finished the year, mostly related to the big contracts coming on board. We have a year-over-year working capital hit from the fact that last year we accelerated bonus. But we also have some working capital pick-up as well : the fact that hopefully we won't have another big legal settlements this year. And we're making quite a bit of progress on working capital, as well on DSO and DPO. So on the plus side, we've got the restructuring impact. We have lower interest expense. We've got those working capital items. And then, really, at that point, you get to our core business, which includes the aggressive approach to cost control. It includes pricing. And so I think when you combine all of those, while there's a lot of kind of puts and takes, I think we feel comfortable with getting to the cash from operations growth figures. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And so of that $300 million, though, how much of it is this \u2013 the prepayment on the cash taxes? I mean, is that effectively a $200 million benefit in 2015? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : $210 million. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Good. And then on CapEx, how does that break down between maintenance and growth? And then can you break it down between trucks, landfill development, containers, et cetera, et cetera? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, I mean, on the first question, maintenance and growth, probably, Jim, I would guess, $900 million. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : In both fleet and in landfills, approximately $900 million, $950 million split relatively equally, Tyler, with collection. We're moving it forward slightly versus the last three years. But on average, we bought about 1,000, a little over 1,000 trucks the last three years. And in 2015, we'll buy 1,020 trucks. So the plan moving forward roughly evenly split... James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. And then, I think in the press release you guys noted that you would do a normal pace of tuck-ins. What exactly is that? I mean, how much are you looking to deploy there on that this would be excluding Deffenbaugh? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I mean, excluding kind of use of proceeds for Wheelabrator, it's typically between $100 million and $200 million. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions this morning. Nice end to the 2014. On recycling, just so I understand all the data you're sharing with us on your guidance, giving the negative $0.03 to $0.05, but there's an offset. And if I look at the offset you recorded in \u2013 and the offset you trying to run the business better that you recorded in the fourth quarter, down about proportionally the same in 4Q as we are sort of going into 2015. So am I right in you've got about $0.12 you're trying to drive savings \u2013 or I mean, sorry, there's $0.12 of loss from paper and there's $0.07 to $0.09 of savings that you're trying to drive. So the question is how much more do you have to play in that sort of $0.07 to $0.09 range to work with going forward? If we're structurally in a long-term low paper price environment, and we got a long tail on the solution \u2013 I get you're working on the solution. But how much more do you have to play with in driving incremental improvements? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I guess, Michael, when I look at this on a blended basis, so I'm not breaking it out, my answer won't be on a OCC versus plastics versus other commodities. But on a blended basis, we finished the year 2014 at $98, and we saw a January drop about $10, so to $89 and that impacts us on the 6 million tons that we actually pick up and take to our MRFs, about $60 million in revenue, which equates to somewhere in that $0.03 to $0.05 range on the EPS line. We think in January, the cost control that we put into place fully compensated for that which is why we were prepared to come on a call and say we thought it'd be flat. And then with the February decline, we just have not been able to put the more stringent contract changes and cost controls in place yet. So can we do that? That is our plan. But at this point we're trying to be a little conservative because of the kind of the falling knife here, so to speak. So we think there's probably $0.03 to $0.05 in the $80 number, which is where we may finish the month of February in that blended rate. If things go to heck from there and fall to $60, then I think all bets are off with respect to that $0.03 to $0.05. But right now, we feel good about the contract changes that I went through in detail in my script. We feel good about the cost controls that we put into place, not only in January, but in all of 2014. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. If the port strike \u2013 and I know this is a tough one because too much guessing I suppose. But if the port strike ends, say at the end of this month, lots of things can change quickly. But how long does it \u2013 excuse me, if the port strike is prolonged, how long can it go before you miss the seasonal uptick, in your mind? Like if it runs into March, even to the middle of March, have we just missed the seasonal window because Asia has to find a source of paper and they go looking elsewhere? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. A couple things, Michael, first of all, it's difficult to disaggregate the effect of the port strike into its component parts in that $0.03 to $0.05. So it's tough to tell. There are a couple of different moving parts. There's a weaker Chinese economy. There's quality issues with outbound product. And there is, of course, the port strike. One of the concerns we have, honestly, about the port strike is that there's a lot of products sitting idle at this point. When that does eventually get resolved, all that product ends up out on the market, which could have a dampening effect on commodity pricing. So I didn't do a very good job of answering kind of your seasonal uptick question there, and I'm not sure I know how to answer that because it's hard to predict what's going to happen with the port strike. It's also hard to separate the port strike in that $0.03 to $0.05 negative guidance that we gave you because there's a couple of different moving parts. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Michael. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hi, David. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Back when we saw the energy price drop, I heard an oil man say something that I thought was a pretty good quote. He said nothing solves low energy prices like low energy prices because, at some point in time, the market stabilizes and you find equilibrium. And I would say nothing solves low commodity prices like low commodity prices. I mean, you're seeing a pretty stark disinvestment in recycling assets. And you're seeing a lot of the smaller players starting to close up shop. That gives us a great opportunity to restructure the recycling business, to restructure it to where we can make a guaranteed return every year, which means we can invest in recycling assets. Look, we cannot invest in recycling assets in a situation like what you and Jim were just talking about, where nobody has any idea where commodity prices are going. And so, we're going to use the opportunity to make sure that we restructure our business such that we can make it profitable come hell or high water. And so, that's really where our focus is, is driving out the operating cost that we can today and then reorganizing the business and only bidding contracts that follow our statement of how we need to make a profitable business out of recycling. We're just not going to sign contracts that put so much risk of commodity prices on our back. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. And I get that. I saw that, what you did with Philadelphia. Foreign exchange was $0.02 in 2014. It's about the same change year-over-year. So thinking it's about $0.02 in 2015, that's the right way to think about it? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm not sure I'd give it $0.02 in 2015. Again, kind of hard to predict what the dollar will do versus the Canadian dollar, but we didn't put anything in for foreign currency impact in 2015. So I would say, it's flat. If we do have an impact, then... David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll find another way to overcome it. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...we'll find a way to overcome it. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then, Jim, you said that you paid down some debt in January. Just so we get the right sort of run rate on the interest expense either based on that revised total debt, can you talk about what you think the interest expense number is? Or tell me what the total debt number is, I'll work backwards into it myself? But what am I looking at starting in January, now that you paid down more debt? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So cash interest decreased by $17 million in 2014 and that was due largely to a couple things, first of all, the Q2 recycling of the $350 million senior notes. We also had some tax exemplary marketings that came in at lower rates. And then of course in January, we made whole those three senior notes with a weighted average coupon of 7%. So what will the interest rate be? It's kind of yet to be determined on what the rates will be on the refinancing. And the cash impact is our cost of debt is coming down. Wouldn't surprise me if the cash impact is similar to 2014. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. And then when you frame Wheelabrator, are you going to either provide restated numbers on a quarterly basis, so we know what it looks like year-over-year comparing without it? Or can you at least tell us what was the revenue number that I should be pulling out of my quarters or at least for the full year in 2015? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, the supplemental schedule that came out pretty much is all. It's divested operations. But for the most part, it's Wheelabrator. So revenue \u2013 the way we've adjusted out to kind of get you to an apple-to-apples is $852 million. Now that's Wheelabrator plus Puerto Rico and the Maritimes, but largely Wheelabrator. And then adjusting out $231 million in EBITDA, $220 million of that was Wheelabrator. So again, largely on every one of those metrics on that schedule, it's for the most part a Wheelabrator adjustment. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think, Michael, I think last quarter we mentioned when we announced the divestiture, we mentioned that, obviously, Wheelabrator, the $0.18 that's coming out of earnings doesn't come out equal every quarter. I think we mentioned last quarter that electricity prices last year in the first quarter were very high. So there was \u2013 I think it was $0.05 of earnings per share from Wheelabrator in the first quarter of last year. And so it won't come out equally every quarter. It'll come out a little bit more weighted toward the first quarter than the other quarters. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. And then cash taxes paid in 2014? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Cash taxes in 2014? Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Let's see here. Cash taxes in 2014, $763 million, and then we expect 2015 cash taxes to be about $517 million, something like that. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. And that delta on the one, well actually the whole $210 million, that's I mean, if we don't get another extension bonus accretion, that doesn't repeat, and then the $150 million is all about having done divestments. So that's a one-time. Those are both one-time events, right? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's right. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then special waste activity, are you seeing volumes that would indicate that non-residential construction may be starting to percolate in a positive direction? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. We've seen special waste volume pretty strong all year. And I think it really is the untold story of the lower energy prices. It started out with natural gas and then it's moved to oil. You've seen a lot of construction projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast where we have great positioned assets. And so you've seen great strength in it in 2014. We'd expect that to continue in 2015. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then I'm surprised you haven't been asked it yet, David, but the price gate for 2015. So you had a different type of bonusing program for the last couple years. What are you doing differently in 2015? And can you share some of the hurdles that you've set for bonuses and how the bonus accrual would work in 2015? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. It's a great question, Michael. As I've said before, you've got two options with the pricing gate. You can either \u2013 well, you can do nothing, but doing nothing for us is not an option. So you've got the opportunity to do the carrot or the stick. The last two years, we had a pretty big carrot out there, where we said if you can get over 2% yield, we're going to basically pay the 2012 bonus that everybody missed out on because we didn't do pricing very well in 2012. And so, in 2015, we'll go back. I hate to use the word, but we'll go back more toward the stick side. We've paid out those bonuses. Everybody is very happy, but that doesn't mean that you can now sit back and rest on your laurels. And so, we'll go back to a price gate where everybody \u2013 we basically give a target to every area, and every area has got to meet their price target. And if they don't meet their price target, we can adjust their bonus by up to 50%. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And will the gate this year include both a landfill driver and a collection? Or it doesn't matter how they get it? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. When we do it, we basically go to back to what I talked about before, core price, right. Look, the reality is as you know, we've been putting a lot of emphasis on landfill pricing, and we'll continue to put an emphasis on landfill pricing. But from a bonus point of view, what we're really looking for is dollars to the bottom line. And so one market might be able to drive that with the landfill, another market might be able to drive it through industrial, and another market might be able to drive it through their commercial business, another one might have to look to their franchise business to drive it. And so there's as many ways to drive it as there are lines of business. We just want to make sure that they get the total dollars to the bottom line. But I can promise you that from a management focus point of view, we've got a lot of management focus on the landfill line. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Michael, Jim Trevathan. I would tell you though that Dave's exactly right that they can get it in any line of business. However, the targets are comparable to last year by area, and they can't get it unless they hit all lines of business. They can't totally load up on one as opposed to touching all of the lines of business. So I think you'll see it come in just about the same as last year, as 2014. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. Great. And then Jim Fish, on cash flow from ops, you finished 2014 at $2.331 billion. If I'm understanding the comments that were made earlier, I can take $90 million and say that's a permanent change on a year-over-year basis and $210 million is a one-time. And so looking sort of modeling out multi-year cash flow from ops, I'm not going from 16.5% to 20% of revs. I'm still, 16.5% is improving by about $90 million to maybe 17%. But I'm making improvement, but that's the way to think about it, right? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I think that's right. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey look, Michael, I think the piece that you wrote hit the nail right on the head. We're going to see good cash flow improvement. We'll start to see great cash flow improvement when we get the recycling business straightened out. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : One last answer for you that you asked initially was revenue for Wheelabrator, revenue for Wheelabrator $817 million of that $852 million that we show on the schedule. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you so much and good luck in 2015. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial. Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : I just wanted to be clear on the comments regarding the thoughts on replacing the Wheelabrator or the lost business in general at seven times multiple. Firstly, should we be assuming that \u2013 what should we be assuming for share repurchase in your 2015 guidance, should I say? And then the seven times multiple you expect to pay, is that strictly on the solid waste side of the business? Or maybe a little update with regard to your interest in energy waste and additional color regarding your assumptions there. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So for the share repurchase, you can assume that we offset dilution, but that we're going to do it in the back half of the year. So obviously, there will be a little bit of an earnings effect because you're not replacing dilution right at the beginning of the year. And so, we would expect to do share repurchases to offset dilution. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And as far as energy services goes, look, there's two things going on with energy services right now. On the price side, and I think you may have heard that from some of the other calls earlier or last week I guess, on the price side, we're working with E&P companies on addressing their price concession requests. We'll see where that ends up. On the volume side, we do expect to see a slowdown in drilling. I guess the good news is though that it seems to be hitting the big three the hardest, those being Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford. And we have no exposure in Permian and limited exposure in Bakken and Eagle Ford. So it's also important to understand that our energy services business, while it's a great business for us, is still small as a percentage of our overall business. And while we will feel some price and volume pressures there in 2015, I think we'll be able to make up that in the other parts of our manufacturing and industrial business such as coal ash and petrochemical plant production, things like that. Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Got it. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And then, Scott, to the question of the replacement of the EBITDA, the acquisitions that we do will be core solid waste or very closely related to core solid waste. So we feel pretty comfortable that we can look at those type of acquisitions and understand exactly what kind of synergies we're going to get out of those, right. And so what we've always said is that we're not going to go out and pay a higher multiple than what we're trading at. If I'm going to buy something at the multiple we're trading at, and we've always used sort of the long-term 8.5 times EBITDA, I'd rather buy back our own stock than buying a business I don't know. And so, post synergies, we'd expect those type of acquisitions to, on the high end, come in at sort of the 7 to 8 times EBITDA, and on the low end, come in at sort of the 5 to 6 times EBITDA. So somewhere between, I would say generally when we're looking to replace the Wheelabrator divested EBITDA, I would say that generally, we're looking at larger acquisitions which trade a little bit higher than normal tuck-in acquisitions. So I would say that the EBITDA there is going to be somewhere between 6 and 8 times. We used 7 for our assumption, and that assumption is made at least to us being able to replace the full amount of Wheelabrator EBITDA and still have a significant amount of cash proceeds left. Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Right. So to be clear, you do see enough within the pipeline of that larger acquisition type you're talking within core solid waste to assign a high probability to your chances of replacing the bulk of that, with good visibility, by the middle of the year? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I would say \u2013 I wouldn't put high probability on it quite yet. I think by midyear we'll know if there's a high probability. We've got some good acquisition candidates, but we've got to make sure that we can do a deal that works for both of them and for us. And so we've talked to a few larger acquisition targets that it seems like we're on the same page. We've talked to at least one where we're not on the same page, where they wanted more like 11 to 12 times EBITDA. And we basically said look, we've got two choices. We can either buy your business at 11 to 12 times EBITDA or we can go in and buy smaller businesses that mirror your geographic footprint and we could go in and do that. And so we're not going to pay 11 to 12 times EBITDA. We'd rather go out and buy smaller \u2013 in that geographic area, we'd rather buy smaller companies. So we do think there's some targets, but before I say that I'm confident, we can replace the Wheelabrator EBITDA, we want to make sure that we're on the same page from a valuation point of view. And like we said, we should have a very good feel for that by midyear. Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Okay. We'll stay tuned. Thanks. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini of Morningstar. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research : Hey. Good morning, everybody. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research : When analyzing the acquisition landscape, can you give us a general sense for the health of the recycling operations of tuck-in candidates that are similar in size to a Deffenbaugh, for instance. So if these businesses come with existing recycling contracts that are unattractive from a rebate standpoint, let's say, do you have to wait for these contracts to be rebid? Or can you improve the recycling economics of these tuck-ins immediately, despite instituting some of the costs control you've talked about today? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Generally, frankly, the acquisitions that we're looking at really don't have a recycling component associated with them. And quite honestly, if they did have a recycling component associated with them, we're either going to pay very little for it or we're actually going to subtract from it. I think you hit the nail right on the head. If they have bad recycling contracts that they can't get out of, we're just not going to pay them for it. Or we might even reduce the price because of those recycling contracts. So when we look at the acquisition candidate, what we're going to is we're going to pay for the business that we know. We're going to pay for the business that we can very easily find out what kind of synergies we get. And then we're not going to pay for the businesses where we don't have the synergies. But you're also correct that if they did have a recycling component, there's plenty of places where geographically we can then consolidate with our facilities. So what I would say as a quick summation is that most of the assets that we're looking at buying don't have a strong residential recycling component to them. To the extent that they do, we would take that into account in connection with the value we pay for the business. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research : Got it. That's helpful. And then, what is your appetite for acquisitions within energy services? So you had mentioned increasing market share, so are you looking at this area in particular to deploy some of the Wheelabrator proceeds? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. We're probably looking at it a lot harder at $80 oil then $50 oil. But look, over the long-term, I think that's going to be a very good business. If we could get assets in that line of business at the right price, we would certainly look at doing that. But I would tell you that the right price today is not what the right price was six months ago. And so, it would have to be something where we would feel fairly confident that over the long-term, we could make the business profitable. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research : Got it. Thanks and great job this year. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you all for joining our earnings call. As you can see, our team here at corporate and our team out in the field created some great momentum in 2014. We fully expect that to continue through 2015. And as we replace the Wheelabrator EBITDA in 2015, we're going to accelerate that growth into 2016. So thank you all and we'll talk to you soon.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Egl, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Egl. You may begin your conference. Edward Egl : Thank you, Tanisha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Fish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Trevathan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedule for the press release included important information. During the call, you will hear our forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. David and Jim will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which, unless otherwise stated, more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume. Additionally, any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the first quarter of 2014. For comparative purposes, our first quarter of 2014 results have been adjusted to exclude certain amounts attributed to divested operations. Please see the tables attached to our press release for additional information. During the call, David and Jim will discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS or earnings per share. David and Jim will also address operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin as defined in the earnings press release in the Form 8-K filed today. EPS, effective tax rate, income from operations, income from operations margin, operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin, operating cost, operating cost as a percent of revenue, SG&A and SG&A cost as a percent of revenue results discussed during the call have been adjusted and EPS projections are anticipated to be adjusted to exclude items that management believes do not reflect the fundamental business performance or are not indicative of our results of operations. These measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release footnote and the schedule for the Form 8-K filed today, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner. David Steiner : Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. We're very pleased that we earned $0.49 per share in the first quarter, an increase of almost 9% from our 2014 first quarter results, when adjusted to exclude the earnings from divested businesses and assets. Our EPS increased despite $0.03 of year-over-year headwinds from lower recycling commodity prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuation. Our field and corporate teams overcame those headwinds through continued improvement in our pricing and cost control programs. This led to growth in income from operations, operating EBITDA, margin and free cash flow and marked a strong start to 2015. These results were in line with our internal expectations and we expect to see continued improvement as we progress throughout the year.  During the first quarter, we reinvested a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our waste-to-energy business. We completed the acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal at a pre-synergy operating EBITDA multiple of just under 8. Once fully integrated, the acquisition should add about $52 million of annual operating EBITDA. On the acquisition front, we continue to have discussion with sellers, but will remain disciplined and not overpay for assets. If we cannot identify core businesses to acquire at reasonable prices, we'll buy the business that we know the best, ours, by doing a share buyback. Even if we do identify acquisition targets at reasonable prices, we will still purchase at least enough shares to offset dilution and we'll begin buying those shares in the second quarter. Turning back to our operations. Our pricing programs continue to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.4% and yield was 2%. We've now seen 8 consecutive quarters of yield at 2% or better. In the first quarter of 2015, each of our lines of business had positive yield. In the first quarter, we also saw core price improve 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 to the highest level that we've achieved. We also saw the highest core price ever in each of the commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business. Core price in the industrial line was 9.4%, 6.6% in the commercial line, 2.3% in our landfill line and 2.1% in our residential line. This is a tremendous accomplishment by our team in light of depressed CPI levels. So we continue to use core price to drive margin expansion. And in the first quarter, our traditional solid waste business income from operations margin increased 110 basis points and our operating EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points. Clearly, the trade-off of emphasizing core price over obtaining lower margin volume remains very positive for us.  Turning to volumes. Our traditional solid waste volumes declined 1.2% in the first quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 3.2% in 2014. We saw some very positive trends in our commercial and industrial lines of business. The losses in our commercial volumes improved 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 and industrial volume losses improved 520 basis points. Both the commercial and industrial lines of business saw the lowest rate of decline in 7 quarters. So the volume trends are very positive. The revenue trend was not as positive but it reflects the loss of low margin work that we intentionally shed. Total company volumes declined $95 million or 3% in the first quarter. The overall volume decline stems from a $51 million decline in national account contracts and residential business as we shed this low-margin business, consistent with our revenue strategy.  We also saw a $43 million decline in our commodity driven businesses, from lower recycling commodity sales driven by the West Coast port slowdown and to a lesser extent, lower landfill gas-to-energy sales. Consequently, although total volumes are down more than we expected, it's due primarily due to volumes in lower margin lines of business. While the volume trends in our most profitable lines of business are encouraging and we expect the positive momentum to improve as we see our normal seasonal upturn.  Our recycling operations resulted in a $0.02 decline in earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2014. This decline is due to the more than 14% drop in average commodity prices for the quarter and an 8% decline in volumes, associated with the slowdown in Western U.S. ports and contractual losses as we renegotiate contracts to include improved processing fee and rebate structures. On a positive note, we've seen our operating cost improve as we tighten our enforcement on contaminated loads and our capacity utilization is at the highest level that we've seen. However, the operational improvements have not been enough to offset the decline in commodity prices. So we will continue to look to improve operations and rationalize our recycling assets until we see the market improve. Given the continued weakness in overall recycling commodity prices and lower volumes, the full year impact from our recycling business is now anticipated to be closer to negative $0.10 per share when compared to 2014 versus our original outlook of between negative $0.03 and negative $0.05 per share. We also expect foreign currency translation to continue to be about a $0.01 per share headwind per quarter for the remainder of the year. So 2015 is off to a strong start and we have the momentum to achieve our full year goals of adjusted EPS of between $2.48 and $2.55 per share despite lower-than-expected recycling results and foreign currency translation headwinds. We also expect to achieve our full year free cash flow guidance of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. As we move through the second quarter and see the seasonal upturn, we expect to see continued improvement in our volumes. Combined with our focus on costs and pricing, this should lead to continued growth in earnings and free cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. James Fish : Thanks, David. During the first quarter of 2015, we decided to refinance a significant portion of our high-coupon senior notes. As a result of the combination of make-whole redemption and a cash tender offer to purchase certain senior notes, the issuance of $1.8 billion of new senior notes, we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our portfolio by 100 basis points, extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations by 3 years and reduced senior note debt by $181 million. The after-tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt related to these financing transactions was $344 million.  We also had 2 balance sheet items in the quarter. We had a true-up of the sale of our Wheelabrator subsidiary, which reduced our gain on sale and we impaired a short-lived landfill asset. Those 2 items negatively affected our earnings by $0.03 per share but had no effect on free cash flow.  In the first quarter of 2015, our focus on reducing SG&A costs continues to bear fruit. Overall, SG&A cost declined $27 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. When you adjust 2014 for the operations that we divested, our year-over-year SG&A cost improvement was $15 million, consistent with our expectations for savings from our reorganization. With the strong results in the first quarter, we expect to achieve a full year SG&A -- our full year SG&A goals of reducing SG&A cost by reducing $60 million. Turning to cash flow for the first quarter. Free cash flow was $285 million in the first quarter of 2015, an improvement of $22 million when compared to the first quarter of 2014, excluding the $221 million of free cash flow related to operations divested in 2014. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $233 million, $33 million less than the first quarter of 2014. However, we spent about the same amount of capital as a percentage of revenue in both years. Given the strong start to the year, we still expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. And free cash flow in 2015 is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. First quarter revenues were $3 billion. In addition to the $220 million impact from the divestitures and a $25 million impact from foreign currency fluctuations, the lower fuel surcharge negatively affected revenues by $36 million. Looking at internal revenue growth for the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.4%, with volumes declining 1.2%. This led to total company income from operations growing $21 million, operating income margin expanding expanded 130 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $11 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of the price-volume trade-off. Our commercial core price was 6.6%, our industrial core price was 9.4% and residential achieved 2.1% core price. In addition to the continued strong momentum on pricing, we saw some positive momentum in volume. Commercial volumes were down 2.8% the first quarter of 2015 versus the decline of 4.8% in 2014, a 200 basis point improvement, and the best result in the past 7 quarters.  Industrial volumes improved 520 basis points from a negative 5.7% the first quarter of 2014 to a negative 0.5% in 2015. In April, we see industrial volume turning positive for the first time since the first quarter of 2013. Residential volumes declined 3.1% in the first quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 3.5% in 2014. But those losses were generally intentional as we pushed price over volume in our residential line. Overall, collection core price was 5.7%, with volumes declining 2.3%. The volume change was a 220 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2014. This core price and volume led to income from operations growing almost $14 million and margin expanding 140 basis points. In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive core price in the first quarter. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year for the eighth consecutive quarter, up 1.2% from Q1 2014. Combine special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes, we're a positive 2.3%, MSW volumes grew by 5.7% and C&D volume grew 10.9%. Total landfill volume increased 1.8%. This led to income from operations growing $2.5 million, which is the eighth consecutive quarter growth, and margins grew 40 basis points. We believe the weather had some impact on landfill volumes. But the special waste pipeline looks strong, so we expect to see positive landfill volumes all year. Looking at our recycling line of business. We had some challenges with low commodity prices and declining volumes. The impact of our recycling business was a negative $0.02 per share in the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2014. That decline would have been more than $0.05 per share if we've not been taking steps to improve contract and reduce operating costs. Those steps included : auditing inbound material to ensure compliance; renegotiating contracts to recover the appropriate our processing costs; and improving the quality of materials coming into our plants through consumer education. We were also able to improve the overall operating efficiency of our plants. As David mentioned, we expect our recycling operations are going to be a headwind all year, but we're seeing the results of our efforts to improve the operations. When commodity prices rebound, we're in a great position to see meaningful earnings improvements. In the meantime, we will curtail capital spending in our recycling operations, which will allow us to allocate more of our $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of capital spend to our core solid waste assets. Moving to operating expenses. We continue to see improvement in all of our cost lines. With respect to total operating costs, operating cost as a percent of revenue improved 130 basis points to 64% and improved $131 million in the first quarter after adjusting for divestitures. $83 million of the improvement related to lower diesel costs and lower recycling commodity rebates to our customers. We're also seeing a continued benefit from our service delivery optimization program in our labor costs as we see improved efficiency in all of our collection lines of business. Labor and related benefits improved $17 million when compared to the first quarter of 2014. The remaining savings were primarily driven by improvements in the subcontractor costs.  Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 62.3%. Our expected 2015 weighted average cost of debt is 4.3% and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 9% at the end of the quarter. In the first -- in the fourth quarter, we returned -- first quarter, we returned $176 million to our shareholders through our dividend. As David mentioned, we expect to return more cash to our shareholders in the second quarter as we look to repurchase shares to offset dilution.  Our income tax rate in the first quarter was 41%. Adjusted for items excluded in our as-adjusted results, the tax rate was 34.2%, which is closely in line with our expected tax rate of approximately 35% for the full year. To summarize our quarter with the exception of recycled commodity prices, virtually all of our financial and operating metrics were tracking ahead of our internal expectations and our previous guidance. We expect that to continue throughout 2015. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in the first quarter. I know that they will continue their focus to make 2015 a successful year. And with that, Tanisha, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Corey Greendale : So first, I apologize. This is a little bit of a mechanical question. But in the press release, the internal growth numbers that you're giving, are those adjusted for -- are you pulling out divestitures in the denominator from the year prior period? James Fish : Yes, we are pulling out divestitures, yes. David Steiner : Yes. Corey Greendale : Okay, so in other words, if you pull out divestitures, volume was down 3% just based on the operations that you still have? James Fish : That's correct. David Steiner : That's correct, yes. Corey Greendale : Okay. Good, I'm getting a totally different number, I'm not sure why. But anyway, so my question is, it sounds like the core business is kind of moving in the right direction. So could you just talk about, a little bit more detail on the pieces that -- where the volume is declining like national accounts? Is that -- are you seeing more aggression there? Is -- do you think you're hitting the ceiling on what you can do in terms of pricing? David Steiner : Yes. Basically, Corey, that's the carryover of our largest national account that we lost last year and then 2 residential franchise contracts that we lost in our Southern group last year. And as you can imagine, all of those contracts were single-digit margins and not revenue that we wanted to keep without significant price increases. So that was business that we pretty much intentionally shed. Corey Greendale : And the volume decline didn't accelerate in Q4, correct? James Fish : Pardon? Corey Greendale : The volume was not down as significantly in Q4 as it was in Q1 of '15, is that correct? David Steiner : Well, Corey, when we looked at it, we look at the specific lines of business. When you look at the commercial and industrial line, they were actually improved from the fourth quarter. On the commercial line, we were down 3.5% in the fourth quarter, we were only down 2.8% in the first. On industrial, we were down 0.9% the fourth quarter. We're only down 0.5% in the first quarter. And that's -- really, that's what you've got going on in our business. What we're trying to say, both in the scripts and in the press release, is that we're seeing improving volumes in our most profitable lines of business. We are seeing declining volumes in our less profitable lines of business like recycling and residential. But even in residential, you can see it getting a little bit better year-over-year by 40 basis points. And it only went backwards 20 basis points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Corey Greendale : Okay, yes. What I'm trying to get a sense of is just given the -- what seems to be the improving environment overall. And David, I understand things are moving in the right direction on the commercial and industrial. So just the piece like residential for example, is it getting more competitive for some reason than it has been over the past year? David Steiner : Yes, no. I wouldn't say it's getting more competitive. I think residential has always been a very competitive line of business. What -- those are big contracts, big slugs of revenue and generally, you've got a lot of different bidders. So there's always been aggressive players on the residential side. Frankly, I would say that we're seeing a little bit of more stability on the residential side as folks that have taken those low margin contracts from us over the last few years start to realize they can't make a lot of money on them. James Trevathan : Especially Dave, when you look at the capital that's necessary to fund those new contracts, people are starting to look at it a little more diligently than we think in the past. James Fish : Corey, just to give you a sense of -- you asked about the volume in Q4 versus Q1 and you also asked about kind of the difference between 1.2%, which is our traditional solid waste volume loss and 3%. To answer the second one first, the difference between the 1.2% and 3%, 0.8% of that is commodities, 0.2% is renewable energy and then you got another 0.2% which is oil and gas. So and then you got 0.6%, which is national accounts. That 0.6% is $21 million and $18 million of that is Walmart. So to go from the 1.2% to the 3%, it's largely commodities, national accounts and energy services or oil and gas. When you go from Q4 to -- negative 0.8% on volume to that negative 3%, it doesn't look dramatically different. In fact, collection's actually up. As David mentioned, collection was up 0.2%. But then you've got energy services that was down 0.5% of that delta; you have renewable energy that was down 0.4%; you have oil and gas that was down 4%; and recycling down 0.4%. And the other one that is -- the changes from Q4 to Q1 is the landfills were down a bit versus Q4 and the reason for that is, really, special waste was a little softer than we thought, probably largely because the weather in Q1 was quite different than the weather in Q4. Corey Greendale : Yes, that's really helpful, Jim. And one other quick one then I'll turn it over. Do you have an estimate of what the year-over-year impact -- I'm assuming it was some benefit -- was from lower fuel cost net of the lower surcharges? David Steiner : Yes. That was about $0.02 in the quarter. But from our perspective, you get lower fuel because you get the recovery from the fuel surcharge. But we also have some oil and gas assets that we maintain. And so when you look at the overall effect, it was about flat. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey : A couple questions for you, guys. First, thinking about the impact of the CPI on pricing. Do you expect the impact from CPI to change on pricing as we move through the balance of 2015? David Steiner : No. I don't think that we'll see a significant change in CPI. But when we look at our pricing programs, we try to look at them holistically. And if CPI is lower, then we just have to get those dollars from somewhere else. And so if we get a bump from CPI, that would be great. But if we don't get that bump, we're just going to have to pull those dollars from somewhere else and that's what we've been doing the last few years and that's what we'll do this year. Alex Ovshey : Got it. Thanks, David. And then in the recycling business, I'm not sure if you mentioned this, but is there any EBITDA in that business right now? James Fish : Right now, it's... David Steiner : There's EBITDA because of the depreciation. [indiscernible] There's a lot of EBITDA. James Fish : [indiscernible] the impact of EBITs, income from operations was negative $11 million year-over-year, Alex. Alex Ovshey : Okay, okay. Got it, got it. And then just lastly, is there any visibility on potentially seeing a benefit from coal ash volumes, either towards the end of this year or into '16? David Steiner : Yes. We've got a nice contract that actually begins in the second half of the year. It's not going to be -- it's not going to move the needle significantly. But it's a nice contract, a few million dollars. But we're having continuing discussions with all of the various utilities. And I'd expect that to be a nice volume stream for the next -- gosh, for the next 5 to 10 years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital. Scott Levine : So I just want to focus on, I think, Jim, you mentioned a 60 basis point volume headwind from national accounts and Walmart. To be clear, is that all associated with contract changes within the past 12 months or were there any additional changes this quarter? And then maybe a little bit more elaboration on your thoughts on that business in general going forward. James Fish : So I'll take that and then maybe, Jim, you can add to that. Yes. So for the quarter -- and we expect that -- well, the Walmart, that will anniversary in May, so we won't see that headwind if you want to call it that, it's a headwind on the revenue, not line -- it's not a headwind on the bottom line. But that will anniversary in May. We did lose some other contracts and some of them, we were intentional, some of them were not intentional. We lost some due to aggressive pricing and it's a competitive marketplace for sure. James Trevathan : Jim, what I would just add to that is that we are also winning new contracts. We have won some business, some additional business from current customers as well as some additional businesses that you'll see in future quarters. But that roll forward, in fact, from some of those large losses like Walmart will continue for, at least, first half of the year. David Steiner : And when we look at that business from a philosophical point of view, look, we completely understand that sort of like the residential business, there's some stiff competition there. But particularly, where we can get that front end small container work that we can tuck right into our operations and create that route density, that's really the kind of work that we want to pick up. The compactor work, like the Walmart business, is generally lower margin and it doesn't really help us from a route density point of view. And so our focus will be on that small container business. But we're obviously going to remain competitive in national accounts and we expect to continue to be the biggest player. Scott Levine : Got it. And just to be clear, and strictly for modeling purposes, was Walmart half of that 60 basis point volume impact or less than that? Or is it -- just to make sure we model the volumes right for the rest of the year. James Fish : I think it was a little more than half, Scott. Scott Levine : Little more than half, got it. And then as my follow-up. I think you mentioned in plans to repurchase stock to offset dilution, share dilution in the second quarter. Just kind of are you still holding off on, call it, the larger repurchase activity as you assess M&A prospects and maybe a little bit more elaboration on your thoughts on the acquisition landscape. David Steiner : Yes. No, that's exactly right. So when we look at 2015, there's really 2 pieces to it. There's what I'd call sort of our normal recurring stock buyback. We generate a lot of free cash flow, a good portion of that goes back to our shareholders through the dividend and traditionally, the remainder goes back to our shareholders through a share repurchase and some of it goes into small tuck-in acquisitions. In 2015, we're getting back to that. And so what we're talking about doing in the second quarter, I would characterize as part of our sort of normal, recurring, returning of cash to our shareholders. On the redeployment of the Wheelabrator proceeds, as we talk to sellers, it's sort of interesting. You've got, really, 2 things happening. You've got expectations of price multiples, which are probably a little higher than we expected. But then you've also got some timing events, right? You've got private sellers that might have family or estate issues and then you got private equity sellers that might have funds that they want hold for a number of years that have sort of a liquidation time frame on them. And so what we're battling is price expectations and timing expectations. My guess is that by midyear, we will know whether we can meet both timing and price expectations. If we can't do that, then we'll buy back stock. Now that doesn't mean that we're not going to ultimately talk with those sellers and buy their business. If they have timing expectations that don't mature for 1 year or 18 months, we'll be talking to them in 1 year or 18 months and we'll buy them as part of our normal acquisition process. And so in the middle of the year, by sort of the end of the second quarter, we would expect to be in a position where we're going to make a call where we say we will either buy those businesses with the proceeds or we'll buy back stock with the proceeds. And if we don't buy those businesses with the proceeds, you'll probably see us continue to look to buy them over the next couple years as their timing gets better. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : So just a clarification on volume. Are we still thinking about volumes turning the corner later in the year and either flattening out on the total basis or even being up? David Steiner : Yes. So let's sort of look at those profitable components that we talked about before. On industrial, we actually saw volumes turn positive in April. They were only negative 0.5% in the quarter. And we actually saw them turn positive in April. So I would expect that we would see positive volumes from the industrial side going forward. The landfill side has always been positive volume. But we would expect to see that get better as we get to the seasonal upturn. We had a little bit of a weather effect in the first quarter. So we'd expect to see those volumes improve. On the commercial side, again, we're 200 basis points better than we were in the first quarter of last year. We're 70 basis points better than we were in the fourth quarter. We would expect that sort of rate of improvement to continue. Such that by the end of the year, I would expect that we'll be closer to flat on the commercial side. So if you look at commercial being closer to flat, industrial and landfill being positive, I think that could lead to positive volumes by the end of the year in those 3 lines of business. Now the headwinds you have are basically national accounts and the residential line of business. Those will be slight drags, but again, those are low-margin drags, so we're willing to live with those. So when we look at the core solid waste business, the negative 1.2% that we had in the first quarter, we completely believe that by the end of the year, those will be flat to positive such that our guidance for the year of negative 0.5% to flat volumes is still valid. James Fish : Joe, when you think about how that volume that you talk about translates to top-line revenue, the way we looked at the quarter was -- when we looked at collection, disposal and transfer, the revenue was up fairly decently at about $25 million and keep in mind, that's almost all organic. We really didn't have a lot in the way of acquisitions for the last 12 months. So up $25 million. The second factor, of course, was, as we've talked a lot about this morning, the negative revenue impact of recycle commodity prices and recycle volumes,  and that was a negative $70 million. So and then of course, the third factor, David just mentioned, fuel surcharge, FX and we've talked about the lower -- the lost Walmart contract and some of the lost national accounts business. But overall, the volume numbers that we -- the improvement that we're seeing in some of those volume numbers on the core side is translating to top line revenue. We weren't displeased with the $25 million in those 3 core businesses. Joe Box : Well, actually, Jim, so to that point, maybe you can help me understand the disconnect here. If I just add up the numbers that I have for collection, disposal and transfer, acknowledging that there's some component that's going to go to intercompany, if I'm just adding it up, I'm coming up with a flat number versus last year. So are you stripping out FX to get to that $25 million? Or are you stripping out fuel? What am I missing? David Steiner : No, you're adding in price. When you look at it from a total revenue point view, you've got to add the price in as well as the volume component. Joe Box : I'm just looking at total revenues at a flat year-over-year. James Fish : FX is not included in that $25 million. So I've broken it into a couple of different buckets, which was our core solid waste, collection, disposal, transfer, those, price and volume, excluding divestitures, was up $25 million in revenue. And then the second factor was a negative $70 million in recycling. And the third factor was $36 million negative in fuel surcharge, $25 million negative in FX, and $21 million negative in national accounts. Joe Box : Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification. So I'm just looking at the core solid waste business and I'm curious, what are you specifically seeing that gives you the confidence that you can offset that incremental $0.05 to $0.07 headwind in recycling? Or is that just a moot point because you guys prefer to address the guidance in 2Q? David Steiner : No, I mean, look, we see -- what I would tell you is that we're much more confident now that we're going to get the dollars that we expect to get from our pricing program. We continue to see good improvement on the cost side, both on the SG&A and on the operating cost side. And then I'd say that we're probably a little more optimistic than we were at the beginning of the year from a volume perspective. Again, that's why this is a -- it's an interesting quarter for us. When we first look at the quarter and saw the revenue decline, we said, \"Wow, what's going on?\" When we look behind it, we say we see some really good trends in our profitable lines of business. We can't help the fact that we lose $70 million of revenue on the recycling side because of commodity prices, but when we look at our very profitable commercial, industrial landfill line, we see some really positive trends there. So and that was -- all those positive trends occurred even though we had got some negative weather in the first quarter. So I would say that we're fairly bullish on the volume side. We're extremely confident on the price side. And we think we'll get a little bit more out of our cost programs than we expected at the beginning of the year. Joe Box : Got it. One last one for me then. So why does recycling actually get worse as we move through the year sequentially? I mean, it seems like pricing is somewhat bottomed and comps should get easier. So why would the headwind actually get worse? David Steiner : Yes. Well, the price, actually -- I'm not sure if the price has bottomed or not. It's as low as it's ever been. But we haven't seen any indication of a bottom. And so you've got some fairly tough comps in the second and third quarter, gets a little bit better in the fourth quarter. And then you've got the volume decline right? The 8% volume decline, we don't expect to see that improve throughout the course of the year. And so it's basically -- it's mostly driven by commodity pricing. And I would tell you that we're being a little bit conservative on that because we just don't see any catalyst out there that's going to drive the commodity prices up significantly. James Fish : Joe, I think what you're probably thinking is why can't you just straight line the $0.02 and come to $0.08 and the reason is that commodity prices dropped throughout the quarter. So we're looking at kind of straight lining from the commodity price in March, which was the lowest of the 3 months. David Steiner : Yes, when you [indiscernible] March -- for the quarter, it was down 14% but for the month, it was down 24%. So we're basically extrapolating that low price across the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk : I want to continue on, on recycling. Can you help us maybe appreciate, for lack of a better word, the mix issue that you're dealing with? And then secondly, the contract structure issue that is probably a multi-year resolution to, at end of the day, conclude that this macro theme that you set up for 20 million tons of -- to handle recycled product still makes sense in the shareholder's mind? James Fish : Yes. So Al, a couple of things. First of all, on the contracts and the mix issue. Each of these contracts has an expectation as to mix of commodities. And when that mix changes, we have to address that with the customer. So for example, we've talked quite a bit about glass over the last couple of quarters. Glass is heavy, so the customers may like it. We don't like it as much. It's only the commodity that we don't get paid for on the back and we actually have to pay to get rid of it. And so as glass goes up, as an example, then we have to address that with the customer, if there are limitations, mix limitations within our contract. Similarly, if there are contamination level restrictions. So for example, if a community has a restriction of 10% contamination levels and when we go through an audit find that there are 20%, then we have to recover some of that. So part of what we're doing through our recycling team is really taking a tough stance on holding customers to contracts on contamination levels and material mix. David Steiner : Jim, I would add that those 2 issues are absolutely related because some of the mix issues that are caused as cities and counties want to divert more waste add to contamination level in some of those commodities. And many of our older contracts don't allow us to charge. That's what we're changing. We're going in, some of them in mid-contract and having some success, most of them though, we'll wait until the contract ends until we can change the terms and allow us to get paid for their mix issue or their contamination issue. Al Kaschalk : So it's clearly a multi-year undertaking here? David Steiner : Yes. Well, look, there's 2 pieces to it. There's fixing the mix and contract issue. And then it's fixing operations, right? I mean, we still have some opportunities to consolidate plants, to drive out from operating costs and we think we can make some more headway there. Like Jim said, if it weren't for the headway that we made in the first quarter, it would have been -- if you look just at the price component, it was a $0.05 problem. We still think we've got some operating cost that we can pull out. We're going to have to consolidate some plants and rationalize some assets. And I think that's what customers need to realize is that we're not the only ones rationalizing assets. The industry is rationalizing assets. And unless we can work out a way where recycling is profitable over the long term, there's not going to be recycling. And customers certainly don't want to live with that. So we just need to make sure that the customers understand that if they want glass recycled, we need to get paid for it. We actually lose -- or we lost in the quarter $6 million by recycling glass. That's -- long term, that cannot be sustainable for Waste Management. So we need to work with the customers to get them to understand the mix issues, to understand the commodity market so that we can make a long-term, viable business out of recycling. Al Kaschalk : But the progress to date, David, has been slim. Is that because the major customers -- or your larger customers in this area are not ready to discuss until contract comes up? David Steiner : Yes, exactly. Most of these contracts are long-term contracts. And look, it's a long-term contract. We sign the contract, we will live up to the contract. But what they need to realize is, we'll live up to that contract but we're not going to be there when the contract ends and nobody's going to be there when the contract ends. So if they want us to maintain the facilities that we have in those markets, we're going to have to get some relief from these contracts or we're going to just have to shut the plants. And so I would hope the customers would say, \"Let's take a long-term view at it rather than a short-term view.\" But as you know, as we generate $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of free cash flow there's not a lot of sympathy for our losses in recycling. James Fish : Al, I wouldn't characterize the progress as slim. I think what's happened is, it's been overshadowed by the real dramatic falling commodity prices. Look, commodity prices were basically kind of -- our average bucket of commodity prices was in the $100 range for the last 2 years, last 2.5 years, $98 finished the year in 2014 and all of a sudden, it's gone from $98 to $82 and we processed between 6 million to 7 million tons a year. That's a big price decline to absorb. So we've made some good progress on controlling cost and on kind of holding customers to contract. But man, with such a dramatic commodity price decline, it was hard to overcome it. Al Kaschalk : So -- but you're not able to maybe take a little more aggressive action yourself and walk away from these contracts? James Fish : Well, we're looking at everything. But it's hard to walk away from a contract at times. Al Kaschalk : Okay, I understand. A follow-up then. Just a little more -- David, your comments about capital deployment or redeployment of the Wheelabrator proceeds. It would seem to me that this is more a function of, maybe some larger transactions that you're looking at than your traditional annual deals you're doing or even something of a Deffenbaugh size. Could you comment on that? And if that's not the case, then why wouldn't you be out in the market aggressively buying back stock, particularly given today's reaction? David Steiner : Yes, exactly. Well, obviously, that gives us more opportunity to buy back more stock. And so you're exactly right. I mean, what we're looking at, when we look at the Wheelabrator proceeds, are looking at -- we sort of look at it the exact same way. We say we want another 3 Deffenbaughs, right? And those are -- there's not a lot of Deffenbaughs in the country. And once you find that type of business, you've got to overcome 2 hurdles. One, are they ready to sell? And two, what do they want -- what the price that they want to sell? And I would tell you that at the beginning of the year, we were pretty encouraged by what we saw on both of those fronts. As we've got into deeper discussions with sellers, we found out that some of them had bigger timing issues than we thought and some of them have higher pricing expectations than we thought. And so look, that doesn't mean that we ultimately won't buy those businesses. But it might mean that it's going to take us longer to buy those businesses. And if that's the case, then we do need to be out in the market buying back our stock because look, as I've said, that's the business we know the best. We're never going to pay a multiple higher than our own multiple because there's one business we know real well and that's ours. And so I would guess that in the back half of the year, we will be in the market more than just to cover dilution. But if we can get to the point where we can get some of the sellers to -- that we can meet their timing and their pricing expectations, we would obviously much prefer to buy good core solid waste businesses at reasonable prices. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Redding of BB&T. Charles Redding : On the industrial side, it certainly sounds like your seeing improvement here. I guess as we look ahead, how do we rectify what looks to be slowing industrial production in a tough market for U.S. exports with the expectation for stronger volume growth? David Steiner : Well, it was mentioned earlier. You've got the coal ash coming. But you've also got a huge amount of construction being done along the chemical corridors, right? From Houston to Beaumont and up to Baton Rouge and up through Pennsylvania where you've got very low natural gas prices, you've got some huge projects being built. We expect to get good volumes out of that. And then when you look at the residential and commercial construction, those numbers look fairly strong. So we think that the economy's going to be finally a little bit of a help to us on that side. Now remember, we also have a lot of those hauls in our energy services. We really haven't seen a dramatic drop on the energy services side. And so we've got well-positioned in still some good shale plays there. So we see pretty positive trends throughout the various sectors that drive industrial hauls for us. Charles Redding : Okay, and then I guess just a little follow-up on Canada. I realize it's relatively fractional for you. But can you speak to, perhaps, what you're seeing there? And then I guess, has the macro pullback had a material impact on the recent volume growth in the region? James Fish : I think it's kind of the tale of kind of 2 parts of the country. Western Canada is, particularly Alberta, suffering a bit from the energy price decline. Eastern Canada seems to be reasonably strong, similar to kind of Northeast U.S. cities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown : Just, Jim, can you help us out on the cadence of cash flow and just why Q1 was such a large working capital drag? I don't know if that was the cash taxes paid on Wheelabrator? Or if your cash conversion cycle creeped? And then maybe how do we think about the full year impact of working capital in your cash from ops guidance? James Fish : So couple things running through working capital worth mentioning here. First of all, our -- you may recall that in -- for our bonus payouts, our annual incentive comp payout that would've paid out in March of 2014, we accelerated a piece of that into December of '13. So it was a 2013 year annual incentive comp. But a portion of it was paid out in 2013. We did not do that this year. So we knew we were going to have a working capital negative headwind in March of this year. And that amounted to about $65 million. Most of that was that acceleration, a piece of it was just a higher payout from year '14 versus year '13. That was -- totaled about $65 million as a headwind. We also had about $21 million in nonrecurring -- mostly nonrecurring cash payout for the 2014 restructuring. We've got about $12 million left. And that will spread out over the next 3 quarters. But we had $21 million in Q1 that is, for the most part, nonrecurring and that's a payout of our 2014 restructuring. And then in addition to that, we had -- in 2014, we had a benefit, a $36 million benefit from the settlement of a forward-starting swap that didn't repeat of course this year. So you think about year-over-year, the negatives were those, the positive was EBITDA was up. And then the other positives were that we continue to make headway on managing working capital on DSO and DPO, particularly DPO, was up 2.1 days, DSO up 0.6 days. So we're starting to narrow the gap pretty significantly there from a couple years ago. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay. So is working capital a drag in cash from ops guidance or is it neutral? James Fish : Well, I think working capital is certainly a drag in Q1. There will be some positives coming up as we look at the remainder of the year. So for example, the San Jacinto settlement of last year. That won't repeat. And so that will be a tailwind for us on working capital. And as I mentioned, we shouldn't have those -- that cash impact from the restructuring starts to taper off pretty dramatically in Q2. So as those -- and of course, the bonus headwinds from the incentive comp payouts, acceleration of that, that doesn't occur either. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay, that's helpful. And then, follow-up here, just -- I just want to understand CapEx just a little bit better. So if I look a trailing 12 CapEx, and I even -- if I even adjusted divestitures, you guys are about 8.5% of sales. I think there's a common convention or belief out there that you need to be north of, call it, 9% of sales on a pure maintenance basis. So am I missing something there? Or how do you bridge the gap, the differential in the CapEx? James Fish : We've said that -- we kind of gave a number of 8.3% to 9%. I think we gave that last year. First quarter's historically slow. We were -- the number I had was 7.7% of revenue in the first quarter. And -- but if I look at Q1 of '14, it was 7.8%. If I look at Q1 of '13, it was 7.9%. So not way out of the range with those 2 years' first quarters. We expected 2015, actually, is going to be in that $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range, which is a bit of a headwind for us in terms of free cash flow because last year, we only spent $1.150 billion. So we're going to spend somewhere $50 million and $150 million more in CapEx and clearly, on a percent of revenue, without the Wheelabrator assets, that will be a higher percentage of revenue. So I think 2015, not only is it going to be higher in absolute dollars, it's going to be higher as a percent of revenue. Patrick Tyler Brown : Okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe if I can squeeze in one last in here. Thinking about capital structure. But you guys a have kind of swept some of the Wheelabrator proceeds, the net proceeds, I should say, maybe to Deffenbaugh, you had your note repayment, maybe you've delevered a little bit. But I've got you at about, call it, 2.7 on the leverage. You've got $300 million in cash. So when we think about future capital deployment, is the idea that you would relever to do so? And if so, what is the kind of the level of leverage you're willing to go to or what's your kind of optimal capital structure? James Fish : Yes. So if I think of us as being in kind of that 2.78 leverage ratio range, yes, I would expect that to increase slightly as we acquire some businesses to replace Wheelabrator going forward. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Jim, can we do a little bit of a waterfall to try and reconcile 2014 EPS and the guidance for '15? If I understand everything you've given us and thanks for the data, which, I should take $0.18 out of last year's number for all the divestments and then you take $0.10 out for recycling and $0.04 for currency and that kind of gives me a starting place, add in buybacks and then I get growth. That's kind of how -- is that the right way to think about it? James Fish : Yes. And there's some interest expense savings in there too. Michael Hoffman : Interest expense would be a part of that. Okay. So getting back to the growth then aspect of this and in the solid waste side. And I -- and you may have given this data and I pardon, it was just so much of it. I'm not sure I got it all written down. But weight per yard trends in your front end loader business had exited '14 on a positive trend line. How -- what's that trend line coming through the first half of the year at this point? And where does it sort of set in your mind about that cycle of service interval upgrades that creates such operating leverage? David Steiner : Michael, when we look at the commercial line of business, I'll give you a few reasons why we're optimistic. First is you're right, the weights continued through the first quarter. We saw improvement there. We saw service increases exceed service decreases. So there's some good news there. But frankly, the best news that I've seen on the commercial line of business, we just went through reviews with our 17 market areas. And 12 of our 17 market areas had net positive new business in the first quarter. The other good part of that news is that over 2/3 of that new business was greenfield projects, new businesses that are created, not stealing share from somebody else. And so I think what you're seeing is a better secular trend. And what you're seeing is that we're taking advantage of that better secular trend. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So following through with that then, on your C&D side of the business. On the pulls, what's the trend in absolute number of pulls and in revenue per pull? How's that trend look like? David Steiner : Yes. The revenue per pull is nicely improving. On the number of pulls, frankly, I don't have the actual number of pulls. I know what the percentage increase was. But you saw a 10.9% volume in the landfill. And so I would assume that equates to a pretty healthy increase in the number of pulls. James Trevathan : I think it was down slightly in terms of revenue pulls which pretty much is -- correlates to the volume number that we talked about. But it was down slightly and part of that, as David mentioned earlier in the call, Michael was in energy services. I mean, there's -- you're down 50% in rigs. Fortunately, we were able to replace some of that revenue. So we're not down as much as the rig count, of course. But it did affect the hauling side of the business. Michael Hoffman : Well, okay. So what I was really trying to get at too is, and you alluded to this to one other question, if I remember correctly, pretty much the whole industry assumed going into this year that residential construction would hold about 1 million starts. Some of us were looking for it to be better. But so far, the data set would suggest that maybe that trend is better, one. And two, the nonresidential construction x oil and gas and energy, broadly, if you will, power and oil and gas, which had been positives in the '14, all of the other components, commercial, lodging, office and what have you, actually, just struck a bottom in '14 and it started to turn a corner. Are you seeing that corner turn? In both... David Steiner : Yes, look, I think that's exactly right, Michael. I mean, look, we're not going to call a dramatic turn. But I do think that we -- for the first time in 2 years, we're willing to say that there is a good secular trend going on that we see continuing. Michael Hoffman : Okay, all right. And then on the recycling side. What -- if $98 was the number for blended commodities in end of December and $82 is 1Q, what's the blended commodity dollar number given the current cost structure of your recycling business to be breakeven on an EBIT basis? What do you need that to be? David Steiner : Breakeven is probably in the $78 to $80 range. Michael Hoffman : Okay, and then on free cash flow. When do I see working through the cash flow from ops that -- there's $200 million in nonrecurring tax situation, when do I see that walk its way through? Is that spread out through the whole year? Or is it -- there's a tax filing in I think 2Q and 4Q -- is it a 2Q and 4Q issue? James Fish : Yes, it's -- well, we're paying all 3 quarters. We kind of make a double payment in 2 and 4. So you'll start to see it in Q2 and it will carry through the rest of the year. Michael Hoffman : Okay, so I should see a little bit of a above average cash flow from ops as a percent of revenues in 2Q? James Fish : Yes. I mean, none of that $210 million, Michael, showed up because we didn't make any federal tax payments in Q1. Michael Hoffman : Right. So stripping that away and looking at the sort of recurring number, $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, what do you think, based on what you're looking at the business today, the embedded recurring growth rate of that $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion would be as I look forward? Is that mid-single digits? High single? David Steiner : I think you're looking at, basically, sort of that 5% to 7% compounded growth rate. Michael Hoffman : Okay, that's very helpful. And then, 2 housekeeping questions just because I'm a little confused. On Page 6 of your 8-K, you have a nice table... David Steiner : Yes, Michael, that's a little bit obtuse for us. Michael Hoffman : What's that? Page 6? David Steiner : Going to a specific page of the 10-K [indiscernible]. Michael Hoffman : Right, sorry. But you have these great tables you've given and you talk about landfill volume up. But the tons number you have in the document, actually, has it down versus 1 year ago. You were 21.3 a year ago and you're 20.9. So I'm trying to reconcile the script and the data that's in the document. James Trevathan : Michael, that's all intercompany volume based. The intercompany volume's down, third-party volumes are up. That's the difference. Michael Hoffman : Perfect. That's great. And then as I think about the fuel -- I mean I had a -- more cost saves than I did revs in 1Q but I would assume that, that gap narrows through the rest of the year and it's less of -- it's more just a net offset each other as I work through the year. That's a timing distance difference of -- the surcharge comes back slower than the savings hit. James Fish : Yes, that's correct. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And I should try and just smooth that out to the remainder of the year and it kind of nets itself out by the end of the year? James Fish : Correct. Operator : I will now turn the call over to CEO David Steiner for closing remarks. David Steiner : Thank you. Well, obviously, we at Waste Management had a very good quarter. But when we look beyond Waste Management and look at the overall industry, as we said with Michael, we see improving industry fundamentals with the pricing environment stable and the volume environment improving. So we look forward to capitalizing on those improving industry fundamentals and continuing to gain momentum throughout 2015 and into 2016. And with that, we'll see you next quarter. Thank you.

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner. David Steiner : Thanks, Ed. Good morning from Houston. Our strong second quarter results reflect our continued commitment to disciplined core price growth and cost controls, combined with improving volumes, all positive trends that we expect to continue throughout the second half of the year. In the second quarter, we earned $0.67 per share, an increase of almost 16% from the second quarter of 2014 after excluding the earnings from divested businesses and assets. Our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin and earnings per diluted share all improved when compared to the second quarter of 2014, despite year-over-year headwinds of $0.03 per diluted share from lower recycling commodity prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We also saw our business generate significant cash as our cash provided by operating activities increased 47% and our free cash flow grew 30%. We're pleased with these results, and we expect the positive momentum to continue to build through 2015 and into 2016. Our pricing programs continue to be a big part of our earnings growth and margin expansion, and our strategy remains the same : continue our focus on core price while selectively adding the right new volumes. For the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.1% and yield was 1.7%. Year-to-date through June, core price was 4.3%, which exceeded our 2015 core price target of 3.8% and yield was 1.9%. As we've said in the past, core price is a better indicator of true pricing activities because mix issues can affect our yield results, as we saw in the second quarter. It's bottom line dollars that count, and core price reflects the bottom line impact from pricing. So while we said that yield would be around 2% for the year, we're not concerned with a slight drop in yield, as the absolute dollars to the bottom line from pricing remain on track and our core price remains robust. Over the last 6 quarters, core price has been consistently over 4%. In the second quarter, we saw our core price improve 10 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. When compared to the second quarter of 2014, core price in the industrial line was 8.6%; in the commercial line, it was 5.8%; 2.1% in our residential line and 2.3% in our landfill line. As we saw in the first quarter, core price continues to drive margin expansion, as our traditional solid waste business operating EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points. So pricing efforts are right on track, and we expect that to continue in an improving volume market. With respect to volumes, we look at our traditional solid waste business volumes, which excludes recycling and non-unit or nonsolid waste revenues. Our traditional solid waste business declined 0.6% in the second quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 2.3% in the second quarter of 2014, a 170 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 60 basis point sequential improvement from the 1.2% decline in the first quarter of 2015. Overall volumes, which includes recycling and those nonsolid waste volumes, declined 1.3% in the second quarter, compared to the negative 3% reported in the first quarter of 2015, a sequential improvement of 170 basis points. Although overall volumes continue to be negative, we saw some positive signs in the second quarter. In our industrial line of business, we had very strong new business pricing, yet volume was 270 basis points improved year-over-year, improving from negative 2.7% to flat in the second quarter of 2015, which reflects a robust market. We also saw the rate of decline in our commercial line of business improve again, as the rate of loss in commercial volumes improved 280 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014 and 60 basis points, sequentially, from a negative 2.8% in the first quarter of 2015 to a negative 2.2% in the second quarter of 2015. And the momentum improved throughout the quarter, with June showing better volumes than April or May. We also saw service increases exceed decreases in the quarter. Finally, new business in our commercial and industrial lines, combined, exceeded lost business for the first time in 3 years. So we are predicting a dramatic and fast turn to positive volumes, and we continue to see the light at the end of the volume tunnel. And we'd expect volumes to strengthen through the rest of 2015 and into 2016. Turning to recycling. As you've heard us say many times, the current recycling model is broken and we, and the entire industry, need to fix it. We've seen progress in our recycling operations, but the issues are complex and there's not an overnight fix. We're also working together with our customers, vendors and industry groups, and we've made progress as we're finding some acceptance for better contract terms and higher fees to offset the higher processing cost that we're experiencing. We're working with customers and municipalities on educating the public on what and how to recycle to bring down contamination levels and on the true cost of recycling. We, and our entire industry, realize that recycling is the right thing for our customers and the environment. We need to make sure that it's not only the right thing to do, but it's also a sustainable business. Moving to current results from our recycling operations. In the second quarter, we had a $0.02 decline in earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2014. This decline is due to the more than 13% drop in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 5.7% decline in volumes associated with contractual losses as we shed unprofitable volumes. Our recycling employees continue to perform at high levels, working to reduce operating costs. In the second quarter, operating costs continued to improve as we saw an 8% improvement in operating cost per ton compared to 2014. We expect to continue to see improvements in the second half of the year, but low commodity prices will continue to be a challenge. With respect to the deployment of our free cash flow from operations and our Wheelabrator divestiture, we will continue to seek a balanced approach to buying solid waste businesses, repurchasing shares and maintaining a strong yield through our dividend. With respect to acquisitions, we believe that in 2015, we can execute agreements to add an additional $50 million to $75 million of operating EBITDA. We would likely close those acquisitions in 2016. In the second quarter, we repurchased $300 million of our outstanding shares, and we will repurchase an additional $300 million in the third quarter. Because I had a 10b5-1 trading plan in place, in the second quarter, I personally purchased $2 million worth of Waste Management shares. In the fourth quarter, we will determine if we have additional acquisition candidates likely to occur or if we want to deploy cash to repurchase shares. And of course, we will continue to maintain a strong dividend and a strong balance sheet. In conclusion, we're pleased with the strong results through the first half of 2015. When we combine the first half results with our outlook for continued price and cost control discipline and improving volumes, we're confident that we can achieve our full year guidance. We now expect that our 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share should be at the high end of our previously announced guidance of between $2.48 and $2.55 per share, despite negative headwinds to diluted earnings per share of between $0.07 and $0.10 from recycling operations and about $0.04 from the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments. We also expect to achieve the upper end of our full year free cash flow guidance of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. So the year is playing out pretty much as we expected, but our people are doing what they need to do to offset the recycling and currency headwind. Their efforts have been extraordinary. And on behalf of the entire senior leadership team, we thank them for their excellence. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail. James Fish : Thank you, David. In the second quarter of 2015, our focus on reducing SG&A costs continues to bear fruit. Overall, SG&A cost declined $31 million compared to the second quarter of 2014. When you adjust 2014 for the operations that we divested, our year-over-year SG&A cost improvement was $18 million, consistent with our expectations for savings from our reorganization. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.7%, an improvement of 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. With the strong results in the first half of 2015, we expect to achieve our full year SG&A goals of reducing SG&A costs by $60 million. Turning to cash flow for the second quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities was $816 million compared to $555 million in the second quarter of 2014, an improvement of $261 million, with a reduction in cash taxes accounting for $216 million of the increase. Free cash flow was $579 million in the second quarter of 2015, an increase of $245 million when excluding free cash flow from operations divested in 2014. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $296 million, $88 million more than the second quarter of 2014, as a portion of our expected increased fleet spend occurred in the second quarter. Excluding the cash tax benefit, free cash flow grew almost 9% compared to the second quarter of 2014, despite an increase in capital spending. Given the level of expenditures in the first half of 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Despite that, free cash flow for 2015 is also expected to be at the high end of our guidance range of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. Second quarter revenues were $3.3 billion. We saw a $54 million increase in revenues from acquisitions and a $34 million increase in our traditional solid waste business. The overall revenue decline stems from a $193 million decline from divestitures, a $59 million decline from lower recycling revenues, $45 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues and $27 million in foreign currency fluctuations. Looking at internal revenue growth in the second quarter. Our collection of disposal core price was 4.1% with total volumes declining 1.3%. This led to total company income from operations growing $12 million, operating income margin expanding 60 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $11 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 80 basis points. These results are strong and that much more encouraging when you consider the about $30 million of benefits we realized in the second quarter of 2014 that did not repeat in 2015. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of the price volume trade-off. As David said, our internal core -- our industrial core price was 8.6%, our commercial core price was 5.8% and residential achieved a 2.1% core price. In addition to the continued strong momentum in pricing, we saw some positive momentum in volume. Commercial volumes were down 2.2% in the second quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 5% in 2014, a 280 basis point improvement. Industrial volumes improved 270 basis points from a negative 2.7% in the second quarter of 2014 to flat in 2015. And outside of energy services, our industrial volumes were positive. Residential volume declined 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 3.8% in 2014. The residential line of business remains competitive, and we remain focused on retaining and growing where our return on investment is accretive to shareholders. This core price and volume led to income from operations growing more than $3 million and margin expanding 30 basis points and operating EBITDA growing more than $8 million and margin expanding 70 basis points. In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive core price in the second quarter. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter, up 1.4% from Q2 2014. Combined special waste and revenue-generating recovery volumes were a positive 4.3%; MSW volumes grew by 7.2%; and C&D volume grew 7.3%. Total landfill volumes increased 3.2%. This led to income from operations growing $9 million and operating margin grew 70 basis points. Operating EBITDA grew $16 million, and margin expanded 140 basis points. Moving to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, operating costs improved 60 basis points to 63.6%. Lower diesel costs and lower recycling commodity rebates to our customers improved by $68 million. Labor and related benefits improved $21 million when compared to the second quarter of 2014 as we continue to see the improvement of our service delivery optimization program. These savings were partially offset by increased disposal costs related to our improved volumes and an increase in risk management costs. Overall, operating cost improved $56 million in the second quarter after adjusting for the divestitures. Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-total capital ratio was 62.7% and our weighted average cost of debt is 4.4%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 9% at the end of the quarter. In the second quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million of our outstanding shares for $300 million and paid $175 million in dividends. The $475 million reflects our confidence in the cash generation of our business and commitment to return cash to our shareholders. Our income tax rate in the second quarter was 29.6%. Adjusting for items excluded in our as-adjusted results, tax rate was 30.9%. In the second quarter of 2015, a reduction in deferred taxes and utilization of net -- state net operating losses benefited earnings per share by $0.02. In summary, our second quarter results continue to show the momentum that we saw in the first quarter and positions as well to achieve our full year guidance. This would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all of our employees. And for that, I want to thank them. We're more than halfway through the year, and we're very confident we'll have a successful year. With that, Ginnisha, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Corey Greendale : Just a few questions. So first of all, I appreciate the update on progress on some of your discussions on the structure of your recycling contract. Just wondering, given that commodity prices have come off the bottom somewhat, is that impacting those conversations and your customers' willingness to engage in changes? David Steiner : No. Really, the prices haven't come off the bottom. I mean, as -- to the extent they've come off the bottom, it's been very marginal. So we're still relatively close to sort of breakeven when it comes to processing costs versus commodity sales. So no. The -- in fact, if anything, I think the discussions have become more pronounced with the customers. And I think more and more -- as you see more folks like you all in the financial community and more folks in the general press understanding the issues facing recycling, I would say those issues are more and more coming to the front rather than going back. James Fish : Corey, when you look at the way that average weighted commodity price, it was about $83 in Q1 and $83 in Q2. So really, the improvement we're seeing is through our cost efforts on cost of goods sold and operating cost. Corey Greendale : Okay. As far as -- at least, the numbers I've seen so far in July, it came [ph] more meaningfully off the bat [ph]. And --  but I'm looking at OCC and newsprint primarily, so maybe the... David Steiner : Yes, OCC seems to have stabilized a little bit, but it's still at low levels. Corey Greendale : Okay. The next question, David, clearly, the tenor on the volume environment is getting increasingly positive. I just want to make sure I'm hearing you correctly. I think you're saying you would expect volumes to get kind of increasingly less negative each quarter in the back half, but you're not necessarily calling to -- for it to go positive.  Or -- but I just want to clarify that. David Steiner : Yes. What we're trying to do, in order to give you all a little bit even more clarity is to separate it between what we're calling sort of our core solid waste volumes and then overall volumes. And so when we look at it, we look at those core solid waste volumes, which were negative 0.6% in the quarter. And we would expect that to improve in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter so that -- look, we aren't going to try to predict a turn to positive volumes. We said this year that we didn't think volumes were going to get positive. But I would expect us by the end of the year to be at a run rate where we're actually flat to positive on volumes. Corey Greendale : Okay, great. And then a question on the free cash flow. I'm just trying to understand the moving pieces, particularly related to cash tax payments. I think last year, you had a $210 million hit from early payment of taxes and that benefits this year. But can you kind of clarify, is that the right number? What -- have you already seen that whole benefit? And what should we expect in the free cash flow breakout between Q3 and Q4? James Fish : Yes. So that's right. $210 million was kind of the early payments in the Q4 of last year. So we kind of backed out $216 million to get to a number where we think that's for the year.  And particularly, by the way, when you look at cash from operations and free cash flow, both of those, if you normalize those for those taxes and if you normalize free cash flow for CapEx, we're in a position where we've actually overcome the WTI divestiture, which is pretty amazing in and of itself. For the remainder of year, if you tack on what we think was -- is achievable, which was the last year -- or last year's cash flow from operations, and essentially, that's what we did for the first 2 quarters; if you tack that on, and that's what we're forecasting, then you get to a number that's in that $1.5 billion range for free cash flow. Corey Greendale : And Jim, without asking for kind of operational guidance for 2016, if you just look at movement in cash taxes, would you expect the free cash flow would be up in '16?  Or could it be down because of a movement in cash taxes? James Fish : So if I -- yes, if I take our guidance for this year of $1.5 billion and I normalize that for the cash tax benefits and CapEx a little bit -- it's hard to say exactly what CapEx is going to be next year -- I get to a pretty good starting point of about $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion. Not that we're going to give you a lot of guidance for -- just yet, but... Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs. Usha Guntupalli : This is actually Usha Guntupalli on for Alex. One more question on recycling. Assuming commodity prices stay flat at current levels, you're obviously working on reducing cost in this business. But when do you expect the business to turn earnings positive at current commodity prices? David Steiner : Yes. Well, we're earnings positive, actually, at current prices, just slightly EBIT positive and certainly positive from an EBITDA point of view. So we didn't lose money in recycling in the quarter. We just did $0.02 worse than we did last year. So it's the year-over-year comparison. So we are slightly EBIT positive, but certainly not EBIT positive enough to earn our return on capital, to earn our weighted average cost of capital. So that's why we've got to get those earnings up. Usha Guntupalli : Got it. That's helpful. And on the yield, yield seemed to have slowed in the second quarter, and you did mention part of it was just mix. Could you give us more color on what was driving that mix? David Steiner : Yes. When you look at yield versus core price, it's why, quite a while ago, we started talking more about core price. Because really, core price is what drives dollars to the bottom line. When you look at yield, there's a lot of different factors that can play into that. I'll let Jim talk about a few of the ways that yield can -- I guess though, the point is that yield is indicative of pricing, but it's really sort of directional, whereas core price is truly indicative of what's going on in our pricing programs. But I'll let Jim talk a little bit about the difference between yield and core price. James Fish : Yes. I think probably a good example of that is our energy services business. Typically, that business has a longer -- quite a bit longer length of haul than our ordinary business. So due to that longer length of haul, that business has a higher unit price and a higher yield, but not a higher core price or profitability per unit. So as the energy services business has slowed due to the fall in oil prices, we've seen a decline in yield but not a decline in core price or unit profit. James Trevathan : Dave and Jim, you also mentioned that we improved in the new business side on a net basis when we add new business in markets that have a lower average unit rate -- not a lower profitability measurement, not a lower margin, but a lower average unit rate, and that's what happened in Q2 -- and/or we lose business in markets with higher or lower average unit rates, that affects yield, and that's what happened in Q2. But it has no impact on margin or core price. David Steiner : Yes. You can imagine, just to sort of put some color around what Jim Trevathan is saying, you can imagine that, right now, there's a lot of growth in Texas and Texas has lower landfill rates than you have in the Northeast. And hence, you've got a little bit lower pricing, but you also have very high profitability. So it's not a profitability issue. It's just the fact that you -- because you have lower landfill pricing in Texas than you do in the Northeast, you'll have lower unit costs and unit pricing for when you offer new services. And so as you've seen more growth in places like Texas, where it's very profitable but it's just a lower unit rate versus the Northeast, that's what drives sort of those mix issues. And so when we look at that, we say, \"Okay, the yield is down, but profitability is up.\" That's not such a bad thing, and that's why we say, really, what you have to look at is, overall, across our entire business, what are we doing from a price increase point of view? Because price increases takes mix out of the mix, and so core price is really the true indication of what we're doing. And as you saw with core price at 8.6% industrial and 5.8% in commercial, it's still running at a pretty hefty rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : Just want to review the capital deployment strategy post-Wheelabrator. Obviously, you guys have Deffenbaugh under your belt, and I know you've got $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA lined up from deals that are going to go next year. Just curious if you've gotten all the deals done that you've expected. Because externally, it looks like or it seems like -- I know you guys are shooting for more deals when you sold Wheelabrator. And then just as a quick follow-up to that. The items that you outlined, the items that you mentioned in the pipeline, are those solid waste companies? Or are they outside of solid waste? David Steiner : Yes. When we're looking at companies, they're all going to be solid waste. We really wouldn't look to stretch outside of sort of our core business when we're doing acquisition. The acquisition -- you always think that you're going to have to have this money to spend, there's plenty of people out there to sell and it should be fairly easy to replace the EBITDA. And then once you get into the market, you realize that there's 100 different issues that affect sellers, right? Sometimes they're family businesses, and it's hard to get the family over. Sometimes there's a higher expectation for pricing. And so when we went into the -- into it, we said, \"Look, if we can replace the Wheelabrator EBITDA at good accretive multiples, we'll do it.\" The good news for us is, if we can't, we can still buy back stock and it would still be accretive to where we were with Wheelabrator. So we're sort of in a win-win situation. And rather than run out and, sort of in an undisciplined manner, just pay whatever we needed to pay to replace the Wheelabrator EBITDA, we decided to take a little bit more of a disciplined approach, focus on our core solid waste business and see if we can't go out and do deals that are nicely accretive to -- for our shareholders. And so would we like to -- would we prefer to buy businesses that replace the EBITDA rather than buying back shares? Sure we would, because that's a little bit more accretive for our shareholders. But we've got to maintain our discipline on pricing, and we've got to realize that sometimes these acquisitions have to brew for a little while before they're ready and sellers have to come around to the fact that they're ready to sell. And so we certainly think that, over time, we will replace that roughly $200 million of EBITDA from Wheelabrator. It's just not going to happen overnight. James Fish : And Joe, as I said earlier to Corey's question, I mean, we've kind of afforded ourselves the luxury of really being disciplined here, because we really have -- if you look at our second quarter, you look at our net cash from operating activities and you back out the cash tax benefit, we're $45 million in second quarter of last year, and that quarter includes all the divested businesses. So in -- on a net cash from operating activities line and on the free cash flow line as well, if you -- you got to normalize the free cash flow for CapEx. But on both those lines, we have essentially replaced Wheelabrator and Puerto Rico and the Maritimes. And really, the only acquisition we've done is Deffenbaugh, and we've had it in the company for a quarter now. So what we'll do in terms of capital allocation is continue to opportunistically buy back shares, which we're doing here -- which we did in Q2 and, again, in Q3 and look to use those proceeds to buy companies at attractive prices. Joe Box : Got it. Switching gears over to the New York City contract. I know it potentially is coming a little bit closer. Can you guys maybe just talk to what your current contracts are? I know you guys have some transfer stations in the market. And maybe talk about if you are participating in the new RFP and how you kind of sit in that market. James Trevathan : Joe, I'll address the bid that's out now, the RFP that's out. We have provided a proposal for that volume. We are on the short list, along with Progressive. It appears the city has begun discussions with Progressive, and we're awaiting what the next steps are. Progressive, as you remember, was the incumbent for that volume, and what happens to it, I guess, will occur over the third and fourth quarter. We still have the transfer stations in place, receiving volume from the New York -- from New York City, a couple of those big transfers, Joe, and nothing has changed with regard to that volume. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital. Scott Levine : So just looking back at your initial guidance for this year. I think I assumed a $0.03 to $0.05 year-over-year hit from recycling. And obviously, your current guidance is assuming much more than that, and I'm guessing a little bit bigger hit from FX. So really, just trying to get a sense. You're guiding to the upper end of the range here. Where's the upside versus your initial expectations coming from to more than offset the greater headwinds in recycling and FX? David Steiner : Yes. It's really coming sort of across-the-board, right? I mean, on the volume side, although the actual percentage declined and the volumes isn't as good as we thought it would be, frankly, the flow-through that we're getting from the new volumes is better than we thought it would be. And so the point is that we're getting the right volumes. We've consistently hit or beat our targets on our SG&A numbers and on our operating costs. And so really, it's -- what I've said is that everything that we've got going on from an operational point of view seems to be working, other than recycling. And then obviously, we've got the interest savings and the share count going down from the share buyback, and that's benefiting the year. And so when we look at our business, we'd say everything is sort of clicking on all cylinders other than recycling. And so, what is it that we can do to fix recycling? That's -- like we say, that's a long-term issue, but we're making good progress on it. Scott Levine : And to be clear, is there -- and I don't know if you mentioned this, is there a tax rate assumption implicit in your guidance for this year now? Or has it changed at all or no? James Fish : For the remainder of the year, I would assume that, that will be a 35%, and that's what we baked into the guide. Scott Levine : Got it, 35%. Okay. And then as a follow-up. I think, David, you mentioned that the acquisitions you're contemplating here in the back half into 2016 are all solid waste. Just wanted to confirm if that's right and just to see if your thoughts had changed in any way regarding the energy waste business, in particular, and/or industrial waste, since you had the breakdown in commodity prices and the landscape's changed so dramatically. David Steiner : Yes. What we are looking at the back half of the year is most certainly solid waste assets. When you look at things like energy services, we're going to be a player anytime one of those transactions becomes available. We think long term, that's a good space to be. Clearly, short term, it has some challenges. And so you've got to look at it from a long-term valuation point of view, recognizing that short-term valuation is -- might not be what the sellers are trying to sell it on. So we'll play in every one of those bids, but we're not going to -- look, everybody wants to get paid based on when things were blowing and going. They say, \"Well, this is just a short downturn.\" Well, you know, we're not going to make that assumption. When we look at it, we're going to make an assumption on where we think the business is going to go over the next 5 to 10 years, and we're going to value it accordingly. So we haven't bought anything new in the oilfield service space because seller expectations on price haven't come down as much as our view of value. So I would expect that if you look at what we're going to buy over the next year, it will be focused primarily on solid waste. Scott Levine : And what are sellers' expectations there, in general? Is that market kind of more rational in your view than oil services or not? David Steiner : Yes. I mean, look, we've always said that, for us, it's pretty simple on the solid waste side. If you assume that our long-term multiple is somewhere around 8x, right? It's been higher than that; it's been lower than that. But let's call our sort of long-term view of our multiple at 8x to 9x EBITDA. Why would I pay someone more than 8x EBITDA when I can buy a business I know real well, our own business, at 8x EBITDA? And so -- look, we have lost a lot of deals right out of the chute because sellers are expecting 10x to 12x EBITDA, and that's just a number that doesn't work with our model. And so could we buy more businesses? Absolutely, but we'd be buying those businesses at very high multiples, which obviously reduces the benefit to our shareholders. And so we'll continue to look for those deals that we can buy pre-synergies at 8x or less and then post-synergies, hopefully, at sort of, as we've always said, 5.5x to 6x EBITDA. If we can do that, we're pretty much guaranteed that, come hell or high water, it's going to be accretive to our shareholders. James Fish : Scott, and I think the -- kind of the opportunity landscape here in terms of what sellers are looking for is pretty broad. I mean, there are some folks that are looking for -- and, in some cases, getting -- 12x to 15x. We're not in -- we're not talking to those folks. But there are folks that are much more reasonable, and obviously, Deffenbaugh was one that we felt we got at a very attractive multiple. And so we'll continue to talk to companies like Deffenbaugh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk : David or Jim, I just wanted to clarify. On these deals that you've laid out, the $50 million, $75 million, are these close? Are we at the goal line? Or are these things that still have a few hurdles to get over? I'm just questioning why put this type of color out there today? David Steiner : Yes. Well -- so I'm going to define the goal line for you, Al. There's really -- there's 2 goal lines : there's getting a deal signed; and then the second goal line is getting a deal approved by the government. And getting the deal signed is a pretty simple process. For some reason, the government has been taking a long time. I mean, look, you saw our Kansas City deal, and it took them 8 months to approve a deal where we weren't even in the market, right? And so it didn't seem like it should take that long to approve it, and it took a very long time for the government to approve it. Now they've got a lot of big deals in the pipeline at the Department of Justice and FTC, and so I assume that's what's causing the delays. And so what I would tell you is, the first goal line is getting the deals signed up. The second is regulatory approval. We will be past that first goal line very short term. I mean, as far as getting the deals signed up, we're pretty much there. And so now the question is, how long is it going to take us to get those deals approved and what constraints will we have around getting those deals approved? And that's just such a wildcard that, that's why we wanted to let you all know, we pretty much got these deals signed up for $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA, but now we've got to get across the regulatory goal line, the due diligence goal line. There's -- as you know, from signing to closing, it's complicated, not only from a business and a due diligence point of view, but from a government point of view. And so we're pretty much past the first goal line. We're now marching toward that second goal line. James Fish : And that second goal line, Al, is -- that's not an easy one to get over. We had a deal recently where we had agreed -- we'd crossed the first goal line -- we had agreed on purchase price months ago, but the HSR process was daunting enough for these folks that they just decided, \"For now, we're going to back away.\" So we both agreed to a -- what we both agreed was a reasonable purchase price. But we just felt like that second goal line was not going to be achievable, at least in the near term. So we decided to part ways for now. Al Kaschalk : So it sounds like this is multiple trans -- several acquisitions as opposed to a single transaction? David Steiner : Yes. Well, the $50 million to $75 million that we're talking about is comprised of one larger transaction that would generate the bulk of that and then, obviously, some smaller bolt-on. Al Kaschalk : Okay. David, I want to push back on the volume comments here. The stock got absolutely crushed after Q1, and the number that you put up, I don't know if it was 2.6% or 2.8%, but pardon me for not recalling that. And you had articulated, as a company, getting towards that 50 basis points down to flat, exiting -- I believe, exiting '15. David Steiner : Yes, yes. Al Kaschalk : So can you maybe just a little better refine the sequential trends here? And in particular, is this -- this was an overall volume comment? Or was it specific to solid waste about the volume trend? David Steiner : Yes, it was specific to solid waste. But let me put some sort of color around where we see the volumes going for the back half of the year. So let's start out with our industrial volumes. Our industrial volumes were flat for the quarter, and the only reason they were flat is because energy services obviously is down. So when you look at the rest of the business, industrial is actually positive. So when you look at what we would look at before we got into the energy services business as sort of our core solid waste business, industrial volumes are actually positive, and we don't see anything on the horizon that would stop that momentum. And so even with energy services down, they're flat. So we'd expect those volumes to turn positive in the third or fourth quarter. Looking at the commercial volumes for the quarter, they were down 2.2%; now that's a 60 basis point improvement from the first quarter. We would sort of expect that rate of improvement to continue. And so if you see that rate of continuing -- rate of improvement continue, by the back half of the year, you're sort of at that negative -- call it, negative 1% on commercial volumes. Residential volumes were down, let's call it down 3%, 3.1%. But we don't really honestly even look at residential volumes, because when we're losing those volumes, they're generally low profit, very low-margin volumes. And so we're not that concerned about losing those volumes. And then the landfill continues to be very strong. So when I look at volumes for the back half of the year, I look at volumes -- I'm looking at the volumes that make us money, right? And when you look at the volumes that make us money, it's industrial, commercial, landfill. Industrial is going to be positive, landfill is going to continue to be positive and commercial is going to get better. And so when I look at that, when I look at those 3 components of the volume, I say, \"Look, the rest is all just noise.\" As Jim talked about, when you're getting -- when you're passing through transportation to your customer and you charge your customer $100 for transportation, they pay you $100 and it costs you $100, you make no margin on it, I don't care if I have that kind of revenue or not. And so when I look at the revenues that actually make us money, we see some really good trends, and we expect those to continue in the back half of the year. James Fish : Al, I'll add one thing to that, which is recycle volumes. I'll give you an example. We have a plant that's -- a big plant that essentially cut their volumes in half. And by doing that, they improved the quality of the material coming in. They went from, call it, $0.5 million a month loss to breakeven by doing that. So that's similar to the resi volumes. And that's yes, we lost volume on the recycling line of business, but not a bad thing for us on the income statement. Al Kaschalk : Right, right. Okay. My final question, I want to ask about this whole capital allocation and question why I guess, we lay out -- by the way, is the share repurchase in your [ph] open market transactions versus an accelerated share repurchase? David Steiner : We haven't made a final call on that. But we did an accelerated share repurchase in the first quarter, and I wouldn't be surprised if we did one in the second. Al Kaschalk : Okay. The second -- I guess the... James Fish : On the 14th [ph]. Al Kaschalk : To that end, David, why quantify a certain one quarter out of share repurchase program target versus -- you're in it for the long haul here, but -- and then as well as shareholders are, to just not maybe specifically allocate capital to those markets so that you can give yourselves some flexibility to execute on M&A? Maybe the stock gets hit, maybe it doesn't. David Steiner : I think that's a great point. And where we are right now is, we're still sort of in the -- what I'd call the final stages of replacing that Wheelabrator EBITDA. I will tell you that, as Jim pointed out, we've basically replaced it through operations. That obviously takes a lot of pressure off of our need to do acquisitions. But we want to see what we can get put together in the back half of the year from an acquisition point of view so that then we can make that long-term call on where we are in share repurchases. So Al, I would expect that when we give guidance for 2016, we'll be able to say, \"Okay, here's what our expectations are for acquisitions, and here's what our expectations are for long-term share repurchases and an approach to the dividend.\" And so I would say that in 2000 -- at the beginning of 2016, after we've sort of went through the market and determined what we can buy and what we can't buy, that we would be able to give you a more long-term view of share repurchases. Al Kaschalk : But to be fair, David, I think what you said earlier this year that by the end of Q2, you would kind of know -- I guess you're asking for an extension, from the outsiders looking in. Because I think you said earlier this year that by the end of Q2, you'd have an idea what the M&A would look like to execute here. David Steiner : I'm not sure that I'm asking for an extension. But I am saying that -- yes, like I said earlier, you go into this process thinking, \"Well, this is going to be simple. There's a bunch of sellers that want to sell, and we're a buyer and this should line up fairly easily.\" And at the beginning of the year, it absolutely lined up easily. Jim talked about a transaction, and if we had done the transaction Jim was talking about, we pretty much be -- have replaced the Wheelabrator EBITDA and we'd be moving on and telling you what our long-term share repurchases are. It's only been in the last month where that -- the risk of HSR was too much for the seller to take on, and so we pushed that aside. And so I'm not looking for an extension. I'm just saying that it's a fluid process. It's not a onetime event. And it didn't play out as fast as we would've liked it to play out. And so the back half of the year is going to continue to be a little bit more fluid, and then we can get more certainty going in 2016. Al Kaschalk : Yes. But I guess you were playing a little analyst earlier in terms of 8x, 9x on what you're trading at. And if you're down now with the stock price where it's at, at the level, it sure would seem to make a lot more sense to buy back stock than to chase M&A. But I certainly understand the need to grow back the EBITDA level, but I think I'm looking at what the realization is on asset valuations out there. It looks pretty attractive at 8x here. David Steiner : Yes, absolutely. Well, look, you're talking at a person that put $2 million of his own dollars into the stock. So I certainly thought it was attractive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Brown : Jim, so if we could just go back quickly to free cash flow, and you gave some really good color, but I do need a little clarification. So if you assume that the cash tax normalizes, I think you noted kind of a run rate base of $1.35 billion. But does that incorporate this $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA that you have kind of lined up? James Fish : It does not. So there's -- that is just growth on top of it. So that -- what I'm talking about with $1.35 billion is really normalizing. And by the way, what we'll do is -- I didn't want to give 2016 guidance, so I kind of gave you a nice starting point there, about $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion. Patrick Brown : Exactly, okay. So then you would add on kind of acquisitions, maybe some rollover of Deffenbaugh and then kind of whatever your growth is in the core business and plus or minus the other stuff? James Fish : That's exactly right. Patrick Brown : Okay, okay, perfect. That's very helpful. David Steiner : Need models? Patrick Brown : No, very helpful. And then can you just -- can you guys kind of work through or kind of remind us just what percent of the book is linked to CPI? I'm just curious how the 0% all-in prints [ph] today are going to impact the '16 pricing. I mean, is that more of a back-half issue? And I mean, should we expect the core pricing will take a step down in '16, just mathematically, from CPI? James Fish : Well, to answer your first question, Tyler, it's about 40% of our businesses is driven by CPI. I wouldn't say it's a back-half issue, because I think it's pretty evenly spread. It's kind of a midyear and then an end-of-the-year adjustment. So it's pretty evenly spread for us. And what we've always said about CPI is, to the extent that it hurts us, we'll make it up elsewhere with open market. David Steiner : And when we talk about CPI, CPI is not -- there is not one CPI. There's a lot of different CPIs and different contracts. What we've been trying to move toward is more of a industry-specific CPI, what we call the Refuse Rate Index. So that as our costs go up -- when CPI is 1% and you're giving people 3% pay raises, CPI just doesn't cover your costs. And so what we've been trying to do in our contracts is look at different types of indexes that more reflect the true costs in our business and try to get those true costs. And so I think as an industry, we could probably do a better job of making sure that we don't get linked to some arbitrary type of CPI, that we get linked to something specific to our industry. And so, when we talk about 40% of our business, a lot of that business -- or some of that business is tied to what we call this Refuse Rate Index, and we hope to move that percentage up. James Trevathan : And David, we've had some success in doing that in the first half of this year in some renewals, where we moved to more of a Refuse Index rather than just CPI. So there's some positive trends occurring. Patrick Brown : So is it -- I mean, is it a big portion of that 40%? Or is just kind of a small slice? James Trevathan : Yes. It's probably in the 10%, 15% of that 40%, and that's -- maybe it's 20%; I don't have the numbers in front of me. Within that range. David Steiner : And typically, Tyler, where we've seen more success in this is in the franchise markets in California. And we've had a couple of big franchise agreements that we've moved to Refuse Rate Indexes. James Trevathan : Tyler, I was trying to break out, at the lower end, we've done in the first half, we -- the Oakland contract is an example of what we did last year that's going into effect this year that's on that same basis. Patrick Brown : Okay, great. And then just lastly, real quick. You guys mentioned that, I think, overall landfill was up 3.2% and MSW landfill was up 7.2%. I think I heard that correct. I'm curious, is that a third-party number? James Fish : Yes. Patrick Brown : Okay. Any color on why landfill MSW has been so strong? David Steiner : It's been strong now for 2.5 years. And it's probably mostly tied to when we bought the Oakleaf business, and we retained that broker model. And we went out to the folks that brokered the collection business for us and said, \"Look, we want you to keep that collection business. You're making good money on it. We want to keep it. But in return, we want you to bring those volumes to our landfill.\" And that was very successful, and that's when we saw the rates go up. And then -- look, over the last couple of years, I think we've also seen -- as an industry, we've seen MSW grow. So I think the specific actions that we took with respect to our brokers and then the general economy have both been good drivers of MSW. James Fish : I tell you, Tyler, the encouraging part about it's not only the volume piece there but really the price piece, if you look at unit rates at our landfills, I was looking at it last night, over the last 5 years, I mean, we've really increased unit rates at our landfills by waste stream, whether it's MSW or C&D or special waste. So we've -- I was kind of thinking along the same lines as you. Does this volume mean that we're seeing a deterioration in price as I think about it by -- in unit rates? And it's not. I mean, it's, since 2011, nice increases and it's every year, nice increases for MSW, special waste, C&D. Patrick Brown : Okay. Yes, very good color because that's what I was going to ask. And I mean, it sounds like -- is the landfill pricing a key initiative as you look forward? James Fish : Absolutely, absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael Hoffman : So I -- a little bit on the volume issue. If you look at commercial same store, kept the customer, had the customer, that volume's up, isn't it, in the container? David Steiner : Yes, that is correct. Michael Hoffman : Yes, right. So when you have a 7.2% from third party, there's some number that's got to be in that direction in your commercial market same store? David Steiner : Yes, that's correct. Michael Hoffman : Right, right. So you're benefiting from what the industry is benefiting, because we've had -- you and I interfacing with the economy outside of work, outside of home is driving more volume in the container. David Steiner : Yes. And again, look, we don't want to declare that the good times are here. But you all have heard me say over the last couple of years that we have fits and starts in the various statistics, and we still haven't seen a very clear-cut trend until last quarter. And that trend continued into this quarter. So when you look at -- this really is the first quarter where all of the indicators are positive. And again, that doesn't mean we're going to go from a negative 2.2% to a positive 5%, but we don't have to, right, in order to try to make our numbers in the back half of the year. We just want to see continuous improvement. And so weights are up, service increases over decreases are up, the churn rate's down. On the industrial side, we've had really strong new business pricing. So this is really the first quarter where I would say all the indicators are positive. Now look, we all know that can change on a dime. But right now, I'm more optimistic about volumes than I've been over the last 5 years. James Fish : And Michael, I want to really reemphasize something here that -- and that is that because this industry -- you've been around a long time. The industry has a history of either being one or the other. You're either price or you're volume, and there's nothing in the middle. And so while we're seeing some nice momentum here on the price side, David went through it in detail a few minutes ago, we are not conceding our strong approach on pricing. I mean -- and that's why we want to make sure we gave that explanation of yield versus core price that Jim and I walked through, because we are as strong as we have ever been on pricing. We're just starting to see it. Maybe it's the economy. But we're starting to see that our volumes are looking promising. It's early in the third quarter, but July looks promising as well. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So -- you've set me up for a perfect follow-on, Jim. I think of waste as having sort of put their foot down on the accelerator on price right to the floorboard for the last 4 or 5 years, and you took the volume consequence for that knowingly. Where are you -- or are you even contemplating feathering that where instead of being 100 miles an hour, you're going 80, but now, you're not pushing away what could be deemed good business, in particularly, commercial, that now that this volume trend's coming too? David Steiner : Yes. Look, just the simple math. You've all have heard us say it a million times that you need to get 3% volume in order to make up for 1% price. I mean, that's just simple math. And you can't get 3% volume by giving away 1% price. So the weighting of where you want to focus will always be on price. What we want to do -- and by the way, if we, as the largest player in the industry, switch and go after volume, what do you think the industry's going to do? I mean, look, we're the largest player, and we recognize the position that we're in. So what we want to do is make sure that we get our fair share of the growth and that we grow the right volumes in the right places. And so I don't think -- when you talk to industry participants, I don't think you'll ever hear anyone say, \"Well, Waste Management's doing a volume grab in market X or market Y.\" Do we have individual contracts that we've done where we've gone after volume that I wasn't particularly happy with it on a national account side or somewhere like that? Yes, we've done that in the past. But it is -- that's certainly not a pattern that you will see out of Waste Management. And so we're always going to favor price over volume. But in a growing market, we ought to get our fair share of the volume too, because we can get our fair share of the volume and that won't have an effect on the overall industry pricing dynamic. And so -- look, it's pretty simple economics. In a better economy, we think we can get both price and volume. James Trevathan : And I might add to that, that we've also, because of our price leadership strategy, have begun efforts to improve our service. We realize that there are some improvements that need to be made to make sure we're providing that service that's worthy of our price leadership position, and we're doing a better job of that. You see it in the churn rate. We see it in metrics. We're not done with it, but we have progress in that regard. James Fish : Jim, I was just going to say that. Michael, when you talk about going from about 100 miles to 80 miles an hour on pricing, look, we've had a lot of discussion recently, to Jim's point, about a differentiated strategy. I mean, you can still go 100 miles an hour on pricing if you're differentiated. I mean, if your strategy is differentiation with things like the industrial business, where we provide expertise and -- that others don't have and the size of our balance sheet, things like that, or whether it's bringing technology to bear or, to Jim's point, improving customer service, all of those enable you to keep your foot on the price accelerator. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So but to Jim T's. comment, then the churn rate must be coming down, if the service relationship is getting better. James Trevathan : It was -- it's not where we want it to be. But 10.3% is a whole lot better than 12.2% that was -- that it -- that Q2 of '14. So absolutely, we see improvement and we expect more. David Steiner : And by the way, Michael, just to expound on that, so -- it shouldn't be lost that we improved the churn rate 190 basis points, but we didn't materially increase the rollbacks, right? I mean, in the past, what we've seen is that we've been -- one of the ways we improve the churn rate is we -- our rollback percentage goes from 25% to 60%. This quarter, we reduced the churn rate by 190 basis points with a virtually nonexistent change in our rollback percentage. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So we've known each other too long because you just anticipated my next question. So that was -- you're retaining more price, too, then. Is that... David Steiner : We're hanging on to that. Michael Hoffman : All right. So now I'm changing gears for a second. Some housekeeping questions, Jim Fish. Starting share count for 3Q should be about 454.5 million. Is that the right way to think about it? James Fish : I think more like 457 million, I think, is the number. Michael Hoffman : What's the 451.8 million, then, that's in the press release plus the comp numbers of -- like 2.8? I can follow-up on that. But I just want to make sure I have the starting place. And then on tax rate, just a follow-up on a question asked earlier. That's 3Q and 4Q should have a 35%, not that the full year will be 35%? David Steiner : Correct. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And the working capital, you didn't talk about that. Where are we in DSOs and payables for -- the sort of your plan there? James Fish : I'm sorry. David Steiner : DSOs and DPOs? Michael Hoffman : Yes. James Fish : DSO and DPO, yes, we've made some nice progress there over the last 2.5 years. We've made a nice progress sequentially and year-over-year. We -- year-over-year and sequentially, from Q1, we've improved DPO by about a little bit less than 3 days, DSO by a little less than one day. When I look at it over kind of the time period that we've really started working on this and I -- over maybe a 2.5-year period, we've really improved the combination of the 2 by 9 days. It's not totally out of the realm of possibility that we couldn't crossover at some point down the road. We're still a ways away from that. Some of our areas have started to cross over where their DPO is higher than their DSO. But yes, I mean, I'm pleased with the progress, but won't be completely pleased until we cross over like most companies are. Michael Hoffman : All right. So just to put numbers on that. You're still in the mid-40s on DSOs and high 20s on DPOs, days? James Fish : We're in the low 40s on DSO, and we're -- we've crossed over to 30 now. We're above 30 on DPO. Michael Hoffman : Okay, okay. And then I didn't -- maybe you said this, but I was writing some of your numbers and I missed it. But what was the special waste trend at the landfill in the second quarter? David Steiner : Yes. The special waste was 2.4%, as I recall. Let me -- just looking at the volume, it was 2.4% for special waste. And then -- but when we look at it, we sort of look at special waste, C&D and revenue-generating cover. When you look at special waste, it was 2.4%. But revenue-generating cover, which is essentially special waste, was above 10%. Michael Hoffman : Well -- and I guess where I was going, it was wet in a lot of places in the country, and special waste is predominantly dirt. So there's a good chance that we could see a special waste number that's much bigger in 3Q because you just couldn't get heavy equipment in to move the dirt around. David Steiner : Yes. We actually had that discussion with our folks out in the markets. And you obviously had some wet down here in the Texas area. You had it up in the upper Midwest. I think what our folks would say is the pipeline looks pretty strong. We don't expect special waste to slow down in the back half of the year. So I think they're pretty optimistic about it. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then on the deal commentary. Just to be clear. I get these are -- the ones you've got targeted are solid waste, but that doesn't preclude you -- you made a comment earlier, David, that I want to do is make sure I understand. You would buy hazardous waste business or an energy waste business under the right circumstances. That's just not what you're targeting at the moment. David Steiner : Yes -- no. Absolutely, we would. And we consider those sort of core solid waste-type businesses. Those are areas where we can apply our expertise very easily. What we aren't going to do is what I led 5 years ago, which is, get into some other types of businesses that -- where we can't take our solid waste expertise and apply them very easily. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Saving the best for last, Jim Fish, on free cash flow. If I take your $1.5 billion and I look at it on what's the recurring operating cash generation, I got to pull out $300 million, right, $100 million for asset sales, round number's $200 million for cash tax. So I start at $1.2 billion and then you're suggesting you'll be $1.35 billion potentially, not giving guidance. But none of that has any deals in it. So that's a pretty healthy $150 million swing. How much of that's working capital versus the optimization programs, cost saves, organic? James Fish : Part of it, Michael, is you pull out $100 million in acquisitions. But -- I mean, in dispositions. But we do dispositions every year. And so we sort of always assume that we're going to do, call it, $50 million to $100 million of asset dispositions. And so that -- I'm not sure that you pull out that full $100 million. David Steiner : And how did you get to the $1.2 billion? I know you pulled out the cash tax piece. What else did you pull? Michael Hoffman : Well, you have asset sales, so I can't predict that number, right? Because I can't write a chart between 1 -- $50 million and $100 million. So if I say it right, with the business generating in its own cash $1.5 billion less $100 million for assets, $200 million for cash taxes puts it at $1.2 billion. $1.2 billion goes to $1.35 billion, that's a $150 million year-over-year improvement and there's no deals in that. I'm just trying to understand... James Fish : I'm trying to also kind of normalize CapEx. I don't know what my CapEx is going to be next year, but 2014 CapEx was $1.150 billion. 2015 CapEx is going to be $1.3 billion. So on -- by the way, on a smaller business, at this point, I mean, we don't have Wheelabrator, we don't have Puerto Rico, we don't have maritime. So I'm kind of -- I'm adding back a bit there in CapEx, too. But it's hard to say what are -- we know we're going to have some CapEx next year for Oakland. We had some this year for Oakland. So it's not going to be $1.150 billion again, but it may not be $1.3 billion either. David Steiner : And Michael, you and Jim are talking the same number. The only difference is the divestiture piece basically. And I think that's the whole point, Michael, is that it's the divestitures and the CapEx that can move around a little bit. So when you look at the sort of the long-term history of what we've done, both on CapEx and on divestitures, you sort of get to that $1.35 billion number. Michael Hoffman : Okay, yes. What I was really trying to understand is what made up the $150 million. And so some of it is CapEx. How much then is organic versus the optimization programs you've initiated over the last couple of years? That's -- how would you... David Steiner : We'll get into that. I mean, I don't want to try to parse it to the penny, because frankly, we haven't done that. We'll certainly do that next year when we give 2016 guidance. So that's probably a better time to try to parse it down to the penny. James Fish : We'd still get asked the starting point though, so we did have that answer. Michael Hoffman : Right. So we're agreeing -- both agreeing on $1.2 billion. So that's good enough. All right. David Steiner : Certainly. James Fish : And Michael, the -- your question about share count. I mean, the difference between your 451 million or 452 million and my 457 million is just the effect of using weighted average common shares outstanding, and that's -- that has to do with the midyear share repurchase. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini of Morningstar. Barbara Noverini : You talked a little bit about differentiation earlier in order to push price, and I thought we'd focus on the residential business just a little bit. My sense is that Waste Management used to differentiate themselves with recycling services in a bundles contract. But now that you're heavily scrutinizing recycling, how else do you differentiate in residential outside of recycling? Is winning or renewing municipal contracts in this competitive environment increasingly dependent on the bundled services you're able to provide municipalities? David Steiner : Yes. So I don't think the bundling of recycling with residential slows down. In fact, frankly, it's more of an opportunity to bundle it, because given the asset mix that we have, we're one of the few companies that can actually make money on recycling. So it probably gives us a little bit of a competitive advantage as far as bunding recycling with that -- with the -- with residential services. But when we look at the residential line of business, we start out with, let's keep the contracts that we have at current rates or higher rates. And keeping the contract that you have is all about service, right? Most municipalities, if they've had your service for a long time and they're happy with it, the citizens aren't looking for a change just to save a little bit of money. And so the first part of our residential strategy is keep the contracts that we have at the same or higher rates, and we've got a very high success rate of doing that. And then the second piece is, find out where we can be competitive advanced -- competitively advantaged. So if it's in a market where we have recycling capability and no one else does, can we bundle it with recycling capability?  If it's in a market where we have different types of disposal assets and different green initiatives that we can bring to the table and that's what the customer wants, that's how we'll differentiate ourselves. And so for us, it's a 2-part strategy. It's, make sure you keep your current contracts, and that's by providing spectacular service. And then it's, find out where we can win bids that aren't based solely on price. Because if they're based solely on price, we aren't going to win. And so let's find those markets where service, recycling, green initiatives, make a difference, and let's go in and win those bids. James Fish : I think there are are several things. I mean, we almost look at it by line of business. Because what differentiates you in the industrial line of business is different than what differentiates you in the residential line of business. So as we -- and in fact, we're in the process of going through a strategy preparation to present to the board here in August, and we're focusing specifically on differentiation in one case and it is by line of business. So maybe we bring different technology to the table, maybe -- certainly, operating efficiency because so much of the residential business is driven by price, that you've got to be as efficient, from an operating standpoint, as you can in residential. Operator : I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Steiner for closing remarks. David Steiner : Thank you. Thank you all for joining us. We've had a strong start to the year.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the third quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Egl, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Egl, you may begin. Edward Egl : Thank you, Junisha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Fish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Trevathan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release, and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. David and Jim will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. During the call, David and Jim will also discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS, or earnings per share. And David and Jim will address operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin, as defined in the earnings press release. Any comparison, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2014. The third quarter of 2014 results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect the fundamental business performance or results of operations, and by excluding amounts attributed to businesses and assets divested in 2014. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release footnote and schedules, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information of our use of non-GAAP measures.

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner. David Steiner : Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our strong third quarter results continued what we saw through the first 6 months of the year. Disciplined pricing and cost control programs driving improvement in our business. In the third quarter, we earned $0.74 per share, an increase of more than 10% from the third quarter of 2014. Each of our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin, and earnings per diluted share improved when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Through the first 9 months of the year, our operations have generated almost $2 billion in cash provided from operating activities, which is a 16.5% increase from the prior year when you exclude divested businesses. Our strong performance puts us on track to exceed our full year goals, and we're excited about the positive momentum built into the fourth quarter and heading into 2016. Again, in the third quarter, our pricing programs continue to be a big part of our earnings growth and margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4%, which is consistent with the third quarter of 2014 and yield was 1.8%. Core price in the industrial line was 8.4%. In the commercial line, it was 5.7%. In our residential line, it was 2.2%. And in our landfill line, it was 2.3%. Year-to-date, through September, core price was 4.2%, which exceeds our 2015 core price target of 3.8%. As we saw in the first half of the year, core price continues to drive margin expansion as our traditional solid waste business operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin increased, when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Turning to volumes. When we look at our business, we track traditional solid waste volumes, which excludes recycling and non-solid waste revenues. Our traditional solid waste volumes were basically flat, declining only 0.1% in the third quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 1.9% in the third quarter of 2014, 180-basis-point year-over-year improvement and a 50-basis-point sequential improvement from the 0.6 decline in the second quarter of 2015. Overall volume, which includes recycling and those non-solid waste volumes, declined 1.4% in the third quarter. In our industrial line of business, the positive momentum that we saw in the second quarter continued into the third quarter. Strong new business pricing outpaced the price of lost business. So we were able to get both a strong price and positive volumes in the quarter, as industrial volume was a positive 0.4% in the third quarter of 2015, improving 290 basis points from negative 2.5% in the third quarter of 2014. We also saw the rate of decline in our commercial line of business improve again, as the rate of loss in commercial volumes improved 360 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014 and 90 basis points, sequentially, from a negative 4.9% in the third quarter of 2014 to a negative 1.3% in the third quarter of 2015. This is the best commercial volume that we've seen since 2006. Our service increases continued to exceed decreases, and new business in our commercial and industrial lines combined exceeded lost business for the second consecutive quarter. These are all positive signs that make us optimistic that volume should continue to strengthen into 2016.  Turning to recycling. We continue to work together with our customers, vendors and industry groups to improve the long-term outlook for recycling through educating the public on what and how to recycle to bring down contamination levels. We have also made progress on renegotiating contractual terms with our customers, including exiting some unprofitable contracts. Ultimately, we want to provide recycling solutions that both meet our customers' needs and generate an appropriate return for us. Recycling is the right option for the environment, and we're working to make it the right business decision for our shareholders as well.  Moving to current results from our recycling operations in the third quarter, earnings per share from the recycling operations were flat compared to the third quarter of 2014, despite a 15% drop in average commodity prices and a 6.4% decline in volumes, which is largely associated with contractual losses as we shed unprofitable business. Our recycling employees performed incredibly in reducing operating costs and improving the business. In the third quarter, we saw a 7% improvement in operating cost per ton compared to 2014. So we're moving in the right direction and our results in 2015 will exceed the expectations we laid out earlier in the year, but there's still a long way to go to get the appropriate returns on our existing assets. With respect to potential acquisitions, as we mentioned on our second quarter conference call, we believe that we can execute agreements to add an additional $50 million to $75 million of operating EBITDA in 2016. Recently, we closed on 2 acquisitions that we expect to generate approximately $18 million in operating EBITDA in 2016. Our pipeline still looks strong, and we're in the advanced stages of some transactions. Consequently, we still believe that we can close transactions that will generate $50 million to $70 million of additional 2016 operating EBITDA. So we expect to see strong operating EBITDA growth from our core business and from acquisitions in 2016. But I'll remind you that the operating EBITDA from acquisitions won't translate to earnings per share in 2016 because we'll have corresponding intangible amortization. However, the transactions will generate cash flow, which is the most important metric in our business. And we expect that our cash flow in 2016 will be strong. In conclusion, we've seen 3 consecutive quarters of strong results, and we're confident that strength will continue as we conclude the year and look forward to 2016. This performance is a tribute to our employees executing our pricing, disciplined growth and cost control strategies. We're confident that our employees' focus on our core business will allow us to meet the analysts' fourth quarter consensus of $0.67 of adjusted earnings per diluted share, which will allow us to exceed the upper end of our 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance of $2.55. We also expect to exceed the upper end of our full year free cash guidance of $1.5 billion, in which case, we may decide to prepay some items to help offset tax and other cash flow headwinds in 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail. James Fish : Thanks, David. In the third quarter of 2015, SG&A costs continue to be a bright spot in our results even as we face tougher comparisons to the prior year. Overall, SG&A costs improved $8 million compared to the third quarter of 2014. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.8%, an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014. With the strong results in the first 9 months of 2015, we expect to achieve our full year goal of reducing SG&A costs by $60 million. Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities was $657 million compared to $627 million in the third quarter of 2014 after adjusting for $45 million from the divested operations. Other impacts on our cash provided by operating activities were $40 million paid to complete our withdrawal from the central states pension plan and a $60 million reduction in cash taxes paid. During the third quarter, we continued to improve our working capital position, as we reduced days sales outstanding by 1.4 days and increased days payables outstanding by 3.9 days. We're pleased with these results as our team has done a terrific job of making these improvements, and we expect to see continued improvement into 2016.  Free cash flow was $358 million in the third quarter 2015, an increase of $20 million when excluding free cash flow from divested operations in 2014. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $335 million, $28 million more than the third quarter of 2014. As David mentioned, we've generated almost $2 billion of cash provided by operating activities through the first 9 months of 2015. In addition, we've generated over $1.2 billion of free cash flow. Given that, we expect that free cash flow in 2015 will exceed the upper end of our guidance range of $1.5 billion. David mentioned that we would prepay some expenses in the event that we exceed our free cash flow guidance. An example might be prepaying cash taxes. We currently anticipate that our 2016 cash taxes will increase by $300 million to $400 million. If we have excess free cash flow, we may elect to prepay some of the cash tax increase at year-end to lessen the impact of this increase.  Third quarter revenues were $3.36 billion. We saw a $53 million increase in revenues from acquisitions and a $48 million increase in our traditional solid waste business. We also saw an overall revenue decline of $186 million from divestitures, a $49 million decline from lower recycling revenues, $47 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues and $41 million in foreign currency fluctuations. Looking at internal revenue growth in the third quarter. Our collection and disposal core price was 4%, with total volumes declining 1.4%. This led to total company income from operations growing $24 million, operating income margin expanding 110 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $29 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points. In each case, compared to third quarter 2014 results. Our collection lines of business continues to see the benefit of core price and disciplined growth as operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margins grew. In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive core price in the third quarter. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year for the 10th consecutive quarter, up 3.6% from Q3 2014. MSW volumes grew 5.9%, C&D volume grew 4.9% and special waste volumes were a positive 2.4%. Total landfill volumes increased 4%. Our special waste pipeline looks strong and we expect to see landfill volumes remain strong through 2016. Moving to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, operating costs improved 140 basis points to 62.4%. Lower diesel costs and lower recycling commodity rebates to our customers contributed $73 million to the improvements. We also had reduced expenses from foreign currency fluctuations. Subcontractor costs improved $17 million and labor and related benefits improved to $12 million when compared to the third quarter of 2014 as we continue to see improvement from our service delivery optimization program. These savings were partially offset by increased disposal costs related to our improved volumes and slightly higher maintenance costs. Overall, operating costs improved $91 million in the third quarter. Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-total capital ratio was 63.3% and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 8% at the end of the quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased 5.9 million of our outstanding shares for $300 million and paid $172 million in dividends. This $472 million reflects our confidence in the cash generation of our business and our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. Our income tax rate in the third quarter was 32.3%, which compares to the 30.6% for the third quarter of 2014. A tribute to the late and great Hall of Famer, Yogi Berra, our third quarter results were d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. We've seen 3 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement, and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. All of our employees have worked hard to deliver these solid results and for that, I want to thank them. We are very confident that we'll continue to deliver strong earnings and cash flow to complete a successful 2015 and set us up for continued improvement throughout 2016. And with that, Junisha, let's open the line up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital. Scott Levine : So just looking for maybe a little bit of an update on the pricing environment, core pricing looked like it was pretty strong in the quarter, but it sounds like a lot of the gross margin expansion you're getting is from lower fuel and commodity costs. But are you still seeing a pretty good pricing environment out there? How are you progressing with regard to your price gauge? Are you still getting good margin expansion associated with your internal pricing activities? David Steiner : Yes, I'd say sort of as a follow-on to last quarter, I would say that the overall pricing environment is as solid as I've seen it since I've been at Waste Management. We see real good progress across all lines of business, except for our residential line. And as you all know, the residential line is traditionally the most competitive line. I would say even in the residential line, though, we're seeing very disciplined pricing based on return on invested capital type of metrics from the large national players. It's always sort of those small, local and regional players that seem to sometimes forget that if you offer a lower price and you invest a lot of capital in those residential contracts that over the term of those contracts, you don't make as much money as you think. But even in the residential line, what we're seeing is sort of those large national companies are bidding based on return on capital not on chasing low-priced volume. So I'd say, overall, I'm extremely encouraged by the pricing environment, we expect it to hold into 2016. Scott Levine : Got it. And maybe shifting to tax a little bit here. So I don't know if Jim had given a tax rate assumption for the fourth quarter. Did you give one? James Fish : I did not. Tax rate in the fourth quarter is going to be similar to the third quarter. Scott Levine : Okay. So, let's say, about 32%. And then with 2016, you mentioned $300 million to $400 million pickup in cash tax, but for some of this prepayment, maybe a little bit more elaboration there. And if we do get renewal bonus depreciation, might you see a significant benefit associated with that, and one that you might be able to take an early shot of quantifying? James Fish : Yes, if we do get bonus depreciation -- and thanks to our slow-moving Congress, it seems like that always happens at the very end of the year, but it's probably going to be in the neighborhood of $70 million, Scott, for bonus depreciation. And then when you think about that $300 million to $400 million, really that's, of course, that's the prepayment from last year of 2 14. It's the 150 or so from the early extinguishment of debt transaction earlier in the year. And then combining all those benefits with earnings growth in 2016, our cash tax headwind will be somewhere in that $300 million to $400 million, which is why David and I both mentioned the fact that we probably will prepay. Certainly the -- probably half of that benefit from the early extinguishment of debt will get pushed forward into '16. And then depending on how we do with respect to free cash flow, it's possible that we will prepay additional taxes at the end of the quarter. Scott Levine : Got it. So said another way, maybe -- it's like maybe at least half of that increase in '16 to be pulled into 4Q based on what you expect right now? James Fish : I think that sounds about right. Scott Levine : Got it. One last one on the M&A side. So you're essentially, I guess, affirming the EBITDA, the target that you expected to acquire for next year. Should we assume those are kind of your traditional solid waste acquisitions? Or has your review changed at all with regard to, call it, the nontraditional waste business, whether it's industrial, energy or otherwise. James Fish : Yes. No, that would be core solid waste. We would consider hazardous waste and energy services both to be core businesses. And if we found some transactions in those areas, we'd look at them. Obviously, we would look at them based on today's environment, not on tomorrow's environment or yesterday's environment. But when we talk about that $50 million to $70 million of additional on top of the $18 million that we already closed, we would -- yes, we'd look at those more as traditional solid -- you'd look at it as traditional solid waste businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Corey Greendale : First, I wanted to follow-up on Scott's question about price, it sounds like the environment is favorable, overall. But I guess, first of all, can you just verify, I had from my notes that about 40% of your revenue base is tied directly to CPI? Do I have that right? James Fish : That's about right, yes. Corey Greendale : So can you just address that portion specifically? Given where CPI is at, should we expect a lower price in those markets in '16 and what does that imply for overall price growth in '16 relative to '15? David Steiner : Yes, when we look at our CPI business, we always look at it and say, look, there's nothing we can do about CPI because it's a government-posted stat that we cannot control. So sometimes we're going to get hurt, sometimes we're going to get helped by it. It seems over the last few years, all we've done is get hurt by it. So in 2016, we don't expect to have a benefit from CPI. In fact, we'd expect to have a little bit of a detriment to pricing from CPI in 2016. But like we've always said, we can't control that. What we can control is the core price on the rest of our business. And so if we aren't going to -- my guess is that we will have sort of a consistent core price target next year that we've had both in '14 and '15. And if we're not going to get it from CPI, we'll make up for it by getting core price on our other lines of business. Corey Greendale : Got it. And just to clarify. When you say you can't control CPI, obviously, that's true. But one of your large competitors has talked about trying to shift customers to more of a sewer water waste index instead of CPI. Is that something that you've thought about or doing at all? David Steiner : Oh, absolutely. We've actually done that. We've tried to use that index. We've also used what we call sort of our solid waste index. And so every time that we talked to the customers, look, this goes back 10 to 12 years ago when we first instituted a fuel surcharge because we saw fuel prices fluctuating. What has to happen is that everyone in the industry needs to say, look, this just doesn't make sense for us unless we look at these contracts with this type of adjustment in it. And so going back 10 years ago, when we first put in the fuel surcharge on our residential contracts, everyone said that's never going to happen because the municipalities won't accept it. And as the industry said, we're just not going to bid unless we have a fuel surcharge, customer started to accept it. It's the same thing with CPI. Look, every single company has been hurt by CPI in the last 5 years. And I think it's incumbent upon the largest companies to say, look, we're just not going to bid these under the traditional CPIs, or even worse, 75% of CPI type of contracts. And if the industry is able to do that, then you'll see municipalities change. But they're not going to change when only one player is out there doing it. So we've been doing that particularly in California for the last number of years and we'll continue to do that throughout the country. Corey Greendale : Yes, I understand. And David, can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about new business, kind of your selling effort in an improving economic environment? Whether -- what's the state of your sales force, you're growing the sales force, so you're changing how they're incentivized or anything like that to try to win new business? James Fish : Yes, I'm not sure I'd say that we're growing our sales force. I'd say what we're doing is we're sort of reallocating our sales force. From our perspective, what we've tried to do is put our sales force in those areas where it's growing. So when we look at a market area that's not growing, we might reduce the sales force. Whereas, when we look at a market area there that is growing, we might add the sales force. And so there won't be a drastic addition to our sales force, there will certainly be a reallocation of our efforts in those lines of business that are growing and in those geographies that are growing. Corey Greendale : Okay. And then one more for me. Dave, it sounds like you're making good progress on reducing your recycling processing costs. Can you just give us a couple of sentences on what that constitutes, whether it's a labor question or you're putting in different equipment, just what you're doing there? And then, secondly, the reduction that you've seen so far, how far does that take you towards your goal, I think the goal is reducing average cost per ton by $10 or something like that? David Steiner : Yes, I would say we're probably 70%, 2/3, 70% of the way there on our goals. There's still plenty of room for improvement. And those cost improvements have come from sort of all of the above. First and foremost, you'd have the operational improvements. But secondly, you have shutting down some of our more high-cost operations. And so we've basically shut down those operations that we would expect to shut down. There are some contracts that we need to get out of that are high processing contracts. And then, finally, we need to reduce those contamination levels. That's -- frankly, that's what drove the highest increase in our operating costs. And so working with our customers, we need to make sure that when we have a contamination rate goal in each -- in our contracts, which we have in virtually all of our contracts, we need to make sure that our customers are meeting those goals, and so we'll go in and do the audits to make sure that we're dropping those contamination rates. And so, look, our recycling folks have really done a spectacular job of approaching the operating cost from every angle. I think there's still some room for improvement in 2016, but they've done a heck of a job so far. James Fish : They're still there with some of those contracts that will fall off during '16. It will provide some structural improvement as well to the recycling business. David Steiner : Corey, I think that this is the first time that we have talked about, internally at least, 2016 not being a big down year versus the prior year in recycling. It's -- by the way, it's not because of any help we're getting on the commodity line, it's just that the efforts of our team to really permanently change the way the business operates on the cost side are starting to really bear some fruit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : So I just wanted to dig into the moderating decline in solid waste volumes. How would you explain the 180 basis point of improvement year-over-year? Is that more a function of waste fundamentals improving? Is it better sales execution? Or is it maybe just a function of your pricing is up, but it's not up quite as much? Just any color on that would be helpful. David Steiner : Yes, I would say that, primarily, it's related to improving fundamentals in the industry. We really aren't using price to go out and chase volumes. So you've got improving fundamentals across some lines like the industrial line where, frankly, in the industrial line, we probably could've grown it more in the last couple of quarters. But we're constrained by the number of containers and drivers and trucks that we have on the road. And so primarily, it's improving industry fundamentals. But we really have seen a nice improvement in productivity from our sales force. When I talked about it earlier, we're not adding a lot of folks to our sales force, but we are top-grading our sales force. And the folks we have right now are much more productive than they'd been in the past. And so it's really sales productivity and mostly improving business fundamentals. James Fish : Joe, we've talked a lot about, also, the fact that on the disposal side how important pricing is there. And when we see same-store average MSW rates up approaching 4% and kind of we just talked about CPI being close to 0 in almost a 0 inflation economy, we're pretty happy with that. I -- and at the same time, we see almost 6% growth in MSW volumes. To us, that's really where we've got to dig in is on the disposal side of our business. James Trevathan : Joe, I was going to add, also, that you've mentioned you're open with price comment, and we've maintained that approximate 4% core price number while improving volumes. We also had rollbacks for the quarter at about 18%. So that's a real improvement versus prior year. So all of those factors have helped improve volume. Yes, we've been maintained the price focus. James Fish : And to Jim's point, on the industrial line, our new business pricing is actually higher than our average rates, and so we're seeing real strong pricing on the industrial side. Look, industrial volumes are as close to a spot market as we have, as we've talked about many times. And the spot market right now is very strong. And so you should be getting both positive price and positive volume. Obviously, that will moderate as we come into the seasonality and the weather of the fourth quarter and the first quarter. But I would expect to see that improve, both volume and price improve, as we come out of the winter and get into the seasonal uptick next year. Joe Box : That's great color. And let me actually just follow up on that. You guys have made it clear that you do want to manage to a certain price increase, and I guess the specific metric that you're looking at is core price. Jim, you mentioned better rollbacks. And I think, David, you said something about the industrial business not necessarily coming in at a lower price. So I understand there are some nuances here. But how are you incentivizing the sales force to really minimize the impact of rollbacks and lower new business coming online with the exception of industrial? James Trevathan : Joe, our sales incentive plan for the account managers that manage our current business is directly linked to how much price they get for their current customers, and whether or not they're rolled back. So it is a direct impact on that sales rep when they increase rollbacks or they don't get their price, so it's a direct link. And that has... Joe Box : Okay. So it's not just core price? James Trevathan : No. Joe Box : It's also looking at rollbacks and where they're bringing on new business. James Trevathan : Absolutely. New business pricing, yes, the payout as well. David Steiner : And Joe, look, when it comes to the sales incentive plan, I think everyone that's ever managed a sales force would love to have EBIT as their core metric rather than revenue growth, right? Because you can get revenue growth at low margins and that doesn't do anyone very much good. We've got a tool that we're rolling out in '15. It'll be fully rolled out in 2016 that will allow us to measure profitability at the customer level. At that point in time, I would expect us to really look at the compensation plans and say, okay, rather than focusing on revenue and price, let's start now focusing on the actual EBIT that we're generating and start incentivizing folks to generate higher EBIT. How do you do that? By selling the right volume. By selling the right volume at the right price. And so we've got compensation plans in place right now that I think drive the right behavior. That's only going to get better through '16 and into '17. James Trevathan : In the meantime, Joe, we have absolute control over the pricing, the area level and the corporate for larger accounts. So we know exactly where our reps are going in from a price standpoint on an overall basis. So we're not waiting for that tool to help us in that regard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael Hoffman : If I could, just want to back up a little bit around the solid waste and the commentary on volumes, just to slice it once a little bit differently. If you looked at the same store volume trends on front-end loaded business, residential and your permanent roll-off, because I get the temporary has been very strong on the permanent. What's the trend on a same-store basis for each of those lines in collection? David Steiner : As far as waste go? Michael Hoffman : Yes, the volume. Just -- the direction, is it positive? Flat? Negative? David Steiner : Yes. I mean, obviously, it fluctuates slightly quarter-to-quarter. But I would tell you that the trend line is that both of them were slightly -- actually slightly negative this quarter, but the prior 2 quarters they were up. And so I would tell you that the trend line is up. So we -- and service increases have exceeded service decreases. So I would tell you that every trend line that we look at -- and as you know, Michael, I haven't been saying this for the last 3 years, but every trend line we look at is -- right now is positive. Michael Hoffman : Okay, so just to make sure I understood that. The overall trend in permanent roll-off front-end loader and residential since -- wait, since every day this stuff goes across the scale is positive, which indicates this improving volume pattern structurally. David Steiner : Yes, I would say that's true for commercial and industrial. Residential, we, frankly, we don't look at that. We look at that a little bit differently than we look at the other lines of business. So we're not as focused on waste in the residential side. Michael Hoffman : And fair enough, because it's really about the asset utilization of the equipment going down the route. How would you frame your churn trend at this juncture as well, with both the direction and then the rate of replacement? David Steiner : Yes, so the rate of replacement actually has improved fairly dramatically over the last 4 quarters. And the churn rate, so this quarter, we saw about an 80 basis improvement in the churn rate. But its stubbornly stuck at sort of that 10% to 10.5% churn. Our focus in 2016 is going to be to try to drive that churn rate down below 10%. Now look, again, this is a simple business if you want to use price as your lever. We can drive that churn rate well below 10% if we just exceeded every single customer asking for a price rollback. But as Jim pointed out, our price rollback trends are actually very positive, too. So again, when you look at the combination of trends, you can look at rollback and say, boy, rollbacks are going great. But if you're doing it by a price, not so great. And what we've done over the last 2 years is seen the churn rate come down marginally, not as much as we'd like to see it come down, but we've seen the rollback rates also perform very well while not giving away the price. And so the combination of the 3 is very positive. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. And if you -- go ahead, sorry. James Trevathan : I want to add another thing quickly to it, and that's the addition rate. I think you had mentioned -- questioned as well, Dave said it was very positive. I mean, we're about 200 basis points positive on the addition rate, and that's really helped some of the -- especially the commercial volume. We're positive in dollars in 15 of the 17 areas. The other 2 are fairly close and making real improvements versus prior years. So the trends are positive, but stay stressed. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And on the churn, given maybe stubbornly where it is. How do you think about it as that which you control versus that which you don't? And that which you control isn't so much about price as it's more service oriented. Things that you could fix and then you could keep doing what you're doing in price. David Steiner : Yes, I mean -- and roughly half of it is structural. The companies going out of businesses are relocating. And so that leaves you 500 to 600 basis points of churn that is voluntary. And you've hit the nail right on the head. I mean, every study that we've done since I've been at this company for 15 years, tells us that price is not the primary reason for churn. Now price becomes the primary reason for churn when you have a service failure. And so I always liken it to the cable companies. We all get a flyer every week that offers us a lower price for cable. There's probably a lot of people that accept that and say let's take it every time we can get it. But 90% of the folks say, you know what, the cost of changing out is too high. So I'll accept the fact that this price might be a little bit higher, but I'll accept it because the pain of switching is too high. Until the cable starts going out or the satellite dish starts going out. And then all of a sudden, that price offer looks pretty attractive. But every study we've ever done says that service failures drive churn, and that's why we've reinstituted what we have when I first came to this company 15 years ago, the service machine program, which when I came here 15 years ago did a great job of rallying the company around the customer. And we've tried to do that in the last 14 months. That's exactly what we've been trying to do, rally our company around the customer, and we're seeing some really nice progress in that regard. Michael Hoffman : And when you think about the efforts in productivity and the service optimization, is that what's giving you the comfort to say, 10 goes -- we go below 10% in 2016, as you correct that missed pickup, which is usually driven by a truck that broke down, things like that. David Steiner : Yes, I mean -- and you hit another great point, which is not just wanting to have great service. It's also being able to provide great service by having a truck that's operating, which goes back to maintenance and fleet and all of those types of issues. And so what we've done, Michael, is try to take a holistic view of what causes a service failure. And you're absolutely right, a lot of times it's because we don't have a truck that can service it. And so when we look at driving it below 10%, we really need to have all of our operations working in conjunction with our sales folks to execute flawlessly. And I will tell you not just at Waste Management, but throughout the entire solid waste industry, it is stunning to me that we do our jobs every day as well as we do them. But at Waste Management, what we said is good is not good enough. We have to be great, and that's what James got the company focused on. James Trevathan : Michael, one thing that we've changed in that regard, you mentioned the missed pickups, if you do a missed pickup measurement, and we're pretty good. We compete with almost any industry around this pickup that are reported by the customer. We've taken another view of that. We're looking now at -- Dave mentioned the maintenance side, we're looking at service failures where perhaps a truck went down late in the day, and we missed half a route, we're point to get back up tomorrow. Well, that's a missed pickup from the customers view and we're adding that to the metric and looking at it a little differently than just past when the customer responded to a missed pick up, trying to add and restore that confidence where a truck went down, and fleet's part of it. But the real issue is also -- is around our call centers and how well they are connected to the field, and we can respond to that customer's need in a more timely manner. So we -- it's a huge focus for us. It's been that way in the past but we're adding a little bit more color to it. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then, Jim Fish, I think I understand what you're saying about free cash flow, I just want to say it out load to make sure I get it. So I'm picking a number just to frame it. If $1.5 billion is this year's number, and all things being equal, that number would be midpoint of the $300 million to $340 million is $350 million. So if $1.5 billion is down by $350 million because of more cash tax, and then it grows based on all the other things you would do, and you're intention is to pay some of that $350 million this year, so that the $15 million would be less -- it's smoothing your cash is what I -- which is perfectly appropriate. I just want to make sure I understand it. James Fish : Yes, I think that's -- I'm not sure I'd use the word smoothing, but that's about right. One thing I would say, Michael, about free cash is that we're pleased with here is we've been kind of a $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion free cash flow company over the last 6 years. And I think what you're seeing is, in 2015 and going into '16, for those 2 years, is we're starting to become a more of a $1.4 billion free cash flow company. And that is really a function of all these things we've talked about. But is largely organic growth for us. Michael Hoffman : Right. So if you didn't prepay anything, it's not an unreasonable observation that sequentially the cash could be down. That's not a bad sign, since the timing of big flows like that. If we didn't have BD and all that, we wouldn't be having this conversation. James Fish : That's right. Without question, Michael, if we didn't prepay anything, because of the big headwind that we've got, we'd be down. David Steiner : I think Jim's point shouldn't be lost, which is we're sort of establishing a new baseline to say we're a $1.4 billion baseline free cash flow-generating company. Now some years we might generate $1.5 billion $1.6 billion, other years -- and to the extent that we can prepay those cash taxes to ensure that next year we hit that baseline of $1.4 million and who don't have those headwinds, we ought to do that. But going forward, I would tell you, Michael, that $1.4 billion is sort of our stepping off point. Obviously, we'll give more specific guidance when we give it in February. But at this point, I think we've gone from saying we're a $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion baseline free cash flow company to the -- we're a $1.4 billion baseline free cash flow company. Michael Hoffman : Yes, we agree. So how do you think about the sustainable growth rate of that $1.4 billion, if you took a 5-year view? David Steiner : Yes, I mean, as we've said, we think it's sort of 3% of 5% a year type of free cash flow growth. When I think about free cash flow, Michael, I will tell you. I think about 2 things. I think about -- and it comes back to our capital allocation program, which is, we can grow free cash flow by doing acquisitions. As Jim Fish like to point out, we basically replaced the Wheelabrator EBITDA not through acquisitions but through improvements to our business. We'll continue to add a little bit more acquisitions in 2016, as we talked about that $50 million to $70 million of EBITDA. But then I also look at cash flow on a per share basis. And as we buy back shares, cash flow per share is going to go up. And so as I look at it, when we look at our capital allocation program, we're going to have a nice balance that's going to both increase operating cash flow, but it's also going to increase cash flow per share. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then, Jim Trevathan, how would you frame your current on a same-store basis recycling plant capacity utilization? It's got 1,000 tons per day. Is it 60% or 80% run rate? And what can you do to improve that? James Trevathan : Michael, we're closer to that 80% than 60%. Part of it is volume-driven as well as specific plans, part of it is shutting down the plant in cities where we have to dual capacity. But that's the goal. And there's still room for improvement there. We won't stop at where we are with that, what, 7% to 8% improvement in cost. Year-to-date, that's still going to go further into '16. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk : I don't know if the fair question for this morning's call or not, but we'll give it a shot and see how we do. If I take a step back and look at the cost improvement side of the equation, and to your point about nearly replacing all of the EBITDA from Wheelabrator, are you suggesting that your -- at the goal line on sort of the cost -- annual cost improvements in the business? Or what's left in the tank? James Fish : I wouldn't say that, Al. I'd say that's, on the cost side, first of all, I'll tackle it from OpEx and then SG&A. On the OpEx side, we put -- over the last few years, we put on more computers in all of these trucks. And I would tell you, we're only kind of at halftime with respect to using the onboard computer to its fullest capability. For example, we can route our trucks dynamically, but that doesn't any good unless the driver follows the route that the computer generates. And then we're only following that route -- if you think about best-in-class, FedEx or UPS probably follows the route 95%, 97% of the time. We're kind of about 80% of the time. So while that may seem like pretty good and it is okay, that lasts 15 to 20 percentage points is worth a lot of money. So there's a lot of process work that's going into. We put the technology in place, there's a lot of process improvement that still needs to take place on the OpEx site. Maintenance cost is another component of OpEx. And I would tell you, we're probably not at halftime on maintenance costs. We're more like in the first quarter on maintenance costs. We don't use data as well as a lot of the companies, a lot of big companies use data to really proactively address maintenance cost as opposed to reactively addressing it, so you're not breaking down on the road. And we don't use it to the extent that we could. And so there's, I think, a lot of upside with respect operating cost going forward. Jim Trevathan talked a bit about the upside on the recycling side of our business with cost. And then SG&A, look, our goal for the last 3 years has been to get to a number below 10% of SG&A, I think that's -- because we haven't fully replaced the revenue side of Wheelabrator and the divested businesses, 10% of SG&A is going to be a challenge. But holding flat on SG&A while we still give our employees a merit increase, is no easy task. And so we planned from '15 to '16, again, to hold flat on SG&A, and that's on top of the $60 million that we said we would get this year. James Trevathan : Al, I might to Jim's mentioning of the onboard units, we were positive in all 3 lines of business on the collection side in Q3 and efficiency. And we're really starting a hard look at cost per unit and starting to move the needle on a CPU basis, which is where the money is, not just in a unit measurement, on a COGS per hour, for example. And that'll have a real impact. Volume has helped, but that's not the driver. We're still negative, for example, in residential volume, as Dave mentioned, and yet we were positive on the efficiency side. And moving that way on the CPU with real upside left as we fully implement SPO and some of the process work that will continue to work across all business. Al Kaschalk : Are you able to -- or as David put it, any thresholds in terms of the dollars, the cost of operation that come out on an annual basis or margin improvement beyond basis points? I mean, all of these -- I appreciate the macro commentary, and I know there was one on truck efficiencies down that 15, 20 basis points. But is there any way to help on the operations side to talk about maybe some goals and where that's at on a quantified basis? James Trevathan : Al, we don't -- I don't think at this time we're going to give you guidance for 2016. But we absolutely have targets both in dollars and in metrics. At the area level, the district level and all of these, we expect improvement. And hold people, ourselves, accountable as well as their areas, they hold their districts accountable. But this isn't just a shot in the dark. We have absolute dollar and metric goals for each of these metrics. James Fish : And as -- in that regard, I would say we're 33% to 40% there on the cost target. Like anything, when you start out with a cost program, it is the hardest thing to do in a company. And so we're about 33% to 40% there, but we're pretty confident that we're going to hit that target. It's a multi-year target, we're pretty confident that we'll hit it in the next 2 years. Al Kaschalk : Great. We'll certainly be watching, right? James Trevathan : We will as well. Al Kaschalk : On the acquisition side. Did I hear all areas where targets including energy service and energy waste, is that fair? But what you have in your line of sight is not -- is more on the solid waste side. James Fish : Yes. What I'd say is we're primarily focused on our traditional solid waste business, but -- we'll, let's now retract that. We are only focused on our core solid waste business. We're not looking to do acquisition outside of our core solid waste business. Right now, what we're looking at mostly is what I would call our traditional solid waste business. But we do believe that industrial waste and energy services are part of our core solid waste business. But when it comes to industrial base, we would certainly look at assets in that arena, because that dovetails perfectly with our industrial footprint. On the energy services side, I'd tell you that if we were to do a deal with energy services, we'd do an opportunistic deal. We are not actively looking to go out and expand our footprint dramatically in energy services business like we have been in the past. But if we combined some deals that are opportunistic and at the right price, we certainly think that, that long-term energy services is going to be a good line of business. It's not going to be a good line of business for the next year or 2. So we've got to see something on the long-term horizon at an opportunistic price if we're going to invest in energy services. Al Kaschalk : I don't have much in the way of discussion on hazardous waste. Is that something you're less focused on? Or just -- it's not imperative from an operational distribution point, collection route, density type of... James Fish : No, I think that's exactly right. It is a great line of business that completely overlays our footprint. The reality is that there are a lot more traditional solid waste providers out there that we can buy than there are industrial waste providers. And so I wouldn't say that we would -- we certainly would not preclude any transaction industrial waste. But right now, we're a little bit more focused on traditional solid waste. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Brown : I don't want to get too caught up in the vernaculars here, but can you give us what average yield was in industrial and commercial? I just assumed that, including the impact of churn, it's a bit more meaningful in volumes are improving. David Steiner : Yes, the average yield on the commercial side was 2.6%. And on the industrial side was 3%. Patrick Brown : Perfect. And Jim Fish, just a quick clarification, but when you talk about exceeding the $1.5 billion of free cash, are you including or excluding divestitures? James Fish : Yes, we're including it. There's not a lot there. It's a -- we excluded the big ones last year. So we've always included them, but they are cats, dogs and add up to not a huge number. But obviously, last year, we had to exclude them because they were all so big. Patrick Brown : Okay, but you are including them in the $15 billion this year? James Fish : Correct. Patrick Brown : Yes, okay. So I'm just curious, so what is exactly exceeding -- what's driving the exceeding of the range? I mean, are you coming in better on cash from ops? Or is it the CapEx just tracking towards the lower end? Or is a little bit of both? James Fish : No, it's definitely not -- it's not the latter for sure. CapEx is just kind of at the high end of the range. The range we gave for CapEx was $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We're at the high end of that range, we maybe even go a little over the top of that range, so it's certainly not because we're tightening down on CapEx. I think it is more -- when I look at EBITDA, that's really in my mind, kind of the best barometer for how a business is performing, and our EBITDA seems to be performing quite well. Some of it's from yield. The big puts there are really yield, operating expense. And then that takes are kind of the for energy services business. Our energy services business will be down as much as 30% for the year. So that's been a big take that we haven't really talked about. But -- and it just nets out against the progress we're making on the others on the EBITDA outside. James Trevathan : Tyler, the improving volumes have obviously helped as well on the free cash flow for sure. Patrick Brown : Sure. Sure. Okay, good. If I think about it, though, and I appreciate that you're not giving '16 guidance, but I'm just looking at the buckets. So if we start from cash from ops of, call it, 2 7, 2 8, wherever you guys end up this year. You're going to get back the $40 million of Central States Payment that you won't make next year. You're going to get some core EBITDA growth, just in the base business. You've got -- we've talked about the M&A that may be in the pipeline that comes on. And then you're going to lose the $300 million to $400 million of higher cash taxes, and then kind of whatever you think you'll do with that prepay. Is there anything else, big buckets wise, though, that I'm missing? David Steiner : I think working capital -- we're making some progress on working capital, there's a lot that runs through that line. But you mentioned this one big thing that ran through at this quarter, the Central States Pension is what makes it. But we're making a lot of progress, it kind of got masked a bit this quarter because of that Central States. But with DPO up 3.9 days and DSO down 1.4, it's pretty impressive improvement considering that it wasn't too long ago, a couple of years ago, where we were kind of a 20- to 25-day difference in the wrong direction. It was 45, 47 on DSO and 22 on DPO. We're now up over 30, approaching 31 on the DPO and down at 42 on DSO. So that we shouldn't lose sight of that. That has a big impact on cash. Patrick Brown : Sure. Okay. So working capital might help a little next year as well. Okay, and then on the M&A, I'm just curious, is at $50 million to $17 million EBITDA with justice at this point, for review? James Fish : Yes. Patrick Brown : Or does it have to go to review? James Fish : Yes. That level of purchase price, it has to go through Justice. And we do have one transaction that's going through Justice and some others in the pipeline. Patrick Brown : Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just my last question for Jim Trevathan. It sounds like you're core solid waste business is pretty solid. But I'm curious, have you guys seen anything, even small, a deterioration in the hazardous waste side of the house or maybe anything on your industrial services lines? James Trevathan : No, Tyler, we haven't. It's been very strong for us this year. The base business, more so than the event business, we -- our sites are, from a geography standpoint, sitting right where most of the construction in the petrochemical industry is occurring. Given the low energy cost, therefore, the low feedstock for that petrochemical industry. Our Alabama and our Louisiana sites, it's really good spot for base businesses as that industry grows. Even business on the West Coast on the haz side has been very good, especially the Pacific Northwest. And in places in the Southeast, maybe not so much, but that's kind of a mixed bag. But we're very happy with that business, and expect it to continue to improve. James Fish : Tyler, we -- anecdotally, Jim and I met with some of our big customers a couple of weeks ago over Louisiana. And those guys are all, as Jim said, kind of the beneficiaries of lower energy price. You've got the producers that are -- and the service providers that are kind of taking it on the chin, but you have the consumers that are benefiting. And we met with some big benefits of ours who are consumers, and they're very positive about their industrial business with us in '16. In fact, our haz business, even though it's still small relative to our solid waste business, our haz business is up year-over-year. Patrick Brown : Okay. Yes, I assume the Mill is very well positioned to capture that petrochemical story over the next few years. James Fish : Really... James Trevathan : Lake Charles, is sitting right in the middle of it. Patrick Brown : Lake Charles. Okay. James Trevathan : The Mill is good, but Lake Charles is better. Patrick Brown : Yes, perfect. Okay. And then just lastly, have you guys seen anything in the coal ash side? Is there anything to think about as we look to '16? James Fish : Yes. I mean, look we're in the early stages here of this opportunity. What we are seeing is that it's -- we think it's a good long-term opportunity for us. But it's also pretty capital-intensive. And I guess, that can be a good thing, because it serves to differentiate us from some of the small guys who can't put the capital into it. But it's still is very early. We're starting to see some of these companies make some decisions about coal ash and we feel like we're well positioned. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft of Gabelli. Tony Bancroft : On the -- back to the energy waste business with the slower sustained crude prices, customers probably are pretty cash strapped by now. Are you seeing any issues with your contracts with them, negotiations for concessions? James Fish : Yes, I mean, they've come back to us over the last probably 12 months and asked for price concessions. In some cases, we've made some price concessions; in some cases, we haven't. It's as much as anything a function of where our assets are relative to the drilling that's taking place. But certainly, there's been some real pressure in that business and that's why our revenue will be down probably 30% for the year. Tony Bancroft : Got it. And then I know you've discussed the M&A on your services side. But what would you -- so if a deal were to be done on a one-off basis like you mentioned, what would you -- what would be a -- what's the going rate right now? I -- can you give me sort of a ballpark what you would think you'd be paying? James Fish : Going rate in terms of a multiple, is that what you're asking? Tony Bancroft : Yes, yes. James Fish : Oh, it's -- I don't know. David Steiner : I'm not sure the multiple changes. But your forecast changes, right? In other words, it's a multiple of EBITDA and we aren't paying trailing 12 on EBITDA. What we're going to do is say, okay, let's look at a forecast of what we think is going to happen over the next 3, 5, 10-year horizon and let's discount it forward and figure out a reasonable multiple to pay. But I would tell you, again, when I look at our pipeline of acquisition, I would say that the pipeline that is the least full would be energy services. I mean, we are not actively looking at any transactions in any services of any magnitude. And so like I say, we'll be opportunistic. But we're not going to be as actively searching for deals in energy waste as we are going to be actively searching for deals in solid waste. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten of Macquarie. Adam Baumgarten : Just a quick one on dividend. I mean, you talked about this sort of 3% to 5% free cash flow growth going forward. I mean, is that what we should expect for the dividend? Or could we see some upside there in the years ahead? David Steiner : Yes, we've always said we want to have a balanced dividend, where we want to have a payout ratio somewhere around 50%. We want to be in the top quartile of S&P 500 dividend paying companies. We're in that sweet spot right now. We've had pretty consistent growth in our dividend over the last few years and I'd expect that to continue. Operator : You have a question from the line of Barbara Noverini. I'm sorry. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Egl for closing remarks. David Steiner : Thank you. I'll fill in for Ed. I wanted to thank the entire Waste Management team for some spectacular business results. But every once in a while, an event happens that makes you realize that the reason that we all are here is not for business, it's for family. And we actually had one of those events yesterday when Jim and Ren\u00e9 Trevathan welcomed Georgia Marie, their grandchild. And... James Trevathan : Number 8, Dave. Number 8. It makes me feel old. David Steiner : Number 8. So Jim is going to start some routing programs for his grandchildren, because he now has 8 of them running around. It makes you realize what's important. And I certainly hope that Georgia Marie has as good a 2016 as we expect to have at Waste Management. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management conference call.

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2015 was a very successful year as our commitment to core pricing, disciplined growth, and controlling cost generated our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. We grew our income from operations and operating EBITDA and achieved the highest operating margins we've seen since 2010. We generated earnings per share of $2.61 in spite of the divestitures of our Wheelabrator, Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada operations and headwinds from recycling commodity prices and foreign currency translation. In 2015, we saw the execution of pricing, productivity and growth strategy strengthen our foundation in a way that will lead to continued growth in 2016 and beyond. During 2015, our strong free cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We've seen solid growth in cash generation in our business over the last few years, and we're confident that our free cash flow has reached a new base of at least $1.4 billion per year, up from the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion level that has characterized the last several years. As a result of confidence in our cash flow, our board decided to increase the dividend by 6.5% in 2016 and to authorize up to $1 billion of share repurchases. We acquired Deffenbaugh and several small solid waste companies in 2015. And in early 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Southern Waste Systems or SWS. The acquisition of SWS and other smaller tuck-ins we expect to close in 2016 should generate between $50 million and $75 million of operating EBITDA in 2016. As we previously mentioned, the operating EBITDA from these acquisitions won't translate into earnings per share in 2016 because we'll have corresponding intangible amortization. However, the transactions will generate cash flow in 2016 and incremental earnings starting in the second half of 2017. Looking at our operations in 2015, our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. When we gave initial guidance for 2015, we targeted core price of 3.8% for the full year, and we exceeded that target. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2% with yield of 1.8%. We've now seen eight consecutive quarters with core price of 4% or greater. For the full year, core price in the commercial line of business was 6.1%, industrial was 8.6% and the landfill line of business was 2.4%. For 2016, we expect core price to be about 4% and total revenue growth from yield should again be in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Our pricing themes continue to perform at high levels, and we'll continue our focus on price in 2016. But pricing excellence is not a one-year project at Waste Management, it's a way of life. We must get pricing to keep up with inflation, and we have the tools and the people to do that indefinitely. Our traditional solid waste volumes which include our collection, transfer and landfill volumes were a negative 0.5% for the full year. But importantly, we saw positive trends throughout 2015, with traditional solid waste volumes improving sequentially each quarter, culminating in a slightly positive fourth quarter. Although commercial and residential were still negative, we continue to see positive momentum in those volumes, particularly in our commercial line of business. In that line, we have seen six consecutive quarters in which the rate of decline has improved. And commercial collection was down only 0.7% in the fourth quarter versus down 1.3% in the third quarter. Our continued focus on disciplined volume growth and customer service is paying dividends. Our churn was 10.1% for the full year, the lowest level since 2012. In the fourth quarter, it was 9%; the lowest level since 2002. And we did all of this while reducing rollbacks in 2015. So, we're keeping our customers through improved service, not price concessions. We saw our new business exceed our lost business for the eighth consecutive quarter. These are all positive signs that our volumes are headed in the right direction without resorting to lowering prices. Total company volume which includes lower margin recycling, brokered, and non-solid waste volume decline 1.6% for the full year, with the fourth quarter being the best quarter of the year, declining only 0.9%. For 2016, we expect that traditional solid waste volumes will be positive. However, we do not see a recovery in recycling and non-solid waste volumes which will lead to overall volumes being about flat. Of course, some of the recycling volume that we lose is a direct result of our efforts to shed unprofitable volume. So, losing certain volumes in the recycling business is not such a bad thing. And we expect that overall volumes will turn positive in the second half of the year. As you can see, the price and volume trade-off continues to be very positive. For the full year, the company's income from operations grew 4.6%. And our income from operations margin grew 120 basis points. In addition, operating EBITDA increased about 3%. And operating EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points, to 26.5%. Our solid EPS growth was achieved despite a $0.09 per share decline from our energy and environmental services business, which has been affected by the sharp decrease in market prices for oil, a negative $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation, and a negative $0.04 impact from recycling operations. Looking more closely at recycling, we made significant progress improving operating costs and on renegotiating contractual terms with our customers, including exiting some unprofitable contracts. Our recycling employees worked hard and reduced gross operating expenses by 15%, and changed contracts where possible to allow us to charge a processing fee where we previously paid rebates. Without these operational contractual improvements, we had estimated that the recycling impact could be as much as a negative $0.08 to $0.10 per share ,as average commodity recycling prices declined 17.5% in 2015. However, the operational improvements lessened that negative impact to negative $0.04 per share. On the recycling commodity price front, 2016 has seen a continuation of the downward slide, and current prices are down $20 per ton, or 23%, from January of 2015. These are levels that we've not seen in nearly seven years, since the 2009 recession. If we do not see a normal seasonal uptick in commodity prices and prices remain at January levels, this would be a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind in 2016. We're committed to recycling, and we'll continue to work to change the business model to generate revenue that covers our processing costs and drive out operating expenses so that the business is sustainable over the long term. Turning to free cash flow. Our strong operating results, coupled with continued discipline in capital spending, allowed us to generate $1.41 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Included in that free cash flow number was a $150 million prepayment of 2016 cash taxes. We had mentioned on the third quarter conference call that we'd make this type of prepayment, given that our cash flow is going to be above the high end of our $1.5 billion range. Consequently, we increased our 2016 guidance to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. So, when we look at our success in 2015 and our guidance for 2016, we look at three things. First is price. In 2015, we exceeded our goals. And for 2016, it's pretty much locked and loaded and already in process. So, we're very confident we'll meet our 4% target in 2016. Second is costs. Again, we did well in 2015. And we believe there's plenty of room to improve in 2016. So, again, we're very confident. And finally, volumes. In 2014 and 2015, we built momentum. And for the first time in many years, I'm very confident that we'll see our volumes turn positive toward the end of 2016. So, we go into 2016 with a lot of confidence, and look forward to another strong year. We expect that our continued execution of these strategic priorities will drive 2016 adjusted EPS to between $2.74 and $2.79. And, we expect operating EBITDA to grow at the fastest rate in 10 years, up 5% to $3.6 billion. But we can't do it without our people. I'd be remiss if I didn't thank them for their hard work and professionalism. And I know they will once again prove their value in 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2016 outlook in more detail. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, David. We produced solid growth in earnings and cash flow in 2015. And it would've been even better when you realize that recycling is down $0.30 per share from its peak. That is why we need to maintain our focus on fixing recycling. As David said, we're committed to recycling. And for the last two years, we've been working to improve our recycling business. We want to see recycling thrive, because it's the right thing for our environment and it's the right thing for our customers. We just want to make sure it's the right thing for our shareholders. We performed well in 2015, navigating the recycling headwinds, which I'll discuss in a moment. But we're in the fourth year of low recycling commodity prices, and we are currently seeing these commodity prices at the lowest levels we've seen since the 2009 recession. Since there's little we can do to affect global market conditions, we're doubling down on those areas we can control. We've tightened our belt on investments. We're driving operational efficiencies. We're working with our community partners to reduce the amount of expensive contamination at our MRFs. We're optimizing our MRF network and we're tackling the slow, difficult, but necessary process of changing the terms of our contracts. Together, these actions produce real, measurable results in 2015, and are expected to make recycling profitable over the long term. Initially, we expected the headwind in the recycling line of business would be between $0.08 and $0.10 of EPS. However, the full-year impact ended up only $0.04 negative. That was not driven by an improvement in commodity prices, but was due to the actions that we took to improve recycling operations. Recycling was one of several market factors we overcame in 2015. In addition to the $0.04 impact from recycling, we had a $0.09 per share headwind related to low demand for energy and environmental services, a $0.04 impact from foreign currency changes. Despite these market pressures, our EPS grew more than 13%, to $2.61 per share in 2015. We overcame those headwinds through cost controls and strong growth in our traditional solid waste business, and those efforts will continue into 2016. At the beginning of 2015, we expected to see a $60 million improvement in SG&A costs when compared to 2014. I'm pleased with our 2015 results, as SG&A cost for the full year improved $68 million to $1.34 billion, and improved as a percent of revenue by 20 basis points, to 10.4%. For the fourth quarter, SG&A costs were $343 million, an improvement of $27 million compared to 2014. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs improved 70 basis points, to 10.6%. For 2016, we will continue to focus on managing anticipated wage increases, cost inflation, and incremental SG&A brought on from the acquisitions. But despite these increases, we anticipate that SG&A costs should be flat when compared to 2015. Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $1.41 billion of free cash flow. As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we expected we would have a strong year of free cash flow and that we would likely make tax payments, assuming the tax extenders were not going to be enacted. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we prepaid $150 million of 2016 cash taxes. For 2016, we now anticipate between $60 million and $70 million of cash tax savings from the impact of bonus depreciation, which was reinstated by Congress at the 11th hour. During 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. In 2016, the impacts of organic earnings growth, bonus depreciation, acquisitions, and higher capital spending should drive free cash flow to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. In the fourth quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders through our dividends. For the full year 2015, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders, consisting of $695 million in dividends and share repurchases of $600 million. Our board has indicated its intention to increase dividends in 2016 by 6.5% to $1.64 per share on an annual basis and this is the 13th consecutive year of increased dividends. In 2016, our anticipated annual dividends will result in approximately $730 million being returned to our shareholders. We expect to spend around $100 million to $200 million on tuck-in acquisitions in 2016 with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We have authorization from our board of directors to repurchase $1 billion of our shares. We've already repurchased $150 million and expect to spend an additional $500 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were $3.25 billion. We saw a $59 million increase in revenues from acquisitions and a $50 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of pricing and volume. We saw an overall revenue decline of $163 million from divestitures, $43 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, a $34 million decline from lower recycling revenues, and a $33 million decline in foreign currency. Looking at internal revenue growth. For the total company in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2% and yield was 1.7%, with total volumes declining 0.9%. This led to total company income from operations growing $42 million, operating income margin expanding 150 basis points to 17.7%, operating EBITDA growing $37 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 150 basis points to 27%. For the full year, income from operations grew $97 million. Operating income margin expanded 120 basis points, and operating EBITDA grew $86 million, and operating EBITDA margin grew 130 basis points to 26.5%. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs in the fourth quarter. Our commercial core price was 5.8% with yield of 2.9%. Our industrial core price was 8.7% with yield of 2.3%, and residential achieved 2.2% core price and 1.5% yield. Overall, collection core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.2%. Our focus on customer service which helped reduce our churn and disciplined growth also benefited our volume trends in the fourth quarter as volume declined only 0.6%. The volume change was a 90-basis point improvement sequentially from the third quarter and a 190-basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. This core price and volume led to operating EBITDA growing $11.7 million and margin expanding 30 basis points. In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter just as we have all year. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.4% from Q4 of 2014. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year MSW rate increases. Total landfill volumes increased 0.5%, MSW volumes grew by 11.1%, and C&D volume grew 15.8%, while special waste and revenue generated cover volumes declined 7.4%. The special waste decline was predominantly driven by the decline in our energy services business. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $15 million, margins are growing 160 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $14 million, and operating EBITDA margins increasing 120 basis points. Moving now to operating expenses. These expenses improved by $50 million in the fourth quarter and as a percent of revenue improved 80 basis points to 62.4%. For the full year, operating expenses improved $328 million and as a percent of revenue improved 100 basis points to 63.1%. In 2015, our focus on improving operating costs saw a significant traction and we expect that to continue into 2016. For the full year, we saw improvements of $187 million in fuel costs, $102 million in cost of goods sold, and $35 million in labor costs as we continue to see the benefits from our routing and logistics program. Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.66 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.32%. A floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 8% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 32.4% in the fourth quarter and 32.3% for the full year. Taxes were a $0.01 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for waste management. As our employees did a great job on focusing on price, disciplined growth and cost controls. I want to say thank you to our employees for their hard work in delivering a successful 2015 and positioning us to continue that into 2016. We're excited about continued growth from 2016 and beyond. And with that, Karnethia, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Your first question is from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Good morning, guys. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Scott. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Scott. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : So, it seems like steady-as-she-goes in terms of the organic growth trends, that the pricing environment is pretty healthy, that the volume environment is generally improving, and is expected to improve albeit gradually with volumes inflecting positive by the end of this year. But anything surprising, either to the positive or the negative on the macro or the industry front either geographically or relative to your expectations \u2013 or really, are things just kind of continuing to improve at a gradual pace, and there is no real change in the operating environment in general? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Scott, when I look at the business, you can sort of say, I think your right, the growth is fairly muted from the economy. But you can pretty much say, the business is firing on all cylinders save two areas, and that's recycling and energy services. And I think we all know what the macroenvironments are for that. I mean, it's low commodity prices, not just oil but cardboard and plastics. So, I think you hit the nail in the head. It's steady-as-she-goes. We continue to see the other lines of business doing very well and we don't expect that to end in 2016. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Scott, I would say that the only thing that was surprising was kind of a positive, we weren't surprised obviously by the headwinds with recycling or energy services. But we were pleasantly surprised, when you look at the construction business, I mentioned we were up over 15% in C&D waste stream. And that really, to us, is kind of a foreshadowing of good things there in 2016. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Understood. And then, it sounds like you're baking in an expectation here of $50 million to $75 million EBITDA. You've been talking about this for a while. Could you tell us how \u2013 how much of this have you closed on with the SWS acquisition? How much remains to be closed? And maybe a little bit more commentary regarding the M&A landscape in general and whether we may see some upside to your $100 million or $200 million spend or valuations in the marketplace, a little bit more color there. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I would say 80% to 90% of it is locked in with SWS. I mean, that's going to be the big acquisition that we do in 2016. When I look at acquisitions, we've done RCI in Montreal. We did Deffenbaugh in Kansas City. And now, we've done SWS in South Florida. And those were spectacular acquisitions for us because they're a fairly large amount of revenue but they're also straight tuck-ins into our business. And so, we know exactly how to do them. We know exactly how to get the dollars out. It takes a little bit of time but we know exactly how to do them. So the more of those that we can do, the better. We thought there might be a few more of those in the pipeline but those, call them, those $400 million to $500 million transactions, we really don't see a lot of those on the near horizon right now. So, I think 2016 will be a year where it's mostly driven by tuck-in acquisitions. But again, we'd love to do some larger acquisitions like those three that we did in Montreal, Kansas City and South Florida. Pricing, I don't think it's changed dramatically. We've said it many times, we generally pay a little bit lower price for those smaller tuck-ins and it's because you can pay a little bit higher price when you get that bigger bulk of business like we did down at SWS although even with SWS, on a post-synergy basis, we'll end up paying sort of 6 to 7 times EBITDA. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Got it. And as a follow-on to that, assuming \u2013 is there any change in your interest level in energy and industrial and \u2013 or if we get a floor in commodity prices on the energy side, could we see your interest pick up as 2016 plays out or you're still focused predominantly on solid waste? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We're focused predominantly on solid waste and I think we've said it the last two conference calls which is, look, long-term I think energy services will be a great business. But we're not out there looking for businesses. I think it's going to be a prolonged, flattening of oil prices. And so \u2013 and energy services, if we buy something in energy services, it would be opportunistic. We're not actively out searching for businesses in that line of business. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Got it. Thanks, David. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Corey. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Corey. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: So, two questions. First, Jim, I was hoping \u2013 Jim Fish, I was hoping you could help bridge the cash flow from ops guidance from 2015 and 2016. I calculate your guiding to a $300 million to $400 million increase EBITDA, your guiding to $160 million, so just what's accounting for the rest of the increase? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so when we look at cash flow from ops or if I look at free cash flow because I want to include in there, CapEx, if I talk about free cash flow \u2013 and if that doesn't answer your question, let me know, but if I talk about free cash flow for 2016, I have a starting point of let's call it $1.41 billion from this year. And then I'm adding in EBITDA growth. You mentioned $160 million, we're kind of calling it $170 million in EBITDA growth year-over-year which includes \u2013 that includes organic growth, that includes some of the benefit of acquisitions. I add in the impact of bonus depreciation which I mentioned was let's call it $70 million. And then our CapEx is going to be a bit higher this year. I mentioned the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range, so back out $100 million in added CapEx, I arrive in the middle of that range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. And keep in mind there, Corey, that the prepayments that we made in cash taxes is really offset by the benefit we got from the Q1 2015 debt transaction. So, those two kind of offset each other so that walk-forward works without a cash tax, the cash tax difference. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: That did it for my question. Thank you. And one clarification. I think you've said this, but the EBITDA that you're expecting to get from acquisitions, the number that you gave, is that only from Southern and new acquisitions? So, in other words, you're not including rollover effect of acquisitions in 2015? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, there's a small rollover effect from 2015 but the bulk of it would be the SWS and the tuck-ins we do in 2016. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Okay. Then next question, you addressed the environment in general when you were answering Scott's questions. But given that we have a lower \u2013 a low CPI environment, you're committed to continuing, like you said, pricing is not a temporary thing, it's the culture. I guess the question is how confident are you that you won't be pushing away more volumes as the year goes on given that CPI will be quite low? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, look, we've done it the last three years consecutively. We've seen our churn rate come down while we've maintained that core price at 4% plus. And so, look, it really comes down to making sure that you service your customer. I mean, if your customer is happy, they completely understand that our costs go up every year, and you've got to get those price increases. And we've always said that it's a fairly small portion of our customers' overall cost structure. So, getting that price increase to maintain inflation plus really hasn't been difficult as long as you can maintain the service levels to the customers. And so, that's really where we're focused this year. We know how to get the 4% core price. We've got those plans, like I said, locked, loaded, and we're already executing them. So, we know we can do that. The key is having that great customer service which allows you to keep that low churn rate, also keep price rollbacks down and get that positive core price. And so, like I say, we've got it sort of clicking on all cylinders, but we can always do better. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great. And then on the kind of competitive and acquisition front, David, I'd just love to get your thoughts on whether the proposed Connections acquisition of Progressive has any impact on those markets and also whether you might be interested in some of the potential slots that may be coming out from that? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, I think Ron did a spectacular job in picking up that business and everywhere that we compete with Waste Connections, they are a tough competitor but they are a fair competitor, and so we certainly welcome them into the markets. I don't know how to say welcome in Canadian but we welcome them into the markets. But the other thing is I would love \u2013 I'm glad you brought it up. I owe Ron a phone call to let him know that to the extent that they have to get rid of any business that we would certainly be interested in buying any pieces of those business that we can buy. So I'll make sure to give him a call today and let him know that. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great. Let me know if you need his phone number, I can send that to you. And then just one last quick one, if you don't mind. I'm whipsawing back to Jim Fish. Given the EBITDA guidance, I'm coming out at a slightly different place on EPS. I was hoping you might be able to give us some sense of what you're assuming on interest expense and share repurchases? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Interest expense will be up slightly. We finished the year at $384 million in interest \u2013 cash interest. They will be up slightly, not a lot, maybe call it $5 million and then share repurchase, look, we said that we'd probably repurchase \u2013 we've already done $150 million. We said we'll probably do another $500 million on top of that for a total of $650 million, which kind of approximates what we bought last year. We bought $600 million last year. We have authorization for $1 billion, probably won't spend the full $1 billion in 2016. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Got it. Okay. That actually moves me in the wrong \u2013 is there anything going on in the equity income or loss line, or anything else below the line that's changing meaningfully from 2015? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. Not that I can think of. Maybe we can reconcile it for you. If I look at EPS, I mean, that's what you're concerned about, right, is EPS? Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yes. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : If I look at EPS, from $2.47 to $2.61, we had divestitures that were worth $0.18, so I'm backing those out. And then, we had \u2013 and I'm reconciling 2014 to 2015 for you here. But then, we had shares and interest. We had traditional solid waste growth of $0.08. We had some unusual items. Specifically, our energy services business was $0.09. And then, when I look at moving from $2.61 up to our range of $2.75 to $2.79, I'm really adding in the kind of our traditional solid waste growth that we expect, and we talked about on the EBITDA line. So, hopefully that helps. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yeah. That's fine. I'll let you move on. If I come up with a question that I could ask otherwise, I will follow up offline. Thanks, guys. Thanks for the time. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, David. Just want to dig in a little bit more on the relationship between core price and yield. So, if we go back and look over the last few quarters, including Q4, it looks like the spread between core price and average yields actually widened out. And at least from an outside perspective, it just looks like you're keeping less and less of that core price increase. Can you guys talk a little bit about that relationship and why that spread is widening out? I mean, it sounds like churn is actually trending well, and the gap between new and lost business isn't widening. So, is it mix or what's going on there? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, you hit the nail on the head with mix. The reason we moved to core price is because core price is really an indicator of the price increases that we put across our current customer base. To go from core price to yield, you then put in \u2013 because we do it on a per-unit basis, you then come in to a lot of things like mix. And so, the biggest thing that we think drove the disparity between the core price and yield was the fact that our energy services business was down fairly dramatically, and those are very high-priced hauls. Compared to \u2013 if you look at an energy service haul compared to an industrial container at a shopping mall, the price per haul difference is dramatic. And so, the fact that energy services dropped off, as we said, $0.09 for the year, when you saw that dramatic drop-off in energy services, you lost a lot of those very high-priced pulls, and that's where the biggest chunk of the disparity between core price and yield comes in. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. No. That's very helpful. And then, Jim Fish, just can you help us out a little bit on cash taxes? You got lots of moving pieces here. So, first off, just simply, what was cash taxes paid in 2015? And then what is exactly contemplated in the guidance, just the total dollar number, just ballpark? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : 2015 was $434 million. So, if you assume that we've got the offsets for 2016, 2016 is going to look like kind of that $433 million. We'll get a benefit of about $70 million from bonus depreciation. And then a piece of kind of incremental taxes on earnings gets us to a cash tax figure of around $400 million, is our expectation for 2016. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Good. That actually answered my next question, so I'll kind of move on here. But just David, really quick, can you guys talk about where you are on the coal ash front? And is this \u2013 well, first off, how much did you move in 2015, if any? And then, is this a key driver in your confidence in back half volume growth? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, so, we're seeing \u2013 it was a piece of our growth in 2015, not a huge piece. We've got one customer that has started with us. We've got three different plants that we're working with them on. Really, one of them was started in June, the other one started kind of November, December, and then the third will start in 2016. So, not a huge impact for us. And we're kind of seeing the public utilities move at varying paces here, in terms of remediation on that side of their business. Recall there is this \u2013 there's another side of their business, which is the perpetuity. And so, we can use either on-site management for their continuing needs, we can manage it off site through our landfills, or we can offer them beneficial reuse. So, we're equipped to handle all three. We think that will ramp up in 2016, but not a huge impact in 2015. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay, good. And then, just, Jim, lastly. How much did you pay for SWS? Just what will we see on the cash flow statement in Q1? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : We paid $516 million for SWS. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I wanted to ask around the industrial side of the business, industrial waste space doing well. What I wanted to find out is just kind of an update on how much of your business is directly linked to the industrial economy? And when you look at the portions of the industrial (41:21) perm business, temp business, what do you see in 2016? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, it's interesting when you look at our industrial. Our industrial line of business, as we look at it, includes a couple of different business types. It includes large retailers, it includes manufacturing and industrial. It includes construction, and it includes energy services. And those really were \u2013 there was a wide spectrum there. Construction, as I mentioned earlier, really finished the year on a high note. So, we're very happy with that, and it looks like it's going to do well going forward. The large retailers were pretty solid, as was manufacturing and industrial. Looks like \u2013 industrial production figures came out today, and looks like they're decent, and that's kind of what we saw as well, pretty solid in manufacturing and industrial. The one real soft spot, and you'll hear it several times today, was energy services, and it got worse throughout the year. So, we were down 32% in our energy services business, albeit on a kind of a small base there, but down 32%, and down 45% in the fourth quarter. And looking through that kind of small lens, we don't see energy services getting much better in 2016. But overall, if you want to think about how we talk about industrial, it was \u2013 it more than compensated for the downturn in energy services. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think everybody gets concerned that there's going to be some kind of industrial recession. I mean, look, in our business, what you had happen last year was obviously, you had the inventory build and then working off the inventory. And that's what I think drove everybody to say, oh, gosh, what's going on in the manufacturing sector. As Jim pointed out, you saw some good numbers from it today. But when they build up the inventory and then they work down the inventory, they don't shut down their plants. They still operate their plants. And so that really just doesn't have that big of an effect on us. It doesn't have an effect on us until they shut down the plants. And I don't think anyone's seeing a shutdown of plants. I think they're seeing a little bit of a slowdown of the plants. And so when we look at our industrial waste, it really isn't going to be affected by the manufacturing and industrial space. And then the final piece is that a lot of the low energy prices are a big boon to a lot of the manufacturing and industrial customers that we have in the chemical corridor all the way from Beaumont, Texas up through the Midwest. And so, we see the manufacturing and industrial volumes actually being very strong. As Jim said, we've got a wide spectrum from extremely strong construction to weak on the energy services side. And manufacturing and industrial I'd say would come in on sort of the slightly positive side of that spectrum. So, we don't see that particularly slowing in 2016. And we expect industrial volumes to continue to be positive in 2016. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's very helpful. Just following up on the commentary, I think from the last quarter. You talked about some situations with shortage of drivers in the industrial side of the business. Is that a material headwind heading into 2016? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I'll jump in, Jeff. It is a headwind, but it's a weakened headwind. We are doing much better in that regard. The oil field services decline in 2015 has helped us in that regard in those markets where that kind of business exist as drivers have become more available. It's still in some of the larger \u2013 the higher growth markets, it's an issue for us, but we're working through it much better in late 2015, and then we expect too in 2016 better than in that 2013-2014 period when the oil field service business was booming. We'll manage right through it and we'll continue to grow our business on that industrial side with new drivers. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But look, it's a good problem to have, right? I mean, that tells you there's strong demand out there. We'll take that problem six days to Sunday rather than the alternative. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : One more question for me, if I may. On the CapEx side of the business, looking into 2016, are there any sizable differences in sort of in the buckets of investments compared to 2015? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, not anything sizable. We'll spend a little more on fleet capital, probably $20 million more on fleet capital. We've got about $15 million that is related to Deffenbaugh and SWS acquisition that we'll spend. And part of the reason we were a little lower than our guidance back at the end of Q3 in CapEx for 2015 was that we had some CapEx that was accrued and the cash didn't actually go out the door until Q1. So, we'll have a little bit of carryover and that's really what gets us from that $1.23 billion CapEx number from 2015, up to kind of the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Jim, maybe just a little more color around the fleet side of our business. Our supply chain folks and our field people have worked really well together. In 2015, for example, we purchased 12% more trucks than we did in 2015, but for the same total dollars as we expended in 2014. In 2015, we bought 1,124 trucks, about 11% average reduced price per truck than 2014. So, we're doing some standardization around the fleet. It's helped us in that regard and some commitments to our suppliers that helped us with that reduction. In 2016, we'll buy 1,234 trucks, according to the current plan. And it's about 10% more than 2015, but we'll only spend about 4% more in dollars than we did in 2015. So, we're making real progress there and we're investing in the fleet. But we're just doing it more efficiently. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's very helpful. Last one from me, I promise. What is the impact of the one \u2013 or the leap day in the first quarter? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The impact on what? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Leap day. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Leap day. One extra day. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We actually have one extra day total in the quarter. We had one fewer in January, we have one extra in both February and March. And, theoretically, that extra workday probably costs us a little bit of money, because our cost structure is a little bit higher than the additional revenue that we'd get. But it shouldn't have a material effect on the quarter. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much, David, Jim and Jim for taking my questions. Jim Fish, on the free cash, if you were to pull out cash taxes entirely and look back over a trend, how would you characterize the growth rate of your free cash ex the variability any given year of cash taxes, what's happening operationally before the tax impact? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I guess I would focus on EBITDA for that question, Michael, because really, that's where \u2013 that's the biggest component and that's where we spend most of our time, is on EBITDA. And we saw EBITDA grow nicely last year, kind of in that 3% range, and we see it's \u2013 we see it replicating that again organically and then we'll have some EBITDA growth from these acquisitions in 2016. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. With that said, then if I looked at your expectation for the $3.6 billion in 2016, what is the underlying margin assumption in the EBIT and the EBITDA? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, EBITDA would \u2013 you know, look, if you \u2013 there's always the question of what happens to the top line. If we don't have these kind of top line impacts that are kind of out of our control such as foreign currency and fuel surcharge, if you assume the top line doesn't have those, we'd expect to see EBITDA margins improved somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And EBIT, what about the EBIT margin? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't have a number for your there, Michael. I'll have to get back to you on that. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Behind that question is, does D&A stay flat on a percent of revenues or is it up or down with the mix shifts that are going on? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. It should stay pretty flat on a percent of revenue basis. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then when I think about that question that's been asked a couple different ways, what is your share count in your assumption for $2.75 to $2.79? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Share count at the end of last year was 455 million shares and in our plan, we've got 445 million shares. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then if you did spend $1 billion, it would imply that you would borrow money to do that. That's the right interpretation. Correct? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I guess... David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It depends how the cash plays out during the year and then when you buy the shares, right? And so, what we've said is that we're going to basically spend \u2013 we aren't necessarily going to spend the whole $1 billion. We will spend the difference between dividends and what we do in acquisitions from \u2013 subtract that from the total cash flow and the remainder will go to the stock buyback. And so, we're sort of planning on the $600 million type of dollars on the share buyback. If we go above that, we'd either have to generate more cash or have less capital in the year, or we'd have to borrow it. But right now, when we draw down on our revolver, we're drawing down at 1%. Our balance sheet at 2.66 times is in great condition. So, we don't have any intention to borrow, to buy shares. But certainly, we have the ability to do it. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, I guess where I was coming from on that, I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing because you're delevering naturally and there seems to be logic in leverage in a 2.5 times to 3 times just from a cash tax planning standpoint. The rate of the improvement you're delevering pretty quickly. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean, Michael, if you look at our \u2013 if you look at free cash flow and you just take the middle of the range of $1.55 billion and back out dividends of $730 million, let's back out \u2013 we've kind of said $100 million to $200 million in tuck-ins, so let's back out $150 million for that, that gives you $670 million. That's kind of right where we've discussed today would be share repurchase. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. And then the one sort of in the weeds question around the industrial side, is you do operate five hazardous waste landfills, what's the trend been volume-wise there? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Michael, Jim Trevathan. It's been as we ended the year and as you saw some of the petrochemical plants gearing up some with a low \u2013 their low feedstock cost, it's been okay. We've done fine at both Emelle in Alabama, Lake Charles in Louisiana. Kettleman has got the new permit and online and adding some volume. So, overall, that business is doing well for us. It's not as you know a huge part of our total revenue, but it's an important part because it differentiates us from those large \u2013 four of those large customers with capability to handle everything from their trash and recycling to their hazardous waste. And they like our balance sheet, as we just talked about. And our capabilities are full for them. So, it's been a \u2013 it's a good part of our company and we expect to grow it. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It has been very nice for us, Michael. And, frankly, if I look at the various pieces of businesses and think, can they get better or worse? This is one that I think can get better, both organically just because of the growth in the volumes. But we can also extend the reach of these landfills. Right now, we've got fairly limited reach without transfer capabilities. And over time, if we can improve those transfer capabilities, we can extend the reach of our hazardous landfills, and both grow volumes because we see growth in overall volumes but also because we can extend our reach and take volumes out of further-away geographies. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and Michael, an example of that, of our commitment to that business is in the fourth quarter, we did a small tuck-in kind of transaction and acquisition in California that helps us with internalize some volume at that new Kettleman-permitted space. So, we are committed to that business, to growing it and looking for opportunities in that regard. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, Jim Trevathan, while I've got you, if we're 50 to 100 basis point margin improvement, you're getting 20 basis points out of G&A, per Jim Fish, the rest has got to come from ops. Some of it's fuel because they clearly \u2013 they've got a favorable trend. But where would I look in the line items to see that incremental improvement coming from? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: One area, Michael, is labor. If you look at all three collection lines of business in 2015, we were positive in efficiency in all three, with obviously a couple of them still negative in volume. That's one excellent indication. If you look at those three lines of business, collection lines are a cost per unit business, all three of them, are in that 1% range and with inflation, just driver labor cost in the 2%, 2.5% range, that's a pretty good number, and you see that in our labor cost improvement. We rolled out our SDO initiative across all 17 areas, service delivery optimization. We're focused on two things in that regard. Let's sustain it where we have it working well and let's improve it. Let's find best practices as areas have implemented it now for a couple of years, and we're looking for new ways to utilize some of the logistics and the technology that our corporate operating team is providing us to get more labor cost out of that and continue to improve on the efficiency. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. It's Sean Egan on for Joe Box. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Sean. Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I wanted to dig in a little bit into your pricing guidance for 2016. Looking at that 4% versus the 4.2% posted in 2015, is that sequentially lower simply due to lapping more difficult comparisons? Is it conservatism on your part? Any color there would be appreciated. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, 4% has sort of have been our target for the last three to four years. And so, we want to maintain that target. We obviously overshot that target in 2015. I'm virtually certain we'll get that 4% in 2016. If we were going to not hit that target, the question is would it be lower or higher than that target. I'm also very confident that if we miss the target, we're going to miss on the high side not on the low side. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But I don't think there's anything to read into the difference between 4.2% and 4.0%. Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then kind of piggybacking on that with respect to yield, outside of CPI, can you maybe help us understand what some of largest drags would be to beating that 2% top of the range? I mean, would it be the mix that you talked about earlier with the energy business? Any (57:15) there is helpful. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The two biggest components of that would be mix, and then new business pricing versus lost business pricing. Those are two big components that go \u2013 that don't affect the price increase that you're putting on your current line of business but that does affect yield. And so that would be \u2013 it would be mix and the difference between new business pricing and lost business pricing. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : And, David, if I added a third to that, it would be rollbacks. And we've managed those really well over the last couple of years. We're positive in 2015 versus 2014 and we expect that trend to continue. Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got you. So, what you just alluded to earlier, the new business pricing, how is that holding in, say, compared to a year ago? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Our goal is to drive that new business pricing to 10% or under. And I would say right now, we're sort of at the high end of that. As the economy improves and as we've seen a good pricing environment, I would expect us to over time to be under that. But right now, we're sort of at the high end of that 10% discount. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Joe, if I add a little more color, the industrial line of business, the roll-off line, we're within that target with the commercial side just outside it and working hard to improve it. Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then I wanted to talk a bit about recycling volumes. Just curious where, if you know, the recycling volumes might be going that you have shedded in favor of price. Are customers choosing not to recycle? Are they choosing independent operators? If you have any sense of where it's going, that would be helpful. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Most of the volume that we've lost have been large residential contracts, and that volume is turning into net losses for our competition. Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Understood. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I can promise you, we know what those prices were bid at. And at these commodity prices, there is nobody making money on those contracts that we gave up. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Especially, Dave, with the capital required. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Exactly. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : With a new contract, where typically that customer wants new trucks, we make that decision around return on invested capital, as well as margin. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, frankly, those contracts, just to be very clear, those contracts generally have not been lost to our solid waste competition. They've been lost to people that are solely in the recycling business. And if you're solely in the recycling business and you take on another underwater contract, you can see that story is not going to end very well for those folks. Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Understood. That's all for me. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Al. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: David, I have one simple question. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, you don't. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Why can't Waste Management post positive volumes like their peer group? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, this is an easy question to answer. Because you can't look at just a volume number. You've got to look at, what is that volume made up of, right? If that volume is made up of brokered volumes, you're not making any money on it. If that volume is made up of recycling volumes, you're not making any money on it. And so, when I look at the volumes, I don't say, look at the overall volume number, I say, look where the volumes are coming from. So for us, we've got positive volumes in the industrial line, which is a very high-margin line for us. We've got positive volumes in the landfill line, which is the highest margin business that we have. And we're about to turn the corner to get positive volumes on the commercial line. We're at negative 0.7% in the quarter. I would expect to see that turn positive during 2016. So, we're adding volume in the high margin areas. We are losing volume in recycling. We're losing volume in brokered businesses and we're losing volume in non-core. All very low margin businesses. And so, if you get positive volume and margins go backwards, I don't see that as a good volume report. If you get negative volumes and margins go up by 150 basis points, I view that as fairly positive. So, I think it's a very easy question to answer. We look for volumes where we can make money on those volumes. We don't look for volumes for the sake of volumes. And so \u2013 but, having said all that, in those money-making volumes, we're going to see the overall volume number turn positive in 2016, and that's what I look forward to. Look, this is a high fixed cost business, and layering in that volume on the high fixed cost allows you to drop a big flow-through to the bottom line. So, I think we've done the right thing. We'll continue to do the right thing. We'll continue to add volumes where we can make money. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hence the progression on EBITDA margin. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Exactly. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: I guess (62:28). David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Exactly. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Right. As a follow-up \u2013 thank you for that. I guess I have a second question then. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I told you. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: The commentary around the industrial environment economy, and yourselves being opportunistic when you can, why would you not, or are you suggesting to keep our eyes open, on being more aggressive on that hazardous piece of your business which, I guess would be \u2013 I don't know if I'd say is as profitable, but maybe you could articulate that for us? But why wouldn't you get more aggressive on acquisitions on that front? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I'll jump in. I mentioned earlier that we did, as we added airspace at Kettleman in California, we went out and found the right tuck-in for us to add volume. So we invested in that business in the second half of 2015, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities that can improve both our margin, but our returns, especially. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But, look, what we need to do in our hazardous waste line of business is, we need to develop a national transfer network so that we can leverage our landfills. We would love nothing more than to be able to buy that and go very quickly to do that. But there's just not a lot of businesses out there that meet those needs and that are for sale. So, in the meantime, we're going to do it organically. And so, we're going to \u2013 we're going to grow that network one way or another. But right now, given the state of the acquisition market right now, we're going to do that organically. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Good luck, guys, and thanks for your time. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Al. Operator : Your next question is from Charles Redding with BB&T Capital Markets. Charles Edgerton Redding - BB&T Capital Markets : Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Charles Edgerton Redding - BB&T Capital Markets : Perhaps just a follow-up on transportation, how should we think about the impact on Northeast landfilling volume from the lower transportation costs? And then with reduced diesel, is it fair to expect collectors to bypass closer incineration units really in favor of the longer haul sites, just based on price alone? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, when you see the transportation costs go down, which is what happens with the fuel, you basically open up landfills that are further away, right? And so, we've actually seen pretty nice growth in our Northeastern landfills. I'm not sure that I'd attribute it 100% to the lower transportation costs, but we've seen nice volumes both in our Northeastern network and then in our Southern network. We would expect that \u2013 we'd expect that to continue into 2016. I always say, to a certain extent, low fuel prices are both good for the economy, but they're also good for our business. Charles Edgerton Redding - BB&T Capital Markets : Great. And just a follow-up, with apologies, on energy services, can you be a little more specific in terms of those types of hauls that are seeing the most pressure from lower spending, and maybe too early to think about any nascent stabilization here year-to-date? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : The types of haul that are seeing lower spending \u2013 look, we haul \u2013 most of what we haul is drill cuttings. And then we haul some waters, we haul a little bit of NGL. So, clearly, the big piece that has declined is drill cuttings. But what's happened is, you're seeing these \u2013 the rig count has dropped off by 60%. So, they are not drilling. They may be leasing property, but they're not drilling nearly as much as they were a year ago. And so, as a consequence, the drill cuttings coming out of those holes are not moving to our landfills. So, I think that answers your question. It is \u2013 because it's the majority of our energy services business, that is what's causing the biggest drop-off. Charles Edgerton Redding - BB&T Capital Markets : Great. Thanks for the time. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli & Company. Tony Bancroft - Gabelli & Company: Thanks. Could you please add just some little more color maybe on the renegotiations for your recycling some of the lower \u2013 the unprofitable recycling contracts and CPI-linked contracts? I realize that you said it's a small portion of the customers' cost structure and you guys in general are more prone to not \u2013 you said \u2013 you always previously said that if you can't do anything at CPI, you'll go get it somewhere else. But maybe just like, where are we, in a sense, maybe on a percentage, maybe some kind of gauge where on a percentage basis of what needs to be renegotiated and how far along you are? Is there some kind of maybe general big picture, inning type thing of where you are along in that? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. On the recycling front, I would say we're about 75% to 80% through renegotiating the contracts. And the contracts that we haven't renegotiated, we can't do anything more about, because they're basically sort of long term contracts and we just have to eat the losses on those contracts until the contracts come up for bid and hopefully at a higher rate or they will go to someone else who is welcome to lose money on them. And so, on the recycling front, we're probably about 75% to 80% through. On the CPI front, about 20% of our business \u2013 our CPI-related business is either on a floating index that more approximates the Waste Services Index or they're on a fixed price increase track with over 2.5% fixed price increases. In other words, 2.5% is sort of our inflation rate. About 20% of our contracts are either on a CPI-based measure or \u2013 that is not CPI but would be, for example, the Waste and Water Index or what we call a Solid Waste Index. And so, that runs at a higher rate generally than our 2.5% inflation. And then, we've got other contracts where they run higher than our 2.5% inflation because they have fixed price increases at over 2.5%. So, about 20% of our business is under those types of contracts. So, there's still a lot of room to go on the residential and on the national account side to get those CPI contracts moved up but we're about 20% through it. Tony Bancroft - Gabelli & Company: That's great. Thanks, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Barbara Noverini with Morningstar. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning, everybody. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Somewhat related to the last question but if we're looking at a lower-for-longer commodity price scenario for recycling, how much further can you take the operational improvements that you've been speaking about? Would you have to consider more aggressive restructuring actions or is there still a lot of runway for this sort of operational cost saving, customer education, et cetera, that you've been describing? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. When we look at recycling, we've made some great improvements. I think there's still plenty of room for improvement. But at this point in time, basically what we're down to is we have a series of plants and those series of plants generally revolve around a large contract, a large municipal contract or other contracts. So if we lose that large municipal contract, absolutely, we would probably have to shut down that plant because we don't have enough volume going through that plant. We don't have any that we have on the early time horizon where we think that will happen but that's basically how we'll have to respond to a low-for-long commodity price. We still have operational improvements we can make. We think we can pull out sort of that 5% to 10% operating cost for a few years. But then any bigger restructuring, we don't have any planned right now. If we did any of that, it would be based upon large contract losses that we would have if we have those. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : And just a reminder, we have consolidated over the last two years roughly 20% of the total number of facilities. Most of them smaller, but where we've either lost on profitable volume and can move the remaining good volume into a larger facility in the same MSA. So, we've already done some of the physical rationalization. And we're working towards the operational side of efficiency now. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But let's not lose sight of the fact that if the industry changes, what we've said is we won't bid contracts unless we can be guaranteed that we recover our processing cost, and then we'll split \u2013 and a margin of profit, and then we'll split any excess with the customers. But if there is no excess, then the customers are going to have pay for the processing and profitability. If we can get contracts on those terms, we're not going to be shutting down plants. We'll be adding plants. And so, what we're trying to get to is how we can make this business sustainable for the long run. I think we've done a spectacular job with our recycling folks of doing that. I'm a firm believer that the industry is going to follow just because the economics don't allow them to do anything different than what we're doing. And so, I think over the long haul, even in a lower, longer commodity price environment, I think we can grow recycling. So, we're looking forward to doing that over the next few years rather than shrinking our footprint. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Yeah. That makes sense. Thanks for the additional detail. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no questions. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Well, just in closing, as we said, we're real confident that we can hit our targets in 2016. For the most part, everything seems to be clicking on all cylinders. But you can't do it just because you have a good economic environment, or you can't do it just because you have the best assets in the business. You absolutely have to have the right team to execute. And so, I'd say all the way from our senior team here in Houston and out in the field, all the way down to our leadership out in the field, all the way down to our frontlines, we've got the right team, and that's why we're so confident that we're going to grow this business in 2016 and well into the future.

The first quarter of 2015 net income, EPS, income from operations and operating EBITDA have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operation. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release footnote and schedules, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures. This call is being recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning approximately 1 :00 PM Eastern Time today until 5 :00 PM Eastern Time on May 12.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ed. And good morning from Houston. Our first quarter results continued the positive trends that we saw throughout 2015, and our volumes turned positive more quickly than we had originally planned. We also saw the continued strength on our pricing programs and our cost programs continue to gain traction. This focus on disciplined growth, pricing and continuous cost improvement delivered $0.58 per share in the quarter, an increase of more than 18% from our 2015 first quarter results. Our revenue increased for the first time since 2014, and we achieved positive volumes for the first time since 2012. Our employees are doing a great job of managing cost increases to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. In the first quarter, we saw improvement in virtually every financial metric that we track. Our traditional solid waste business income from operations increased $60 million and margin increased 30 basis points, and our operating EBITDA improved $90 million and margin increased 50 basis points. We're very pleased with our first quarter results as they provide a strong start to 2016. Turning to our operations. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 to the highest level that we've achieved. And we also saw the highest core price ever in each of the commercial, industrial, and landfill lines of business. Core price in the industrial line was 10.7%; in the commercial line, it was 7.5%; in our landfill line, it was 3.3%; and in our residential line, it was 2.6%. As volumes have turned positive, we expect core price to remain strong. With respect to volumes, we saw a positive volume growth in the first quarter but we did not chase low margin volumes by lowering price. We continue to drive disciplined growth by adding volumes in geographic areas and lines of business where growth is strongest. Our volumes reflect both the strong solid waste economic backdrop and great work by our sales and operating teams. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 2.4% in the first quarter of 2016, a 360 basis point improvement compared to 2015. We have one additional workday in 2016 and after adjusting for this, our traditional solid waste volumes improved 1.8%. We saw some very positive trends in our commercial and industrial lines of business. Our commercial volumes declined only 0.2% in the first quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter and a 260 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. In the industrial line of business, volumes were more than doubled to 2.7% on a workday-adjusted basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. We're very pleased with our traditional solid waste volume results in the first quarter, although we likely did see some benefit from the milder winter weather that may have led to some second quarter construction and landfill volumes being pulled into the first quarter. We certainly expect volumes to remain positive throughout 2016, but we would like to see the extent of the seasonal uptick before we revisit our full year expectations for volumes. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong operational results as we saw the benefit of increased core price and strong volumes as Jim will discuss in more detail. However, we see a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. Over the last three years, leachate costs have increased between 11% and 22%. And in the first quarter of 2016, the increase was greater than that with costs up about $14 million. This trend of increasing leachate costs has been ongoing for a number of years, and we believe it's a common issue throughout our industry. With the increase in volumes, we've seen more liquids, and the cost to transport and treat those liquids has increased substantially. Of course, the added cost at our landfills affects our profitability and return on capital so we need to do something to offset those increasing costs. Consequently, this quarter, we'll begin to implement a liquids management charge at our landfill. This charge will be between 4% and 7% of the cost of disposal and it will be applied only to our landfill customers and not to our collection customers. Of course, many of our disposal contracts are long term, but just as we did with our fuel recovery and recycling charges, we'll implement the liquids management charge on contracts as they renew. Only by doing this can we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfills. Turning to recycling. We saw a drop of 12% in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 3.1% increase in volumes. The positive volumes are predominantly due to the unusually low broker volumes that we saw in the first quarter of 2015 associated with the slowdown in Western U.S. ports. This should normalize and will likely be negative in the second quarter, so we don't expect to see recycling volumes contributing to our overall volume growth. But the volumes that we're losing are generally not profitable volumes, so the negative volumes won't negatively affect profitability. Our employees have done a good job at managing operating costs as we've seen our recycling operating costs improve 12% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. However, the operational improvements have not been enough to offset the decline in commodity prices, so our recycling income from operations was slightly negative in the first quarter but we saw a year-over-year improvement of almost $0.02 per share. Commodity prices have come off the lows that we saw in January, but they're still below 2015 levels and we do not expect any significant rebound in 2016. So we continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually-beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling program in their community. We're committed to recycling, and we'll continue to work to change the business model and drive out operating expenses. Finally, in the first quarter, our business generated strong growth in operating EBITDA, which in turn translated into significant cash generation. Cash flow from operating activities exceeded $700 million, an increase of more than $200 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. We did have about $156 million in cash flow benefits in the quarter, which Jim will discuss. But even if you adjust for those, cash from operating activities grew by 10.2%. So 2016 is off to a strong start, and our results put us firmly on track to meet or exceed our full year guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share between $2.74 and $2.79. We also expect to achieve or beat our full year free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. Based on first quarter volume results, we'd also expect to beat our volume goal for the year. I certainly believe that this will be the case, and we had favorable weather in the first quarter and we'd expect the volumes will pull it forward into the first quarter. As noted previously, we also had higher recycling volumes, which will not continue through the year. We'll get a better feel for the effects of these factors when we see our second quarter seasonal uptick. After we see volumes normalize, we expect to give more precise volume and financial guidance for the year. But we certainly expect to see continued year-over-year improvement across all of our operating metrics. It's a reflection of the strength of our corporate and field teams to see our strategy so well executed. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, David. In the first quarter, revenues were $3.2 billion, an increase of $136 million or 4.5% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. We saw a $126 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of price and volume, and an $81 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. These increases were partially offset by declines of $32 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $18 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $13 million decline from lower recycling revenues. Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company in the first quarter. Our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6% with total volumes improving 1.9%. We had one additional workday in the first quarter. Adjusting for the additional workday, volumes improved 1.3%. Volumes turned positive in the quarter for the first time since 2012. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $54 million, operating income margin expanding 110 basis points to 16%, operating EBITDA growing $74 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 130 basis points to 25.8%. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs. Overall, collection core price was 6.5% and yield was 3.4%. Our strong core price reflects a disciplined approach to pricing and a strong demand for our services. In the first quarter, we continued to make progress on reducing the churn through our improved customer service. Our churn in the quarter was 9.2%, a 170 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. The improvement in our churn, strong roll off demand, and our focus on disciplined growth benefited our volume trends in the first quarter as total collection volumes turned positive, improving 70 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter and 240 basis points from the first quarter of 2015. Industrial demand was strong in the quarter with volumes up 4.2% or 2.7% on a workday adjusted basis. Our residential business continues to be a drag on volumes while commercial volumes are moving towards positive. For the quarter, residential volumes declined 3.4% and commercial volumes declined 0.2%, a year-over-year improvement of 260 basis points. Strong core price and positive volume in the collection line of business led to income from operations growing $21 million and operating EBITDA growing $36 million. In the landfill line of business, we also saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield in the first quarter just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 11.6% and 10.3% on a workday adjusted basis. On a workday adjusted basis, MSW volumes grew by 13.4%, C&D volume grew by 22.6%, and combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes grew 2.9%. Our landfill volumes were stronger than we expected, in part due to milder weather and a couple of one-time events. We do not expect that the one-time events will repeat. So as we continue throughout the year, landfill volumes may moderate, but should remain solidly positive as we face increasingly tougher comparisons. We achieved core price of 3.3% and saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.1% from Q1 of 2015. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $29 million, margins growing 60 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $40 million and operating EBITDA margins increasing 40 basis points. Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, these expenses improved 120 basis points to 62.8%. For the first quarter, operating expenses increased $47 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Landfill operating costs increased the most at $17 million, an increase of more than 27% year-over-year. $14 million of the $17 million increase was leachate costs, which is one of the reasons that David mentioned the importance of imposing a charge to recover our increasing costs. The remainder of the operating cost increases primarily relate to our increased volumes and costs related to acquired operations. For the first quarter, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 11.4%, flat when compared to the first quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $362 million, an increase of $14 million compared to 2015. Labor costs drove the majority of the increase primarily related to acquisitions. We also had higher accruals for incentive compensation costs related to our strong performance. We still expect to improve SG&A costs as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015. Turning to cash flow for the first quarter, our operating EBITDA growth of almost 10% translated into strong cash flow growth. Cash provided by operating activities was $706 million, a $207 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2015. Included in the 2016 results was a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross-currency hedge. We terminated the financial hedge because we borrowed money in Canadian dollars, thus providing a natural hedge against fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. The termination of the hedge had a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. In addition, favorably affecting our year-over-year comparisons were nearly $90 million from timing and size of compensation payments. Excluding those benefits, we had strong growth as cash provided by operating activities grew 10.2%. During the first quarter, we spent $317 million in capital expenditures, an increase of $84 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. The increase was related to an intentional change in the timing of our truck purchases. However, as David mentioned, the cost of transporting our leachate has increased substantially so we are building some additional leachate treatment facilities. This will help with costs over the long run but will increase capital expenditures in 2016 and 2017. This makes it very important to implement our liquids recovery charge, so we can offset some of these capital costs and generate acceptable returns. Nevertheless, we still believe that we will be within our guidance range of between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. In the first quarter, we also had $13 million in proceeds from divested assets. Combined, we generated $402 million of free cash flow, an increase of $117 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. This puts us well on our way to achieving or exceeding our free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. In the first quarter, we returned $433 million to shareholders. We paid $183 million in dividends and we repurchased $250 million of shares. Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants was 2.77%, and our weighted average cost to debt was 4.26%. The floating rate portion of our debt portfolio was 15% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 35.4% in the first quarter. It was a bit higher than expected due to the timing of certain items, but we still believe that our full year tax rate will be 35%. In summary, the first quarter trends continue the momentum that built throughout 2015. We're well positioned to achieve or exceed our full year goals as our employees performed well to start the year. In the coming quarters, the year-over-year comparisons become tougher. But we have confidence that our employees can continue to meet or exceed our targets. And with that, Rebecca, let's open the line up for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If you could talk a little bit more about your volumes this quarter, obviously, there is some seasonal improvement. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what it's going to be like going forward, and what's the sustainable volume number into Q2, and what would this quarter then adjusting for what you said was recycling benefit, too. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. If you look at the volumes for the quarter, we think that about 30 basis points of the improvement was attributable to the recycling volumes which, as we said, won't repeat in the following quarters, but that's okay because they're not profitable volumes. And then about 20 to 30 basis points we estimate would be the amount that was pulled forward sort of from the second quarter. It's always a question when you have \u2013 whether it's good weather or bad weather in the first quarter, do volumes disappear when you have bad weather or do they just get pushed into the second quarter? And the same is true with good weather. Did volumes get pulled in from the second quarter to the first quarter, or is it just more economic activity so that there's going to be more volume? And so before we adjust our full year guidance, we wanted to be a little bit more precise on what the \u2013 we wanted to give a fairly tight range. And so waiting until the second quarter seasonal uptick, I think, will allow us to sort say, okay, here's a more normalized look at what the volumes are going to be. We fully expect those to be positive in the second quarter. The question is how positive will they be. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Andrew, I guess if you put those in dollar terms, last year one of the ways we looked at this was that last year's negative impact from weather was about $12.1 million in revenue and about $8.1 million EBIT. So I think it's fair to assume that we didn't have that weather impact this year. But as David said, it's hard to tell how much just moved from quarter to quarter and how much good weather actually expands volume or, on the other hand, bad weather contracts volume. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. I guess, can you give us a sense of how April was trending then seasonally it probably still was strong like it's still trending... David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Basically, what we saw in April was that collection volumes sort of continue apace. The landfill volumes come down a little bit. We had some one-time \u2013 the MSW volumes come down, look, the MSW volumes were really strong in the first quarter but we had a couple of one-time type items. So for example, some of the waste energy plants along the East Coast were down for maintenance and so some of those volumes came over to us into our landfills. And so we'd expect the landfill volumes to moderate a little bit. But they'll still \u2013 they'll continue to be strong. So, I would say that, so far, the trends are pretty much what we expect in the second quarter. We continue to see positive volumes and we'd expect that to continue throughout May and June. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right. Thanks, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Looking at 2016, if you try to put it kind of all together, where do you see the main threats to your 2016 guidance? Where would it be coming from? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, to be quite honest with you, I don't see any threats to the guidance. I see some opportunities on the upside. But if there was going to be a threat, clearly recycling is still a little bit volatile. We haven't seen the rebound in commodity prices that you'd expect to see. Look, our core price is pretty much locked and loaded for the year. I mean, that is going to happen. Once we saw the \u2013 when you see these volumes turn positive and you see that our addition rate's exceeding our defection rate, it's hard to see volumes turning backwards. And so the things that are under our control, I think there's only upside, no downside. I guess, really, the only potential downside would be in a general economic downturn, what would happen to volumes. But I think if there is a general economic downturn, it's not going to be led by housing like the last one was. And so we should see, at least, a six- to nine-month lag in any reduction in volumes. And so it's hard to see how 2016 can do anything other than meet or exceed our guidance. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Dave, I might add the issue of the economy itself. We still see positive container weights in the quarter. We have the last couple of quarters and our service increases are exceeding decreases six or eight quarters in a row. So that's pretty good economics on what's happening in North America. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Jeff. One of the common questions that we get is about the strength of the industrial sector and we best measure that by looking at our special waste pipeline. When you look at special waste for the first quarter, it really didn't show a whole lot of impact from weather because in the month of January, we were actually down year-over-year about 4.5%. We were up about 1% in February, so pretty close to flat. And then March, we were up 6.1%. And when you look at April, April looks like it's up probably double March. So when you ask about the risk to EBITDA, one of the areas that is somewhat \u2013 it does fluctuate some is that special waste pipeline and it looks pretty encouraging right now. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's very helpful. And if I can ask one more, just if you could give a little more color on the geographies and how does performance change in various regions where you operate? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It is interesting to see that after the last economic downturn, you saw the trends completely switch from being Sun Belt driven to being more Rust Belt driven. And what we've seen over the last six to nine months, as you've seen it sort of revert back to what I would call a pre-recession economy where housing starts in Florida and throughout the Gulf Coast and then all the way into California are driving very strong results throughout the sunbelt. And you've seen the Sun Belt actually performing better than the Rust Belts. It's why we like having a diversified business. It works in any kind of economy. Obviously, right now, you're seeing the South do better than the North. But the North continues to drive improved profitability, it just happens to be a little bit stronger in the South. So from a geography point of view, I think you can sort of follow the housing trends and say that our business is following that, which is very strong from Florida through the Gulf Coast then into California. And then continued strength, but not as strong throughout the Midwest and East Coast. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : I would echo what the Waste Connections guys said this morning which is pretty strong growth universally across the country and in Canada as well, except where you have kind of big E&P operations, and those are weak. And so those areas of the country have been a little bit depressed, but the rest of the U.S. and Canada looks pretty strong. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : This is very helpful color. And one last maintenance question from me is just on CapEx. So your total number for CapEx remains the same, you have a little bit of an increase for leachate investments where \u2013 and then you've have more truck investment. What is being reduced as far as capital investment? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're not really reducing anything. We're actually increasing the number of trucks. It just moves us within the range, right? The range is $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and what we're spending on leachate treatment facilities is well less than the amount of the range. So we are not cutting back on capital for Yellow Iron, on capital for containers and capital for trucks we're actually increasing that from last year. So it really just moves us a little bit up in the range. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We're probably going to be \u2013 you remember last year, we're $1.23 billion in CapEx. We gave the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range. This year, we're probably going to be in the middle of that, maybe towards the higher end of it. Exactly what David said which is about 125 extra trucks, about $25 million additional capital invested in our Yellow Iron fleet which is, in some cases, has got some older equipment. And then putting in some wastewater treatment facilities, which we'll have the pay back to them but they have a big upfront capital cost. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. This is very helpful. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Jim, Jim, how are you today? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : (30:04). David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm doing fine, too, Michael. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good. I asked. On the MSW, when you talk about that type of a volume number in the landfill, one could go that's eye-popping. Well, (30:19) 2% GDP. So Jim Trevathan, you made a comment earlier that container weights \u2013 on a same-store basis, what's your container weight trend been in your commercial business? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : It's been positive the last couple of quarters, Michael. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: In the 2%, 3% type zone? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : A little below that. 1.5%, in that kind of range. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, that's more reflective of underlying consumerism GDP, and that's how we should think about this is good but shouldn't get irrationally exuberant about 13% MSW in one quarter? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Agree. Absolutely agree. Michael, we also had \u2013 Dave mentioned the waste energy plants. We also had a couple of competitor landfills close during the quarter or during the \u2013 really, the second half of last year. And we've picked up a good portion, if not all of that volume at one of them. And that's helping that 12%, 13% MSW volume growth. That'll continue but some of the one-timers that David and Jim mentioned will not continue. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Michael, at the peak, we did roughly 130 million tons into the landfill. Now we're probably looking closer to 110 million tons into the landfill. And so the strong MSW volumes, to me, are indicative that finally we're getting back to where \u2013 as in an industry, we're getting back to where we were pre-recession. Most other businesses are already above the volume levels that they were pre-recession. And so I don't see that moderating. I think that's just a reversion back to the norm. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And when do you think that leveling-off point occurs as you look at sort of the economic drivers that drive your business? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Gosh, it's hard to see \u2013 again, we're still 20 million tons below where we were at peak. You're seeing a lot of municipalities take some types of materials out of their recycling streams. And so when I look at the future, I think there's more upside potential on the volume than there is downside potential. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And a couple of years before you get that incremental 20 million? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well maybe if you look at the pace of change between today and the great recession, yeah. I would think \u2013 I think it's you'd still see a couple years. And that's a couple of years of good solid, sort of 4% to 7% type volume growth at the MSW line. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's what I was trying to get at. And then this liquid management charge, if you took the 3.3% landfill pricing in 1Q and you had had that surcharge in the whole quarter, what would this 3.3% look like? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, look, it's going to be slow to see any big results out of that. Look, the point here is that we've got to recover our landfill operating costs. The part of the problem is that a lot of those contracts are long term. And we're going to go out and start doing it in some test markets in the first quarter. we're not going to just go out and do it blanket across the country just to find out what does the reception look like. If we go out and do a 7% charge across the entire country, you're putting a lot of volumes at risk. And so we're going to go into a couple key markets and we're going to test it and see what the reaction is in the market. I think the whole industry is having the same problem. And so, I would expect the charge to be well received in the market. But we're going to test it this quarter and then we'll roll it out during the course of the year. But even at its peak, we don't think it's any more than $10 million to $15 million over the next couple of years, and that's on an annual basis just because we have so many contracts that are long term. But if we can get an additional $10 million to $15 million that at least goes a little bit of the way to cover in the increased leachate costs. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And is some of this leachate \u2013 you've had a very wet year, first quarter in the middle of the country where you have a lot of landfills. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And so, basically what you got going on here, Michael, is two different things. Look, we had 11% additional volume going in there. So you've got naturally-occurring water from the volumes. And we've had positive volumes now for quite a few years so you get more liquid out of that. And then as you say, we've had more rain events. And so there's been a lot more fluid. But the bigger part of it, frankly, is that the cost to transport and dispose of the liquids has gone up fairly dramatically. And so we sort of had a double whammy, more liquids and higher cost to dispose. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean, that's the bigger concern is the last part of David's statement. When you look at some areas of the country, the unit cost of disposal of leachate has gone up 400% to 500%. So that's why we're talking about this charge. It's not related necessarily to the rain because \u2013 look, we could have a dry year at some point, too. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Jim Fish, on the cash flow from ops, it was 22% of revenues which is well above your long average. How do I think about what cash flow for ops should be for the full year as a percent of sales given the adjustments you talked about? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Boy, on a percent of sales. And I don't normally look at it that way, but I think it'll moderate a bit because the primary driver of that is EBITDA. And while we thought EBITDA was fantastic, as David said in his opening comments, we need to see what EBITDA does or all of our financial metrics do when we transition from this pretty mild winter quarter into spring and summer. With that said \u2013 and even \u2013 honestly, Michael, when we look at this on an EPS basis, we were up $0.09 versus prior year. Historically, we've been up kind of $0.02 to $0.03 over the last five years, $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter. So $0.09 felt like a great quarter but also felt like we don't want to straight line that. So when I think of cash from operations I think we're going to wait, reserve comment until we see how that transition from the mild winter first quarter into the spring quarter, how it looks. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Churn is at 9.2%. Is that about the floor? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, that's right about the lowest we've ever had. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, the good news is is your replacement costs have come down meaningfully because you've reduced the churn, so that's helped in the overall pricing as well and that anniversaries. So I got 2Q and 3Q, and then it anniversaries in the fourth quarter because you're around 9% in the fourth quarter. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. That's right... Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, Jim \u2013 sorry. Go ahead, David. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We were at what, 9.2% in the fourth quarter? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We were almost identical. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I'll tell you, Michael, we've touched 12% over the last couple of years and most of those numbers have been double digit. Those two quarters are the lowest in over a decade. So this is substantial for us in the process of retention, and we're making real headway in that regard. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, yeah. Yeah. I get it. Because it significantly lowers the pressure on your pricing reported \u2013 yield because to replace that customer's much lower price than what you lost. So... David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the important thing, Michael, is that the addition rate was 9.6%. And so you can see the rollover effect of that positive addition rate. We always follow the rule of 72 here and you can sort of see it as it creates that sort of annuity policy for us. That addition rate just continues to roll and roll and roll throughout the quarters. And so that's why we say it's hard to see our volumes going negative again because we've got that addition rate above the defection rate. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Michael, as you know, that addition rate and defection rate are based on number of customers. We're net positive in dollars as well and have been now for the third consecutive quarter. So that roll-forward effect will continue. Again, numbers matter. Number of new customers, but dollars are the ultimate measure. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Michael, one last point on your question about cash from operations. When you say 22% of revenue, that includes the $67 million benefits to cash from operations from the termination of the SWAB. It includes the one last cash pay period that we had. We had a pay period that fell on January 1 this year, so we actually had \u2013 we paid it out on December 31, 2015. So we actually had one more cash pay period in 2015 and one less in 2016. So that 22%, even if we take out any effect of kind of a mild winter quarter, you still have a few things in that 22% that don't repeat. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. That was my question. I'm assuming the 22% benefited by the nonrecurrings, but your long-term average has been 17%. It appears you're trending better than your average even for the adjustment. So that's what I was trying to get at. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, yeah, I didn't do a good job of answering that, but that's \u2013 I think you're right. We feel good about the trend. We're not looking at a 22% trend because of the one-timers. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. And which leads to \u2013 I get you're not raising guidance, but if you take the midpoint of your capital spending and your trend works up by a percentage point on cash flow from ops, we're beating free cash flow guidance, too. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, look, I mean I think what we'd say is that we want to wait for the second quarter to understand the seasonal upticks. But if there's going to be an adjustment, it's certainly going to be an adjustment upward. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. And then last one from me, Jim Fish, you had led this year with the objective to have a flat dollars of SG&A, is that still the intention given some of the strength in the business? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, look, our goal is to stay as close to flat as possible. But keep in mind, we added $90 million, $92 million in acquisitions, which came with some SG&A, primarily S right? A lot of the G&A has come out of those, but the S stays and that's a good thing for us. And similarly, the other half of our increase in dollars in SG&A was incentive compensation related to strong performance, so I look at that as being a good thing as well. One thing I would say is, in addition to saying that we will try to get as close to flat as we can is that on a percent of revenue basis, one kind of aspirational number we've had out there for probably a decade has been 10% on an annual basis. We were at 10.4% last year. I think we have a decent chance of getting to or below 10% for the year. So we'll shoot for flat, may not get there but I think we're getting pretty close to 10% for the year on a percent of revenue basis. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for answering my questions. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Morning, everybody. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Al. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Just wanted a couple of housekeeping items. For 2016, how much acquisition revenue is included in your expectations? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. When we looked at the beginning of the year, we thought we'd do $100 million, $200 million of tuck-ins. I would say that we're probably on pace for the lower end of that right now. And then obviously, we sort of used a mid-year convention for that. And then, of course, we got the SWS revenue. So we had, what, I'm sorry, $90-some-odd million become... James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : $92 million and then (42:49) David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Exactly. $92 million and then you'd take the divestures out. But I would guess that that $90 million run rate is probably good for the year. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It might be a little high just because we anniversary Deffenbaugh. So, what you're going to get is a full year of SWS, a full year of EnviroServ which is a little smaller out west. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But then you replaced that with the small tuck-ins, right? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We replaced that, yeah. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So it could be. It kind of depends on how those tuck-ins go throughout the year. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. It's a good point. Deffenbaugh's anniversaried already, or is there a couple... David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Al, well, yes. It's anniversaried at the very end of Q1. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : With a full first quarter of kind of gain, if you will, in Deffenbaugh, but then nothing in the second quarter. It's all kind of integrated in an anniversary. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. In constructive light, if you don't mind, may I ask this question? Understanding that the volume was strong and there were couple of the extra work pay, one other things that just escaped my mind. But the messaging, David, around volumes seems to be a little misplaced and I said \u2013 and taking this in the light of what I'm intending it. You've been pushing for getting to flat. It now seems you're going to be substantially above that flat level, yet we all know that the underlying business doesn't really change all that much. So for lack of a better word, what did we miss on looking at the business or directionally? Where were you a little too conservative on the trend there for volumes? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, I would say the underlying business actually has changed fairly dramatically. I mean, you see it not only in our numbers but you see it in everybody's numbers. The roll off volumes right now have been nothing short of spectacular. And our roll off volumes doubled quarter to quarter, and that's with the energy services being down. And so roll-offs bench really strong. C&D has been very strong. MSW has been very strong. Special waste has continued to be nicely positive. And then on the commercial side, I think you're seeing sort of a cumulative effect of the new business in new commercial construction that we've seen over the last few years. So I really think the underlying trends in our business are as positive as they have been since 2007. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Finally, if I just may pick a little bit on the SG&A, Jim Fish. I saw some recent head count reduction announced. I think there was more for outsourcing. What other benefits are there in terms of trying with the goal of keeping the dollar level flattish that was just asked previously? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. First, let me correct one thing, what you saw was probably in Phoenix, and we moved \u2013 by the way, the difference between outsourcing and offshoring there/ They're still employees, we just have now employees at our own host office, back office indoor in India. So they're still considered employees, and are still carried under our payroll as opposed to true outsourcing there. But really, the big drivers of SG&A dollar increase, as I said to Michael, were acquisition related which we think is a good thing. We will make sure that we try and take as much of the kind of duplicate SG&A out of these acquisitions, as we always do. But the sales component is very important. I mean, if you think about Deffenbaugh, it was an area that we had no operations. If you think about EnviroServ, it's an area where we had operations but they had a niche business. So, the sales component of SG&A will stay on and is very important to us in terms of growing top line dollars. And of course, the other piece is just a true-up of incentive compensation plans. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey Al, if the concern is just the creep into our SG&A, we \u2013 Jim and I both and Dave are still on track. We look at all of increases or even replacements and make sure that the absolute right thing to do and there are very few of those on the sales side even, although, Jim is right, we retain the Deffenbaugh additions. We have added some sales heads in early 2015 but fewer in 2016. And we look at those on a return basis. Are they generating the value or we don't do them. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would tell you, nobody is more cognizant of the danger of SG&A creep. When things look good on all other financial metrics, the one that can get away from SG&A. So as Jim said, we are scrutinizing every single not only head count addition but even replacements to make sure that we're only adding where we need to add and where it adds top line or bottom line. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Excellent. Great. Appreciate it. Thanks. Good luck. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Just a couple from me. First of all, so the pricing \u2013 the core price in industrial has been strong, got even stronger. Is that reflective of what you're seeing in temporary roll off or is that being driven more by permanent work? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's temporary roll off. We had a roll off season that started very early. We had unseasonably warm construction season. And virtually, across the board we heard from our folks out in the field that they're not able to \u2013 they don't have the trucks and the containers to meet the demand. So what do you do when you don't have capacity to meet demand? You add more trucks and drivers and you raise your price, and that's basically what we saw. And not only do you raise your price, but all of a sudden, those cans that are only being pulled once a month, you take them back and you put them out into another customer where they're pulled more often. And so we saw an unusually strong roll off season. And again, that's continued through April. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: So, on \u2013 sorry. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : I was going to say, if I can add to that, that doesn't diminish the increases that we're getting on the permanent business as well. It just says most of that came from the answer that Dave gave you. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yeah. So the data suggests that the market is absorbing it well with the low churn. If you had told me two years ago that you're going to get 10% core price in industrial, I would have said you're going to shock the market by doing that. So it sounds like that's not happening. Is there any time that that could be starting? Or is it that there's so much demand and you've got the capacity by virtue of being Waste Management, and some of the smaller local providers just don't have capacity so you're able to do that now, but maybe more capacity comes in over time? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's exactly right. I mean, I think you hit the nail right in the head. There is limited roll off capacity and it got stretched in the construction season. Not everywhere, it's regional. And so we haven't seen that slow down. And again, it's not just raising prices. It's making sure that you're getting the most efficient use out of that container and that driver and I think we've done a pretty good job of that out in the field of making sure that we're getting the maximum number of polls out of our can. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And it all sounds, Corey, like, when you talk about a 10% increase as if there's concern that we lose permanent roll off business and that's why David pointed out. But this is largely a microeconomic application of pricing to the temp roll off business as a function of strong, strong demand in certain geographies. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: I understand. And then I understand that the leachate related charge you're talking about, not a big dollar amount. But can you remind me, have you done other kind of specific cost offsetting fees at landfills or have you only done that on the collection side before? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've applied the environment charge at the landfill. Certainly not as much across the board as we have on the collection line of business. And that's why this one's going to be landfill focused. I mean, it really is a landfill particular problem. The environmental charge, when you look at our cost for environmental compliance that stretches across all aspects of our business. This is peculiar to the landfill. Again, I think if you look at everybody in the industry, you'd see both industry players and private players. You'd see that their leachate costs are going up. I mean, it's just a function of higher volumes and higher transportation cost. And so I think the industry has two choices, right? You either watch that return on capital shrink at the landfills, which it has been doing over the last few years or you do something to reverse it. We've decided to do this liquids management charge. I can't speak for anyone else, but that's the way we're going to drive that return on capital. Because look, we invest more capital on the landfill than any other single asset that we have. Now we've got to get the return on it. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yeah, I understand. And I realized kind of market conditions change so maybe not a good analog. Where I was going with that, I was wondering if you could make a drawn analogy what the reaction was when you implemented the environmental charge at the landfills. Have you found competitors kind of following along or if they use that as an opportunity to try to take volume from you? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I mean, I would say for the most part \u2013 again, the environmental charge is not widespread on our landfill customers. But for the most part, we've seen the market react quite favorably. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: And then just one last quick one, you already addressed the line question a bunch of different ways, but when you reported last quarter, you said that you thought volume gets stronger in the back half of the year. Do you still think that is likely to be the case? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well the couple of headwinds that we have going into back half of the year are the recycling volumes, right? And that was about a 30 basis point benefit in the first quarter. But if those volumes go negative like we expect them to go in the back half of the year, it's probably a little bit more of an effect because it will go from positive 3.1% to negative 2% in the back half of the year. So it could be a little bit more than 30 to 40 basis points. But the underlying macroeconomic trends that we see in the industrial and the commercial line are strong. And so I would expect \u2013 look, we've always said we don't look at volumes for volumes' sake. We look at volumes to try to add profitable volumes. And what I would say is that the trend line on the profitable volumes that we're going to add is going to be very positive throughout the rest of the year. Some of those negative volumes like landfills, maybe some residential contracts, some of those things might moderate the volume growth a little bit but I expect that we'll continue to see good strong growth in the landfill line and the industrial line and the commercial line. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Got it. Thank you and congratulations on the good start to the year. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Tyler. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, quick housekeeping item. So Jim Fish, I may have missed it but can you go over the day adjusted collection volumes by line? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Let me see here. Flip back into the script for a second. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry about that. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So, roll off volume was 4.2%, on a day adjusted basis it was 2.7%. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I didn't give a day adjusted commercial... David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's the same negative point 2%. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay. So roughly maybe the same impact on each, okay. I do want to dig in a little... sorry. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There was no impact on the commercial line. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Oh, no impact? Okay. Okay. Perfect. All right. And then I do want to dig in a little bit more on the landfill volume. So if you look at your actual tons consumed, the $23.6 million versus $20.9 million that actually went in to the landfill. That was a great number, probably the best physical number we've seen in some time. You noted a number of the one-time drivers. But can you isolate maybe how much the burner availability was in issue? And was coal ash a driver in that? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, yes, to both. The coal ash was a driver. By the way, one last point on your first question. Landfill volume on a day adjusted basis was 10.3%, the unadjusted was 11.6%. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So to answer your second question, coal ash was certainly a piece of it because we saw some scheduled maintenance done at Covanta and at Wheelabrator that did impact us. We also saw that the coal business, that Duke Energy contract we've talked a lot about, started to really kind of ramp up. We have three plants and all three of those are kind of fully up and running, and that was growing incrementally throughout 2015. But, I would tell you that those \u2013 I don't know, Jim, if you know the number for the coal ash piece. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I don't.. But it was improved year-over-year. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly improved. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : It was part of that... Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : But that's a long-term issue, Tyler. We have that business in 2016 and we'll continue those projects. So that's not part of the one-time. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, David, this is a bigger picture question. You kind of touched on it. But the MSW landfill volumes are very robust. We saw it with you, we saw it with Connections, et cetera. The industry seems to be shuttering, recycling capacity across the board. And do you think that the woes on the recycling side with some of that material, is it making its way back into the landfill? And do you think that's part of the whole MSW volume story? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I don't think there's any doubt. I mean, when you see recycling rates going backwards over the last couple years, that material has to have an outlet. And I do think that some of that material is going clearly to the landfill. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, very helpful. And then just last one, Jim Trevathan, what did hazardous waste landfill volumes do in the quarter? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : They were improved year-over-year. We had a pretty good year-over-year improvement at the two Southern sites that had a event business given good weather that was larger than the prior years, event business. Especially at the Alabama site. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And then in our California hazardous site, we actually did an acquisition, our EnviroServ acquisition out there. And so we saw pretty good volume growth there too. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : And we'll continue to see that as we move some of that volume that's still going third-party as we get state approvals to bring them into Kettleman. That volume from that acquisition, will improve here, during the course of this year. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Didn't Kettleman just restart up? Is that right? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. In the second half of the last year. They were running but they had a very low rate in the first year (59:05). Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. All right, thank you, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So with cash flow expected to be above the range and leverage up some but still below the 3 times kind of mark that you're looking for, can you maybe just gives an update on the buyback and maybe should we think about another ASR at some point, either this year or on the horizon? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We said at the beginning of the year that we'd spend $600 million on the share buyback and I would expect that we would at least hit that number. We've talked about \u2013 we did $250 million in the first quarter, we've talked about doing another $250 million ASR this quarter. And so we'll certainly spend the $600 million. I think there's probably a little bit of upside to that number as we see the cash generation through the year. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for that. And... James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There's a couple things there on the leverage ratio and then capital allocation. The leverage ratio finished at 2.77, up a bit from the end of Q4 largely related to the acquisition of SWS. But we think for the year, we'll probably be in that 2.6 to 2.7 range. Long term we probably expand that range a bit and kind of call it 2.5 to 3.0 just to give us some opportunity there if we see a big acquisition that looks like it's strategic and reasonably priced, we may go after that. Unfortunately, at this point we don't see any of those out there. So we'll just go \u2013 when we think about capital allocation, we'll go with kind of the $100 million to $200 million in acquisitions. And then we'll maintain that leverage ratio, long term in that 2.5 to 3 range. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for that, Jim. And then one last quick one. So I want to flesh out the volume growth a little bit. You're still seeing resi volumes decline. Can you maybe just talk to the undercurrents that you're seeing within volume and maybe the impact on margin? Because obviously a solid incremental EBITDA margin this quarter. Is there may be a double benefit with the volume? You're getting a positive mix and then you're also getting more volume at the landfill. Just any color there would be helpful. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think it's exactly right. When you look at the lines of business from a margin perspective going from top to bottom, you go landfill, commercial, industrial, residential, right? And when you see the predominant volumes coming into those \u2013 to the landfill and into the industrial side, and you saw 360 basis points of improvement on the commercial side. It's like I said, we don't go after volumes for volumes' sake. We try to go after the volumes that actually make money. So if we lose a little bit of volumes on recycling, lose a little bit of volumes on residential, I'm not going to tell you that we like that because they do generate some EBITDA, but when you look at it from a mix point of view and from a profitability point of view, I'd much rather be adding volumes on the commercial, industrial, landfill line than on residential and recycling. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Maybe one more point, Dave, is that on the resi side, when you renew a contract or you gain a contract, it's generally a capital outlay. So we look at return on that invested capital stronger there. Because the other lines of business are inherently strong on an ROI basis. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for the color, guys. I appreciate it. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And your question comes from the line Hamzah Mazari with Sterne Agee. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is (01:02:51). I'm filling in for Hamzah. Had a question about the Canadian portion of your business. With the Waste Connections and Progressive Waste merger closing soon, can you give us a sense of your position in the Canadian marketplace? And maybe do an M&A there on the U.S. side, how that all relates? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. When we look at the Progressive deal, obviously, we couldn't do that because we have too much business in Canada. Certainly, I think Waste Connections, taking over that business is a very positive thing for the industry. Progressive, I would say, was a little bit more of an aggressive volume player than Waste Connections is. So I think it's only going to be positive for all the business in Canada. From our perspective, we did a large transaction in Montreal couple years ago. I think, I'd say about Canada exactly what Jim said about the United States. If we could find a good sized acquisition that's strategic for us and that's priced fairly, we'd go out and do it. But I think the same thing applies to Canada as does the United States. Right now, we just don't see those. A lot of the sort of what I'd call mid-sized acquisitions, call it in the sort of $500 million to $2 billion type, dollar range. A lot of those type of sellers right now expect too high a price for their business. And so, we have to pass on them for now. But I see that business certainly not being hurt by the fact that Waste Connections will be our new Canadian neighbor instead of Progressive. Unknown Speaker : All right. Great. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks, guys, for taking my call. I think last quarter you mentioned a 30 to 40 bps benefit margin on lower fuel. Did you guys break that out this quarter? Where did you see the tailwind on the margin line from the lower fuel price? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The fuel impact was, to be exact here, 13 basis points tailwind for us. When you think about fuel, we had about $32 million lower in fuel surcharge revenues, $33 million in fuel expense, so kind of a push there. And then when you factor in the lower fuel surcharges that we pay to third-party transportation providers, that's where you get the 13 bps of tailwind. Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. And the incremental margin was I think around 50% this quarter, a little over that. I mean, is that \u2013 when we think about this going into this environment where it's kind of looking like the best environment we've seen since 2007, is that 50% incremental margin, is that a sustainable run rate we should be thinking in a market where you're getting really good pricing and starting to see positive volumes? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, I think in a positive volume environment and particularly when the volumes are positive in the landfill and in the commercial industrial line, I don't think that 40% to 50% flow through is an unreasonable number. Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Hey, guys. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Scott. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Just one question, really. Your core price of 5.3%, just looking at your last transcript. You guys were guiding for 4% this year. Obviously, this is a huge upside to that number. Just wondering whether informally your expectations for this year would be considerably higher or maybe a little bit more color on the upside in price in the quarter. And then I have a follow-up about CPI which has always been strengthening a bit of late and wondering if you could remind us of your exposure to index-based pricing and/or whether we might see some lift associated with that if inflation continues to pick up. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. When you look at CPI on a core basis, you certainly see an improvement. But when you look on it on a universal basis, you've actually seen it flat to down because of lower energy prices. So we still think that in the back half of the year, CPI, which is about 40% of our business, CPI could be a headwind not a tailwind in the back half of the year. With respect to core price, we pushed up a lot of our price increases this year, and we're going to be anniversarying some mid-year type price increases we did last year. And so I don't expect the dollars to moderate during the course of the year, but I would expect that the actual number at core price and the number on yield would probably moderate a little bit. But we still wholly expect to be above that 4% core price, and at or above that 2% yield. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Great. Thanks, David. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning, everyone. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Barbara. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Just a quick clarification question. So once your leachate treatment facilities are built, we're basically looking to see operational cost savings from replacing higher or third-party cost with your own labor. So is this a longer term goal and that you want most of you major landfills that's common in wetter areas to be self-reliant when it comes to leachate treatment versus basically just targeting specific facilities where this has been a particular challenge? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so... James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's the latter. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: When you look at it, it's really geographies. I mean, the biggest expense we'll have this year is a geography where you have a water treatment facility at POTW that in the past has always taken leachate, not only from us but from a lot of other third party landfills around the area and they decided not to take leachate anymore. And so that's when Jim talks about cost going up by 500%, that's basically what happened and this geography. Our outlet for disposal basically disappeared, so now we have to find another outlet and it happens to be a lot further away. So in that type of case \u2013 and this is a fairly rural area in the Southeast, and so in most cases, if one POTW shuts you down, doesn't take leachate anymore, you can find another POTW. This happens to be in a more remote type area so you have to build your own treatment facility, but that's pretty unique to this geography. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Got it. Got it. And then out of curiosity, could you then open your own treatment facility to accept third-party leachate volumes? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We could if we wanted. I think it'll be fully utilized with our own capacity but we could if we wanted to. And then I think I'd just add a little bit to what David said. We don't expect to build these things across the country, across U.S. and Canada. We don't want in Eastern Pennsylvania, the one that he mentioned is in kind of the mid-Atlantic area, and we don't have any other plans to build them beyond those unless we see similar cost increases. But that is the concern and that's why we're proposing the charge here. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. Thanks a lot. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : I might \u2013 one clarification. We can but we would have to get a permit from the state that would allow us to accept third-party materials rather than just our own. The current permit does not allow that. So it's possible, it's just not part of the current plan. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's moot because we're going to have (01:10:52) James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We'll fill it up. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): You've got enough to keep your attention, I understand. Thanks a lot. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thank you, all. Obviously, we're off to a very strong start. We look forward to seeing the seasonal uptick in the second quarter and getting back to you with a more precise view of the full year at the end of the second quarter. But I would be remiss to say that when we get to report these good quarters, we as a senior team get to report the numbers. We still realize who produces the numbers, and that's our folks here at the corporate staff and our folks out in the field that are doing a spectacular job applying our strategies throughout the country. We will see you on the road, and we'll see you in the next quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for participating. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Our second quarter results again exceeded our internal expectations, and mirrored the trends we've seen for a number of quarters, improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and greater traction in our cost programs. In the second quarter, we earned $0.74 per share, an increase of more than 10% from our second quarter 2015 results. The combined revenue growth and cost improvement led to strong growth in operating EBITDA to $955 million, an increase of almost 9% and an improvement in our operating EBITDA margin of a 140 basis points to 27.9%. This is the highest operating EBITDA margin that we've achieved in seven years. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth in margin expansion. For the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved 80 basis points from the second quarter of 2015 and yield was up 90 basis points. Core price in the industrial line was 9.5%, in the commercial line it was 7.6%, in our landfill line it was 2.7% and in our residential line it was 2.5%. Importantly, in the second quarter, our churn was 9.1%, a 120 basis points better than the last year and 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2016, which demonstrates our ability to retain pricing and retain customers through improvements in our service efforts. At this point, we would certainly expect to exceed our full year core price target of 4% and our 2% yield target, although, both metrics could moderate somewhat in the back half of the year due to year-over-year comparisons. With respect to volumes, we saw positive volume growth in the second quarter just as we did in the first quarter. But most encouraging is that we saw volume growth in the right volumes, our high margin commercial, industrial and landfill lines. In fact, our commercial volumes turned positive for the first time in over a decade. We shed volumes in the lower margin residential and recycling lines of business as we continue to eliminate low or negative margin contracts. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 0.8% in the second quarter of 2016, a 140 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our commercial volumes were 0.3% in the second quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points in the first quarter and a 250 basis point improvement from Q2 of 2015. As this is our highest margin collection segment, this is a significant accomplishment and is reflected in the income from operations of the commercial line of business where we achieved the highest results ever. We expect to see continued growth in our commercial line as the year progresses, which is attribute to the efforts of our sales and marketing teams. So, our strategy of maintaining price discipline while adding the right volumes continued to bear fruit. We did see slightly stronger volume growth in the first quarter with weather in the first quarter of 2016 much milder than in the first quarter of 2015. So, we weren't surprised to see a little less volume growth in the second quarter versus the first, but we expect total company volumes to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year and we now expect our traditional solid waste volumes to exceed 1% positive by year end. Residential and recycling volumes were down on the quarter and we'd expect them to be down for the remainder of the year, but the loss of those volumes is mostly intentional, given that their low margin or often times even negative margin volumes. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results, which Jim will discuss in more detail. However, as we mentioned on the first quarter conference call, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. In the second quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate cost was about $22 million or $0.03 per share. As of July 1, we've implemented a wastewater management charge at all of our landfills for customers that are not under contract. We're still in the early stages, but so far, there has not been significant pushback. The next step will be to apply the charge to our disposal contracts as they renew. By passing these cost increases on to our customers, we'll ensure that we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfills. Turning to recycling, we saw a 2.3% increase in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 2.9% decrease in volumes. We continue to focus on managing operating cost as we've seen our recycling operating cost improved more than 9% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. These operational improvements and the increase in commodity prices drove the recycling line of business to its highest income from operations since 2012. When the blended commodity prices were a $109 per ton versus $85 in the second quarter of 2016. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed $0.01 per share to earnings. We continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling business model. To summarize, the positive momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter. All of our employees worked hard to deliver strong first half results by focusing on improving price, driving disciplined volume growth and managing costs. In light of a strong first half performance, we're increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to between $2.83 and $2.86 for the full year. A $0.09 to $0.12 increase from the low end of our previous guidance. More importantly, we're also raising our free cash flow guidance for 2016 to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, a $100 million to $200 million increase in the low end of our previous guidance, despite our expected capital expenditures being slightly higher than our previous guidance. So the momentum in our business continues. And our focus has never been sharper. We look forward to our corporate and field teams building upon this strong performance to drive even better results for the remainder of 2016 and beyond. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, David. In the second quarter revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of a $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We saw a $150 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to a $98 million increase from the combined impacts of price and volume and a $52 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. These increases were partially offset by declines of $24 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $10 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $5 million decline from lower recycling revenues. Looking at internal revenue growth for the company in the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6% with total volumes improving 0.4%. Volumes were positive for the second consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and positive volume, led to total company income from operations growing $58 million, operating income margin expanding 120 basis points to 18%, operating EBITDA growing $76 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points to 27.9%. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs and improved volumes. Overall, collection core price was 6.3% and yield was 3.3%. Industrial demand continued the strong performance that we saw in the first quarter. Volume was up 1.5% in the second quarter, a 150-basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. And as David mentioned, commercial volumes were positive for the first time since 2005 at 0.3% for the second quarter, a 250 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our residential business continues to be a drag on overall collection volumes, down 3.5% in the second quarter, similar to the declines that we've experienced throughout 2014 and 2015. However, strong core price and positive volume in the high margin commercial and industrial lines of business led to our collection income from operations growing $44 million, and the operating margin growing 120 basis points. EBITDA grew $54 million, and EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points. In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the second quarter, just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.5%. Our landfill volume growth is very consistent with the volume growth over the past two years. MSW volumes grew by 5.2%, C&D volume grew 12.5%, and combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes grew 4.4%. We achieved core price of 2.7%, an increase of 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2015, and saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 1.9% from Q2 of 2015. Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, those expenses improved 140 basis points to 62.2%. For the second quarter, operating expenses increased $22 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Landfill operating costs represented the largest increase, up $28 million. $22 million of the $28 million increase were the increased leachate cost, with the remaining $6 million increase related to the decline in the U.S. treasury rate used for discounting our long-term care obligations. The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase primarily relates to our increased volumes and cost related to acquired operations, which were partially offset by savings from lower fuel and risk management costs. For the second quarter as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.9%, up 20 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $340 million, an increase of $18 million compared to 2015. Labor cost drove the majority of the increase, primarily related to acquisitions and higher accruals for stock-based incentive compensation. As you may recall, our stock-based incentive compensation is based upon performance in the areas of free cash flow and total shareholder return. And we've achieved strong performance in both metrics the last two years. In the second quarter, those costs increased $11 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We expect that these costs will exceed last year by about the same amount in the back half of the year. We still expect to improve SG&A cost as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015. Turning to cash flow in the second quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $748 million, compared to $816 million in the second quarter of 2015. Our operations continue to perform very well as we achieved operating EBITDA increase of $76 million. However, this increase was more than offset by the impact of timing differences in cash tax payments of $75 million and working capital changes. We expect the working capital changes to even out over the remainder of the year. During the second quarter, we spent $312 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $16 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Through the first six months of 2016, CapEx has increased $100 million compared to 2015. A large portion of the increase relates to one-time capital spending for a leachate treatment facility and the timing of truck purchases. As a result, we now expect that capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for 2016. We do not believe that this year's increase in capital spending over our original guidance is a permanent increase due to the one-time nature of the extra spend. In the second quarter, we had $11 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $48 million from last year. Combined, we generated $447 million of free cash flow, and almost $849 million year-to-date. Given this strong first half performance, we're raising our free cash flow guidance to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $431 million to shareholders. We paid $181 million in dividends and repurchased $251 million of shares. Finally, looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.67 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.22%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 10% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 37.6% in the second quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, tax rate was 34.7%. We still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 35%. In summary, through the first six months of 2016, our employees have driven strong operational and financial performance that's exceeded our expectations. And for that, I want to thank them. The second half of 2016 we'll have tougher year-over-year comparisons. However, we're confident that we can execute our strategy to have a successful 2016. And with that Jinisha let's open the line for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Joe. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I just wanted to flush out the better than expected performance within really just your gross margins here in the quarter, can \u2013 how much of that would you attribute to the volumes kind of really turning the corner here and maybe getting a little more route density within some of your higher margin businesses like commercial versus say the reduction in churn that you saw in the quarter and maybe not losing some of those more profitable existing customers? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think they are two sides of the same coin, right. I mean, I think our performance on the volume side was driven by both. You can't have continued volume increases when you're leaking customers out at the backend. So, we've really done a nice job this year of not only adding more new business, but losing less of our business. And so what I'd say Joe is that, we did a great job on that front. But as we get the tools in place to really understand profitability by customer. We can be a lot more focused on maintaining the right customers rather than just retaining the right number of customers. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Joe, I would say on the operating \u2013 with respect to operating expenses, that was a good story as well. We were up $22 million if you exclude that pension charge last year, but you're up $22 million on 3.3% top-line growth. So if you adjust for revenue growth, our salary and wages line improved by about 20 basis points and we really overcame the merit increase \u2013 the annual merit increase of about 2.5% and that increase in landfill operating costs. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. And I guess ultimately what I'm trying to get at it is, you've had the price lever that you've been pulling. Now you're starting to see volume. Obviously, you've been working the cost side, should we think about the incremental EBITDA margins maybe being north of that typical kind of 30-ish plus percent that I typically think about going forward? Is that a reasonable bogey? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Certainly on the commercial line that's a reasonable bogey. I mean, you hit on it earlier which is the route density, the ability for us to add the right customers in the right location at the right price is really the core to our sales and marketing efforts. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And David, just to be cleared, I was talking total company not just commercial on that incremental EBITDA? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, the commercial line is \u2013 yes, you're absolutely right, certainly at the landfill line, it's higher than that. In the industrial line, it will be higher than that. But the commercial line is really where you get that benefit of added density. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then maybe just one last quick one, I'll turn it over. I think it's interesting that your commercial volumes are starting to turn the corner, really at the same time, it looks like the consumer maybe \u2013 could be getting a bit punkish. Are you thinking that this is going to be the beginning of a sustainable recovery in commercial volumes or would you caution us that it's going to be somewhat lumpy? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, when you look at what's happened to our commercial volume over the last, call it, 10 quarters. It's been a really steady progression of about 0.5% to 0.8% every single quarter. And so, the beauty of the commercial line of business is once you signup those customers, unless they go out business, they're with you for a long time. And with the churn rate going down, I would say we are at the beginning of the cycle, nowhere near the end. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Joe, I'd also add that most of our new customers, our greenfield sites, new customers, new startups, it's about at the 60% mark of new customers. So that tells you there is some economy positives occurring. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for my question. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So, just looking at your volumes, I mean, so now we've got our second quarter in a row of positive volumes, how did it track towards what you guys were expecting in the quarter, I know we had a lot of noise last quarter, but were these better than you expected? And then, how do things trend through July so far? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'd say they're a little bit ahead of where we expected. Like I said, the commercial line of business has been a very easy pattern to follow. The march has been very steady at about a 0.5 point to 1 point improvement every quarter. Obviously, the industrial line is a little bit more seasonal, and we probably had some of those volumes move into the first quarter, with the stronger construction season in the first quarter. The landfill line again has been a pretty steady march, again a little bit of extra volume probably in the first quarter. So I'd say we're a little bit ahead of where we are, but we don't expect the trend to change. That's why we think that we're on a very good march towards that positive 1% plus volumes by the end of the year. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Andrew, the big question that we had really at the end of the first quarter was how much volume did we borrow, because of the mild weather that David mentioned, how much did we borrow in Q1 from Q2. And that borrowing would have occurred really in two lines of business, it would have occurred in the roll off line of business primarily within the temporary roll off component. And then it would have occurred in the landfill line of business. And looking at it, it looks like if you adjust out the added work day that we had in Q1, we think we probably borrowed somewhere in neighborhood of 60 basis points to 80 basis points of volume in those two lines of business, but still when you look at a 150 basis point improvement in the industrial versus last year and commercial being up 250 basis points which didn't see any borrowing from Q1 to Q2. We felt pretty good about volume in Q2 and as David said, probably a little bit ahead of where we expected to be, particularly on the commercial line. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And with respect to last part of the questions, obviously it's still early, but July volumes continue to show the steady progression. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Let's get into July, I mean you said, you could probably do better than that 1%. But, I guess what's the hesitation there, I mean are there some pretty large contracts rolling off in Q3 and Q4 or is it just tough comps or what, I guess what do we expect into the second half? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, obviously, the comps get a little bit tougher that. And so, there is no, there are no big contracts. In fact, we have a couple of contracts on our national accounts side, that will be coming on in the back half of the year. And so, there really aren't any large volume losses like we've had in the past few years, particularly in the residential line of business. But there are a little bit tougher year-over-year comps. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, David, Jim, Jim, how are you today? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Michael. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, I have a question on the price side. You noted that you had a delta of about 80 basis points year-over-year on the core but you had a 90 basis points on yield on a \u2013 in the inside solid waste. So you clearly, that's the right direction. You're retaining more price within the core. What are you doing proactively to offset the leakage from $450-ish million of price you're going to the market with versus what you reporting? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Michael, as you've heard us talk about that's our Periscope project and Jim Trevathan is leading that, so maybe he can talk a little bit about what we're doing with Periscope. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Michael, I \u2013 I \u2013 you've noticed well because that is absolutely true. Part of it can be mixed, that we don't have control over. But what we do have control over, we're seeing the benefit of that. We're retaining more of that price. Periscope and it's a self service analytical platform, it really marries kind of revenue cost unit data, gives us profitability and trending profitability. We can do it, Michael, by customer, by sales rep, we can do it by customer segment or a sales channel by route, geography. It really will help us as we move forward. We're about halfway through, rolling it out to our 17 areas. Not all of them are executing with it. We're in the final steps of putting together a playbook that really will be because the analytics are so intuitive and so obvious, it will be really heavy on action. What do we do with the tool to get benefit? Most of that will come as we finish the rollout in Q4 and especially into 2017. But, for those areas that have been \u2013 have had it up and running, we see the benefit. We also see some real strong effort just in execution by our team on retaining those higher margin customers. And I think that plays into that yield positive as well. We've got really good processes that are being executed across the areas to retain customers and our operating team is providing a lot better service that we measure really consistently with real accountability processes. I think that trend will continue. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And based on the early rollouts, where it's been in for a while, what's the pace of that gap narrowing, I mean is it 10 basis points a quarter or is 20 basis points or 30 basis points quarter? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Michael, we've got, I don't have the number in front of me, but we've piloted in the Southeast and that's one of our highest yield and our most improved from a retention standpoint area. So we see the benefit of that from that area using it and implementing the tool. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on volume, if I follow the path of the sequential progression and you exit the year at over 1%, but it feels like you start the year at almost 2%, based on that \u2013 I mean the reported number will be over 1%, but you're starting 2017 at 2% on volume. Am I being overly optimistic about your volume outlook for 2017? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Obviously, we put our budgets together in the October-November timeframe. So, we'll look at it then and where we are at that point in time, but what I've said Michael is that I do think we're progressing towards that what I call the 2% price, 2% volume, the 2x2. I've said that it's probably 18 months away, but as we put together our budgets for 2017, hopefully we'll see it on the horizon a little sooner. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, there's lots of hand ringing in the stock market about the economy and recession here, there, Brexit all that. Can we break into two sort of pieces of your business. So the part that Harry Lamberton runs that approximately $1 billion that's industrial. If I pull out the energy waste business, which I get is down for secular reasons, what's the rest of the trend, and are you seeing any recessionary signs? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. It's interesting because you hear everybody talking about this industrial recession that's going on in the U.S., and I would tell you we're not seeing at our \u2013 our C&D volume, which is part of the industrial line of business, and then our special waste volumes are probably the best gauges of the economy \u2013 that part of the economy. And they're pretty strong, both were solid in Q2. June was the strongest month for the quarter, and July shows continued strength. So we're just not seeing the industrial recession. Now, maybe it's because we're at the backend of the cycle, but I would tell you, we're \u2013 even when we look at our special waste pipeline, it looks pretty strong. So, I'd tell you we're not seeing what the rest of the country seems to be talking about. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Michael, I'm not sure when the country talked about an industrial recession, I think they're thinking about things like automobiles and refrigerators. I think Houston is sort of indicative of the country, which is the west side of Houston is not doing so great because of low oil prices, but the east side of Houston, when you go to Beaumont, Lake Charles the spots where we have our industrial landfill base because of the low energy price inputs, those places are booming. You can't buy a house in Beaumont, not that anyone would want to. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Be careful. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But that's \u2013 yeah, that's a wonderful city. But the chemical corridor is doing spectacularly well, certainly is not in any kind of industrial recession. So, when we look at our overall industrial business, it's actually performing very well. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, if I follow that through on the consumer side. So every restaurant company in the country, that's casual or fast casual is reporting lousy comps. So, yeah, you would have shown positive commercial volume. And I think the restaurant comp issue is they thought their comps were going to be three and four and they're coming in at one and two and that's deemed lousy. How do you see like the commercial market in the context of like \u2013 end markets like restaurants or the entertainment or services sector? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The overall commercial business as Jim Trevathan mentioned with about 60% to 70% of our new business coming from greenfields, which are our brand new operating businesses. It seemed to us that the whole commercial end market is very strong. We don't look at it necessarily by the various segments but the end market actually seems to be very strong. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. And then last one from me. On your free cash flow raise $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, how many dollars of one-time that are unique to 2016 are in that $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There's probably three numbers that really matter in that, Michael. You've got the one-time CapEx piece and that's about $100 million and that's offset by kind of a one-time cash flow monetization \u2013 cash taxes monetization. So those two offset one another at about $100 million apiece. And then you've got just the business itself growing at about $100 million coming in through the EBITDA line. Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's great to know. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Thank you. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Just focusing on the decline in recycling volume this quarter, which I believe may be a part of the volume you're shedding. Can you speak a bit about the dynamics here just given that commodity prices have been on an upward trajectory recently? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The bulk of those \u2013 of those volume declines were large contracts, where we were losing money and we rebid them to make money and someone else took the contract. And so losing those volumes is the best thing we can do for recycling because they were literally negative margin volumes. Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then kind of on the same topic. I know you put into place recycling contracts that limit price exposure. And again with prices up for commodities, how will this affect the bottom line? Is there kind of a formula that you can give us or some kind of rule of thumb? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and look, prices are up, not dramatically, just in that 2% to 3% range \u2013 for the quarter. So, not a dramatic increase in price. And as we look forward, remember, every year, you seem to have that seasonal uptick and then starting in July, it starts to tick down. So, we're not certain that we're going to see that benefit in the back half of the year. But, generally what we say is that every $10 in commodity prices equates to about $30 million of EBIT for us. And so what we've tried do in this business is to make sure that if commodity prices go down, our earnings don't take a negative hit, but if commodity prices go up, they take a positive hit. So we've tried to de-risk the business. So that there's no downside, only upside. If the commodity prices go down in the back half of the year, we think we can offset that with operational improvement. So, we don't expect any negative benefit in the back half of the year, if we see anything in the back half of the year, it will be a positive benefit from recycling. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And if you look at the whole first half of the year on recycling, while we were up in commodity prices for Q2 by about 2.3%, we're actually down still year-to-date over 4% in commodity prices and, to David's point, we think that'll probably even out, we're cautiously optimistic because of the dynamic that he mentioned with kind of high prices in Q2 and then they tail off in Q3 and Q4, but we're cautiously optimistic that we might be able to get to flat pricing. All of the benefit that you're seeing from recycling, a big chunk of the benefit you're seeing from recycling for us has been on the OpEx side where we've taken quite a bit of OpEx out for the first six months and we'll continue to do so in the back half. Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Thank you. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yep. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Al. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: From LA, I should say, right, as opposed to Houston. On the recycling piece, we can talk a little further on that please, a clarification. A couple years ago, you called out and I think it was actually dollar valued sort of the improvement that you were looking for operationally. A lot of it was through negotiating and re-negotiating contracts. Some of the commodity price headwinds et cetera. But where are we at in terms of that tailwind on the improvement? You earned $0.01, I think this quarter, or you commented that I think you had $0.01, which is the first time you turned profitable in a while and so, maybe I'll just leave it at that and let you take it from there to see if you can share an update on where you are at. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah sure. We're about 75% to 80% of the way through what I'd call those negative margin contracts. We still have a couple more that will roll off over the next six months to nine months. And so, and that's why say in the back half of the year, being 75% to 80% through those contracts, obviously we still have 20% to 25% that have some exposure to downward commodity prices. But, if that 20% to 25% sees downward commodity prices, we do think we can offset that with operational improvement. So, that's why I say in the back half of the year, there really is only upside from recycling. There really isn't much downside. Now, as we look back into the back half of year, we're not counting on a dramatic commodity price increase. But any commodity price increase that we have obviously falls straight to the bottom line. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: All right. Are you hearing from customers in terms of new service adds in this area, are people \u2013 municipalities in particular \u2013 are they still \u2013 do they get it yet in terms of understanding the cost?. I know your messaging has been very direct there. But what's the feedback that you're getting as folks are looking at the service? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, I think they get it. It's been a very prolonged downturn. This has been a different downturn than we've ever seen in the recycling markets. And so, I think they get it. Now, early on in the cycle you had some people that came in and bid some of these contracts under the old methodology, right. And they're not very happy with those contracts right now. So, in my mind, it sort of follows the same cycle that we saw with the fuel surcharge back in the early 2000s where initially people go well, we will count on the markets bouncing back. So we'll continue to bid under the old model. They're now stuck with three-year to five-year contracts where they're going to lose money for three years to five years. The next time those contracts come up, they will be bid more rationally. So, not only do the municipalities get it but I think that, that the recycling business community gets it too. And so, I think what you'll see is a much more rational bidding behavior over the next five years. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Switching gears on the industrial side, you guys were on record in talking about this being a very, very strong growth area for you. It suggests to me it was more M&A implied but also organically. Could you talk about the environment there? There's certainly been a few companies that have struggled in this area. We've had a fair amount of tailwind from sort of the energy comps, which largely now I think is dissipated out of the numbers, so-called easy comps, but and then I think Jim made some comments earlier about the C&D and special waste but just talk about you put up 9.5% price, which I think was pretty, you got that number right, correct. Where do we go from here? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Al, there is a couple of components of that industrial line of business. It's a big category. Of course energy services, I mean that we've had some questions, when we've been out talking to investors about are you seeing your energy services business coming back because you're seeing the price of oil bouncing back up and what we've said is look, energy services is really not so much driven by the price of oil, as it is driven by drilling activity and we've not seen drilling activity rebound in the form of recounts. So, the energy service piece is still pretty soft year-over-year. It's a pretty big negative for us that we've fought back against. Coal ash is another component. Coal ash, as you know, we have a big Duke contract that \u2013 that is proceeding well for us. And we're seeing some, certainly seeing the landfill impact from that contract. The utilities \u2013 the public utilities are out there developing their coal combustion residual plants at each \u2013 for each plant. And we expect that those plants will result in a combination of kind of onsite work and some offsite disposal for us, in the next few years. So, coal ash will be good. I would tell you that, that for the most of these companies prefer to handle it onsite, prefer beneficial reuse, we can handle all three. But we'll certainly see some benefit in addition the new contract. C&D, we talked about. C&D has been strong and I would tell you that in talking to one of our area Vice Presidents, who has a strong C&D market right now, he believes that that's part of what's affecting his commercial volume is that David has said it many times, it's when you start seeing these big tracks of land being taken out and we get that C&D business. That maybe the more beneficial side of that is getting the commercial volume the permanent business on the backend of that. And this \u2013 this VP seems to think that's exactly what's going on and then, there are couple of other components within the industrial line of business as well. But overall I think, industrial looks to be reasonably strong for us and it appears to be continuing down that path. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Jim, on your coal ash opportunity, there are a couple of companies. One in particular that has a fair amount of relationships with the utilities on the sort of selling that ash out for beneficial reuse. Is M&A an opportunity for you guys here? Understanding that disposal or the offsite work you certainly are set up for. But wondering about the onsite work \u2013 onsite work excuse me and the marketing of ash? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, M&A is an opportunity for us there. Although, we've bought a company called FlashDirect a couple of years ago. And they have really grown tremendously since the acquisition of since we acquired them a couple of years ago. So, while we're always looking for proprietary technologies and that's what FlashDirect brought to us. Right now, we feel good with that acquisition, but not to say we wouldn't look at another acquisition there or in any other space, in energy services for example, it's got to be properly priced and we don't want to kind of buy at the bottom, but and we can talk more about M&A later. But, yeah, we'd certainly be interested in acquisitions, we just need to make sure it's the right technology and provides the right returns. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Finally David, if I can come back to your comment on your prepared remarks, I think you said that core price 4%, yield was 2%, and then you followed that with, it could moderate in the second half of 2016. Help me appreciate what you were \u2013 I won't say thinking at... David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. What I meant, Al, was that our original targets were 4% core price, 2% yield. We're going to exceed those, there is no doubt about it. This quarter it was 4.9%, so well above our target and 2.6%, well above our 2% target. And so, on the back half of the year, we've got some CPI headwinds, we've got some year-over-year comp issues, we've got the timing of price increases, so it might moderate a little bit. But, nothing dramatic, nothing that will dramatically affect profitability, we still expect that have a great back half of the year. And for the full-year, we'll clearly exceed that 4% core price target and that 2% yield target. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. So, you're saying moderate from the 4.9% and 2.6%? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Exactly. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: All right. We'll look forward to seeing the results. Thanks a lot. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Al. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, thank you, good morning. Just wondering, if we can touch on the residential portion of the business. You did shed some of the unprofitable volumes. Can you give us an update on how you're tracking with migrating to the Waste CPI sub index, something that I know certainly competitors talked about quite a bit. Can you give us a way to sort of measure where you are in the progress of that initiative. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Noah, Jim Trevathan, here. We absolutely are focused on it not just with the residential line of business but with our national account business. With CPI obviously below one and not looking for any real strength in that number. We have migrated in that regard. We're \u2013 on new contracts, that is the goal of every new contract to have a metric that is closer to our cost increases rather than CPI. And we're on the residential side probably a third of the way through. On the national account side, we're getting a different metric on every renewal of a contract. It may not be the full wastewater treatment metric, that's generally 200 basis points, 300 basis points higher than CPI. But we see that as the way forward to minimize the margin deterioration as our costs go up, but yet CPI stays below one. So that is absolutely a focus and we're little less than halfway through, but again those are long-term contracts. So, as they change, that's the goal. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Noah, even with the positive progress that Jim just talked about on shifting within these contracts, it's no secret that resi is a top line of business for us and I think it \u2013 to me it highlights the need for good solid disposal pricing. And we believe that we've made some progress on disposal pricing not as much as we would like part of \u2013 you will see an improvement as our charge kind of \u2013 how do we put it, in last quarter actually started on July 1. Starts to kind of come to fruition, but look that line of business has in all honesty has been a disappointment for us. We are doing a lot to try and fix it and part of that is addressing it on the disposal side of our business. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Noah, an example of that \u2013 of that focus, on the residential line we were over 2% in yield for the quarter where we haven't been over 2% for a couple of years on the resi line of business. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : So we're making real progress, that's measurable. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That is incredibly helpful. Thank you. That additional $100 million to $200 million of free cash flow, a nice upward revision there. Wondering kind of how you are thinking about allocation generally these days, how are you looking at the M&A landscape, certainly a rising tide tend to lift all boats and potentially evaluations. But we are seeing more indiscrete discipline on a number of fronts. So, wondering, how you're thinking about the M&A opportunities and also what kind of opportunities you are seeing for any kind of asset swaps and market consolidation? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. when we look at the \u2013 at the acquisition market, basically the last three years, we've done a moderate size deal each year that added sort of that $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA. So, we did Deffenbaugh \u2013 RCI in Montreal, Deffenbaugh in Kansas City and then SWS in South Florida. And we really don't see another one of those on the horizon. We've looked at a number of deals, in the Southeast and some other places where, what you've said is exactly right, sellers have gotten a little bit undisciplined on what they want. We're generally willing to pay sort of six times to eight times EBITDA, given the synergies we can pull out. For a bigger deal, we might pay 7 times to 9 times EBITDA, again, because we can get good synergies and post synergies, we can get it at sort of 6 times to 7.5 times EBITDA. The part of the problem is we've got a lot of the solid waste sellers that want 12 times EBITDA, and that's just not a number that really works for us. And so, we really don't see one of those decent sized solid waste acquisitions on the near horizon. We aren't looking dramatically outside of our core solid waste. As Jim said, if we saw some opportunistic buying on the industrial side or energy services, we'd look at that, but we are not currently actively looking at anything in that arena. And so, we're sort of back to what I'd say are our smaller tuck-in acquisitions, sort of the $10 million to $20 million type acquisitions. And we've asked our business developers to pick up the pace on those to make up for the fact that we don't have any of those larger transactions on the horizon. And so, you know the deal. These things go in cycles. There are not a lot of buyers out there, you really haven't seen a dramatic amount of activity in the M&A side. And so \u2013 and I think that's probably because a lot of these sellers have heightened expectations, as the industry dynamics have improved, I would say that the industry is showing just as much discipline on the M&A side as they are on the operational and pricing side, no one is out there paying crazy numbers. So, those businesses are going to be sold, it's just the matter of when they get to a reasonable multiple. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Yep. Well, thank you very much, and congrats on the quarter. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Scott. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Just want to push a little bit more on the guidance revision. And what's behind, it looks like the recycling business did a little better than you were budgeting for in the first half of the year. 1Q exceptionally strong, volumes seasonally \u2013 maybe a little bit more detail on explicitly what's behind the guidance raise. And also you know, I know you don't give guidance first half versus second half per se, but is this mostly just outperformance in the first half or is it factors that should continue to lend themselves to upside in the back half of the year and beyond? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. When I look at the first half of the year and the outperformance in recycling, the outperformance in recycling is sort of offset by the underperformance on our leachate costs, which as we've said were up $22 million this quarter. And so those \u2013 actually that's a slight negative overall. And so from an \u2013 from a business point of view, when I look at the year, it's the plain and simple stuff, it's the blocking and tackling, price, volume and cost control, right. And we've seen steady progress on all three of those. We don't expect that to slow down. And so, the back half of the year, it obviously ramps up a little bit more than the first half of the year. But, we're pretty optimistic that we're going to continue to see the strong performance continue. Again it's blocking and tackling \u2013 price, volume, costs. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Got it. Fair enough. Thanks. And as my follow-up, not to beat the dead horse on residential. But, I don't recall, I think you said, Jim, down 3.5% on volume. I don't recall offhand if that's better than it's been or maybe just a little bit more elaboration on what's driving the weakness. And it sounds like you're doing some things on the pricing side that are working well. But, how fixable is this or is this kind of an industry phenomenon and how confident are you that this business just in general that the metrics improve going forward? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Look it's about the same. I mean last quarter it was negative 3.4%. We've had some 2.6% and last year we had a couple of negative 3.6% on volume. So it's not been a great volume business for us. By the way, a lot of that is by design, but I think the changes that Jim talked about in those contracts are kind of back to David's point about de-risking the business or helping to de-risk the line of business. And then I think it's very important that we \u2013 we've had some very stiff competition within the resi line of business and so it's important for us to continue to push disposal price increases in addition to collection price increases. We're pushing collection price increases through this residential line of business on our customers, but I think it's important that we push disposal price increases on our third-party customers as well. They should have to pay their fair share. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Is it a certain class of competitor, where you're seeing the issues of large residential contracts or it's just intense competition for them and landfill prices delever to drive improvement or is there more to it than that? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Scott, Jim Trevathan. I think part of the issue on some of that volume loss, not all of it, but enough that it's measurable are from our local competitors. When you look at interest rates where they are. They can lease trucks at a really low cost and come in and take some of the neighborhoods for example that are around the Houston area. Now they probably don't have the capital, the capability from a capital standpoint to handle one of the larger locations or franchises, but they put pricing pressure on some of those local neighborhoods, where they can get a couple of trucks really, really inexpensively and that's part of the effect. What we do is look at it from an integrated standpoint as Jim Fish said. We're integrated and we're taking the \u2013 handling the disposal internally and it's not flow controlled to another disposal site then, we're going to retain that business. Where it's not we'll turn that volume loose where it's a low collection margin and put that capital to work at a place that we get a better return. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the beauty of that is when you see that local competitor take on sort of a moderate sized residential contract. Generally, what happens is they lose their focus on the commercial and the industrial side. So, they're adding trucks on the residential side. We don't have any problem with that, as long as they're not adding trucks on the commercial industrial side. So, for us, it's really a matter of balance, where do you want to invest your capital? And for us, we'd much rather invest our capital on the commercial industrial side than on the residential side. Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC : Understood. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger of Bank of America ML. Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks guys. With maybe not a large transaction on the horizon and with free cash flow coming in stronger than expected, could we maybe see more put to share buybacks or dividend growth perhaps, how are you guys thinking about that? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's really a great question. And look, as we've said many times, our first priority would be to reinvest it in the business through acquisitions. The fact that we don't have one on the horizon doesn't mean, these things \u2013 these things happens fairly quickly. So, we want to make sure that we keep enough powder dry that if something comes along, we're able to act and act fast without leveraging up the balance sheet too dramatically. And so, we're always going to save a little bit of a dry powder to make sure that we can do any of those acquisitions that come along. And then, when we look at it, obviously our dividend yield has gone down with the stock price going up. And so, at the end of the year, when we look at our dividend, I would expect that we'll see another good increase in the dividend coming into the back half of the year. And then, on the share repurchase side, the bulk of the remainder of our cash goes to our share repurchase. We don't really time share repurchases. And so, we're going to ultimately do sort of $500 million to $800 million of share repurchases every year and I'd expect to see that continue. Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. And on the churn rate I guess, how low can that go? What's the ceiling or I guess, the better term is the floor? How should we think about that progression? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Michael, we \u2013 we ask ourselves that same question regularly. In the vicinity of 5% is structural churn, it's businesses, small businesses that open and then come and go. So, we probably at this point, have about 400 basis points to play with. I fully expect it to stay in single-digits and whether \u2013 our next goal is to get it below that 9% number and into the 8%'s. I think that is an achievable goal over the next few quarters, next year or two and that's what we're after. That's affected both by service, by how we handle customer issues as they come up. I think the Periscope tool will help us in that regard and help us focus price increases on customer segments that tend to accept them better and therefore reduce that churn number. Some of the process issues I mentioned earlier will help us in that regard, but a lot of it boils down to much better just front line service provision that our field guys are 100% focused on. Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thanks guys. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey good morning guys. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Tyler. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey congrats on the swinging the pendulum over to the positive side on commercial volume, but Jim Trevathan, can you talk a little bit about the frontload fleet to how much excess capacity do you think you have in that fleet and how much of volume growth do you think you could absorb before you would have to see a bump in CapEx? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Tyler, we have plenty of capacity. There are a handful of markets, where we've added some frontload capacity on the route side, but our system has plenty of capacity when you look across the whole network to handle more volume. There are places as I said earlier that we've added routes, but with the tools that we now have to service delivery optimization and SDO with the onboard computers. When we add that we're adding it at that low cost basis rather than just a truck handling a handful of customers, we re-route regularly with that tool and make sure that the efficiency numbers stay up and they have as we've added volume in high growth market. So, I don't think you're going to see the huge impact whether it's to efficiency, you will see most of those dollars on the commercial customer additions going to the bottom line. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : By the way Tyler and we're buying more trucks this year. We're probably going to buy 10% more trucks this year than last year. So, we are buying some additional trucks you can imagine, we're not buying a lot of resi-trucks so most of them are going up on the industrial line of business and also the commercial line. James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Right, we'll about 1,300, 1315 trucks this year versus 1,120 last year. So we see that upside and yet our efficiency Tyler is still positive about 1% year-to-date. That's a good number for us compared to historic numbers. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. That was actually my second question. So is that 1,300, is that a heightened replacement or is that a more of a normal replacement cycle, I assume it heightened? James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It's heightened somewhat, especially as Jim said on the industrial side, because we're seeing more growth there and have consistently over the last couple of years. But it's \u2013 you're going to see it stay in that vicinity, we expect that volume as Dave said earlier, to go past one and we'll continue in that 1,300 or so trucks on just a replacement basis. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then Jim Fish, maybe I'm read into a little bit. But did your comments kind of indicate that CapEx would decline in 2017, given the leachate investments or do those stick around into 2017 just anyway to think about that? James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Specific to the leachate investment, yeah, I think you're going to see a decline because as we talked about that kind of $100 million, not all of it is, it is the leachate plant, or the waste water treatment plant. But yeah, specific to that they will decline now, there are some other things that could affect it, if we win a big contract for example next year that might offset some of that. But not knowing that at this point, I would say that we would see at least a partial decline off of this kind of $1.4 billion or $1.45 billion number.(1:02:10) Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Very helpful. And then this is a housekeeping question. I apologize, I got on the call late, I may have missed it, but what was the $40 million expense in the other line that was below EBIT and can you give us any help on how to think about that line going forward? David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. That's the impairment of some conversion technology investment that we had. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Steiner for an announcement and closing remarks. David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. In a year where there doesn't seem to be a lot of good presidential news, we actually have some very good presidential news here at Waste Management. Today, we'll be issuing a press release and we're going to file an 8-K, announcing that we're promoting Jim Fish to the role of President. I wish I could promote him to role of President of the United States, but unfortunately all I can do is promote him to President of Waste Management. As part of our ongoing succession planning process, the board and I felt that the next logical step in that process was for us to name Jim President. We are conducting a search for a new Chief Financial Officer, who will report to Jim and while that search is underway, Jim will retain his CFO responsibilities. Obviously, you all on the phone know Jim very well. Many of you have worked with him for a while now, so you know why the board and I have such confidence in him. He has really been pivotal to the success of our company and he's also a talented leader with tremendous knowledge of all aspects of our business. The promotion is a well deserved recognition of his past accomplishments and another step in his development as a leader. I'm sure, you'll join me, our board, our senior leadership team and the rest of our Waste Management family in congratulating Jim on this great achievement. And with that operator, we will see you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management conference call.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner. David Steiner : Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes strong attitudes in our pricing programs and continue traction in our cost programs. Each of our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin and earnings per diluted share improved when compared to the third quarter of 2015. And during the third quarter, we achieved the significant milestone as our operating EBITDA exceeded $1 billion for the first time. We earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 13.5% from our third quarter 2015 results. Our continued growth and earnings translated into strong generation of cash flow from operations, which grew $96 million in the third quarter and drove year-to-date cash from operations to over $2.2 billion, that\u2019s almost a 12% increase over last year. So, we\u2019re very pleased with the momentum that we built in the first three quarters of the year, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and extend it to 2017. Our pricing programs are significant reason for our earnings growth and margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and collection and disposal yield was 2.1% with total company yield at 2.6%. Core price improved 70 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. Core price in the industrial line was 8.6%, in the commercial line it was 7%; and in both our landfill and residential lines, it was 2.6%. Importantly, we demonstrated our continued ability to increase prices while retaining customers through improved customer service. As our churn rate dropped to 8.7%, that\u2019s 170 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than the second quarter of 2016, this is the lowest churn that we've seen since before 2015. It attributes to our customer service and operations folks who work together to create a better customer experience. With respect to volumes, we continue to see positive volume growth in the third quarter just as we have all year. In the quarter, we saw volumes in our high margin commercial, industrial and our landfill lines of business continue to grow, and we saw an improvement in the rate of decline of residential volumes. On traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.6% in the third quarter 2016, a 170 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015, and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially from the second quarter of 2016. And our overall volume was also a positive of 1.6%, as our national accounts and recycling segments contributed positively to volume growth in the quarter. Our entire team continues to execute on our strategy of maintaining price, adding high margin business and improving customer service, and the results continue to impress. Our landfill line of business continues to shows strong results too, which Jim will discuss in more detail; however, as we previously mentioned reaching the significant increase in the cost of managing the liquid that occurred in our landfill. In the third quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate cost was about $23 million or a drag of $0.03 per share. We continue to rollout our Waste Water management chart to our landfill customers through our under long-term contracts. However, the charge is fully implemented on our spot customers. So, in the third quarter, we added approximately to 0.2% to landfill yield from implementing the charge, with almost no pushback. However, we still have a long way to go before we can recover the full cost. It\u2019s important that we pass the cost increases onto our customers, so that we can achieve an appropriate return on investment on our landfill assets. But just like when we implemented fuel surcharge, it will take time to fully implement discharge. Turning to recycling, we saw a 13.6% increase in average commodity prices at our recycling facilities for the quarter and a 0.9% increase in the volumes. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed almost $0.03 per share to earnings, which helped to offset the $0.03 of increased leachate cost. The improvement in earnings was driven by about $0.01 from pricing and about $0.02 from operational improvements at our recycling plants and our continued efforts to improve our contracts. On the operational side, our recycling employees have done a nice job on improving operational efficiencies, such as reducing downtime events through preventative maintenance practices, educating customers about contamination and charging for contamination all ridges. This led to gross operating expenses improving 4.5% in the third quarter; and on the contract side, we continue to work with customers on more fair contract terms to allow Waste Management to remain their recycling partner and provide us with a sustainable business model. So, we\u2019re very pleased with our third quarter results as well as our results through the first nine months of 2016. We are proud of hard work all of our employees have done to-date to exceed our expectations for yield, volume, earnings and cash flow generation. Consequently, we are again raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2016. We are confident that we can achieve consensus for the fourth quarter, which would put us at $2.91 of EPS for the full year. Cash flow continues to be strong, and we remain confident that we can achieve our free cash flow guidance for 2016 of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. As we move towards the end of the year, we will do what we have done in the past few years where we estimate full year cash flow and determine, if we want prepay up to a $100 million of our 2017 capital spend or taxes. I want to thank all of our team members for demonstrating once again why they are the best in the business. I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail. Jim Fish : Thanks, David. The third quarter was indeed another strong quarter for us. Revenues on the quarter were $3.55 billion, an increase of a $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. We saw a $110 million increase in our collection and disposal business from a combined price impacts of pricing and volume. A $60 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures, and recycling revenues increased $27 million. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million decline related to lower fuel surcharge revenues. Foreign currency fluctuations had no material impact on revenues, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Looking at internal revenue growth for the Company, in the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and yield was 2.1% with total volumes improving 1.6%. Volumes were positive for the third consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $65 million, operating income margin expanding 90 basis points to 18.8%, operating EBITDA growing $71 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 50 basis points to 28.2%. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of improving volume. Industrial volume was up 1.9% in the third quarter, a 150 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015, and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially. Commercial line of business showed strong momentum with volumes up 1.2% in the third quarter. A 250 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 90 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2016. While our residential business volumes were down 2.9% in the third quarter, this reflected a 70 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 60 basis point improvement sequentially from the second quarter. Overall our collection income from operations grew $26 million and EBITDA grew $38 million in the third quarter. In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the third quarter, just as we saw in the first and second quarters of this year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.9%. MSW volumes grew 6.1%, C&D volume grew 22%, and combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes grew 6.7%. More than half of the growth in C&D was due to storm clean up in Louisiana, but underlying trends remain strong. We achieved core price of 2.6%, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The combined positive price and volume in the landfill line of business led to income from operations and EBITDA each growing $12 million in the third quarter. Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, these expenses increased to 10 basis points to 62.5%. For the third quarter, operating expenses increased to $121 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Landfill operating costs represented the largest increase, up $29 million. $23 million of the $29 million increase were the increased leachate cost, which equated to 60 basis points to the percent of revenue. The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase related primarily to our increased volumes and costs from acquired operations, with labor costs increasing $28 million, cost of goods sold increasing $25 million, and subcontractor costs increasing $22 million. These increases were partially offset by savings from lower fuel costs. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see operating expense margin improvements as we add waste water treatment capacity and as our increased fuel fleet purchases and MSPO initiative began to positively impact maintenance costs. For the third quarter as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.3%, an improvement of 50 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $330 million, a slight improvement compared to 2015. We've done a nice job controlling SG&A costs as increases in wages and compensation have been offset by other improvements. Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $753 million, compared to $657 million in the third quarter of 2015. Our operations continue to perform very well as cash flow was driven largely by an operating EBITDA increase of $71 million. During the third quarter, we spent $333 million on capital expenditures, a decrease of $2 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Through the first nine months of 2016, we have spent $962 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $98 million when compared to the first nine months of 2015. We still expect the capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for the full year 2016. In the third quarter, we had $8 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $28 million from the prior year quarter. Combined, we generated $428 million of free cash flow, a $70 million increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, we have achieved free cash flow of $1.28 billion. We remain confident in achieving our full year 2016 free cash flow guidance of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. In the third quarter, we paid $182 million in dividends to our shareholders. While we didn't repurchase any shares during the third quarter, we currently plan to start buying back our stock again in the fourth quarter when the window opens. We expect that these late 2016 and early 2017 repurchases will allow us to completely offset the 2017 dilution impacts of our equity compensation plans. Finally, looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.56 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.17%. The floating rate portion of our debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 33.7% in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, the tax rate was 33.5%. We still expect that our full year as adjusted tax rate will be approximately 35%. In summary, year-to-date 2016 has been a very successful year, driven by the exceptional performance from our employees. I want to thank them for their efforts through the first nine months. I know they are working hard to improve our operational and financial performance for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, and we are confident that they will be successful. And with that Jinisha, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instruction] And your first question comes from Noah Kaye. Noah Kaye : I would just like to start with maybe your thoughts on the general environment. We\u2019ve seen commentary around maybe a moderating macro longer-term on the other hand that continues to be some optimism around housing growth, but maybe, Dave, if you could sort of tell us how you\u2019re seeing the picture these days and maybe the sustainability some of this very impressive growth that you\u2019re seeing? David Steiner : Yes, we obviously can\u2019t look out a number of years, but we said very often that the best indicator for our business is new housing starts. And as you know, we\u2019ve been running a deficit on new housing starts in the United States since 2009. So, we still haven\u2019t gotten to the point where we\u2019re meeting annual demand for new housing start. So, everything I\u2019ve seen, says that\u2019s going to continue to be strong through 2020. Now, obviously, you saw there are some labor challenges in the housing markets, but once those get evened out, I think you\u2019re going to start to see those new housing starts move up from that 1.1 to 1.2 to sort of a 1.4 million to 1.5 million. And you can run at that rate for a good three years to four years before you actually catch up with demand. So, and following those new housing start, you\u2019ll see commercial businesses come in. So, we see the commercial business remaining strong. And then I think, our other lines of business like our industrial and our oil field services, I think oil field services has bottomed out. We should see a recovery, I don\u2019t think that will be a huge robust recovery in 2017. But I think, we\u2019ll see a good steady recovery over the next couple of years. So, absent any big political event or big regulatory event, I would expect that we\u2019ll continue to see good volume growth over the next few years. Jim Fish : Now, I might add one thing and that is, well, it's sometimes hard to see what the microeconomic climate holds. Demographics are kind of set in stone, and when you look at housing starts as David talked about, you\u2019ve got a big generation that kind of Millennial Generation, that\u2019s coming into their own in terms of moving out of parent homes and buying their own houses. So, we feel pretty good about that housing start, which is a direct correlate for us going forward for us for next 5 year to 10 years. Noah Kaye : Getting the churn rate down to a slowest level, and over a decade, again very impressive, can you go further from here and where do you see it delivers, continue to drive churn rate lower at this point? And also, how do you think about some of the pricing stickiness benefits of the churn rates being at this level now? Jim Fish : Yes, our pricing programs quite frankly have always been premised on providing better customer service. I always use the cable model, right. We all get an offer to get lower cable or lower TV service, once a week. We will get something that will promise us a lower price, but we don\u2019t switch because the pain in switching is high, and the cost differential is not dramatic. So, you got to keep that good customer service because you don\u2019t change TV provider until you start having service issues, and that\u2019s when you take those lower price offers, and you say, I\u2019m going to listen to these and actually get this done. And so, customer service is pivotal to the long-term sustainability of our pricing programs. And I would say, it\u2019s two things that really driving. One is technology. I mean, in use of technology, the use of data, and I would tell you in that we\u2019re probably in sort of the second to third inning. But the more important part of customer service is making sure that our customer service folks, our sales folks and our operations folks are all working hand-in-hand to make sure that we give a great customer experience. And frankly that\u2019s where we've made a lot of progress over the last two year. Jim Trevathan and his team have done a phenomenal job of creating better connections between our sales folks, our customer service folks and our operations folks to make sure that we\u2019re all driving to that same goal. So, yes, it can go lower, a probably about 4% to 5% of that churn is systemic, people going out of business, moving business different thinks like that. But we think we can continue to get it lower and we expect to do so. Jim Trevathan : With a couple of specific examples of that, Jim Fish and I listed with our national account team last week. And we rolled out in the last year, a very specific tools that helps us provide for our largest customers, some online and a real-time information that helps them manage their business more aggressively. And it's led us as Dave and Jim mentioned in earlier, it's led us grow national account revenue in total this year, where that\u2019s been a negative drag of our volume in previous years. So, we\u2019re trying to differentiate that service offering very specifically. The other thing, without getting into any specific metrics; and it ties to exactly what Dave said, we\u2019ve added some operating metrics that tie directly to service to our customers, rather than just add internal efficiency look. And that's really helped us focusing the right think, we think add that specific value. And I guess, the last thing I have mentioned there is that, that we've gotten much more aggressive in the process that how we handle service challenges with our customers. Occasionally, we fell and when we do, we want to correct it quickly and adequately. But we also want to make sure that we renew contracts, every opportunity we get, so we\u2019ve added several process changes that led us renew those agreements once an issue, either positive or negative happened. And I think, it\u2019s added to that decreasing churn number. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Andrew Buscaglia : Can you talk a little bit more about, on the volume side, so that definitely was stronger than we expected, I thought moving into the second half of the year, you guys would see more it like flatter up slightly number, but can you talk about why -- where are the things surprised you obviously C&D was pretty strong, but what exactly happened and how surprised were you with these numbers? Jim Fish : Well, look, I think the trend has been there now for about five quarters. So, I would tell you the move up in the volume number was not surprising at all. What I would tell you is, where we've made the most progress, I would say is on the commercial line. We finally flipped last quarter the commercial line to positive volume, and those are the customers that stay with you on average somewhere between 7 and 9 years. And so, they are long-term customers, we can create that route density. And so adding that 1.2% volume on the commercial line, I think is tremendous. I wouldn't say, surprised, but I would say that, that we're happy to see the landfill continue to be so robust. And it really doesn't look like that's going to slow down dramatically. Now, we may not continue to see that 22% on the C&D line, but we fully expect to continue to see sort of that 4% to 7% increase in the landfill. We don't see that's slowing down, and so we've created some good volume momentum, and we'd expect that to continue in the '17. Jim Trevathan : And I don't think you can overstate also the importance of that chart number that, Jim, just talked about. I mean, when our churn is at 8.7% and it wasn't too long ago that we were in the 11s, that is a big contributor, and it comes as Jim said largely from our focus on customer service which doesn't cause you to lose yield. You keep a good solid customer through improved customer service. David Steiner : Yes, Jim, the addition rate itself we talked more about the defection side, but on the addition side, we were up 50 basis points there, providing another quarter that was net positive in number of customers, not just dollars. Andrew Buscaglia : And your C&D seemed to have benefited, you mentioned, the Louisiana some work down there, how about in Q4 with storm cleanup from Hurricane Matthew, do you expect volumes to just kind of continue at this level here? Jim Trevathan : Yes, like any big storm event, the initial issue is that we've increased operating costs. We were actually as a company hit particularly hard by the flooding from the hurricane, we lost probably 20 brand new CNG trucks that were flooded out. And so, we have to move other trucks in, to cover for those trucks, and so the initial will actually be a cost for us. But obviously, you'll see some additional volumes, but it really was not a hurricane that hit in very populated areas and that caused lot of damage in populated areas. And so, if I had to guess, I would say it would be about a wash for the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is from Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Al Kaschalk : So, performance, David, I want to just drill down on two topics. First, on the volume side, you called out the special waste piece, and if I'm not mistaken that's really more fly ash directed. So, could you talk about maybe the duration of that and what it means more for your broader outlook as it moves to volume? I know you\u2019ve said a few things earlier, but is this more a comment that there is reacceleration in the economy from your perspective, and therefore, this landfill and transfer volumes revenue should be continue to remain strong for couple of quarters. Jim Trevathan : Yes, the ash is actually a very small part right around 10%. David Steiner : Less than that. Jim Trevathan : It's a special waste, so it\u2019s really a pretty small part. But, we continue to see good growth in that area, and we expect to continue to see good growth in that area. As far as special waste goes, my view of it, Al, is that we never really saw the industrial slowdown. And I think, people talk about an industrial slowdown and they focus on a particular sector like, my focus on the automobile sector, they might focus on the housing sector and they might focus on a particular sector and say, well gee, that shows that there\u2019s an industrial slowdown. We cover all the sectors and we service all of the sectors, and we really just haven\u2019t seen when you look at it on that basis with all of the industrial business, we really haven\u2019t seen the slowdown. So, we\u2019ll see a slowdown maybe in the oil field sector, but we\u2019ll see a picked up in the chemical corridor. And so, overall, we really haven\u2019t seen the industrial slowdown, and we don\u2019t see it on the near horizon. David Steiner : And I'd say, but there is no -- Jim Trevathan : I was going to say, Al, part of that answer is because we're well distributed with our asset based across so many geographic areas, but also as Dave said, specific industries, we are so well positioned along the Gulf Coast with all of the capital being spent to improve petrochemical industry that we picked up quite a bit of volume, those hazardous sites along the Gulf Coast while other places show maybe a little bit weakness and that\u2019s the strength of our company. Al Kaschalk : I would have thought with the government spending, the election, housing sort of shaking around a little bit, mix data here, that the volume would not have been as strong. Although, look, I\u2019m not taking anything away, I\u2019m just trying to tease out the duration of the tenure of what you see it looks like to be 2% volume growth for the next several quarters. So, that\u2019s sort of that one the setting out. David Steiner : Yes, we just don\u2019t see -- at this point in time, we certainly don\u2019t see that momentum stopping. Jim Trevathan : Well, actually, Al, a piece that's been a week for us has been energy services, and we\u2019re starting to see -- starting to hear a little bit from drillers that they may be looking to add capital expenditures in drilling, in 2017. So, we\u2019re not banking on that, but that would be a benefit to us in the landfill. Al Kaschalk : Okay. My second follow-up, if I may. I wanted to talk a little bit, I know, it was 23 million in terms of cost for the quarter. But just on a bigger pictures standpoint, the leachate cost seems to maybe something that\u2019s maybe going to stick with you for a while. But maybe you can add some color as to how broad base that is, is it just a few sides? Is it regional? Is there weather issues that are going on? What\u2019s the future expense that we should be thinking about? David Steiner : Yes. I would say that it\u2019s obviously two factors, the volume of leachate and then the cost of disposal of the leachate, right. And there is not a lot we can do about the volume of the leachate. When it rains, we get more leachate. But there is something that we can do, on the disposal side, and that is the bigger part of that $23 million of expense, is disposal side. So we\u2019re building waste water treatment plants, we\u2019re going to look at doing some deep well injection at various sides and so. If we can reduce that disposal cost, we think we can bring that cost down pretty dramatically. Now, that takes a little bit of a time, so we would expect these increase leachate cost to be with us at least through mid-year of next year and probably throughout 2017. But in 2018, we ought to be able to attack it pretty well. Jim Trevathan : Now, I would say that it is, someone regional, but we\u2019ve seen an increase in transportation, not just in kind of East Coast, Mid Atlantic and doing one, we\u2019ve seen it in Michigan area, we seen it in Texas, not obviously so much on the West Coast. And I don\u2019t think you guys have rained there for couple of years. So, we haven\u2019t seen much in the West or the Rocky Mountains, but defiantly the rest of the country has seen an increase, not only in volume but in transportation cost. Al Kaschalk : I appreciate all the colors. Are there any one or two sides that, I don't say are problem child, but could be or are working that way there? David Steiner : The biggest issue we had was in Virginia, when we got, basically, we were transporting the leachate to a water treatment facility, municipal water treatment facility of the PLTW. And they shut off the leachate, not just from our landfill but from all landfills. And so, it\u2019s not an issue that is unique to us. We just happen to have too large landfills fairly close to that PLTW. And so -- and by the way that\u2019s happening a little bit more throughout the country, I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s a trend, but that\u2019s the biggest part of what\u2019s driven our transportation cost. Now, instead of transporting it to a local PLTW, we got to put it on trucks and barges, and ship it 100 of miles. And so, if we can build the waste water treatment facility on site, obviously, you eliminate that transportation cost, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. Operator : Your next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari : The first question is just on free cash flow, is 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion the new normal for Waste Management, 5 to 10 years and ago was 1.1 billion. Just trying to get a sense of, is the free cash flow profile sustainable, given that data, features don\u2019t seem like a big part of the number at least this quarter? Jim Fish : Yes, Hamzah, as you recall back a couple of quarters ago, we kind of set the new normal was 1.4 and it feels like that number is going out and it feels like more or like a 1.5. If you look at, kind how to get to our range of 1.6 to 1.7 for this year, I kind walk you through little bit of it. But most of it comes from the single biggest component, which is EBITDA, which is in my mind kind of the best proxy for how the business is doing overall. So, if we think about finishing 2016 with about 365 in the EBITDA, and then you back out CapEx kind of the middle of that range, so that I give it on earlier. So back out CapEx of 1.425 billion last kind of the some of the interest taxes and working capital of about 650 million. And then you added proceeds, and you\u2019re right proceeds are kind a small number this year compared to prior years. But adding proceeds of about 50 million, and that puts you at about 1625 finishing point for 2016. And then in order to get to kind of a new normal, you probably have to kind of normalize cash taxes a bit. We haven't decided exactly what we're going to do. But for the last two years we've actually prepaid some cash taxes, two years ago, we prepaid 200 million. And last year, we prepaid a 150 million. And as we said when we did it, it was really an effort to try and kind of smooth out cash flows a bit, so we don't have these big lumps. But, we'll look at that as we get to the end of year and to the extent that we're kind of over the top of that low end of the range, maybe look to prepay some cash taxes in December. Jim Trevathan : So, Hamzah, I would completely agree with Jim that I think, I think the business is about a $1.5 billion free cash flow business, I think that's sort of baseline. And then you look at what happens with working capital, right. If working capital goes positive, this year it goes positive because of the prepayments that's how you get to about 1.6 to 1.7. And so, I would say that I'd agree with Jim, the baseline is sort of 1.5 and then you have a couple of other moving items within working capital that could drive it above that. Hamzah Mazari : And then second question on commercial volume, we saw a nice recovery there. But aside from the last two, three quarters, it's been negative since 2008. And I realize that you've been getting rid of low margin business, but maybe just frame for us where we in that commercial volume cycle -- is it the second inning, the third inning? And can commercial see the same cycle industrial volumes have, just curious on any thoughts there? David Steiner : Yes, I would tell you, Hamzah that I think we're in the early inning, still. I talked earlier about housing starts and how housings starts are, the demand is there. The problem right now is that it's hard for the housing companies to get labor. And I would say that's sort of where we are in this cycle, right, that the demand is there. But getting drivers, mechanics, getting the labor, getting the trucks in place, is something that we've got to work to be able to meet the demand. And so, I'm encouraged that I think we're in the early innings because the demand is there. Now, it's a matter of us getting the labor and the equipment there to meet the demand. But, I'll let Jim. Jim Trevathan : Completely, agree Dave, it's been a little more of a challenge, you saw that, little bit of the compression in the operating margin. Although, with move forward, it was smaller than previous quarters, and we think that's primarily related to some new route trucks that were not routed before, we've spent a few dollars in maintenance costs to get them up and running and servicing customers correctly. And it's a good problem to have that we see continuing but we're getting our arms around how to do that quicker and faster and better as that volume is forward. And I think, I mean the economy, that's kind of late cycle economy that I've read, you all have talked about. It's definitely is helping volumes. And then I think our process in some of the additions that we've made on how we go out and find that volume. We're targeting volume especially on the commercial side, but also industrial, much more specifically to MSAs that have growth and where do we put the right resources in place, both human and physical resources in place, how do we target it correctly, price it correctly. And those tools have been out there, we're just using them much more consistently across all areas, sharing best practices and you're starting to see the benefit of that. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : If we\u2019re in a 1.5% to 2% volume growth next year, what can we reasonably expect for margin expansion? Is it just still work to do, I know, we have leachate cost, but still other areas that we could look at for the cost item that we can make sure that we can get margin expansion? Jim Fish : Yes, when you look at the margin expansion, I think that we still have that 50 to 100 basis point. So, when we look at 2017, we will probably expect to not get a big benefit from recycling even though we think commodity prices are up. We\u2019ve been bitten by that before, so when we put together our plan we probably won\u2019t expect to get a large benefit from recycling. So, that won\u2019t contribute the margin. Obviously, we\u2019ve got this leachate expense which will restrain the margin. But what we need to do is get efficiency gains by adding route density, we need to get more dollars of price as we see the construction season beginning next year and we need to do I think a better job of planning for the construction season and meeting the increase demand that we would expect to see. And to meet that what\u2019s going to drive the margin, obviously, the Jims and our other operations folks keep a great eye on SG&A. And as you see revenue go up, obviously, we pick up basis point there because we\u2019ll hold SG&A relatively flat. And so I think that 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion next year, so to come probably 40% from SG&A and about 60% from the operating side. Michael Feniger : That\u2019s perfect guys. And my follow up, if we do see volumes come out a little bit late next year. Is there any way to move in towards or maybe stepping up the acquisition side or situations you guys talk about the pipeline there and what are you\u2019re seeing on the M&A front? Jim Trevathan : Yes, the last three years, we've sort of done that $50 million to $70 million EBITDA acquisition starting with RCI in Canada and then Deffenbaugh in Kansas City and then SWS in South Florida. And we really don\u2019t see, one of those types of acquisitions in the pipeline for 2017. So, we\u2019re going to have to go back have to doing it one acquisition at a time doing those $5 million to $25 million type of acquisitions and get our business developers to really go out and start getting some folks to build up those types of acquisitions, so that we can reach. We like to add somewhere between $25 million and $40 million of EBITDA next year, but we\u2019ve got some work to do in order to get that done. Operator : Your next question is from Corey Grindal with First Analysis. Corey Grindal : So, just looking at yield being a little bit softer in Q3 relative to Q2, just wondering what do you attribute this to and what do you see as the sustainable rate going into 2017? Jim Trevathan : Yes. As you know we\u2019ve always said, we think that yield should be somewhere around 2%. The overall company was 2.6%, we actually got some positive from recycling and some other areas where we've sort of been negative lately. So, it\u2019s pretty much right where we expected to be now, we moved that in the back half of the year. And I think we said on the first two quarter conference call that, that it would probably abate in the second half for the year, between CPI and mix that we would see it come down closely to about 2. But you know when I look at -- when I look at pricing increasingly, we\u2019re looking at core price, not yield, because yield has those mix issue in it. Yield has some of the CPI issues in it. But core price is the actually dollar that we\u2019re putting on the street and holding onto in pricing. And as you saw, that was up 70 basis points this quarter. What we said as that we think core price should be sort of at that 4% number year-in and year-out. We would expect that to continue. And so, we continue to get that 4% plus core price, yield should continue at around 2%. But we\u2019re going to get too worked up over a few basis points of moment here or there based on CPI or on mix. Corey Grindal : And just looking at commodity prices, which have been on an upward trajectory, what kind of impact are you expecting for your recycling revenue over the next few quarters? And does this have any impact on your efforts to change contracts? Jim Trevathan : No, I mean, look, we got to get -- you can\u2019t fall into the trap of saying, no, prices are going up, so let's go back to the old style of doing business in recycling. We absolutely will never do that as long as I\u2019m breathing. And so, it won\u2019t affect our contracts, it will affect -- we will continue to readout those contracts that are under the old form. And basically, we\u2019re about 80% through with that. When you look at the pricing, it\u2019s up, but it\u2019s not dramatically up. And it\u2019s been fairly volatile over the last few years, so we\u2019re not declaring victory, we\u2019re going to continue to go after all the operating cost that we can on the recycling side. And like I said, we won\u2019t expect to get a benefit from it, in 2017. But if we get a benefit that will help to offset some of those increased leachate cost. Jim Fish : Now, we\u2019re finished when you think about were we -- to put its historical prospective, we finished the quarter about $98 in our average commodity price for us. And the 10-year historical average is kind of 103ish. So, still slightly below that, and as David has said, we've fallen into the trap before of some saying we think this trend continues and we'll build it into the guidance for 2017. At this point we, while we haven\u2019t put the guidance, we\u2019re not probably not going to set high expectations for commodity prices for 2017. Corey Grindal : Thank you. Jim Trevathan : And by the way to the volume issue, because I think you did ask about the volume too. Most of the increase that we saw and we did see a positive volume in the quarter, but most of that volume was brokerage volume, which obviously is very low margin volume. When you look at the core processing business, as you know we've shed a lot of unprofitable contracts over the last three years. And so the core business is still seeing some negative volume on the recycling side, but we had really strong brokerage volume. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital. Joe Box : David, if I heard you right, I think you said, you're looking for about 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion next year. And I think you called out 40% of that being SG&A and 60% being operating, maybe if you can drill into the SG&A, which it was basically at the lowest level that I could find in my model going back to at least 2003. When you look at that going forward, are there any big items that you expect to cut out SG&A? Or is this more a function of just watching your costs and getting good leverage on that revenue growth? David Steiner : I do think it is, it is watching the costs. And the Jims and the operating folks have done a spectacular job of keeping SG&A flat despite the fact we gave a 2.5% to 3% merit increase, every year. So, they've done a nice job of keeping the dollars flat. And then, if the revenue goes up, that's where you get the expansion. And look, we've always said, if we can start putting volume onto this sort of high fixed cost structure that we have, that's how we generate margin expansion. And we feel like we've got the right level of SG&A in order to meet the needs of the business whether it's in today's environment or in next year's environment where we see the volumes go -- continuing to go up. And so, we don't think that we're going to have to add a lot of dollars of SG&A. We've done a nice job on SG&A over the last five years of taking out costs, I would tell you there's not any big dramatic decrease in SG&A. It's just a matter of making sure that you're not adding people that you don't have to add. That you're not adding expenses that you don't have to add. And Jim and the operating guys do a spectacular job of looking at every dollar of SG&A we spend and making sure that it's justified. Joe Box : And maybe just switching gears to the coal ash side, can you maybe talk about what the coal ash contribution was in the quarter, either from a revenue or volume standpoint, where are you putting that? Is that primarily in the special waste bucket? And I'd be curious to know, how the margin is coming in for coal ash, if it's accretive to the overall margin or if it's dilutive? David Steiner : Yes, Joe, overall as we said earlier on the call, coal ash, the disposal portion, flows into the special waste revenue generating cover category, and that was up almost 7%. The coal ash part is less than 10% of that total, so it's still a small part of our overall revenue but a growing component of our revenue. We also have some onsite activities. We've done work on those customer sides where we're moving materials from one location to another, helping them operationally manage both their generated waste materials, but also their historic materials that are stockpiled and need remediation. So, there's an onsite component. That onsite component is without a doubt a lower margin. It is accretive to our company. But it also -- it has a very low capital costs associated with it. The disposal side, much higher margin and when we go off site, higher margin. But it's typical to our landfill margins. So, it is a good part of our business but it's not a substantial part yet, Joe. But we expect it to be over the coming years to continue to grow as those regulations take effect. And companies decide what they're going to do on their site to meet those new regulations. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : So, Jim first on, SG&A you started the year targeting a flat year-over-year in dollars. To do that, you would actually be down again in 4Q, is that still the right trend in dollars? Jim Fish : I think for Q4, it'll probably look a little bit look like a first half for the year, but the goal is always as it is, when we talked about 2017 planning right now to try and hold flat in dollars and then get the benefit as revenue increases. I think, Q4 will probably a little bit more like the first half of the year than the Q3 itself. Michael Hoffman : In percentages or dollars? Jim Fish : Percentages. Michael Hoffman : Percentages, okay. So, the midpoint of that sort of 10 points -- Jim Fish : Yes, let say this, not in the absolute percentages, but in percent of revenue versus prior year. So, we were -- for first half of the year, we were basically flat on a percent of revenue basis. We were up a little bit in dollars. And a lot of that came from the increase in our stock based compensation, the accruals for our stock based compensation programs, which driven obviously by total shareholder return and then also free cash flow. And those two metrics have done well, so as a result, we've had increased the accruals there. So, I think you may see that again in Q4, which would mean that as a percent of revenue in Q4 versus prior year will probably be about flat, dollars maybe up again. Michael Hoffman : Right, okay. Well, definitely up a bit, so that puts up for the year. Okay, that helps there. So then, to get to your revised guidance on earnings, which suggests that the gross margin in the fourth quarter has to improve. So while you had gross margins weak a little bit sequentially, this is a sequential issue, and you noted a leachate issue, I\u2019m hearing there is some maybe gross margin improvement that\u2019s to come in the fourth quarter in order to be able to hit that 291 or better number? Jim Trevathan : You've also got the volume improvement continuing in the fourth quarter. Michael Hoffman : Yes, I mean, that\u2019s the operating leverage into the gross margin is what I\u2019m assuming, is that volume improvement, is going to help drive gross margin improvement in the third quarter and fourth quarter? Jim Trevathan : It's absolutely correct. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So, it would be realistic to assume gross margins to be better in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter? Jim Trevathan : Yes, absolute. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then with regards to the volume, but let me ask some questions on churn first and then the operating leverage. Given if you were to run all next year at the same rate of churn, I would think that you are reported price that yield number trends up by definition because you\u2019re not replacing as much business as lower rates, so that four point something core price you\u2019re keeping more of it. That\u2019s part of the answer of why you\u2019re able to do two percentages is because you're structurally going to have a whole year of lower churn? Jim Trevathan : Now, that's exactly right. And when youlookatthe effect of new business pricing, lost business pricing, you\u2019re exactly right. If we can have less lost business, that drops straight to the yield number. Michael Hoffman : Got it. Okay. All right. So that\u2019s the support for that pricing. And then, Jim Fish, on working capital. Do we get some help on working capital on the fourth quarter to the free cash? Should that be a pass -- you\u2019ll get -- you collect more your bills? James Fish : We do get a little bit of help from working capital in Q4. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then, David, you started talking about industrial activity, I think Jim Trevathan use it too, and then you didn't quite close a loop on it. I mean, clearly, the industrial economy is slow, that\u2019s not disputable. But you\u2019re not seeing incremental deterioration, it\u2019s slow to a now sustained rate of a lower rate of growth, and you\u2019re not seeing any future duration? David Steiner : No, I'd agree with that. And last time I saw the numbers, they are still above 50. So, we\u2019re still seeing a little bit of industrial growth. Michael Hoffman : Yes, it\u2019s just that of smaller rate of growth and everybody had been, and folks we\u2019re looking for 3% and 4% industrial traction growth. Starting near, we\u2019re really sort in a 1 to 2. So, it\u2019s a long-term low growth rate? David Steiner : No, I'd agree with that. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then on free cash flow, all things have been equal, we would be -- it would be down year-over-year because of the cash tax issue and then grow that numbers. I mean that\u2019s the common of the base line of 1.45 billion to 1.5 billion and grow that number summary. Is it right way to think because the noise of cash taxes? Jim Fish : That\u2019s right, Michal, I mean there is two things really that are potential headwinds for us, and then we overcome those with growth of the business. Those two things as you mentioned, one is cash tax and the other is CapEx. And right now looks like, CapEx for 2017 could be higher. We've had a couple of projects that we originally had in 2016, that\u2019s why our range is come down a little bit. We were originally 1.4 to 1.5. We\u2019re now 1.4 to 1.45. So, we brought the top end at the right side by $50 million that\u2019s just simply because the government projects that we had originally thought would show off in 2016. Look like, they will show up in 2017. So, none of it is, do we feel like we can\u2019t overcome, but those are two things that work again in little bit 2017. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And I was going to sort of tease on that, given the strength of volume, do we see the mix of CapEx or may be move a little bit to help this tax issue to which is pull forwards and trucks and containers, get them in service before the end of the year and capture the bonus depreciation? Jim Fish : So, Jim and I have kind of managed the capital committee, pretty along those lines. And we look at bonus depreciation and we look at, how do, kind of smooth CapEx a little bit. And so, as we think about CapEx, so really may be to answer your question this way, we set along that we thought CapEx should fall in the 9% to 10% of revenue range. In 2014, it was below that, it was in the 8%. 2015, it was just about 9 like 9.1. And 2016.it's going to closer to 10, but we still think in 2017 and on a go forward basis, that range of 9% to 10% is the healthy range, it\u2019s a good range for us. Keep in mind; if you look at things like leach repurchases in 2012, 2013, I think in 2012 we bought around 900 to 950 vehicles. We\u2019re going to buy 1300 vehicles this year. So when we think about OpEx and we talked about it earlier, eventually that has to start affecting our maintenance cost, as we increase the numbers, trucks that we buy by almost 40%. Hopefully that answers your question. Jim Trevathan : Yes, Michael, I just add one other thing, although we have the last few years moved few dollars to capital into the current year. The one thing that Jim and I are certainly focused on and that's making sure, we support the business and the growth. We\u2019re not doing that other than to support growth where can we have value by moving trucks forward or backward or any other capital projects. It's got to align with where the opportunity is and how we want to grow our business. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Jim Trevathan : Produce in order -- we've talked about as look, talking to individual area of managers and Vice President's and say look, here's what your capital request has done over the last three years. And here's what your earnings have done. So, when we think about return on invested capital maybe you're doing well, maybe you're not. But we're having those individual conversations. Michael Hoffman : And then last question on volume. So lots of hand-wringing in the last month about data regarding the consumer and economy, if you look into your database and start looking at very consumer-centric businesses is strong especially retail. My sense is based on the MSW trends and then landfill volume trends in MSW, that consumer is still plodding along there and you haven't seen any pullback in activity. They're participating in the economy and then restaurants maybe complaining about having many cut price and do all that, that's a fundamental issue for them, it's not that consumer starts shopping? Jim Trevathan : I completely agree with that. We've seen to you point in the restaurant sector we've seen waste come down slightly. But we haven't seen service levels change, so we continue to service increases outpace service decreases. And for us, that's really sort of on the commercial side that's the leading indicator that we look at and we still see that very strong. Operator : Your next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli & Company. Tony Bancroft : Real quick, just give us update on the Waste CPI transition and progress there? David Steiner : Yes, as we look at it I think the number that we've always said is about 25% to 35% of our customers are on some type of modified index, whether it's a particularized index for us or a government index like the waste water and sewage. That\u2019s one where like a lot of things we do. You have to have sort of an industry backing, right. I mean, look too many times we see -- I'll go back to the recycling business, too many times we saw a lot of people bid rational contracts like we do and then one party comes in and says we'll do it under the old type of contract and before you know it they're winning business and losing money. And I would tell you, we haven't seen as much sort of industry acceptance of a different CPI based residential or franchise type model. We've not seen widespread enough acceptance to move the needle, I mean when competitors go and say we're going to bid on a modified CPI and then the fourth bidder comes in and says we'll take whatever you have on the table. It's hard to see things change. And so we've had better success in our large franchise areas like California but I think that's going to be a long slow slug that we just have -- we have to as -- there's only thing we can do at Waste Management, and that's stiffing our backbone and say, we're not going to bid these contracts when it's not good for our business. We've proven that on the recycling side. We need to continue to have that different type of firm backbone on the residential and franchise side. Jim Trevathan : And Tony, you\u2019ve seen that our residential volume is stay negative is that we have loss of volume, but we look at it as Dave said, on the long-term basis or return on invested capital. There is just real focus and we just not going to take business long-term, it doesn\u2019t give us the ability to manage our cost structure and also get some margin improvement. Tony Bancroft : And I know you mentioned in the call bottoming up you\u2019re and if you potentially I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate obviously a little rates have been up. And recently, anything you\u2019re seeing as far as in your line of business right now? David Steiner : Yes. The last report I saw which was last week I think showed rig counts across the U.S and the shale plays up 11, which is very small on a percentage basis. And the majority of those were in the Permian Basin where we don\u2019t have a presence. But, we are starting to see a little bit of indication that maybe some of those shale place where we do have a presence or thinking about drilling next year which is a change from the past two years for sure. Tony Bancroft : Right. Jim Trevathan : But, Tony, in real business, we\u2019re still down versus the prior year or getting closer to that reduction but it still not in close to the previous level and without significant movement forward. But we see some signs of it. Operator : At this time, there are no questions. David Steiner : Well, thank you for joining us as we move into the holiday season. We wish all the best as we move towards the end of the year. And hopefully everyone on the phone will have to spend time with the families and live what the holidays are about. So, we\u2019ll see you when we release next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, Jim Fish. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Ed, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. I'm opening on a somber note this quarter as we bid farewell to our Chairman, Bob Reum, who passed away last week after a brief but valiant battle with cancer. Bob brought a strategic sense and a naturally inquisitive approach to leading the Waste Management board and his intellect and guidance will be missed by me and by all who worked with him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Sherry and his three children, Carson, Courtney and Halley. They've lost a wonderful husband and father, and we've lost a good friend. Thank you for joining me in a brief moment of silence for Bob. Thank you. On a much lighter note, my friend David Steiner completed a very successful and transformational career on Waste Management last year. Among many things that David brought to Waste Management including driving tremendous value through disciplined pricing, our recently completed 2017 Waste Management Phoenix Open was his brainchild. In fact, he played in our first Waste Management Pro-Am with a guy who would later become a good friend of his, Phil Mickelson. While he played with Phil before, Phil plays in lots of Pro-Ams and didn't remember David until David uncorked his infamous swing on the first tee, to which Phil said, now I remember you. Thank you, David, for your great contribution and your many years of service to Waste Management and we wish you well with that swing and all of your future endeavors. Now moving on to results : 2016 was a very successful year as we exceeded expectations across the board. Each of our operating income, operating EBITDA and net cash provided by our operating activities were at all-time highs and each showed the greatest year-over-year percentage and absolute improvements in the last decade. In addition, earnings per diluted share, operating income margin and operating EBITDA margin were the best we've seen since the merger in 1998. Our commitment to improving core price, adding profitable volume in a disciplined manner and controlling costs produced $2.91 of EPS, just as we forecasted when we raised our full-year guidance at the end of the third quarter, that was an increase of 11.5% compared to 2015. We've built a strong foundation and have the momentum to continue to generate growth into 2017. During 2016, our strong free cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We've seen solid growth in the cash generation capability of our business over the last few years, and as a result of their confidence and continued strong cash flow, our board has stated its intention to increase the dividends declared in 2017 by 3.7% and has authorized up to $750 million of share repurchases. Over and above our dividend, our preference is to use our free cash flow to acquire accretive businesses at a reasonable purchase price, so the amount and timing of share repurchases is dependent upon the acquisition landscape. For the full-year, revenues increased almost $650 million, or 5%. This is the best revenue growth we've had since 2011. One of the drivers of our success in 2016 was the continued improvement in our pricing programs. For the full-year, our collection and disposal core price was 5% with yield of 2.4%, both exceeded our original expectations for the year with each individual line of business improving over 2015. For the fourth quarter, core price was 5.1% and yield was 2.1%. Looking at volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.6% in 2016, a 210-basis-point improvement from 2015. And our overall volume was a positive 1.4%, an increase of 300 basis points year-over-year. 2016 demonstrated that we can maintain pricing discipline and grow high-margin volumes, while delivering exceptional customer service. Our employees are focused on continuing to progress we've made here. With regard to recycling, we talked to you last year about the transformation we were initiating to ensure that this line of business is both environmentally and economically sustainable for the long term. In 2016, we made significant progress on that front by improving operating costs and renegotiating contractual terms with our customers as the recycling line of business contributed $0.09 of EPS year-over-year. Our recycling employees have worked hard to change the business model to ensure we generate returns our shareholders expect whether commodity prices are high or low. Our contract terms are now designed to recover processing costs and fully charged for contamination. We're fully committed to providing the recycling services our customers' desired at the returns our shareholders expect. I will now turn the call over to Jim and Devina to discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail, and then I will conclude with a discussion of our strategy and our 2017 guidance. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. The fourth quarter of 2016 saw a continuation of a strong operating and financial results we saw throughout the year. Revenues in the quarter were $3.46 billion, an increase of $214 million, or 6.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Once again, our revenue growth was driven by the successful execution of our price, customer service, disciplined growth strategies in our collection and disposal business. Fourth quarter revenue growth in our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume was $118 million. Fourth quarter revenues also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices, which drove a $51-million increase in recycling revenues. Acquisitions, net of divestitures also increased revenues for the quarter by $45 million. Fuel surcharges and foreign currency fluctuations did not significantly impact our revenue for the quarter. Looking at internal revenue growth in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.1% and yield was 2.1%, with total volumes improving 2% and traditional solid waste volumes improving 1.7%. We saw revenue growth from volume contribute equally to price growth for the first time in over five years, but without compromising our pricing strategy or results. We focused on improving service to our customers, and our full-year churn improved 100 basis points to 9.1%. This is the lowest churn rate since 2002 when we were at 8.6%. We also saw service increases, exceeding service decreases for the 12 consecutive quarter, supporting continued commercial volume growth. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $42 million. Operating income margin expanding 10 basis points to 17.8% and operating EBITDA growing $54 million. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits from improving price and now volumes. In the fourth quarter, commercial core price was 7.6% with volumes up 2%, which was a 270-basis-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2015 and an 80-basis-point sequential improvement from the third quarter of 2016. Industrial core price was 9.7% with volume up 1% in the fourth quarter, while industrial collection volumes continue to improve, the rate of growth moderated when comparing the fourth quarter of 2016 with the prior-year period, which is largely due to the tougher comparisons in C&D volumes. In the residential line of business, core price was 2.7%, residential volumes were down 2.6% in the fourth quarter, which is the same rate of decline as the fourth quarter of 2015, and a 30-basis-point sequential improvement from the third quarter of 2016. Our focus is on disciplined pricing of the business to ensure an acceptable return on invested capital. The combined price and volume in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing almost $19 million and operating EBITDA growing $30 million. In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter. Total landfill volumes increased 6.2%, with MSW volumes growing 1.6%, C&D volume grew 17.7%, and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 7.1%. We achieved core price of 2.5%, about the same as the fourth quarter of 2015. As Jim mentioned, we made significant progress improving the recycling line of business, which contributed $0.09 of EPS year-over-year. The majority of the increase in EPS, or $0.065 was driven by improvements in operating cost and renegotiating contract terms. The remaining $0.025 was due to improved commodity prices. For the full year, gross operating expenses per ton improved by 2.4% and average commodity recycling prices at our recycling facilities improved 8.6% and volumes grew 0.8%. And moving now to operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, total operating cost increased $120 million when compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The cost increases were largely related to our increased volumes and cost related to acquired operations, which were reflected in higher labor and subcontractor costs. We also saw increases in leachate cost and a 130 basis point impact from higher commodity-based cost related to recycling rebates and fuel expense. Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 30 basis points from 62.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 62.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement in operating expense margin from revenue growth, efficiency gains and cost control efforts was 160 basis points, but this margin improvement was largely offset by the commodity-based cost in the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2016, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 10.9%, which is an increase of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2015. On the dollar basis, SG&A costs were $378 million in the fourth quarter, or $35 million higher than in the prior year period. The increased SG&A costs on both the margin and dollar basis are almost entirely related to higher costs for our incentive compensation plans, because we outperformed the goals set for the year. SG&A costs during the quarter also included a charge for executive severance costs, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.01 per share. So when we look at fourth quarter income from operations and operating EBITDA margin, the year-over-year comparison would have been 100 basis points better without the increase in these incentive compensation and severance costs. For the full year, we held our SG&A costs flat on a percent of revenue basis at 10.4% as we offset increased incentive compensation costs and higher SG&A costs from large acquisitions by reducing back office spend and finding greater efficiencies in our processes. We will continue to focus on our continuous improvement objectives and managing SG&A costs in the year to come and expect to hold SG&A costs flat in 2017 and for SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue to improve by about 40 basis points. Turning to cash flow. In the fourth quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $753 million compared to $526 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This growth in operating cash flow was driven in part by an increase in operating EBITDA of $54 million, and this reflects the strength of our core operating performance in the year. For the full year, cash provided by operating activities increased $462 million to almost $3 billion. Again, operating EBITDA was the primary driver of the increase year-over-year, contributing $277 million of increased cash flow. During the fourth quarter, we spent $377 million on capital expenditures, and for the full year, we spent $1.34 billion, which is an increase of $106 million from 2015. When we gave our guidance for capital spending at the end of the third quarter, we expected to spend about $1.4 billion in 2016. Due to permit and construction delays that were beyond our control with three of our capital projects, we pushed $50 million of this spend from 2016 into 2017. This $50 million deferral is included in our 2017 projected capital expenditures, which Jim will discuss. So combined in the fourth quarter, we generated $387 million of free cash flow and this is a $199 million increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, our free cash flow increased by $254 million, or 18% to $1.66 billion. This is the highest amount of free cash flow that the company has ever generated, if you exclude the proceeds from the divestiture of Wheelabrator in 2014. As I mentioned, in 2016, our free cash flow growth was driven by the 8.1% increase in operating EBITDA. While this bodes well for continued cash flow growth from core operations in the year to come, in 2017, we have some headwinds to overcome, but they're incorporated in our guidance that Jim is going to discuss. In 2016, we had a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross currency hedge that will not repeat. We also expect cash taxes to increase, capital expenditures to be higher and our cash payout for incentive compensation to be up in 2017. That said, our focus in 2017 will not change. We will grow revenue and manage our costs, maintain capital spending discipline and drive efficiency and working capital to generate high and sustainable levels of free cash flow. In 2016, we continued our commitment to returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, returning a total of $1.45 billion during the year. In the fourth quarter, we paid $180 million in dividends to our shareholders, and we repurchased $225 million of our shares. For the full year, we paid $726 million in dividends and repurchased $725 million of our shares. During 2016, we allocated cash to capital investments for the organic growth of our business, acquired core solid waste businesses to enhance growth and return value to shareholders, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was 2.53. Our weighted-average cost of debt for the quarter was 4.17%, and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 14% at the end of the quarter. For 2017, we currently expect that interest expense and cash interest paid will be relatively flat with the full year of 2016. The effective tax rate was approximately 34.4% in the quarter. And on an as adjusted basis, the full-year tax rate was also 34.4%, which is in line with our expectations. We have built our 2017 projections using current tax law, and we currently expect our 2017 tax rate to be about 36.5%. The increase in our projected tax rate for 2017 is due to expectations for higher operating and pre-tax income, which reduces the benefit from our tax credit. I will now turn the call back over to Jim to discuss our strategic outlook and 2017 guidance. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Devina. When we reflect on 2016, we're very pleased with our results. We successfully executed on our strategy of improving price, disciplined volume growth and controlling costs. Looking forward to 2017, we expect core price to be 4%, or greater and yield should be approximately 2%. We expect to achieve the same dollar amount of pricing in 2017 as we did in 2016, however, with the growth in our revenue and core pricing yield as a percent of revenue will moderate. We expect total company volumes to grow in the range of between 1.2% and 1.6% for the full year in 2017. We anticipate that we will lose some unprofitable recycling contracts in 2017 and that our 2016 landfill volume growth of more than 7.5% will moderate on tougher comparison with this year. In our recycling business, 2017 has seen a strong start to the year with current prices of our average commodity price per ton up $40 from the lows we experienced in January 2016. January of 2017's uptick over January of 2016 was driven primarily by strong cardboard pricing impacting our brokerage business. However, we're not forecasting that these elevated levels will be sustainable throughout 2017 and the comparisons in the back half of the year will become more difficult. But we still anticipate additional operating cost improvements. Add to that the strong commodity prices in Q1 and we expect a positive $0.03 impact on our EPS year-over-year when compared to 2016, with most of the contribution occurring in the first quarter of 2017. The real theme for our 2017 financial guidance is the continued strong operating EBITDA growth, which will be the foundation of our free cash flow. We expect that the solid execution of our strategic priorities will produce 2017 operating EBITDA growth of between 6.5% and 8%. This will lead to between $3.95 billion and $4 billion of operating EBITDA, and that will, in turn, drive free cash flow of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. The expected increase in capital spending is to fund truck and container purchases volume growth, the Los Angeles and New York City contract wins, and the $50 million carryover impact that Devina mentioned. Bottom line, we expect 2017 adjusted EPS of between $3.14 and $3.18 per share. Looking at the strategic drivers of 2017 and beyond, we will stay keenly focused on those tried and true earnings drivers including core price execution, disciplined volume growth, and controlling costs. In addition, we will stay focused on safely providing superior customer service, attracting and retaining the best team in the industry and differentiation through technology. From improving the ease of self-service for our customers through enhanced mobile applications to improving our pricing and routing tools, to working with our OEMs on advanced vehicle and container technologies, we will use technology to supplement our strategy and both drive growth in our business and further reduce costs. With strong execution on these strategic drivers combined with a continued focus on acquiring accretive businesses, we're confident that 2017 will be another great year for Waste Management. In summary, we had great success in 2016, driving earnings and cash flow growth to record levels that exceeded our own expectations. As we've demonstrated over the last few years, strong pricing, the execution of our service delivery optimization programs and growing the right kind of volume drive margin expansion. We expect that to continue into 2017. We did this as a team working together to execute upon our top strategic priorities. I'm honored to be able to take this opportunity to thank each member of the Waste Management team for this success. So, thank you. In 2016, you delivered exceptional service to our customers, and you look for opportunities to drive improvement in everything you do. And with that, Jennifer, let's open the line for questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning, Michael. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll keep it at two. Just first on the pricing. So, you're guiding 4% for the full year. Q4 was very strong. So, just how much of this is just the tougher comps? Is price increases just getting more challenging now than they were in 2016? And how should we think about pricing kind of playing off through the year? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: No. I think, Michael, it's the fact that we have I think several years said that that we'll be at a 2% yield and a 4% core price and we're kind of sticking to that. We think that's a pretty safe range for this. When you look at whether we saw any kind of sequential weakness we didn't \u2013 the four lines of business that ultimately showed price increases for us are commercial, industrial, resi and MSW. And when I looked at those sequentially commercial was up quarter-over-quarter 10 basis points, 50 basis points in industrial, we were down 40 basis points in resi, and then, we were up 20 basis points in MSW. So, collection and disposal sequentially was flat at 2.1%. So, I think what you're seeing in 2017 is just kind of a standard 2% and 4%, which is where we've guided I think over the last four years. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That helps. And I guess if we could just talk about inflation and CPI. Can you quantify the headwind that we saw in 2016? And what we should be expecting in 2017? If we see inflation starts to pick up over the next few months, is this more of a 2018 story? I hope you guys could kind of parse that out for us. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Michael. Jim Trevathan here. CPI or index-driven pricing affects about 40% of our total business. So, to quantify that about a 50 basis point increase in CPI would impact our top-line by $28 million. But I also want to stress as Jim just did that we don't plan for CPI increases in our business plan. So, you're right, an increase has some upside to it, but we don't plan for a decrease either. Our core pricing strategy allows each area, and we ask them to overcome any CPI increase or decrease with more core pricing, we do that on, obviously, those open-market customers. So, we've overcome the low CPI rates in past years and you've not seen any impact to that core price. So, an increase \u2013 although it will occur, and I think you're right, it does have a roll-forward impact. It would be later in the years. You see it because our price increases don't come every month. They come especially on those CPI or index-driven price customers. They come periodically, July 1 or October 1 based on the contract term. So, that will be more of a late 2017, 2018 if we see that CPI increase. But I stress again, we generally have not let that affect us positively or negatively. We're going to go get core price. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: There is a bit of a lag there too, Jim. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: There is a lag. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: With CPI, these contracts are tied to it, as Jim mentioned. But they have a look-back period, it tends to be 12 months. And then, of course, as Jim mentioned too, we've got these periodic increases that are kind of July 1 or January 1. So, that lag is probably at least 12 months and sometimes as long as 18 months. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's really helpful. And just, if I could squeeze in my last one, Jim. What do you think is an appropriate incremental margin we should be thinking about at this point of cycle for Waste Management? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I mean, I think when you think about the fact that our landfill volume has been strong, our commercial volume has been the strongest we've had in at least four years. If you think about 50% flow-through to the EBITDA line, I think that's probably appropriate. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to dig into the recycling, you guys said that would help you guys about $0.03 in 2017 and looks like some of that is coming more so in Q1. Can you talk about \u2013 I would think that would be a little bit more of a benefit given where commodity prices are going. So, what are your assumptions around pricing for commodities and just generally for recycling? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. So, when we think about commodity prices and particularly when we think about recycling line of business, 2017 is the first year in four years that we're actually budgeting some improvements. We're budgeting $0.03 per share for the year, $0.02 of that comes from price, $0.01 of it comes from continued cost improvements that we've baked into the plan. Now, most of that is in Q1, a little bit in Q2, but most of that is in Q1, and we do expect prices to come back down in the back half of the year. So, I think what this really amplifies is the point that we made last year, which is that commodity prices are difficult to predict and obviously, out of control. So, we need to de-risk the model, and we've done that over the last four quarters to six quarters. So that if prices do retreats, we've really protected the downside. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: We only have a couple of contracts that remain into 2017 that are significant contracts that will fall off and that will give some value there from them, but we have altered all of our agreements, the significant large ones, to make sure that our customers are providing the return or processing their material and then that commodity price impact is minimized. We're not taking that same risk. So, there's only a couple of those lifts. Our operating guys have done a really good work at putting in continuous improvement programs that let us see historically and also look at volumes coming in and just right-size our operations. So, we make sure we get that operating improvement that Jim mentioned. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. All right. That's helpful. For volumes, I thought about 2% was pretty much better than I expected. Just looking at the breakdown, was there anything that surprised you within the breakout? MSW, C&D, and special, any one-time projects that are going away? Are there really just tough comps that you're basing your guidance for 2017 on? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I think you're right. When we look at landfill volumes for the year at MSW at 7.5%, that's pretty strong in a 2% economy, if you believe that the economy drives that. When you look at our C&D volume, I mean, C&D volume was \u2013 for the year was 18% \u2013 18.7% I think. So, hard to repeat that. We're not seeing any weakness there, but hard to repeat that. Now, I would say on the positive there, if you believe that those are going to be difficult comparisons. On the positive side, I would say our special waste, which is driven by kind of the industrial economy was really only at about 3.9%, 4%. So, you may argue that we've got some upside there. Still not weak by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think that special waste that could provide some upside, particularly if something comes out of Washington that benefits the industrial economy. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: From a comparison perspective, the one thing I would add is that in the first quarter of 2016, we did see some MSW volume benefits from some of the waste-to-energy facilities, meeting their maximum capacity. And that will prove to be a bit of a tough comparison, but that's not something that would impact the full year. It just really impacted the first quarter. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And your commercial is very strong. What are your thoughts on that into 2017, because obviously that's an important piece to the puzzle? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. For the year, it was 0.8% volume on commercial. But sequentially, it was getting stronger. So, I think I mentioned in my script that it was really strong towards the end of the year at 2%. And as I look back, that's the strongest number I see on the page here all the way back to 2012. So, we like the direction of commercial. And I think Jim talked about the fact that our churn has been a success story for us too, and that, of course, affects commercial volume as well. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. And similar to that special waste piece you would think that the infrastructure or potential \u2013 something out of Washington could help that commercial side to as \u2013 may be some confidence to that. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: It's more on the industrial line of business, honestly. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: But it certainly wouldn't hurt commercial, but I think the industrial economy for us with respect to collection tends to show up more in the industrial line of business. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Andrew, if you look back in our net commercial volume and you go back 6 or 8, 9, 10 quarters, in fact every quarter, we've had good improvement, leading to that 2%, and that's obviously what the economy hasn't driven much of that. Most of it has come from some of the actions that we've taken around service to our customers, process to handle customers that have issues and how we work through those. Our people in the field have done just a superb job in that regard to get that defection rate down pretty close to the lowest ever. And then, our customer acquisition methods are getting \u2013 we're just getting better at looking for the right kind of volume that Jim stressed to make sure that we still get the contribution from that and don't disrupt the marketplace. And that'd be the last thing we want to do. And we're focused really hard on that, picking the right locations that have a little more economy support, and make sure our resources, sales resources and operating resources align with that, so we can take advantage of that growth. And we're using some of our technology tools Jim mentioned to help us in that regard. And I think you'll see that continue. It's been fairly dramatic on one of our more profitable lines of business and we expect that to continue. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Hi. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about your M&A outlook, specifically any comments on what your plans are, what you're seeing in terms of seller expectations, and any commentary you can offer on pipeline. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure, Ken. Look, we'd like to do more of the RCIs, the Deffenbaughs, DSWs that we've done over the last couple of years, at reasonable prices. And that's I think the key. Obviously, return on invested capital is very important to us, so you're not going to see us pay 12 or 13 times EBITDA on a pre-synergy basis for companies. We continue to kind of comb the landscape and see if we can find those midsize acquisitions at what we think is a fair purchase price. If we don't find those, then 2017 is really going to be a year of tuck-in acquisitions in the $100 million to $200 million range. Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Thanks. That's helpful. And any update on your EBITDA acquisition outlook for 2017? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: We really only have tuck-ins built in to EBITDA. So, it's largely organic growth on the EBITDA line of business or on the EBITDA line in 2017. A little bit of carry-over from acquisitions in 2016 as well. Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great. That's all I had. Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning. It's Derrick Laton on for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to see if we could get a quick update on how we should think about residential volumes. You mentioned those are down about 2.6% year-over-year, but looks like sequentially a small improvement. Was this mainly attributed to the progress you're making on moving to an inflation index that more kind of closely mirrors the waste industry? Maybe we can get an update on your progress there. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Derrick. There's no doubt. That has been a positive impact to us as we change some of those contracts over to that wastewater and sewer increase instead of just CPI. That's a slow process with cities and counties and government entities because cost is so important to them. I think the other thing I'd mention is that that line of business is an extremely competitive line of business, especially with those midsized and smaller communities. They are always looking for savings. Now, what we've tried to do is look more at just return on invested capital. That line of business has such a strong impact on capital requirements as you retain a contract and that entity wants new trucks or with new business. So, return on invested capital's our primary focus there because it has such an effect on our return and that you all care about and we do as well. So, we don't look at it as a growth opportunity like we might other lines of business. We look contract by contract. And yeah, we choose to and we will improve that business. We're doing things using technology and trying to differentiate ourselves, especially on those larger franchise and larger contracts providing some self-service opportunities for customers, some things that local communities look for that we can add to websites both with regard to trash services, but other information that might again set us apart from some of our other competitors. Looking at increased automation, how can we help with those helpers on the back of the truck and get more focused on the drivers. Some of the shortages that we see with automation, we tend to retain drivers longer when they have that kind of truck, and we get better return for our shareholders as well. So all of those things I think will help that line of business, but I don't believe you'll see the dramatic change like you may have in whether it's MSW or special waste or commercial, industrial lines of business. We'll plod along and make good excellent returns for shareholders, but we'll do it spending money wisely. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's really helpful. And then maybe just one more. So, you've mentioned that in 3Q leachate and waste water developments were kind of a headwind for the quarter. Are these issues squarely behind you now? Thanks. I'll turn it over. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, yes. So, you're right. Leachate was a headwind, and we talked about it a bit last year. We've lost some low cost disposal options for our sales with some of these POTWs, specifically the one we mentioned last year was in the State of Virginia, but it's not limited to Virginia. So, we've built a couple of our own plants. We built one outside of Philadelphia a couple years ago. We are in the process of bringing one up and online in Virginia. That will come online at the end of Q2 or maybe the beginning of Q3. So, that Virginia plant coming online in the back half of the year will have a run rate expense reduction of about $0.03 per share, $0.02 to $0.03 per share for the year. We've built in about $0.015 of expense reduction in leachate costs. And then of course, we also have the charge that we put into place last year that's helping us compensate for some of that increase in cost. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. That's helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, I can appreciate you guys are taking a conservative approach to commodity prices. Now that you've restructured a lot of these contracts, can you maybe just give us an update and quantify what a $10 change or a 10% change in the commodity basket might mean? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: So, $10 change, it's about $0.04 on an annual basis. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: $0.04, okay. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: $0.04 annual? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Joe, as we've changed those contracts as exactly as you said, we're not taking as much of that risk on the downside. Therefore, we don't get as much on the upside. There's value to us when we do that, but it's not as dramatic as it was when we took all that upon ourselves. We're trying to make sure that the capital that we've spent at building these facilities provides a return for shareholders that's a reasonable return given the build, the spend. And then we'll share in that commodity value instead of take all that risk, and that's what you see happening. So, generally. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I understand. I'm sorry. I was just going to say \u2013 go ahead. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I was just going to say, look, Devina mentioned it's tough for us to predict what's going to happen with commodity prices. Every time we've tried, we've failed. So, we tried to predict first quarter, and we think that looks like it's going to play out the way we expected based on where we finished the year. But predicting, I'll pass that. I mean, you could look at the transition historically from Q3 to Q4 and historically there's been a big dip in commodity prices from Q3 to Q4. We didn't see that dip this year, and we actually thought it would happen and it just didn't. So, are we going to say that that's a new normal for us? I don't know. I think the problem is, as soon as we say that's the new normal, then we'll get back to normal and we'll see the big dip in Q4 next year. So, we expected it, that you might ask while we're being conservative with recycle pricing. That's why I did mention early on that it's the first year in four that we put anything into our budget in terms of improvement, in terms of recycling line of business from commodity prices. And we did put $0.02 in there, we put $0.03 in total, two of it is price-related. But, it's just \u2013 in our minds it's hard to predict what happens with commodity prices. 30% of our volume goes to China, really hard to tell what's going to happen overseas. So, while you may say it's conservative and we might even agree with that, I think we've got to make sure that we don't get ourselves in a bind the way we have in years past. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. And I get it's \u2013 you just don't have visibility on it. I think it's a prudent way to do it. I just wanted to check in the $10 change given you guys, have restructured contracts. Maybe switching gears. I think you guys snuck-in just a quick comment on an investment for New York City contract. Can you just give us a little bit of color around what that is and how much that investment might be? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah .Sure, Joe. I should probably take the opportunity first to just recognize our team. That was some excellent long-term contract for us and gives us a real basis for supplying service to the New York City area for a long time, for 20 years in fact. So, a really good contract for us with a lot of work by that local team, we'll start accepting MTS, MSW in July of 2017. That waste will go to our Western New York High Acres landfill in early 2018 at the peak of volume, that's about 750,000 tons a year. We'll split that volume between our Western New York landfill and then one of our Virginia landfills. We'll spend money. We've already started a little bit. That's why you saw some of the capital spin that Devina mentioned going up in 2017, and it's in the $50 million range. It includes quite a bit of containers, primary amount of spin. Those MTS is, by the way, when they're fully operational the New York City \u2013 they're implementing, they're executing and building out those transfer stations. We'll end up handling 1.8 million tons for the city at the end of this in total given two MTS contracts, the long-term Bronx contract we have, the Brooklyn contract that we have, and the Queens contract we have. It's sizeable. Over a 20-year period, it's little over $3 billion in revenue. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Congrats on the win. So, can you maybe just talk about the return profile and the risk profile of the contract? Does it end up being accretive to overall Waste Management? And then, hopefully, I can circle up offline and get some more details on it. Thanks. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes, Joe. It absolutely is accretive to both 2016 or planned in 2017. It's a very good contract for us. It's primary \u2013 it's transportation and disposal at our site. It does not include collection. It's just the receipt of the material, the railing of the material, handling, and then disposal at the other end. So, that line of business is good for us, and this contract is very good for us. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Because of the line of business, Joe, it ends up \u2013 that contract ends up being an accretive to margin contract because disposal is such a high margin for us. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Right. And from a risk standpoint, Joe, we've \u2013 just like all the other New York City contracts we have, we've got all the right components in there to make sure that we're covered if the city decides to go with different direction, and we don't expect that. But if they do, we're covered from a capital standpoint and from a cost standpoint. So, we don't see the risk that you might expect with that long-term contract. It has all the right escalators in that cover cost change. So, we're very pleased with the work our local team has done to win that project. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Just a question on longer-term capital allocation, it looks like you guys are not very levered. The dividend increase is lower than free cash flow growth and profile. When you think about M&A, you mentioned accretive acquisitions, are there anti-trust issues for you to grow in solid waste? And how do you think about prioritizing sort of industrial waste, energy waste, medical waste? Any sense of long-term capital allocation around M&A would be very helpful. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: That was kind of four questions in one there. Let me tackle the capital allocation first. So, first of all, yeah, with respect to how we think about capital allocation for 2017, primarily for 2017, we look at that dividend coming out first, and we increased the dividend by 3.7%. You're right, it did not increase at the same level as free cash flow. You recall last year in January, we took kind of a 6.5% increase because we felt like our free cash flow had reached a new baseline. So, we said it had gone from kind of the 1.2%, 1.3% up to 1.4% last January, so we increased it by a higher-than-normal amount. And you could argue that we're now at somewhat of a higher base too at 1.5%. I think we like to have more than just a year's worth of data before we determine that we truly are at a higher base. So, 2017 will provide that data for us, we think, and then we'll readdress the dividend as we go into the latter part of this year or next year. So, once you take the dividend out, once you say, okay, then potentially your next use of capital would be acquisitions. And I talked about the fact that we'd love to get a mid-sized acquisition similar to an RCI or Deffenbaugh, but we've got to get it at the right price. We're looking for those. And to the extent that we can find them, then we would do that. And I think Devina has done a very good job getting the balance sheet in shape to be able to accept one of those should one come along. If it doesn't come along, then we'll do our standard $100 million to $200 million in tuck-ins, plus we'll do about $500 million as what we've built in in terms of share repurchase to our budget for 2017. And then you did ask also, Hamzah, about the types of acquisitions that we would look at. So, we consider that industrial space to be a good space for us. It's a core space for us. We would look at acquisitions within that space, whether they'd be energy services or hazardous waste. All of that, in our minds, is core for us, particularly as you think about what might come out of this new administration with respect to the industrial economy. It could be a good space for us. And so, we would look at those along the same line as we would look at solid waste. And then I guess your last question had to do with anti-trust. It's always something we have to look at. As the biggest company in the industry, we always have to look at the anti-trust side of this. It is a consideration when we buy businesses, but we don't foresee with anything that we're looking at any real difficulties. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank. Since I asked four; I'll leave it there. Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Hamzah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hey. Good morning, everybody. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Hi, Barbara. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): So I'm interested in some of your high-level thoughts about some of the policy talk coming out of Washington. Obviously, you mentioned that an uptick in the industrial economy would benefit you as would, of course, a lower corporate tax rate. But what do you make of some of the talk concerning regulation? I know particularly the EPN environment regulation, obviously, the new administration has been talking about the potential for simplifying or relaxing certain regulations? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: That's a great question, Barbara. We've talked a lot about that internally. Environmental regulation, in a funny way, is a differentiator for us because we consider ourselves to be preeminent in terms of our protection of the environment within the waste disposal space. So, it is a question that we've had. Do we benefit or not? There's a second side to that coin. It's a bit hard to tell because we just don't know what's going to come out. We don't know what environmental regulation or reregulation or deregulation would come out of Washington. So, we really can't give you a very good answer to that. I would tell you that off-the-top that it would be \u2013 there's a potential opportunity we think out there to improve the Superfund program. So, that would be, I think, good for us. But over and above that, it's a bit hard to say because we just don't know where it would be coming from. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Sure. Yeah. No, interesting things. And then just one more. With the prices for recyclable commodities improving, are you starting to see local competition pick up again? And also, have you seen smaller competitors follow your lead and change their contracts, too, to include processing costs, contamination, reimbursement or what have you? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Barbara, we have not seen dramatic change in competition there. It's a very competitive line of business. But we've not seen anything different recently. I mean, it's been such short time since they move forward. And I don't think that'll happen in the short term. It takes a lot high cardboard prices to make that happen and sustained. I think people have been burned enough that they're not going to spend capital with new facilities until we see the right direction. And, yes, I think in general, I mean, we don't change things because of what others do. But at the same time, from just hearsay, we think it's so prudent to do what we all have been doing around de-risking that business, and we don't see any signs of that changing. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. We've talked early in the call about a couple of \u2013 maybe some special items on the capital spending side, on the CapEx side. You called out a $50 million swing from 2016 to 2017, the New York City spend, you mentioned the leachate spend. I guess, can we talk a little bit about how to think about a more normalized kind of CapEx level and the potential for CapEx spending moderation looking beyond 2017 because it does seem like there are a number of higher items impacting the year? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely, Noah. What we've said for quite some time since I was in the CFO job, we've said that \u2013 we thought CapEx would be in a range of percent of revenue of about 9% to 10%. So, when you look at 2017 and the CapEx guidance that we gave of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, that's in that range for us. We do have, as we talked about, some CapEx that moved unexpectedly from 2016 into 2017. And then the rest of the increase is driven by the growth of the business and the two contracts that Jim Trevathan mentioned. Even with the $50 million that's moved from 2016 to 2017, we still think we're within that CapEx range. And I don't think you'll see us to really move much outside of that 9% to 10%. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe one quick follow-up, specifically on the tax reform discussion going on. Just wondering how that's impacting M&A discussions. Certainly, the potential for more cash to you and they also impact the economics of transactions for buyers and sellers. So, to what extent is that having an impact on discussion maybe on timing at all of transactions and how are you thinking about that as kind of impacting the M&A activity over the course of the year? Thank you so much. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Probably, Devina will have a better answer to this than I will. But with respect to how it's impacting our view of acquisitions, we haven't \u2013 I would tell you we haven't looked at that as an impediment at all. It's hard to say because \u2013 again, it's kind of like the environmental question. We don't really know what comes out of the administration. There's been a lot of conversation about interest deductibility going away. So, how would that impact the way we think about funding these acquisitions? There's also been some conversations about the grandfathering of debt that is \u2013 that you have on your balance sheets prior to kind of an April 1 or April 30. So, we hear a lot of this. It's probably just chatter amongst people who don't know. So, in that respect, I would tell you that it hasn't really influenced our decision. Our decision is going to be based much more on the purchase price than it is on the funding mechanism. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And then to the extent that it's impacting the way that sellers think about the landscape for moving forward with transactions at this point, we definitely think \u2013 as we've talked internally, we do think that our sellers are going to be influenced by the evolution of tax policy. And it certainly is going to be a factor in the way that they think about the optimal time to move away from their businesses. So, it's too early for us to say whether or not it can impact our ability to execute on that targeted $100 million to $200 million of tuck-in acquisitions or any other potential acquisitions that we may look at in the future. But we do think that with tax reform, you're going to see some sellers more motivated to move forward potentially, given that they'll likely have lower taxes to pay as a result of a transaction. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I told you, Noah. She'd give a better answer. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Well, I appreciate the additional color. Thank you very much, and congrats on the quarter. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.: Hi, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Jim. I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but if I recall, last Q1 was really strong on an extra day and I think mild weather. How should we be thinking about volumes here in Q1 versus the full-year guide of 1.2% and 1.6%? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, you're absolutely right about that. Last year, was a very mild winter. So, we were a bit worried when we talked about Q1 last April that we would have told \u2013 the big question was how much volumes that we pull into Q1, particularly into the month of March because March was very strong. I mean, January and February were fine, but March was particularly strong last year. I would tell you that aside from the bad rains that we've seen on the West Coast, primarily in Northern California, that the weather has been kind of normal this year, not as mild as last year, but the weather has not had a dramatic impact on us so far. Now, we're only halfway through Q1, but I think so far, we're pleased with what we're seeing. It hasn't been a 2014 or whatever it was where we had the polar vortex or 2015 where New England had 50 feet of snow. It's been more of a normal winter, and hence our volumes have been kind of what we expected. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay. That's a good color. And then you guys noted New York and I think LA as well as contract wins. I'm just curious how much of the volume growth this year is attributable to those? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes, you're right, Tyler. I didn't mention the LA contract, but it's a new agreement that we've been awarded. We've been awarded two of those zones that the City of LA has extended. We've got the exclusive commercial and multi-family franchise for the West Valley and Southeast Valley zones. The real good thing there is that they are contiguous with our current infrastructure, and it really fits our business. And we're very pleased with that. It's also a large contract, life of value of that contract. It's a 10-year deal. It's $1.3 billion at accretive margins to the company. But in our plan, I mean the LA is scheduled to start July 1, to the point of your question, July 1. We have until the end of the year, so until January of 2018, to make the transition. And the real issue there as opposed to New York City is that we currently have 8,500 customers in that open market of LA that's going to these franchises, we'll end up with 16,000 customers by roughly January of 2018. So, they'll piece their way into our structure during the course of the second half of 2017. Yeah, so. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Some hundred did go to other \u2013 it's not just an incremental 8,000. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: That's right. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: There's some swapping going on here, so. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: A lot of operating involved. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: So, there's a lot of logistics involved. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: A lot of operating cost changes that'll occur in the second half of the year. So, I don't think you'll see dramatic value. And we haven't put that in our plan dramatically at to be at July 1 run rate. We've parsed that in throughout the months in the second half of this year. The same for New York City. Although it starts July 1, there's some work to be done at the MTSs and to get the rail capability right for High Acres and Atlantic. So, that'll piece its way in. They'll help our volumes, but there I think our volume forecast and guidance is about what we expect. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. No, that's helpful. And Devina, I know the K will print soon, but what were cash taxes paid in 2016? And is the expectation that cash taxes paid in 2017 will be roughly the same in terms of dollars? And is this kind of the right \u2013 I don't know if this is the right technical term \u2013 but kind of a cash tax as a percentage of pre-tax if that make sense? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Right. So cash taxes paid in 2016 were $470 million. We expect those to increase by about $125 million in 2017, and of course that will vary depending upon our pre-tax income and how the year actually comes in. So, I wouldn't say that 2016 is a normal year because we had a $100 million realization from the debt restructuring that we carried forward into 2016. So, look for 2017, again, it's too early to say what tax reform will do, but look for 2017 to be a more normal year at that $600 million level. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, Jim, Jim, Devina. Thanks for taking my questions. I mean, believe it or not, there's still some left. I have a question with regards to volumes. Given your urban model, your higher concentration of urban, there was a slower recovery in some of that commercial container volume, but it's clearly had showed up in 2016. And that's better quality business than C&D and special waste. So, as that shift is occurring, how do we think about the operating leverage to the business model of that, and where do you think you are in innings, if you will, if we would frame it that way? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: So, Jim and I can take a shot at that. But I think you're right about that, and I think as you talk about the urban model, it really ultimately starts to show up in the commercial line of business I think. And that's why I think you've seen \u2013 that's a part of why I believe you've seen our commercial volume on a nice increasing trend over the past probably 12 quarters. But there are more pieces to that. There's the fact that we're doing a better job with customer service and so we're hanging on to a bigger percentage of our business. The churn has gone, as Jim mentioned, from a high of 11.5% or close to 12%, down to approaching 9%, and we think we've got the opportunity to get to 9% on a full-year basis or even below. But you're right, Michael. I think that this urbanization of the United States and Canada as well is resulting in these commercial volumes for an urban company like Waste Management. We're largely in kind of urban areas, is resulting in some of that volume growth. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And so following through, the operating leverage, you should see this ongoing operating leverage as a result of this improving pattern that hasn't peaked yet. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well that's right because, as you know, the commercial line of business has higher operating leverage than the other lines of business, particularly residential. So yeah, I think while we take some credit for this, when we look at OpEx as a percent of revenue, some of it is the efforts of our SDO and our MSDO, so a lot of it is what we are actually proactively doing. Some of it is just what you say, which is the as volume moves into the commercialized business, our operating, our flow-through really improves. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Hey, Michael. Three points to \u2013 that total agreement with Jim and your theory of, for example, our addition rate and that's largely driven by the commercial line of business, although it includes the industrial line as well, the permanent business on the industrial roll-off line. But we have flipped that addition rate and defection rate, so that we're net positive in number of new customers, starting roughly midyear to early third quarter last year. And that, we see that continuing of the add rate has gone up fairly dramatically, just as the defection rate has gone down. So those lines have crossed. And that's a really good sign for us, both in the selling process, but in the overall economy, as you mentioned. The other thing I mentioned earlier, is that service increases have outpaced decreases 12 consecutive quarters, and that's a real positive for us. And it bodes well given some of the economy improvements that we're seeing. And then lastly, the container weight issue has not changed dramatically for us up or down. I mean, it stayed about where it is. And that's, we think, a good sign. The economy is moving forward, and we think we will gain both revenue, but more importantly margin out of that growth. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And that last point, is it flattish with a positive bias or flattish, just flattish? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, just flattish, it depends on quarter-by-quarter, it's changed some. But not so much with service increases. That's been very consistently positive. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then if we could shift gears to the sales outlook for 2017. If I take your comments about price volume, recycling, guess at what the deal rollover is, and I'm assuming you're somewhere around $50 million or $60 million a deal rollover, that puts you kind of in a $1.42 billion or I mean, $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion. But then if I hear your comment about capital spending as a percent of revenues, I take the midpoint, I'm at $14.5 billion. So I'm trying to understand, what's the right sales number for 2017? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: We're thinking about revenues being just north of $14 billion in 2017. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, kind of $14.1 billion to $14.2 billion? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: I would say on the low end of that, Michael. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That seems very conservative. I mean, if you just take the price and volume assumptions you've given on the 13.6%, that puts you at 14.07%. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, I would say the way that we're looking at it is the build of volumes of 1.2% to 1.6% price of right \u2013 or yields of right around 2%. And then we're not building in anything specific under recycling line of business from commodity price. We're not building in anything from foreign currency, either, and we also leave fuel flat. So, ultimately, that's what builds from this year's 13.6% to 14.05% to 100%, basically I would say. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And I think the lack of acquisition at the same level as what we've done with those three regionals that Jim mentioned, we have in there I think a little over $100 million, $150 million in tuck-in acquisitions. But we don't have acquisitions at the same level as the last three years in the plan. We'd love for them to happen, but we're not forecasting that today. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: That's a great point, Jim. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You mentioned, Michael \u2013 I think you mentioned $50 million carryover on the top line, I think you were saying. And really because we did the acquisitions at the very beginning of 2016, we think there will be some carryover on the bottom line from some of the cost synergies, but the top-line really won't see \u2013 other than what Jim mentioned, won't see much in the form of inorganic growth. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's fair enough. That helps. Actually pulls that closer. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And the other piece of that, Michael, that might be helpful is that we've got to think about yield as being off of an $11 billion base of revenue rather than the $13 billion. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Okay. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's a big part of it then. Okay. That's fair enough. And then, yeah, I just want to touch one quick question on the regulation. I mean, this industry has got very mature regulation. There's very little changing around the margin. Even if Scott Pruitt comes in and got the heck out of EPA, the regulation you've lived with are really very mature. So, there's a probably bigger probably that whatever happens, regulatory was going to impact your customer more than it's going to impact you directly. Isn't it \u2013 is that fair? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: I completely agree with you. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Whether it's MSW regulations that affect our landfills or whether it's regulatory impacts to our landfill structure or recycling or hazardous waste business. Those states are allowed to exceed the federal guidelines and some do, and I don't see that impacted. I just don't see states getting in and changing those kinds of regulations that would impact our business. Could something come out of the blue? I guess it could. But I have seen nothing, no discussion or no intonation that it's even close to affecting our business the way the question was worded. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I think one exception to that would be the Superfund. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: That's right. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Which is really regulated. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right, which is the other side of that, which is if Pruitt rolls back the levering enforcement budget the way it was and using enforcement, so less enforcement to a lot of industrial players look at the project world and say this is the most favorable environment I'm ever going to have to clean things up, so let's get them done in the next four years. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: But they still have to clean them up. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. And might as well do it with a friendly regulator than one that's been thumping near the head with the club. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: That's the upside, right? Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Right. Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: That we think that could come out of this, but as we've said to the earlier question, it's a little hard to tell because we just don't have real goods visibility yet. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Four weeks in. Last question, what \u2013 are you getting a blended average tip fee positive impact from being awarded the two Brooklyn Marine Transfer Stations when you think about where that volume is going? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: One more time, Michael. I'm sorry. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, when you think about the implied tip fee that's in the total price that they're paying per ton, because there's \u2013 certain amount of it is for logistics, but the rest of it for \u2013 you can walk back to that logistics part out and get to what's the tip fee look like, are you getting a tip fee improvement as a result of the New York City contract at high acres or I'm assuming this is going down to, is it King George? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, down to the Atlantic landfill. Well, first of all, Michael, we don't publicize that number, we don't \u2013 the individual disposal component. It is an all-in price for transportation and disposal and includes a lot of handling up the material and moving the material. But it is not going to be a detrimental impact to the company on a margin basis. It is accretive in margin both EBIT, EBITDA. So, we are \u2013 that's \u2013 those two are very good contracts for us. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thank you. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you. Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.: All right. Thanks. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: So, just to close here, 2016 really was a great year for us. And closing with such a strong year really gives us confidence that the business is hitting on all cylinders. I think we have the team, the strategy, the assets, the culture to make this year and years to follow successful really by any measure. So, we're pleased with where we stand right now, and thank you for joining us. We'll see you next quarter.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, Jim Fish. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Ed, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. 2017 is off to a terrific start. Our strong first quarter results continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of improving core price, adding profitable volume in a disciplined manner, and controlling costs as we met or exceeded all our internal targets. In the first quarter, we saw revenue grow by more than 8%. Operating income grew by 10% and operating EBITDA grew 8%. Our operations produced $0.66 of earnings per share in the first quarter despite a $0.02 impact from executive severance which was an increase of almost 14% when compared to the first quarter of 2016. We've built a strong foundation and have the momentum to continue to generate growth throughout the remainder of 2017. In the first quarter, our revenues grew by more than $260 million or 8.3%. Almost all of this increase was organically driven, and our first quarter revenue was the largest organic growth we've generated in over a decade. One of the drivers of our success was the disciplined execution of our pricing programs. In the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.1% and our yield was 2%. Looking at volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.9% in the first quarter. We've been keenly focused on delivering excellent customer service and directing our sales efforts and growth capital on the portions of the U.S. economy that are seeing the strongest economic development. And in the last five quarters, we've seen these efforts result in volume growth that is generating strong incremental earnings and cash flow. Jim will discuss our customer service focus in more detail, but we continue to see improvements in our churn which finished the quarter at 8.3%; that's the lowest number we've seen since 2002. In addition to the strong solid waste core price and volume, recycling commodity prices added over a $110 million to our revenue growth in the quarter. This revenue growth was the primary driver of our year-over-year increase in the earnings of our recycling business which contributed about $0.065 of earnings per share to the quarter. In the past, we've discussed the volatility that market prices for commodities create in our recycling business, and it appears that 2017 will be an even more volatile year than we anticipated. In the first quarter, we saw recycling commodity prices up almost 70% at our recycling facilities. Yet in the beginning of the second quarter, we've seen those prices drop significantly. Due to this commodity price volatility, we're leaving our guidance for the recycling business unchanged though the bias is to the upside, and that should become clearer after the second quarter. Although this is a line of business that's more difficult to forecast, recycling is a service that our customers want and we remain committed to it. As a result, we will continue to optimize recycling to ensure we generate the returns our shareholders expect whether commodity prices are high or low. Now looking at cash flow in the quarter, once again our strong operating EBITDA performance drove our free cash flow. We anticipated that our first quarter cash flow results would be lower than the prior year due to a couple of unusual items that Devina will discuss. But we exceeded our internal expectations and remain confident that we can achieve our full year guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. Our preference after paying our dividend is still to use free cash flow to acquire accretive businesses at a reasonable purchase price, so we continue to diligently identify attractive acquisition targets. So our strategy continues to deliver value to our shareholders and we will not deviate from improving price, obtaining profitable volumes, and reducing costs through continuous improvement to generate strong cash flow. In addition to the these core fundamentals, we will stay focused on attracting and retaining the best team in the industry, safely providing superior customer service and differentiation through technology. When it comes to our employees, we're focused on identifying and developing our future leaders, and since November we've promoted three high-performing key members into open area Vice President roles. You've also heard us talk about technology as a key strategic pillar for our long-term success. We expect to name a Chief Technology Officer this year to lead our talented team as we further develop solutions that enhance the ease of our customer interaction and improve the efficiency of providing that service. This includes rolling out a new wm.com for our customers and using big data across multiple disciplines to improve the business. As part of our long-term strategy to grow profitable volumes, we want to be the premier waste service provider for all our customers, large and small. Recently, two very large customers, New York City and the City of Los Angeles, have decided to partner with us to serve significant portions of their city's long-term needs. We're excited to be positioned to dedicate both the human and financial capital required to serve these two cities and we look forward to delivering excellent customer service to them for the next two decades. To sum it up, we've set the bar high with our solid first quarter results and we're confident in our ability to deliver strong performance through the remainder of 2017 and beyond. And so we're reaffirming our full year EPS guidance of between $3.14 to $3.18 and our full year free cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter operating results in more detail. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Our revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017 reflected the continuation of the strong execution of our price, customer service, and disciplined growth strategies that we saw throughout 2016. Revenues in the quarter were $3.44 billion, an increase of $264 million or 8.3% when compared to the first quarter of 2016. First quarter revenue growth in our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume was $113 million. First quarter revenues also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices which drove a $111 million increase in recycling revenues. Fuel surcharges and foreign currency fluctuations increased $25 million and acquisitions also increased revenues for the quarter by $12 million. Looking at internal revenue growth in the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.1%, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, and yield was 2%. Both total volumes and traditional solid waste volumes improved 1.9%. On a work day adjusted basis, total volumes and traditional solid waste volumes were 1.4%. Our continued focus on customer service is having a positive impact on volumes as we achieved the lowest churn since the third quarter of 2002 at 8.3%, an improvement of 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2016. Our field collection, call centers, sales, and technology teams are aligned around improving service to our customers in a world-class manner and our results demonstrate this alignment. We also saw service increases exceeding service decreases for the 13th consecutive quarter, supporting continued commercial volume growth. Price rollbacks improved 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016 and the combined positive price and positive volume led the total company income from operations growing $50 million, operating income margin expanding 20 basis points to 16.2%, and operating EBITDA growing $66 million. Our collection lines of business continued to perform exceptionally well. In the first quarter, commercial core price was 7.9% with volumes up 2.5%; a 50-basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. Industrial core price was 9.7% with volume up 2.7% in the first quarter, up 170 basis points from the growth that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the residential line of business, core price was 2.6%. Residential volumes were down 1.9% in the first quarter but that is a 70-basis point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016. The combined price and volume increases in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing $29 million and operating EBITDA growing $33 million. In the landfill line of business, total volumes increased 3.7%; MSW volumes grew 6.8%; C&D volume grew 18.9%, and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew about 1%. We achieved core price of 2.1% in the landfill line of business. As Jim mentioned, our recycling business exceeded our expectations in the first quarter primarily driven by a 70% increase in recycled commodity prices at our recycling facilities. Our recycling operations increased EPS by $0.066 when compared to the first quarter of 2016. Most of the increase in EPS, or $0.055, was driven by improved commodity prices. The remaining $0.011 was due to renegotiating contract terms and improvements in operating cost which directly aligns with our recycling strategy to reduce risk and improve the recycling business model. While these results are higher than we anticipated in the first quarter, in April we have seen export prices decline between $50 per tonne and $75 per tonne depending on the specific commodity. Given this volatility, we will wait until later in the year to provide any full year change to our recycling guidance. Moving now to operating expenses. In the first quarter, total operating costs increased $173 million when compared with the first quarter of 2016. The cost increases were largely related to higher recycled commodity rebates to our customers, increased labor costs due to growing volumes, and rising fuel expenses. Fuel negatively impacted our EPS by about $0.02 from the combination of our fuel surcharge not yet catching up with the increased fuel cost and the absence of a CNG fuel tax credit. Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 20 basis points from 62.8% in the first quarter of 2016 to 63% in the first quarter of 2017. The combined cost of recycling rebates and higher fuel expenses increased almost 200 basis points as a percent of revenue. However, through efficiency gains and cost control efforts, we were able to offset 180 basis point of almost 200-basis point increase in the commodity base cost in the quarter. Labor and transfer and disposal cost each improved 50 basis points as a percent of revenue while risk management and subcontractor cost each improved 30 basis points. Our employees have done a good job at managing our controllable costs as volumes have increased which is demonstrated by eight consecutive quarters of productivity improvement in our collection lines of business. Overall, we're very pleased with our collection and disposal operations. They continue to contribute to the growth in our operating EBITDA, adding more than $53 million in the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2016. And I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2017, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 11.3%; that's a 10-basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2016. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $390 million in the first quarter or $28 million higher than in the prior year period. SG&A costs during the quarter included $13 million of executive severance costs, most of which was non-cash. These charges negatively impacted EPS by $0.02 per share and SG&A costs as a percent of revenue by 30 basis points. The remaining increase in SG&A dollars during the quarter primarily relates to the timing of incentive compensation accruals which we do not expect to meaningfully impact the comparability of our SG&A costs for the full year. So when we consider these one-time charges and the impact of timing differences, our SG&A costs were essentially flat in dollars, positioning us very well for SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue to approach 10% for the year. Turning to cash flow. In the first quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $721 million compared to $732 million in the first quarter of 2016. We saw the business generate operating EBITDA growth of $66 million in the first quarter, and that's an 8% increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. As Jim discussed, this operating EBITDA growth was driven by the performance of our core solid waste operations and complemented by strong recycling commodity prices. Our cash flow from operations also benefited from reduced interest payments as well as our focus on working capital optimization, and we're very pleased to see that we continue to convert more of our revenue dollars into cash. These cash flow benefits were offset by a couple of items. As you likely remember, in the first quarter of 2016 we had a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross-currency hedge. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2017 we saw increased incentive compensation payment related to the strong performance that we achieved in 2016. These two items more than offset the benefit from increased operating EBITDA and were the primary reason for the slight decline in cash provided by operating activities. During the first quarter, we spent $332 million on capital expenditures. That's an increase of $15 million from 2016 but in line with our disciplined focus on managing capital expenditures to between 9% and 10% of revenue. Divestiture proceeds weren't significant during the quarter and, combined, we generated $396 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2017 which exceeded our expectations. This strong performance puts us well on our way to achieving our free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion for 2017. In the first quarter, we paid $194 million in dividends to our shareholders, and at the end of the first quarter our debt to EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.4. Our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 4.2% and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 12% at the end of the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was approximately 31.7% which is almost 5 percentage points lower than the rate that we used to build our outlook for the year. The difference is due to tax benefits we recognized during the quarter of divesting an exercise of stock-based compensation awards. The inclusion of this tax benefit as a reduction to our reported provision for income taxes is new in 2017, and it's the result of the new accounting standard. We're going to include additional details about the impact of the accounting standard in our Form 10-Q which we plan to file later today. These tax benefits are difficult to predict and depend on factors like our stock price and employee exercise activity. And with the senior executive severance impact, predicting this activity is even more difficult. So we chose to exclude the $0.07 per share of tax benefit as adjusted earnings. Adjusting out the impact of this accounting change, our effective tax rate for the quarter would've been 36.8% which is slightly higher than we anticipated. We continue to expect our full year 2017 adjusted tax rate to be about 36.5%. So in summary, the strong results of our first quarter reflect the continued execution of our core operating objectives and focus on continuous improvement. The Waste Management team has once again demonstrated our disciplined focus on serving the customer while optimizing our business. 2017 is off to a strong start and we look forward to that continuing throughout the year. With that, Dennis, let's open the lines for questions. Operator : And your first question will come from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions, Jim, Jim, and Devina. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Of the $59 million in volume sale growth in the quarter, how do I think about the mix from MSW versus construction and the special waste? I know you gave me percentage changes year-over-year, but I'm curious to understand the trend line like in commercial as there's still this upside from new business formation and then service interval upgrades that's playing out. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. So if you look at the quarterly numbers by line of business and then you look at those waste streams, commercial has \u2013 and I hope I'm answering your question as you're asking it here \u2013 but the commercial continues to be strong, it looks strong even as we head into month of April. And it's been on that kind of continuous improvement track as Jim said for about five quarters. Then when you look at, well, industrial as well, and I would tell you that industrial has been higher than the 2.7% that we finished in the first quarter, but sequentially we were up from a 1% number to a 2.7% number from Q4 to Q1, and that one also continues to look good into April. Part of that is our energy services business, Michael. It looks like it's starting to pick up a little bit. Might have the first quarter of year-over-year improvement in two years in the energy services business by the time we get to the second quarter. And then when you look at those waste streams within the landfill business, MSW was strong and it's been strong. MSW volume has been strong and I think our focus is not only on the volume side but also on the price side of MSW. We can talk about that a little bit as well but the only weak waste stream for us, and weak is kind of a comparative term here because it was weak by comparison to other quarters, but still 2.6% on special waste. With that said, the pipeline looks good with special waste. C&D has been incredibly strong. I think that demonstrates the strength of the housing business around the U.S. and Canada, but that's a pretty good, I think, overview of what our volumes look like and the mix of those different waste streams. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So if I just parse one thing specifically, commercial in particular is one of your best margin businesses. And how would you think about the service interval cycle on a same store basis today... James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Michael that is \u2013 sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, compared to what that looked like, what that same service interval look like before the great recession. So are we back to those levels or...? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. The right question, Michael. I'll start with container weights in the commercial line of business, and our container weights in Q1 were up at a higher percentage than previous year quarter, more than we've seen in over a decade. Residential line of business as well, container weights are up. I think it signals well for the economy and for our collection business itself. On the roll-off side, the weights were about at the same level of 2016. As I've mentioned earlier, we saw service increases outpace the decreases for the 13th consecutive quarter. It's a really good sign for us. We don't measure it versus the great recession, but I would tell you we're in the, I would guess, the middle innings of that growth in the commercial line of business especially we're seeing good opportunity for us. We're really focused on higher margin side of it. We've seen good growth in the national account business. The multi-location, commercial customer, it started in the second half of last year. So you'll see that in the second half of this year anniversary. So we may not be at that 2.5% level but we'll still be positive and making progress. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Switching gears and Jim Fish, you alluded to this. I was going to ask are you seeing any signs of a recovery in the E&P drilling world and I gather you are? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well we are. I mean, look, it's heaviest and the rebound is heaviest in the Permian Basin where we don't have a presence. But we're encouraged to see that's, in the month of March, first month \u2013 when we look at it on a monthly basis \u2013 the first month that we've seen year-over-year improvement in the Marcellus and the Niobrara in two years. So we think that that portends a pick-up on a quarterly basis when we get to the second quarter. So we're pretty encouraged with the pick-up we're seeing. It's still is more heavily weighted here in West Texas but it's starting to show up in places where we have a presence. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Another gear switch. On the recycling side, one of the things that sometimes I think it's overlooked, you have a pretty big brokerage business which has got a great cash generator in return on capital basis but relatively low margin. So can you frame, of this positive trend in recycling, how much came from the brokerage side so we put in perspective the margin? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes, Michael, absolutely. The brokerage side of our recycling business, it's about 41%, 42% of the total volume, and that's relatively flat. I think one year it was 41% and this year, 42%. Last year it was 41%, so we're roughly in the same place as a percentage of the revenue. And you're right, the margin is at mid-single-digit margins, but as you stated it's very \u2013 there's no capital expense involved, so the ROI is really high and it really gives us leverage in the sale of commodities in addition to just providing more value to our customers, more stickiness with customers that have both large commodity volumes and other waste service needs. So we're very pleased with that business but it's relatively flat with prior year on a volume basis. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. But that accounts for, as strong as the whole recycling pie was, why we've got really great free cash flow leverage but not as much margin leverage. We shouldn't get as hung up about the margin, we should be paying attention to free cash. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. We won't get margin leverage there. We pass through a percentage. We make a percentage on those transactions and that will continue. It won't go down or up much at all. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Maybe a couple of basis points, but not much. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: But not enough to move the needle of the whole company and yet still really good business for us when it connects with all of the other lines of business. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Last question. You said in your comments that you exceeded your own internal expectations for free cash flow. I'm curious by how much? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Well I would say when we look at free cash flow, really, where we're focusing is the EBITDA growth that we saw, and so EBITDA of 8% in the first quarter exceeded our expectations. But as Jim and Jim have said, we're waiting to see the seasonal uptick with regard to core collection and disposal business and then how recycling commodity prices impact the second quarter before we update our guidance for the full year. So the EBITDA piece of it, as a reminder we expected full year EBITDA growth to be $240 million to $290 million and it's typical for us to see more of that in the second and third quarters than in Q1. And if you use Q1 and extrapolate it, it would imply that we're well on our way to be at the top end of that. But we're waiting to see how the full year or the second quarter unfolds before we give an update on full year guidance. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Thanks for taking my question. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, Jim, Jim, and Devina. So just to dig a little bit more into the recycling. First, we had been hearing about recent volatility in the international market especially following China's crackdown on waste exports. Can you just talk about what you're generally assuming for price trends over the balance of 2017 and how we should think about kind of the sensitivity there? You mentioned you had some bias to the upside for the business? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. First, I would tell you that it's pretty tough to predict commodity prices. We have a hard time predicting 30 days out, let alone eight or nine months out. But we did build into our guidance $0.03 of improvement in the recycling business. We kind of use the rule and it still holds that for every $10 move it's worth about $0.04, so that would tell you that we built about $7 or $8 of improvement in for the year. Obviously, it was better than that in the first quarter. But then when we look at the second quarter with the real volatility, OCC down 10%, ONP down 40% in one week's time, it kind of reminds us that don't get too giddy about the commodity prices because they can come back pretty quickly. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah, yeah. And then switching gears. You mentioned that you're going to be hiring a Chief Technology Officer. You talked a little bit about the new wm.com and trying to position closer to customers. I wonder where do you see sort of the low-hanging fruit at this point certainly as we watch technology diffusion across the industry? I mean, you guys have been doing route optimization and other innovative data management techniques for many years now. So where do you kind of see the incremental improvements at this point? Where do you see the possibilities there? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Right. No, it's a good question though, and technologies is a big umbrella. I mean, there's a lot underneath the umbrella. There's data, there's equipment, there's customer-facing solutions, Internet of Things. I think to answer your question, you're right. We've put a lot of effort into the on-board computers and then the resulting efficiency improvement that we see out of those. But you'll start to see us using big data in a much more sophisticated way. We're already starting that with our pricing. But you'll also see it with things like predictive maintenance as we look at how do we predict, and we've just started down that path, but how do we predict when things like hydraulics on vehicles will give. And then as opposed to waiting and handling our maintenance in a reactive manner, we handle it more proactively and that is much more cost-effective for us. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Jim, that predictive modeling begins to pay off and we absolutely see signs of that and have real test underway with real application. It'll affect, to your question though, it'll affect not just the operating cost side of the house but service to customers... James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: For sure. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: ...as we keep more trucks out on the route... James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: That's right. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: ...and improve that consistency of delivery and not have as many road calls, for example, on the cost side of the house. So it'll affect both the operating costs \u2013 it has affected operating costs \u2013 and the service to our customers as well. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Now, if you can imagine though our truck that goes down on the road unexpectedly with a hydraulic hose going out, we're probably paying overtime there to the driver, we've got to pay a towing charge, we may have some type of clean-up charge and, to Jim's point, we have a customer service interruption. So if we can do this predictably then all of that goes away and it's better for our bottom line and better for our customers. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. And if I could just sneak in one more. Are you still confident in getting to that 50-plus bps of operating EBITDA margin expansion year-over-year? It seems, just going back to your SG&A comments, that you don't need to squeeze much juice on the operating expense side to get there despite some of the fuel headwinds. But just want to make sure that that kind of modeling assumption for the year is still holding. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Definitely. I think we guided a 50 to 100 basis points of improvements in margins there and we're still comfortable at that range. And to your point on SG&A, as Devina mentioned we said we'd like to approach 10% and we still feel like we have a shot at that. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Hey, Andrew. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Can you talk a little bit about your fuel expense? You guys had the surcharge and the catch-up in the quarter. Tax credit went away. How do we think about this going forward in terms of modeling fuel? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So our fuel costs were up a total of $32 million in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and that's a combination of our direct costs, our fuel surcharges that we pay to our subcontractors, and then also the fuel tax credit going away. And the increase in revenue that we saw in the fuel surcharge side was only $20 million, so that $12 million delta is what's driving that $0.02 impact. When we look at the full year, what we've seen with diesel cost prices leveling out, if our expectation is that those level out then we think about $0.01 of the headwind in Q1, we should get back over the remainder of the year as the lag in the fuel surcharge part of the revenue equation hedges up. The piece that we can't provide any clarity on whether or not we'll get back is the extension of the fuel tax credit and with tax reform and it's kind of infancy from a conversation perspective. It's too early for us to say whether or not we'll get that back. And so the $0.01 that we saw in headwind for that in the first quarter, you could extrapolate to the remainder of the year of having up to a $0.04 impact for the full year. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Andrew, if you look at the tax credit itself, the expectation from our contacts in DC, if the comprehensive tax reform happens we don't think we'll see that fuel tax credit. It'll be bundled in with other corporate tax reductions. If that falls apart, then I think you'll see that happen, they'll go ahead and pass those extenders. Who knows what's going to happen in DC today. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: But we'll be happy to give up the fuel tax credit for a term for a rate reduction in corporate tax rates. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: We will be happy. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. All right, that's helpful. And just switching gears on your volumes. You guys didn't really call out anything pertaining to weather in the quarter. I would've thought that would've helped you. I mean, can you just talk about that? It sounds like it probably got offset with poor weather in other areas. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You know the weather was good for the first quarter; I would tell you that that's last year though. A part of the reason we didn't say anything is because you can always talk about the weather and we try not to talk about it too much. But last year was really unusually mild. So in an odd sort of way, even though we had a good winter this year, it wasn't as mild as last year. So we had a few shutdowns this year in the Northeast, a couple in the Midwest. I don't recall any shutdowns in the winter of 2016. Whereas last year, we actually did talk about the fact that we were concerned we might've borrowed some volume from Q2 in Q1. I don't think we have that feel and it looks to be the case when we look at our April numbers. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: The other thing I would say about weather is in California in particular we did have an impact from all of the rain that that region saw. And so we did see a bit of a negative impact on those businesses, but that was isolated and minor to the quarter. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just around customer churn. It's improved obviously over the last couple of years. Could you give us a sense whether 7% is realistic there or whether you have a target there that you think is achievable and where does that come from? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Hamzah, good to hear from you. 8.3% is a really good number. That's pretty close to what we had targeted for the whole year. But I'll tell you there's still room for improvement and we would never say otherwise. We've been in the upper 7s before but it's been over a decade ago as we began to roll out service machine internal initiative, and we're back in that vicinity now. So we'll continue to seek improvement, we'll look for improvement but upper 7s, lower 8s is a pretty good number given our history and given the opportunity in the marketplace. We think that we'll continue to see small improvements but that are big with regard to the impact on the business from the commercial line of business especially at keeping those high-margin, high-ROI customers. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. And then just on the share buyback. It seems like leverage is low. If you get tax reform, cash flow goes up. You already have cut SG&A over time. What does your M&A pipeline look like and just remind us what verticals you guys consider core? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. So good morning, Hamzah. When we think about M&A, we're certainly interested in core acquisitions. And to your question, we would define core as being, of course, core solid waste, industrial, hazardous, potentially energy services, even recycling; all of those, we throw in that core bucket. So anything that would be a good strategic fit for us within those core buckets at a fair price, we would consider and we continue to look for those. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, got it. Last question and I'll turn it over. You guys mentioned the brokerage volume on recycling. You've also done some contract work around your recycling business. Could you just remind us, is the operating leverage in your recycling business lower than what it's been historically? OCC pricing was up a lot but it seems like the flow through wasn't very high. So just trying to get a sense of is there anything different around the rebate structure, contract structure or anything else versus history? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Hamzah, we believe the recycling strategy that we laid out a couple of years ago was to reduce the risk in the Atlanta business, and we've done that through the contract renegotiations and renewals. We now charge a processing fee that we believe provides our shareholders with a reasonable return, accretive return, and yet gives customers what they want. But yet we were not rebating at the same level with floors in place like we had before. You saw that in Q1 our recycling rebates to customers were up but yet our margin was accretive to the company and it was very positive for us. So the whole goal was to reduce the risk and yet still play in that marketplace and provide customers what they expect from us, and we've done that. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I think, Hamzah, the restructuring of the contracts that you mentioned, you'll see that show up most when we're down at the low end of commodity prices and, to Jim's point, we've derisked the business down there. When you're kind of in the middle or in the upper end where we've been in the last couple of quarters, you don't see the change from the contract restructuring so much when prices are where they are. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And part of, Hamzah, the continuous improvement for the whole company, we're really focused on the operating side. And if you compare us back today versus two or three years ago, the gross operating expense per tonne is consistently lower quarter-by-quarter. So we're in good shape there, Hamzah, on a long-term basis. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Congrats to Devina and her move in the interim tech (43:52). Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Making it official. Great. You had really strong volumes again and you'd mentioned some of the regional impacts. But I was wondering if you could maybe just step back and look at the country more broadly and talk about what kind of regional trends you saw and where the strength was a little bit better than average or maybe was held back by some factors? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure, Brian. Particularly as if you look at C&D for example, C&D was very strong in the quarter and has been strong for probably five or six consecutive quarters. Regionally, that's where you would expect to see it. It's in the South, it's in the West. But, really, it's hard to find a place where C&D showed weakness honestly. It wasn't as strong in maybe the Midwest and the upper Midwest as it was in Florida, but I wouldn't characterize it as being weak. So when you look at C&D that, I think, demonstrates that the housing market and maybe the overall economy seem to be somewhat optimistic and on an upswing. And then when you look at our \u2013 we talked about our industrial business or the industrial piece of our business that is related to energy services, that's been starting to show some real signs of recovery as well, and of course those are in those areas of the country where we have energy services operations, specifically Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Texas. It's somewhat limited there. You don't see it in areas where we don't have energy services. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks for that. And recycled commodity prices, particularly recycled fiber, tends to be a little volatile. And I think one of the theories for why it spiked so much over the last couple of months was maybe just a shift in trends from retail, brick-and-mortar to e-commerce and changes that might have on collection patterns. In essence, you guys are a little bit more on the forefront of that. Just wondering if you've seen that and kind of how your recycled fiber volumes have trended over the last couple of months? We know the pricing has been up a lot, but just kind of a look at how the volumes have been. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the volumes have been \u2013 I think we're up 1% in volumes for the quarter. Definitely over the long-term, it's going to move or the shift that we're seeing in retail is going to affect volumes. It's hard to see it on a quarter-to-quarter basis though. And when we look at pricing of commodities, the volatility is greatest where the Chinese have the greatest impact. So for us, for example, virtually all of our newsprints goes to China and so when the Chinese decide they're not going to buy newsprints as they did a couple of weeks back, it really dramatically impacts the price of ONP, hence the drop of 40%. We end up selling about maybe 30% of our OCC to China, so while they still have a big and material impact on price that one was only off about 10% a couple of weeks ago. So, really, the pricing is probably driven as much by what the Chinese do and then the volume is much more of a longer-term trend. Somehow to your point, it will be a result of the shift in the retail business. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks. And just one more if I could. You mentioned a little bit about the fuel tax credit as a bit of a headwind. Just wondering, tied to that, if there's any change in some of the energy credits that you get off of the landfills or pricing on some of that that may have changed in the last couple of months? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: That would affect the tax line and you'll see with the 36.8% that we basically came in right at our guidance. So we've not seen a negative impact on that at this point. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning, Waste Management team. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning Al. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: I wanted to come back to recycling and the energy piece but I think Jim Trevathan has talked a little earlier about the strategic process or changes you guys have made. It strikes me as, I don't know, just curious I guess that a $10 move now only has $0.04 benefit to you which is similar to others in the industry. I mean, I understand you're trying to do, and properly do, is minimize the risk but why would you give up so much of the upside in a business that your customers are demanding versus you may be necessarily seeing the ROIC for the investments? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Al, we haven't given up any of the upside with all of our contract renegotiations; we've just minimized the downside risk and that's where, as Jim said earlier, where you'll see that impact. But we've always said for the last handful of years that that $10 price change is about a $0.04 impact to EPS. That's not been changed from previous conversation on these calls or in person. So I think the business is much better set than in the past. For those years like we had, what, it in 2011 and 2012 when commodity prices dramatically went down and we weren't charging for processing to cover our cost, and now we do, we absolutely price all of our contracts to cover the processing cost plus an accretive margin to the company with a really healthy ROI, extremely healthy ROI in fact. But yet, we've reduced that downside risk and yet kept customers engaged by giving them roughly the same upside that they've always had. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: I just remember $175 to $200 of OCC pricing, the numbers were something more like $0.10 to $0.12, and it was clear that the industry, not just Waste Management, but the industry was over-earning at that time. And so to me, we are back not necessarily to those levels but we're up. But it doesn't seem like the flow through particularly in Q1 is where, I guess, maybe a lot of us were thinking it would be, at least in particular this analyst. So, all right. Switching gears. The comment on waste diversion technology that you wrote off, could you just talk about, well, obviously it's probably not significant anymore, but what's the nature behind that? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure. We were in a joint venture to build a gas-to-liquids plant on one of our landfills in Oklahoma, and the focus of that joint venture was to take methane and natural gas and convert it into a higher-value hydrocarbon. And as with many energy-based commodity-driven investments, the financial outlook for those investments has changed as energy prices has been relatively low over the long-term. And as we looked at this project and prospects for building this project further from the one plant in Oklahoma, those became less appealing. And so as a result, we went ahead and impaired that investment to our view of the fair value of the assets that are on our site. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Right. Okay. Thank you for that, Devina. Finally, on the energy side. Historically, I think you've had more traditional landfills taking in waste given the market conditions and the improvement that you've had in the cash flow and the balance sheet and the longer-term opportunity. Should we not see maybe a little more strategic investment there specifically in the disposal capabilities directly related to tailings and energy by-product? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. As to one of the earlier questions, we did mention that when we think about core investments, definitely energy services is one of those. It's not for lack of looking around. We've looked at energy services opportunities, but it's got to be the right strategic fit for us. It's got to be the right place particularly when we think about energy services. It's got to be the right geography for us and it's got to be fairly priced. So it is definitely an area that we are exploring from an M&A standpoint. It just has to be the right strategic fit for us. Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks a lot, Jim. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, I just was hoping if we could just dive into a little bit on the incremental margin. So for the last two quarters, it appears there's been some one-time costs in there that may have weighed it down, limiting that margin expansion. I know growth of free cash flow exceeded your internal expectations. I'm just curious how you're thinking about those incrementals. So, like, what is keeping you from getting to the top end of the range of the 50 to 100 bps of expansion in this type of backdrop? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, I don't think anything is keeping us from getting there. We still have an expectation that we will get 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement. I think when you look at the first quarter and you say, well, on the surface it looks like we were flat on our reported numbers, then you have to consider the $0.02 that we had in executive severance that really is a one-time impact to us, and consider the $0.016 for fuel that Devina went through, really, it's about a quarter lag there for us on fuel between when we see the increase in the price of fuel and our fuel surcharge catch-up to that. And so with those two, you're looking at as much as 100-basis point improvement in EBITDA margins if you take those two out, and that doesn't consider the timing difference that she mentioned in her script of incentive comp that amounted to as much as a $0.015. So we think that that 50 to 100 basis points, while it didn't show up in Q1, it really was because of a couple of those either timing-related issues or the one-timer with executive severance. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Jim, I might mention a couple of things that I did earlier in the prepared comments. But if you look at some of the controllable operating expenses, we improved labor 50 basis points; transportation and disposal each 50 basis points; the risk part of our business, 30 basis points improvement; and our subcontractor costs, 30 basis points. So there's real leverage there that offset a couple of those uncontrollables. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. And if you combine that with what we think about SG&A going forward, I think that probably demonstrates why we are still confident in the 50 to 100 basis points. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. And lastly, I'm just curious how you're viewing your current balance sheet especially in this gradually improving environment. What's the leverage range that you're most comfortable with and do you think to some extent your balance sheet might be like \"too strong\" in this backdrop? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: With a 2.4 leverage, we're certainly comfortable that the balance sheet is in really good shape for us to think about opportunistic acquisitions as a priority, and that's really how we look at our leverage as optimal. And we're certainly at the low end, but we could see that tick down from here as EBITDA grows and if we don't have strategic M&A that's a good fit for us and at the right price to go execute. And I think what is most important and how we message that is that we really want to be positioned so that we can execute at the right time, at the right price, to contribute to the long-term growth of the organization. And so we're not going to chase the leverage up as EBITDA grows. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's fair enough, I guess. When we think about the $100 million to $200 million guidance on the M&A, can you talk about how that's trending and how the pipeline's looking? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure. We actually meet later today. We meet once a month as a team to look at the pipeline. And I would say the pipeline is strong and we see opportunities across the landscape that Jim was describing. It's interesting to see valuations at this point in the market. And one of the things that we're committed to is being diligent users of our shareholders' capital to be sure that we prudently spend dollars at the right valuations. And so that's really what comes into play when we look at the M&A landscape today. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Just to make sure you're clear on the $100 million to $200 million, those are really tuck-ins. We've had several questions today about what types of businesses we would be interested in and we went through what we consider to be core. When we think about that $100 million to $200 million, those are really typically small tuck-ins pretty much solely in the solid waste space. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Corey Greendale with the First Analysis. Please go ahead. Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Thanks. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Just for the first one. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about any, just for modeling purposes, year-on- year work day discrepancies for each of the remaining quarters in 2017? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure. So we have an additional work day of 0.7 work days in Q1. We give that back in the third quarter of this year to be flat by the end of September. And then in the fourth quarter we'll actually have a work day difference that goes the other way. So all-in for the full year, we'll have about one less work day. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: And just FYI, that when we think about work days, the extra work day, the 0.7 work days that Devina mentioned, typically work against us because you have the labor cost in most of your lines of business. The only lines of business where it works for you are with landfill tons and roll-off. And when you get that extra work day in the first quarter which are lighter than the other three quarters in terms of roll-off and landfill tons, it does work against you. We think that it could've been as much as $5 million to $6 million of headwind. We haven't talked about that at all in Q1 for us this year. But no reason to talk about it because we get it back and then some at the end of the year, with this year not being in a leap year obviously. Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just going back to the big data remarks that you had earlier. Can you give us a sense of your IT infrastructure specifically given your roll-off strategy. Do you have all the systems in place to pull all of this data together? And if not, can you give us a sense of what type of investment it would require to do so? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. So we acquired a group about four years ago that's strictly an OR group. And that group is the team that's pulling together the example that we went through with predictive maintenance. That's the team that's doing a lot of that predictive maintenance analytics. So we feel that we have absolutely the right group to do that. And they're not just focused by the way on maintenance, that's the group that's been doing all of our automation of routes, they're also doing things like looking at our safety data and taking a predictive approach to that so that we can proactively train. There's a number of things they're focused on, but that all falls under our operations research group. Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So maybe just a dovetail into the prior balance sheet question. I think you guys have earmarked about $500 million or so for share buyback in 2017. Any thoughts on the timing on that $500 million or even any plans to do another accelerated buyback? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: We continue to have that in our plan for the back half of the year because we're wanting to see how that M&A pipeline shapes out. And with regard to how we execute it, we certainly look at ASRs as an efficient way to execute our share buyback. But that $500 million continue to be in our forecasts and right now it's all forecast for the second half of the year. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And could that theoretically go away based off the size of a deal that you do? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Theoretically, yes. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure, sure. I mean, I think, Joe, when you look at capital allocation, I mean, first and foremost dividend and what we've said about the dividend is we want to see kind of a confirmation of that higher base of free cash flow that we've talked about over the last couple of quarters in 2017 before we make a decision to do anything with the dividends in early 2018. And then, of course, we've talked on this call a lot about the fact that the leverage ratio continues to go down and that really, as Devina said, is in the hopes that we find a strategic fit for us. But you're right. In theory, depending on the size of that, sure, you could absolutely see share buybacks go away completely for a period of time depending on the size of an acquisition. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then switching gears. I know it's obviously not a big line of business for you, but curious if you've noticed any sort of uptick in your hazardous waste business largely from the inflection that we've seen in both industrial production and crude production? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Joe. That business is a really strategic line of business for us because it connects with most of the other lines and we're very pleased with it. We have seen at specific sites some real growth there along the Gulf Coast. The West Coast with all of the rain that Jim mentioned earlier, it slowed down a little bit of the project work that we typically do in that line of business that's on customers or cleanup sites, and that was a little slower in Q1 given the rain and especially in California, Southern Cal, and that one large site for us, Kettleman, has been a real producer for us. It was a little slower in Q1, but in general it's a very well-performing business and we see upside. When you look at the commitments to investment from the petrochemical industry along the Gulf Coast, from Texas across to Florida, you see huge dollars planned for the next decade in the petrochemicals side of the house. That bodes well because we're so well-positioned with the Texas business but with that site in Louisiana, with sites in special waste in Louisiana as well along the Gulf Coast and then in the Alabama hazardous site. So we're extremely well-positioned there and expect that business to continue to grow for us. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I would just, Joe, add to what Jim said there and say that both our hazardous and our non-hazardous special waste were a little slower than we would like. But I think the outlook is pretty strong. Obviously, if some type of infrastructure build could get passed out of Congress, that would be positive for us on both sides of that, both haz and non-haz. So while both hazardous waste and special waste were not weak but not super strong, I think the outlook is where we're encouraged. Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Hey, Tyler. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, I know the call has been long so I've just got one here. So Jim, I know there is a lot to talk about tax reform out there. If we just kind of set that aside for a sec. I think back in 2010, you guys made some investments in low income housing and such. I surmise that was designed to lower the corporate tax rate, but I am curious. One, assuming no reform, when would we expect those credits to sunset, driving a more normalized tax rate? And two, if we do get reformed to a simplified code would that potentially drive an impairment in those investments as I assume you wouldn't be able to take those credits? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: All very good questions, Tyler. I'll take that. So we expect a sunset of both the low income housing tax credit investment and the alternate fuel tax credit investment that we've made to sunset I think beginning in 2018, 2019, and we can get more details on that. But the normalized tax rate without tax reform wouldn't happen until probably around 2019. And then when we think about whether or not there'll be an impairment associated with any of that, we're still looking into that. But I can tell you that the way that those deals have been structured is in addition to the investment that we have. We also have future cash flow obligations that we kind of account for as debt on our balance sheet. And so we think impairment impacts would be limited because that assets goes away but so does the liability, but it's not expected to be material. And as Jim mentioned earlier, all-in we think that tax reform would be a net benefit to us even with those investments going away. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sure. Okay. All right. Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Tom. Operator : Your next question is form the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hey. Thanks. Just a quick one from me. But, Jim, because you've mentioned publicly in the past that there's a lot of interesting recycling technology out there but, of course, many lack scale and given your strong cash flow recently, what's your appetite at this time for either acquiring or investing in any of these technologies kind of as an industry leader maybe to support building that scale? I guess is there anything out there that you may have your eye on that's interesting from a technology perspective? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Hi, Barbara. Yeah, good question. We recently had a leadership strategy meeting, and one of the things we talked about at that meeting was what does the recycle facility of the future look like. So when we think about investing in recycling, I think I would tell you that investing just in the same type of technology that we have today would be less interesting to us than investing in improved technology that helps improve recycling rates for us. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Got it. Thanks. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You bet. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: All right. Thank you. So in closing here, we're obviously pleased with the quarter from a financial results perspective but we're pleased with the cultural shifts we're seeing internally at Waste Management because of our focus on our people, our customers, and our technology. And that was best demonstrated I think on the people side with the succession, planning, and the promotion of three high-performing leaders into the AVP roles that I mentioned. Also on the customer service results that Jim Trevathan talked about, this obsession with the customers is something that I think you'll see Waste Management really focus on. And then a lot of conversation this morning around technology, around pricing, and routing and logistics, and the sophistication of data that we're beginning to bring to our business, we think it's the beginning of this path that we're on for cultural change and I think it makes us the right choice when it comes to an employer, as a service provider or a partner or an investment of choice. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning and we will see you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's call.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Ed, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. Our second quarter results have again demonstrated the cash-generating strength of our company. Our tactical focus on improving core price, adding profitable volume in a disciplined manner, and controlling costs is clearly the right direction for our business. The end result of that focus is once again a strong operating EBITDA performance, which translated into robust cash flow in the quarter. Our operating EBITDA grew about 8% in the quarter to $1.029 billion when compared to the second quarter of 2016. This was the highest operating EBITDA we've ever achieved in any quarter in Waste Management's long history. As a result, our free cash flow grew almost 13% for the same comparative period despite a significant increase in cash taxes paid. The conversion rate of operating EBITDA to free cash flow has increased sequentially for the past three quarters to over 50% in the second quarter of 2017. Devina will discuss our cash flow in detail, but we exceeded our internal expectations. And we remain confident that we can meet the upper end of our full year guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. Turning to earnings per share, we generated $0.81 of EPS in the second quarter, an increase of 10.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2016. Included in that 10.4% growth were a $0.04 drag to EPS, $0.02 from an increased tax rate, $0.01 from the expiration of fuel tax credits and $0.01 from two small impairments. But even with that $0.04 of headwind, we grew EPS by $0.07 versus the second quarter of 2016. Driving strong growth in EPS, EBITDA and free cash flow with solid growth in revenue and operating income, our revenues grew by $252 million or 7.4%. And just as we saw in the first quarter, this increase was organically driven. Our income from operations grew 9.4% and margins also expanded with the income from operation margin of 30 basis points. One of the drivers of our success was the disciplined execution of our pricing programs. In the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and our yield was 1.9%. Our focus on disciplined pricing remains unchanged as demonstrated by our core price results, which are well above our full year goal. Looking at volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 3.2% in the second quarter. We continue to focus on areas of the economy that are experiencing growth, and we are retaining customers through our improved customer service. In the second quarter, the underlying volume growth in our business remains strong in the commercial, industrial, and landfill lines of business. And we also saw slight improvements in the rate of decline in our residential business. As a result, we would expect our volumes to exceed our full year goal. And as you can see, we're maintaining our price discipline, while growing our volume. So, we're hitting on all cylinders right now, with the cash-generating strength of our business shining brightly in 2017. Looking beyond 2017, we've talked recently about our strategy of bringing more technology to bear in our business and about creating a 21st Century HR organization. On the people front, we're tackling long-term opportunities like reducing driver turnover, building best-in-class leadership development, and leading in the field of training and performance management. Regarding technology, our focus there is intended to serve as a differentiator to help us continue down this path of strong organic growth. They will come in several different forms, including customer-facing technologies for e-commerce and self-service, use of big data for predictive analytics like maintenance and dynamic routing, and improvement in our cost structure over the long-term through the application of robotics and autonomy. Of course, we will not lose our focus on disciplined capital expenditures and SG&A expense control as we proceed with this long-term strategy. We plan to have a strategic leader of the technology function placed by year-end. So, to sum it up, we've had an exceptional first half of 2017 and our employees continue to execute our plans and deliver strong performance. In the second half of 2017, we expect to see the momentum from the first half continue. As a result, we expect to meet the upper end of both our full year EPS guidance of between $3.14 and $3.18, and our full year free cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter operating results in more detail. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. The fundamentals of our pricing programs, disciplined growth, and cost initiatives continue to drive income from operations and operating EBITDA growth. The combined positive price and positive volume led the total company income from operations growing $58 million, an increase of more than 9%, and operating EBITDA growing $78 million, an increase of about 8% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Looking at revenue in more detail in the second quarter, we continued to see strong organic revenue growth, as we focused on the execution of our price plans, customer service improvement, and disciplined growth. Revenues in the quarter were $3.68 billion, an increase of $252 million or 7.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter revenue growth in our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume was $158 million. Second quarter revenues also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices and increased recycling volumes, which drove a $90 million increase in recycling revenues. Fuel surcharges increased $20 million, while foreign currency fluctuations decreased revenues by $8 million, and divestitures, net of acquisitions, also decreased revenue for the quarter by $8 million. In the second quarter, looking at internal revenue growth, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and yield was 1.9%. On the volume front, total volumes were 3.4%, while traditional solid waste volumes were 3.2%. We also saw service increases exceeding service decreases for the 14th consecutive quarter, supporting continued commercial volume growth. Our year-to-date churn rate improved 10 basis points to 9%. Our collection lines of business continued to perform exceptionally well. In the second quarter, commercial core price was 7% with volumes up 2.7%, another sequential increase in growth from first quarter levels of 2.5%. Industrial core price was 8.8% with volume up 2.1% in the second quarter. In the residential line of business, core price was 2.7%, with residential volumes down 1.7% in the second quarter, but they are moving in the right direction as the residential volume is a 20 basis point sequential improvement from the first quarter of 2017. The combined price and volume increases in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing $24 million and operating EBITDA growing $26 million. In the landfill line of business, total volumes increased 8.9%; MSW volumes grew 10%; C&D volume grew 17.4%; and the combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 5.2%. On the MSW front, volumes did benefit from an outage at a Virginia Waste-to-Energy Plant. Even without that benefit, underlying MSW volume growth remains solid in the mid to high single-digits. Regarding pricing, we achieved core price of 2.5% in the landfill line of business and MSW yield was 2%, both improvements from the first quarter levels. The combined price and positive volume led the total income from operations growing $25 million, almost a 9% increase, and operating EBITDA growing $48 million, an increase of more than 11% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Turning to recycling, in the second quarter, the recycling business contributed $0.04 of EPS. And China has recently notified the WTO about a scrap import ban on certain categories of solid waste materials, including certain types of scrap plastics and unsorted waste paper. Neither of these categories should materially affect us because of our current sorting processes and capabilities. Although we do not see a material impact to our overall business, we believe this action does create further uncertainty in forecasting recycling price levels. Moving now to operating expenses, in the second quarter, total operating costs increased $160 million when compared with the second quarter of 2016. The cost increases were largely due to higher recycled commodity rebates, primarily related to our recycling brokerage business and rising fuel expenses. As Jim noted, the absence of a CNG fuel tax credit negatively impacted our EPS by slightly more than $0.01. Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points from 62.2% in the second quarter of 2016 to 62.3% in the second quarter of 2017. Combined cost of recycling rebates and higher fuel expenses increased 110 basis points as a percent of revenue. However, through efficiency gains and cost control efforts, particularly in the labor and transfer and disposal cost line, we were able to offset almost all of the increases in commodity-based costs in the quarter. Our traditional solid waste business improved operating expenses by about 70 basis points during the quarter. Thanks to the strong execution of our field and corporate teams. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, the strength of our operating results in the second quarter can be seen most directly by looking at our cash flow from operations and free cash flow. In the second quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $813 million compared to $762 million in the second quarter of 2016. That's an increase of $51 million or almost 7% in spite of an additional $83 million in cash taxes. The significant increase in cash from operations for the quarter is the result of two things : operating EBITDA growth of $78 million or about 8%, and our disciplined focus on improving our working capital metrics. We're particularly pleased with the operating leverage that we can see in our cash flow from operations conversion metrics. In the first half of 2017, our operating cash flow as a percentage of revenues has been consistently over 22%, which is a 400 basis point improvement in the measure over our long-term average. Both capital expenditures and proceeds from divestitures were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, so the growth in cash flow from operations converted straight through to free cash flow growth. We continue to expect the $100 million to $150 million increase in capital expenditures in 2017 as compared to last year, and our full year capital expenditure guidance is unchanged. Due to the timing of truck purchases and certain other project spending, we expect this increase to impact our free cash flow in the back half of the year. We generated $520 million of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $59 million or 12.8% from the second quarter of 2016. For the first half of the year, we've generated over $900 million of free cash flow, putting us well on our way to meeting the upper end of our 2017 free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. The growth in free cash flow positions us to continue to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and to fund acquisitions. In the second quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our outstanding stock, paid $187 million in dividend, and funded $41 million in tuck-in acquisitions. We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that prioritizes using 100% of our free cash flow to pay our dividend, execute strategic acquisitions, and buy back our stock. We will do this in a disciplined way to continue to deliver the best return on invested capital in the industry. Our record high free cash flow in the first half of the year and the positive outlook we have for the remainder of 2017 and beyond supports the continued execution of our capital allocation plan. And so, in the third quarter, we plan to enter into agreements to repurchase an additional $500 million of our stocks, representing our remaining current year authorization for share buyback. Our disciplined management of SG&A costs also benefited our results for the quarter. For the second quarter of 2017, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.6%, which is a 30 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2016. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $353 million in the second quarter of 2017 or $13 million higher than in the prior year period. The second quarter increase is largely attributable to revenue and earnings growth, which drove up our incentive compensation cost and commission. We are successfully offsetting some of these cost increases by improving process efficiency. And we will continue to drive down SG&A as a percent of revenue by better leveraging our fixed costs. We remain confident that for the full year, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue will approach 10%, which would represent a 40 basis point improvement compared to the full year of 2016. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants remained at 2.4 at the end of the second quarter, indicating that we have a strong balance sheet and are well positioned for strategic acquisitions at the right price. Our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 4.2% and 12% of our total debt portfolio was at variable rates. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was approximately 36.6%, which is in line with our expected full year 2017 adjusted tax rate of about 36.5%. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 34.7%. The increase in our tax rate from 2016 is largely due to growth in our pre-tax earnings, which is meeting the benefits of tax credits. The higher tax rate impacted EPS by $0.02 per share. In summary, the first half of 2017 has shown the combined value of our focus on executing our core operating objectives : generating price, growing profitable volumes, and continuous cost improvement. I want to thank all members of the Waste Management team, the best employees in the industry, as once again they have executed extremely well. They delivered fantastic results so far in 2017, and we are well on our way to achieving our 2017 goal. With that, Marcus, let's open the line for questions Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, everyone. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just a question on margins. Obviously, really strong volumes in the quarter. I was a little surprised that it didn't translate into a little bit more operating leverage. And I know you mentioned the tax credit issues on the fuel that it was a bit of a headwind and some of the recycling rebate. But I just wondered if you could dig into it a little bit more. I mean what kind of \u2013 in a normal quarter, what kind of operating margin leverage would you normally expect on that kind of volume growth and maybe kind of an outlook for margins for the full year. I think you had guided to up 50 to 100 bps. Maybe just provide an update on where you see that coming for the full year. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure, Brian. I would actually say we felt good about our margins for the quarter, and here's why. The EBITDA margins were up 10 basis points, or better by 10 basis points, but they were impacted by two factors. You mentioned the one, which was fuel tax credits. That was worth about 20 basis points to us in margin. But the other one that Jim's going to give a little bit of color on is our recycling brokerage business. And that recycling brokerage business was up over 5% in revenue, which impacted margins by 50 basis points. And so, if you exclude those two, you're talking about 70 basis points of margin accretion there. So, that's why I would say we felt good about our margins even being better by only 10 basis points on the EBITDA line. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Jim. Maybe just a couple of facts, first about the recycling business and then into that brokerage side. Overall pricing was up about 31%, volume was up 4%, as we said, and that lower margin brokerage business revenue grew about 10%. It is lower margin. It's 4% to 6% margin on that brokerage business, but it's still extremely healthy for us and good for us strategically. Just a little bit of comparison. First, the revenue is getting to be a substantial percentage of our revenue. It's significant. In fact, the brokerage business is about 2 times larger than our largest competitor's total recycling revenue. And they've got a very healthy business. This brokerage business is about 50% of our total recycling revenue, but just as important as that are the benefits of that business for us. With those additional tonnages, we're able to command a little higher price per ton when we sell all of the volume, both our [MRF]-generated tons and this brokerage volume. It provides our customers that use this recycled commodity with a really consistent and high-quality volume, and it lets us get, we think, a couple extra dollars per ton. The second thing about that brokerage business is it allows us to service these very large customers that generate this volume on a full-service basis, rather than just hauling their trash, we add some stickiness to what we do for them. And I guess the last thing I'd remind you is that these generators of this large volume in broker, they've got their own capital equipment, their balers, and they manage that volume, and we just help them sell it. So there's no capital investment to this line of business, Brian. And it helps us with what Devina said, the highest ROI in the industry. It aligns perfectly with that. And this business is almost an infinite ROI, given no capital associated with it. So, if I'd summarize, Jim's right, we see that 70 basis points improvement without this and that fuel tax issue. This is a really healthy business for us. If you look at one last factor maybe that we were looking at recently, if you remove that brokerage business, our overall WM Waste Management's EBITDA margin would be about 120 basis points higher, would be about 29.2% in the second quarter, again, without that brokerage business, yet, we're going to stay in that business. It's the right thing to do for our customers and very strategic for us, and it's just good business. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, to follow-on with the 50 to 100 basis point margin improvement that you referenced, when we think about that, it really was going to come from two places, and we're seeing both execution in both of those things in the first half of the year. And we expect that to continue. And the two places that was going to come from, and we're seeing results, are core solid waste business improvement to operating expense margin; and then secondarily, SG&A cost control driving margin improvement there. So, what Jim and Jim just described was a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin for our core solid waste operations, and then we saw a 30 basis point improvement in our SG&A cost in the quarter. So, those two things together get us to the top end of that 50 to 100 basis point range. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks. And one more if I could. One of your competitors this morning was talking a lot about a big pickup in acquisition opportunities in the industry. And it seems like it could be a little bit of a change from the trend that we've been on the last couple of years, for whatever reasons. Parsing your comments and maybe some of the actions with the pivot towards the share repo in a bigger way over 2Q and 3Q, maybe just kind of comment on how you see the M&A environment these days, and if you've perceived a similar kind of change over the last quarter or two. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I mean, I think the acquisition landscape is pretty healthy right now and our pipeline is pretty healthy right now, too. We're going to talk about several today, in fact. So, I think you'll see us \u2013 we've always kind of talked about our normal tuck-ins ranging between $100 million and $200 million. Last year, we were towards the lower end of that range. I would tell you, Brian, that this year we'll be at the higher end of that range. So, I wouldn't disagree with what one of our counterparts said about the M&A landscape. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just if you could just outline whether 100 bps further opportunity on customer churn is realistic and where do you think that improvement comes from? Thank you. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Hamzah, good to hear from you. I do think there's upside in our defection rate, 9% year-to-date basis improved about 10 basis points. We've made real strides in two parts of that. First, the core service delivery. We are really focused on our quality of service metric across all of our lines of business, and our areas are starting to clearly show that improvement that we expect in just the core delivery of what our customers pay for, and that'll continue, but that's a long-range impact to it, because we still deliver exceptional service and yet we want to get better. The other side to it, Hamzah, or at least one other side, is some of the electronic e-commerce opportunities that we have. Our customers, at least segments of them, want more online capability, and we're doing a pretty good job of providing that. And as Jim mentioned earlier, we've got plans to really ramp that up and look at more opportunity to differentiate our offering to our customers. As you know, Hamzah, our customer segments are extremely wide from a open market residential customer, all the way up to the largest companies in the Fortune 100. So, their expectations vary across that segment basis, and we are finding things that we can do to improve that. But part of it is just that core discipline of service and then how we handle their questions when they call in. Our call centers are doing a really good job of focusing on answering their questions on the first call. We're making real strides there, but still connected with our field operating team. So, I do see upside improvement continuing in that defection rate. One quarter here or there, maybe a vary, but over time, you'll see that number get better and better. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And then, just on free cash flow, the conversion is higher than history. How sustainable is that free cash flow conversion metric as you look out longer term? And where is it coming from? Is it working capital? I know CapEx is lumpy, but any color as to how sustainable that conversion rate is. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: You're exactly right, Hamzah. With the free cash flow conversion that we saw in the second quarter, what we're really focused on is the positive trend that we're seeing of conversion, of revenue dollars, EBITDA dollars to free cash flow. We tend to focus more on the cash flow from operation piece because of the lumpiness of capital expenditures and just timing differences that can affect that. Our capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, we still target that at about 9% to 10% of revenue. And we were a little below that in the second quarter. And if you were to have normalized that, we would have still seen some really positive flow-through and continued execution of our focus on taking revenue dollars and putting them through to the bottom line, but what we think is important is to look at that cash flow from operations metric. And as I said, that increased to over 22% of revenue in the quarter and for the full year. And when we look at what's driving that, it's two things. It's operating EBITDA growth and it's our focus on working capital. We do think that the focus on working capital will continue to provide us benefits, but we're more focused on that core solid waste operating performance, driving free cash flow and cash from operations growth over the long-term. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Hamzah, one thing I would add to this, and we've given some long answers to the first two questions here from you and Brian, but I think it's worth really addressing this. But Devina is absolutely right about this. I mean, it is the biggest components of free cash flow that's actually driving it, which is EBITDA. I mean, growing EBITDA by 8% organically is no easy task. And if you back up the line from there, growing revenue by 7.4% in an economy that's kind of a 1.5% or 2% economy, and doing all that with organic growth, to me, is really impressive. And you may \u2013 you look at revenue. Even if you took out commodity price completely, if you said, okay, fine, but you're growing your revenue, come on, take it out, take that out completely, we still grew revenue organically by 4.1% in a 1.5% or 2% economy, double or 2.5 times the economy. So, the fact that this is all translating down into free cash \u2013 cash from operations and then free cash is not surprising to us, but we're really pleased with the fact that these big financial metrics that we focus on are performing as well as they are. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. That's very helpful. Just a follow-up and I'll turn it over. Historically, yourself and the sector has raised guidance on the second quarter based on seasonality of volumes that when you first give guidance, you don't have visibility on. It seems like things are coming in better than expected relative to the start of the year. And so I'm just curious, how conservative is your guidance, because you've left it unchanged? Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, we really didn't leave it unchanged. We said the guidance is a range. So, if you think about EPS, for example, $3.14 to $3.18, it's a range. And now, we've said we'll be at the top end of the range. So, if you assume that when we give the range, we're kind of in the middle at kind of $3.16, then we're saying we're \u2013 in effect we're raising guidance to the top end of the range, and you could say the same about free cash flow. So, what we'll do, though, is at the end of Q3 is reassess and look at the first three quarters and decide are we going to exceed the top end of the range or are we still comfortable at the top end, where we are now. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Understood. Thanks so much. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions from me. So, Devina, on the SG&A guidance to get to 10% for the year. So, I think in the first half of the year, you had 20 basis points of improvements, so you need to do better than 40 basis points improvement at the back half to get there. So, if you can just talk about kind of the levers and how you get to that greater leverage? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, as a reminder, in the first quarter, we had a couple of headwinds on a year-over-year basis that aren't going to repeat throughout the remainder of the year. And those two things were severance costs and then a higher year-over-year comparison in how we accrue our incentive compensation costs. And so when you normalize for those two things and think about really what we demonstrated in more of a normal quarter and second quarter, we are confident that we'll get better performance in the third and fourth quarters than what you've seen in the first half of the year. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: So, I understand it and I appreciate the reminder on the Q1 headwinds. But on a dollar basis, I think the SG&A dollars will actually be down year-over-year in the back half. So, I was hoping maybe you could just give us a little more detail on kind of where the cost savings are coming from incrementally from what you've seen so far this year. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure. So, a piece of that incentive compensation accrual in the first part of the year has to do with a timing difference that will benefit the fourth quarter. And so that is a piece of this. But then, as I mentioned, we're seeing some process efficiency opportunities that continue to give us confidence that we're going to be able to reduce some of our general overhead costs, as we look for more efficient ways to carry out processes, things we've mentioned in the past, our call volumes as an example. And as we're driving more and more customers to do business with us through the e-commerce platform, we're able to reduce the number of calls that come to our call centers. And things like that are going to reduce our costs over \u2013 both the second half of the year and as we look forward. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Okay, helpful. And then on the volume side, I think I went back to my model, I think this is the best volume number you've reported since 2004. And it doesn't sound like as you broke down the components that was really event driven. So, I realize the comps gets tougher as the year goes on, but can you talk about kind of the sustainability of these kinds of levels, closer to 3%? And should we \u2013 understand, you'll be above the guidance for the year, but should we expect that it could be kind of this strong as the year continues? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. What I would say, our volume \u2013 and Jim, you can add some color to this, too, but one thing that's pleasing to us about volume is that it's not just a big lump that we're seeing here. If you look at commercial volumes, commercial volumes have improved every quarter since Q2 of 2014, so a fairly long string of improvement that we're seeing. It's not as if we're seeing a big lump all in Q2. The roll-off business has been recently strong for the last seven quarters. Resi has shown \u2013 albeit still in the red, but resi has shown volume improvement for five consecutive quarters. And then, the landfills, Jim talked about MSW, C&D volumes being very strong, and special waste maybe being \u2013 the combination of special waste and revenue-generating cover was the lowest number on the page. And that one probably has some opportunity and we feel good about our special waste pipeline at this point. So, I think the fact that volume has been on this consistent upward trend is really the encouraging part for me. I'd be a little more concerned about it as being one-time if we saw a big blip in second quarter, but we really didn't. It's just been a gradual increase in all lines of business. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Corey, the only \u2013 a couple of color items just I'd note. At landfill growth, we did get the benefit of that Virginia Waste-To-Energy Plant that was down. So, we received a pretty healthy amount of volume from it in the first half of the year. But even without that, as I mentioned, we still would have grown MSW volumes in that mid single-digit range. So, very healthy, given, as Jim pointed out, the economy situation. So, we're pleased with that. And you'll see \u2013 should see landfill volumes stay, again, without that one line item, in that mid single-digit range. Commercial volumes, we're net positive in both number and dollars on a sell/loss basis. So, our sales teams and customer service teams are all doing exceptionally well in that regard. And that'll help that permanent industrial or even commercial volume. The one reminder is that in the second half of last year, we added two pretty large national account customers that were almost exclusively commercial business. So the comps on the commercial side will get really difficult in the second half of the year. But excluding that large national account, you'll see the day-to-day commercial business continue to be strong. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Got it. Really helpful, and then just one last quick one is the tech question. As you talk about some of the things you can do with AI, for example, is that \u2013 build versus buy, are there third-party vendors who provide that or you expect to do that internally, or is that still TBD? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: No, there are third-party vendors. Technology for us encompasses a number of different items including things like, as you say, AI. AI is kind of a longer-term opportunity for us when we think about robotics or autonomy. I think in the short-term, what you're seeing is us spending our kind of innovative time on customer-facing technologies such as the ones that Jim mentioned, e-commerce and self-service, and then also on big data for the use in our pricing tools and in things like predictive maintenance and routing and logistics. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: And I'm just wondering if those kinds of data things could ultimately be a strategic \u2013 like a competitive advantage for you, maybe not relative to the other big players, relative to the mom and pops, enables you to price more intelligently or do maintenance more intelligently in a way that gives you a strategic cost or revenue advantage? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I think you're right. I think it's \u2013 and I think you're also right that this eventually ends up being something that we see across the larger companies. But the smaller companies, it will be a differentiator for us. But we think we're the leader in the industry and in technology, and we continue to invest that way. We're spending somewhere between $100 million to $150 million in tax spend each year. We're putting somebody \u2013 a leader in that position, the Chief Technology Officer position, by the end of the year. So, we see technology as a differentiator for us within the industry, but I do think over the long-term, it probably ends up being more versus the smaller companies. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And, Corey, one last point that I want to go back to your first question on the volume side. And just a reminder, as I did that national account comp problem for the second half of this year, we do have two less work days in the second half of this year than prior year. So, that permanent business like roll-off, the roll-off line of business, but also our landfill could be affected. But the trends and the absolute core nature of the business is still really positive. Those two items will have an impact on the second half volume. That's why big Jim mentioned that we are guiding you to the upper end of our range, which was I think 1.2% to 1.6% for the second half of the year, but still really strong. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good news about fewer work days is, it actually is a positive for us on the bottom line. It just is not going to show up as a positive on a year-over-year comp basis in terms of absolutes. But on the bottom line, it ends up being a positive for us having fewer work days. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Is that, by the way, one day each in Q3 and Q4 or two in one of the quarters? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: It's like 1.7 days in Q4 and 0.3 days in Q3. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great, very helpful. Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Question on your free cash flow. So, you talked about you're going to do $500 million in repurchases this quarter, you did $250 million. Can you just remind us what's left in that authorization after that? And then, your leverage is at about 2.4 times. How do you feel about your leverage there? Would you guys be looking at taking on some debt, I think just given your healthy free cash flow at this point? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, our authorization for the current year was $750 million. So, the $500 million that we'll spend in the third quarter will take us to 100% of that authorization. We'll continue to look at our free cash flow allocation as we discuss future authorizations with the board going forward. And we typically do that in the fourth quarter. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: With regard to our leverage, 2.4 times is low historically when you look at Waste Management, but what we focus on is the fact that that's a healthy balance sheet that positions us for opportunity. And so we don't anticipate that we're going to reduce our debt balances in absolute dollars, but you could see the leverage balance, or the leverage metric reduce over time as EBITDA continues to grow. We really see opportunistic balance sheet \u2013 a well-structured balance sheet as something that gives us opportunity to look for strategic M&A that's priced well. And we think that that combined with our free cash flow really positions us to execute upon that if it presents itself. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, just given what you guys said about your M&A probably hitting the higher end of that $200 million spend, that would imply that you're just looking at some smaller type tuck-ins. But are you seeing anything opportunistic in terms of a larger-type deal? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I mean, there are obviously a few of those than the tuck-ins. And once you get to larger deals, then we, because of our size, have to consider HSR filings and things like that. So, it's not to say that there aren't deals out there of larger size. They involve more efforts for us from a justice perspective. Doesn't mean they're not good. We've done three of them over the last four years. But for now, we're focused on those tuck-ins. And then, as those other opportunities present themselves, I think that's really Devina's point is that the balance sheet gives us the ability to do those. The $100 million to $200 million just comes out of free cash flow, but if you start thinking about bigger deals, you have a balance sheet that's able to easily absorb bigger deals. Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe we could start with the recycling line of business. So, obviously, the China policy, the notification to the WTO, that's all relatively recent. I wonder how do you think about the potential impact on the recycling business as a whole, maybe, in particular, the brokerage part of the business, because it does seem like what's going to be restricted, in particular, a certain categories of plastics. So not sure how that flows through to kind of the brokerage line of business. What do you think may change in terms of kind of the overall throughput going through that part of the business? And then, what might you have to do just in terms of reconfiguring the business to respond? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Noah, great question. Good timing for it. But remember that our brokerage business is almost entirely fiber and not plastics-related. So, we see no impact from a plastics standpoint on the brokerage business with China's action. It's really going to be a fiber and then some plastics, but, again, not brokerage-related. It's because of the way we sort the mixed paper and we do it today. We sort every bit of the mixed paper we receive. We don't see a material impact to what we export on that side. And that's one of their real focus is. The other are plastics that are out of the norm. It's not a large part of what we export. So, we, as of now, don't see a significant impact to either part of that business, but that's still to be determined. It looks like China is really trying to help, from an environmental standpoint. It's not just related to recycle tools, but they're looking to help their internal businesses, probably perhaps to reduce or to manage price a little bit, but also to clean up some of the imported materials that they receive. Given what we do and what we see today, we just don't see a significant impact. Yet, as I mentioned, we're not ready to forecast price until we see \u2013 have a little more clarity into Q3. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: But they are the \u2013 Jim, China is the big buyer in the market. So, when they start tinkering with policies that could impact commodity prices, we have to be increasingly aware of that. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And so just in terms of how we think about the outlook for the rest of the year, are you assuming sort of a more kind of normalized dip in OCC prices? I mean, obviously, we're at elevated levels now. How should we think about kind of how you're thinking about the pricing environment? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. It's hard to predict. I wish I had a crystal ball here because, remember, back at the end of Q1, we had just finished with a really good quarter. And all of a sudden, China comes out and does something kind of crazy, and prices for OCC dropped to 25% or 30% in a period of a week. So, it is - Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Right. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: And we don't have a lot of ability to hedge ourselves there. The markets are pretty thinly traded. So, it's a bit hard to predict. What I would say though about the back half of the year with respect to commodity prices is that comparisons do get more difficult, particularly as you get into Q4. Last year, you may recall that we talked about the normal kind of seasonal decline in commodity prices that you tend to see from Q3 to Q4, and that we did not see in 2016. I'm not sure that we are expecting a repeat of that. I think you probably will see it as a normal seasonal decline in commodity prices after they've done all of their kind of Christmas and holiday buying. So, we think that Q4, in particular, has more difficult comps on commodity prices, but the rest of businesses doing so well and even the recycling business on the cost side is doing so well that we're still very comfortable with going to the top end of our range, as we mentioned earlier. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great, great. Thanks. And if I could just sneak one more in? Jim, you mentioned at the outset, you will be looking to bring on a Chief Technology Officer by the end of the year. It seems as though there are already a number of internal improvement initiatives related to technology under way. You mentioned the e-commerce platform, these predictive maintenance efforts. Maybe just if we could better understand kind of what the type of profile of that person coming in might look like and really what their provenance is going to be over the next several years? Are they \u2013 is this person more kind of geared to some of these longer term initiatives around robotics automation? Just how should we better think about that as aligning with the company's strategic initiatives? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good finishing question there. I would tell you, we're not looking for a Chief Information Officer. We're not looking for somebody to come in and who has a strong \u2013 necessarily a strong IT background to come in and look at things like data structures and systems integrations and things like that. We think we have a really good team internally to do that, and we're in the process of doing that already. We're in the process of consolidating data. We're in the process of looking where we have data overlap and making sure that we establish data consistency and eliminating some of our applications where we have multiple applications that sometimes do the same thing. So, we're not necessarily looking in this new Chief Technology Officer for a more traditional Chief Information Officer. We're looking for somebody that has an understanding of \u2013 if not our business directly, an understanding of this type of routing or logistics-type business in general that also can bring some innovation to bear on those newer types of technologies \u2013 not just data, we've talked a lot about data, but as you mentioned, robotics technology, and then longer term working with our organic growth group on things like autonomy. I mean, we think that autonomy is \u2013 particularly as we think about the collection side of our business is a longer term aspiration for us because while the technology is moving forward, there is a big difference between where the technology is and where the public perception and government regulation is. But all of those we do think will eventually come to our industry. In the near-term, we're going to be focusing this person more on those customer-facing technologies, e-commerce and self-service, and then better use of data to make us as efficient as we can be. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. I guess I'm going to have to say big Jim and little Jim and Devina. Is that what I heard, Jim Trevathan? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: I've been called worse. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. The waste energy volume that was going to a landfill in Virginia, is that stock coming? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: No. It hasn't, Michael. If we had to crystal ball it today, end of September, middle of September, early in, but that depends obviously on them getting back online out of our . Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then, I am absolute believer that your solid waste \u2013 underlying fundamental solid waste business you've been saying it had margin expansion. So, bear with me, this is a little bit laborious. But if I took $3.677 billion of revenues and subtract that $375 million and take $1.29 billion of EBITDA and subtract that $48 million, that's taking it all out, that's a 29.7% margin. If I do the same thing on the prior year, you're at 29.04%. Do you disagree with any of that? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: I can tell you that I - Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Conceptually. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You're giving us a lot of credit for following all those numbers - Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. I can't tell you that I followed the numbers specifically, but I can tell you that the 70 basis point improvement is the number that we have calculated internally. So that math seems to work for us. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I mean, the important statement is that you have real-life, honest-to-goodness leverage, but another way to look at it is you grew revenue 7.4%, you grew free cash flow \u2013 you grew EBITDA 7.8%, so there's 40 basis points there. You grew free cash flow even stronger. So, whether the absolute margin of the whole company reports more than more narrow impressions, there's more leverage here than people appreciate. That's why the cash conversation is so important. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Absolutely. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, that's why, Michael, in all of our scripts, we spend a lot of time talking about cash today because it is \u2013 you're absolutely right, I mean, the cash \u2013 the conversion here is impressive. And so, not only is the conversion price, but the absolute numbers themselves. That's why I talked about revenue growing at 7.4%. I mean, all of these numbers are kind of 2, 3, 4 times the overall economy. But you're absolutely right, the conversion is impressive. But the margins \u2013 and we didn't want to lose sight of that, the margin strength of the business is there. It just was masked a little bit by \u2013 in particular, by these two items that Jim talked about, which was the brokerage side of our business and the loss of the tax credit. It's, Michael, why I went through that brokerage business and the recycling business overall is to clearly show not just its impact on margin and how great, I think, the core business is operating, but it's also to show us all that there's value in that recycling and commodity \u2013 or brokerage side of that business to the overall network. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. So, now, to be fair and balanced about this, at 1.9% reported price, that's below your own internal inflation. So, help me understand where \u2013 either that total reported number can go or how I should look at the mix of that number, this is around the solid waste business, to appreciate that you're not fighting a spread to your own internal inflation, which is probably somewhere between 2% and 2.5%. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, so, keep in mind, first of all, we said we'd be a 2% yield company and we're at 1.9%. So, we're pretty darn close. But keep in mind that the yield calculation really is \u2013 and you know this, but the yield calculation is a unit rate comparison that includes the impact on unit rate of new business. So, by definition, when you bring new business on, and we're obviously bringing new business on when you look at our volume numbers, it has a dampening effect on unit rate comps. I mean, no matter how good that business is, and our sales team, and led by Jim and all of his lieutenants, when they look at new business, they are very much looking at bringing good new business on, but the fact of the matter is that that new business has not gone through a price increase. And we have customers that have been with us for 10, 15 years that have gone through a price increase every year. So, by definition, that new business will have a dampening effect on unit rate comps, which is why we focus on not just yield, but we focus on core price. We think core price is probably \u2013 well, not probably, is a far better representation of the price increases that we take on our core business and the rollbacks and the fees, and that, to us, is the best kind of corollary, I guess, to what's happening with our cost structure. You're right, our cost structure is going up more than 1.9%, but our core price has gone up by 4.7%. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Michael, you just take \u2013 Jim said, new business that he mentioned, you just look at the increased revenue, even take the brokerage side out or the recycling out, and Jim's 4.1% revenue growth that he mentioned, excluding that commodity issue. Just with that growth alone, there's an impact to yield because we are increasing current customers, not increasing those new customers until they anniversary after a year. So, it's just a mathematical issue that's going to reduce yield to some extent because of the revenue growth. The other couple of just factoids about it, almost 70% of our locations had greater than 2% yield and they overcame that. It's a mix issue in a few of our areas that struggled in that quarter, but not related to a business strategy issue, just pure mix issue. If you look at our new business, both commercial and industrial new business came on at a higher unit rate than previous year's quarter. Our lost business was up slightly on the industrial side. That's that mix issue. It had a impact to yield, but every line of business had an average unit rate on a same-store basis higher than the previous year's quarter. So, we have not taken our eye off of yield or price strategy, when you look at that 3.2% volume. In fact, it's just the opposite. We are executing core price above our internal and our external targets. And that's how we measure ourselves. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And, Michael, I think \u2013 part of the conversation with flow-through of that revenue growth through to the bottom line, whether it be the EBITDA measures or the free cash flow measures. And so, what you can see is that this volume growth is coming in with very strong flow-through in both the collection and landfill lines of business and providing revenue growth that is so accretive from a margin expansion perspective and generating a free cash flow conversion that we expect. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, just so I summarize, one of the things I'm hearing, which is what I hope, is that you are participating and possibly even gaining share against new business growth that is coming in at an incremental unit of measure greater than historically, but it has dampened the overall. And that's how we should think about it is the power of the new business growth. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: That is exactly right. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And as \u2013 when we were losing volume, and without a lot of new business growth years ago, that it helped that yield calculation, but it didn't help the business. We are helping the business by focusing on both core price, executing that plan, and growing volume on a disciplined basis. You see that in the flow-through, both free cash and in EBITDA. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. On the technology side, when you think about dynamic routing and you look at it today, what do you think the potential to either measures, things like number of miles driven, how much could be reduced or total hours \u2013 operating hours of the trucks reduced because of the success of what a dynamic routing system could do. And over the long haul, this is going to come in small bites, I understand, steady improvement. What's the scope of something like that, or on predictive maintenance, thinking about \u2013 I'm assuming it's about avoiding the unscheduled downtime, which leads to labor increases and increase in R&M inflation, but I also think it has to do with these aftermarket parts or OEM parts as the aftermarket's cheaper, but do you replace it more often, all that kind of stuff. Help me understand some of that. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, I would tell you, Michael, I'm not sure we've fully quantified the number to be able to answer your question sufficiently. What I will say about both technology on dynamic routing and on maintenance is this. I'll talk to maintenance first. We do think that when you have to reactively repair a vehicle, it's probably 1.5 to 2 times as expensive as proactively repairing it, because when you have a vehicle breakdown on the road, you've got other costs in there. You simply don't have \u2013 you don't have towing cost if you're proactively repairing it. You don't have the overtime cost for the driver. You don't have a \u2013 and by the way, that 1.5 to 2 times does not include the impact to the customer. So, while we haven't gone through and quantified that impact yet on more of a macro basis, we do believe that moving much more towards predictive or proactive, however you want to talk about it, maintenance is a big efficiency and cost improver for us. And then on to routing and logistics, we talked about routing and logistics a lot over the last of couple of years with our SDO initiative, but most of the improvement that we've made has been on the front-end of the day and the back-end of the day for the driver. So, the front-end of the day being their pre-trip and the back-end of the day being their post-trip, we really believe we have established almost complete unanimity there within our systems, that being our districts. But within the middle of the day, which is the route itself, only about 30% of our routes are truly dynamically routed. And so we feel like we've got some real opportunity left within our routing and logistics to pick up some incremental dollars. As you recall, a couple of years ago, we valued that at about $100 million improvement. So, when we started talking about this maybe four years ago, we thought it was about $100 million in improvement that we would get from routing and logistics. And so we've certainly seen a piece of that with the improvement in the pre-trip and the post-trip, but we think there still is opportunity. I would tell you, we're kind of in the ninth inning or at the end of the game with respect to \u2013 maybe we're never at the end of the game, but we're in the ninth inning with respect to the pre-trip and post-trip. We're still in the fifth inning or the fourth inning with respect to pulling the most efficiencies out of the route itself. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Michael, I would \u2013 just a couple of comments there. I mean, we had to go through all of that effort to put onboard computers on every truck and create the management team at the local level that can handle that information and can try to begin to then manage through process their way through that to get to middle of the route improvements. So, that's done. Our districts, right now, 98% do certify that they have the mindset and the skill set in place and are getting efficiency. We had another quarter where the three lines of business, when you combine them, had positive efficiency. I think that's eight or nine in a row now of quarters on a combined basis that are efficient. We haven't had that in a long time. So, we started with that onboard computer. We measure \u2013 as you brought out, we measure miles per route at the local level, at the national level, at the area level today by line of business and are starting to see improvement. But it is the execution in the middle of the day that'll bring that on, and there's some technology that we're looking at adding that's not huge dollars. This is just taking what we have and leveraging it better to get more efficiency improvement than what we've had, but it's part of that margin impact was the efficiency that we've already begun to see. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then lastly on autonomous vehicle, just to put this in perspective. I mean, we're a long way from having a local government having define the rules that would allow a 24-ton residential truck to go down the road. So, that the early wins here might be in off-road applications like inside a transfer station or landfill compaction equipment before we see a commercial vehicle going down on a res \u2013 and it's probably only residential collection this applies to anyway. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. That's right. I mean, look, we're working with... Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: ... both heavy equipment and heavy truck manufacturing partners, but it's really on an R&D basis. And in the short-term, we're going to test an autonomous vehicle in one of our landfills in one of our MRFs probably within the next 12 months. But as I mentioned, and you said as well, that putting an autonomous vehicle on a collection route and I would like to be a residential route, is a much longer term aspiration for us because of that public perception and government regulation. I mean, the technology I think is moving pretty quickly there, but public perception and government regulation have to catch up with that. And I just can't predict when that's going to happen. I think that's a longer term aspiration for us on our collection business. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, it's not unlike the airlines. I mean, the A380 or the \u2013 most of these airplanes can take off and land all by themselves. I'm not sure I'd get on the plane if I didn't think there was a pilot and a copilot sitting in the seat. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You and I are in the same boat there. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Last question on recycling, does the China Certification & Inspection Group come and do site inspections for you, so this whole issue about the WTO, as it really relates to your business, is a whole lot about nothing, because, one, your quality is there with you process; two, you do on-site inspections, and therefore \u2013 and they need the paper. There's a true demand side for this. So, this is directed at Europe and the really bad quality that's been showing up. Basically, all the residuals are being bundled into the bales and sent over to China. And then, China has finally said, enough. And they try doing green fence sword and now they're doing it with the WTO. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: You're right on all fronts, Michael. The one caveat I would add is that we want to see what they have written and see it in action. But, yes, we do certify ourselves. We are authorized to certify that we are meeting the specs, and we expect that to continue right on all fronts. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. And then, Devina, could you give us \u2013 what was your commodity bundle price in 2Q 2017 and then 3Q 2016, 4Q 2016, so we can understand that comparison, just to put in perspective? And my belief is there's this lower number than even what was 2Q 2017 is in guidance. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, we were at about $130 a ton on an average basis in the first part of the year. I don't have last year's numbers at my fingertips, but Ed will be happy to get those to you. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think you said volumes \u2013 you mentioned how volumes are exceeding your full year goal. So, if you could remind us of what the full year goal on the volumes was? And you also said, I believe, core prices above your internal target. Since you're kind of coming in ahead of these internal targets, can you just give us the puts and takes of what's actually holding back the guide then? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: What's holding back the guidance? Is that what you said? Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Yes, with the fact that the volumes and core price are actually turning ahead of your internal targets James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, so two things. One was, just to give you the numbers, the guidance for volume was 1.2% to 1.6%. And we said we'll be at the high end of that or above that actually, that 1.6%. And then, core price, I think, was 4% - James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Close to 4%. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: 4%. So, I would tell you that with respect to guidance, as we said earlier, we are effectively raising guidance here because of the fact that we gave a range initially, and now we're saying we're not going to be in the range. When you give a range, it kind of implies that the middle is what your actual number is, but you're going to give yourself a little wiggle room on both sides. Now, by saying we'll be at the top end of that range, we have in effect raised guidance from the middle to the top. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And what I would point out is the fuel tax credits that we've talked about all year, that's a $0.04 impact on a year-over-year basis that was not included in our guidance for the year. So, that is an element of softness that we didn't anticipate. But if you back out the impact of the impairment and the fuel tax credit on the second quarter, our EPS growth was 12% on a year-over-year basis. So, we certainly are happy with the performance. And as Jim said, $3.18 EPS target for the year is definitely an optimistic view compared to where we started this year when we set guidance. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That helps. That makes sense. And even with the $3.18, I think that implies the second half of the year should contribute around 56% to your full year EPS \u2013 sorry, it contributes around 53%, 54%. I think I'm going to go back to 2010, the second half is closer to 56%, 57%. Is there just anything we should be aware of like the waiting of second half that maybe it's a little lighter this year than it is in the last prior five years? Is it with recycling perhaps? I'm just trying to get an idea of how to think about that. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, we certainly \u2013 it's interesting because we look at that same math. And when we look at 2017 and how it compares to 2016, the year-over-year comparison, you're spot on that it's most difficult in doing that math and just applying it consistently on a year-over-year basis, is the recycling impacts that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. And the recycling benefits have been more heavily weighted toward the first half of this year. And so, it's difficult to just apply that math in the current year without adjusting for the recycling impact. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Exactly. It just wouldn't be accurate, especially the fourth quarter where the comps will not be anywhere near the same as the first two and even third quarter. The comp will be very difficult for Q4 for recycling commodity prices. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That makes sense. And then just my last question. Obviously, there's a lot of conversations about significant M&A. Are you finding valuation multiples high or maybe too demanding? Is there any view internally that you guys are willing to perhaps wait on the sidelines and just have the strongest balance sheet in the industry when the cycle turns down, and maybe focus more on returning cash through dividends and repurchasing, and just wait on the sidelines if the multiple is too high? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think we've done some waiting. I don't think we really changed our approach, though. Our approach has been that we want to be \u2013 that whoever we look at as an acquisition candidates for us, it has to be properly priced based on our analysis and then it has to be the right strategic business for us to acquire. And that's been our approach for as long as I've been here in Houston. To answer your first question, our expectation is high. I would say they might be a little higher. I'm not sure they're high. I think they're a little higher just because you've seen our multiples creep up. The big three, within our industry, multiples have crept up a little bit. And so, as a consequence, some of these folks that we're looking to acquire are not blind to that. But that doesn't change our approach, which is that we want \u2013 we want these companies to meet or exceed our expectations from a financial perspective. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And we continue to prioritize return on invested capital when we make those decisions. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Right. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. And just lastly, I mean, you mentioned a lot about the trend you're seeing in Q2 and the strength. Just quickly, has that continued through to July? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You're talking about volume or - Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Yes. Like volume, C&D, and what you guys are seeing there. Have you felt like the trends have continued through to July? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. We're pleased with July margins so far. Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for sneaking me in. Just one quick one. Your internalization of waste percentage went up, and I think it's the highest we've seen in a couple of years. Can you just give us a little bit more color how you're getting there and how high you think that'll go? Thanks. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. When I looked at internalization earlier, we were \u2013 it's pretty much the same number. And that being that the \u2013 when we think about internalization, is the percentage that we \u2013 actually, that we collect, that we didn't turn around and take to our sites is about 66.5%. And it's been in that 66% range since as far back as I was looking, which was 2010. So, it hasn't changed dramatically. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I'll follow-up offline. Thanks so much. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions. And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Fish. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you. Producing these levels of organic growth in almost every financial metric that are 2, 3, even 4 times the overall growth of North American economies can only be done through the collective efforts of our team of 42,000 people. And every day that passes for me in this CEO job, I'm more and more amazed by this team's dedication, innovation, work ethic, and their willingness to change. So, thank you to all of Waste Management's 42,000 team members for this performance. And thank you to all of you for joining us this morning. We'll talk to you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us this morning. In a quarter where two of our biggest operating areas were heavily impacted by hurricanes, our employees maintained their focus on servicing our customers, improving core price, growing profitable volume and controlling costs to produce arguably the best quarter Waste Management has had in its history. Our operating EBITDA grew by about 7% in the quarter to $1.071 billion when compared to the third quarter of 2016. This is the second consecutive quarter of record operating EBITDA. The strong operating EBITDA continued to translate into free cash flow at a conversion rate of almost 50%. And as a result, our free cash flow grew more than 18% for the same comparative period, despite an increase in cash taxes paid and capital spending. Devina will discuss our cash flow in detail. But based upon our performance through the first nine months of the year, we are raising our full year free cash flow guidance. Our new guidance range is $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion, up from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. We generated $0.90 of EPS in the third quarter, an increase of 7.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2016. In that EPS number was a $0.01 negative impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma and a $0.01 drag from the expiration of fuel tax credits. Despite these $0.02 of headwinds, we grew EPS by $0.06 versus the third quarter of 2016. Given our strong earnings performance, we are raising our full year 2017 guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share. Our new guidance range is $3.19 to $3.21, up from $3.14 to $3.18. As we saw in the second quarter, our strong growth in EPS, EBITDA and free cash flow was driven by solid growth in revenue and operating income. Our revenues grew by $168 million or 4.7%. The majority of the revenue growth was from yield and volume growth in our traditional solid waste business. In addition, the recycling line of business contributed $52 million to our revenue growth. We continue to focus on disciplined pricing as demonstrated by core price continuing to exceed our full year target. In the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and our yield was 2%. Our strong pricing led to income from operations growing 8.3% and income from operations margin improving 60 basis points. On the recycling front, the third quarter was solid in spite of commodity price pressure we started to see late in the quarter. Our recycling earnings grew a little more than $0.01 per share when compared to the third quarter of 2016. While prices remained strong for most of the quarter, up 26.5% year-over-year, we were impacted on the volume side, primarily due to the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, where some of our customers' recycling programs continue to be temporarily suspended. As a result, our tons sold in September were at the lowest level that we've seen in seven years and third quarter recycled MRF tons declined 9.1%. There are several issues that could impact recycling results in the fourth quarter and the early part of 2018. In July, China announced to the World Trade Organization that they were going to ban 24 materials from import into China beginning in 2018. However, this ban is expected to have a minimal impact to Waste Management given the materials that we export to China. In September, our Chinese mill customers informed us that the government was not issuing additional import licenses for recycled materials such as newsprint and cardboard. Since China has been a large customer of recycled materials, this has put the global recycling industry in a bind and forced processors around the world to find alternative markets for materials we collect every day. Thanks to our recycling group's expertise and global relationships, we've been able to leverage alternative recycling markets outside of China to further de-risk the business. Recycling is a key service offering for our customers. And I'm proud to say that our customers' materials received at our MRFs have been processed and not warehoused or landfilled as a result of this disruption. For the fourth quarter, the month of October has seen a significant drop in pricing and we now expect a negative $0.03 impact in the quarter from our recycling operations on a year-over-year basis. However, we do not expect the low pricing in October to become a new normal and while we typically would not give 2018 guidance at this time, based upon current market conditions, we expect to see a $0.04 decline in recycling earnings in 2018 when compared to 2017, heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Our recycling team has worked hard to ensure we have a sound business model and that business will continue to generate strong return on invested capital. These market conditions continue to evolve and fluctuate and we will update our assumptions when we give 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. As we've mentioned on previous calls, we've been looking for a strategic leader of our technology function. The digital era in which we all live affords us tremendous opportunities to grow our business, make it easier for our customers to do business with us using tools and platforms that meet their needs and make us more efficient than we are today. To that end, I'm very pleased to announce that Nikolaj Sjoqvist has been promoted to the new role of Chief Digital Officer. Nikolaj held the position of Vice President of Revenue Management for six years. Prior to coming to Waste Management, he spent five years with McKinsey and Company and 10 years with Compaq HP. Nikolaj has developed an in-depth knowledge of our business, customers, systems and operations. He is a firm believer in the use of data, analytics and customer insights, all of which will be important components of our company-wide digital strategy. I have no doubt that he is the right leader to take us on this new and important journey. To sum it up, we've performed very well during the first nine months of 2017. And in our third quarter, we delivered an impressive $0.10 diluted earnings per share year-over-year improvement in our traditional solid waste business. Looking into the fourth quarter, despite an anticipated negative $0.03 per diluted share impact from our recycling operations, we are raising our full-year guidance. We're confident that our employees will continue to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter and into 2018. I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter operating results in more detail. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim and good morning. The fundamentals of our strategy continue to drive income from operations and operating EBITDA growth. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $55 million, an increase of more than 8%. Our operating EBITDA grew $69 million, an increase of about 7%, when compared to the third quarter of 2016. And our operating EBITDA margin was 28.8%, an increase of 60 basis points when compared to last year. Revenues in the third quarter were $3.72 billion, an increase of $168 million or 4.7% when compared to the third quarter of 2016. Third quarter revenue growth in our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume was $93 million. Third quarter revenues also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices, which drove a $60 million increase in recycling revenues. In the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and yield was 2%. On the volume front, total volume was 1.1% and traditional solid waste volume was up 2%. As we expected, the year-over-year comparison in the commercial line of business became tougher in the third quarter as we've anniversaried the award of several large national accounts. In addition, and as Jim mentioned, we saw weaker recycling volume from the hurricanes. Overall, we're very pleased with our volume results given these headwinds, as our focus on customer service and disciplined growth are delivering consistent results. Through the first nine months of the year, we achieved about 2% yield and 2% volume. Looking at other revenue metrics, service increases exceeded service decreases for the 15th consecutive quarter, our year-to-date churn rate was 9.3% and rollbacks improved 170 basis points year-over-year. Our collection lines of business continued to perform exceptionally well. In the third quarter, commercial core price was 6.8% with volume up 2.7%. Industrial core price was 9% with volume up 2.4% in the third quarter. In the residential line of business, core price was 2.9%, while residential volume was down 2% in the third quarter, similar to the second quarter. The combined price and volume increases in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing $48 million and operating EBITDA growing $50 million. Those results produced a 100 basis point improvement in income from operations margin and an 80 basis point increase in the operating EBITDA margin. In the landfill line of business, total volume increased 7.7%, MSW volume grew 10.1%, C&D volume grew 4.3% and combined special waste and revenue generating cover volume grew almost 2%. On the MSW front, volumes continue to benefit from an outage at a Virginia Waste-to-Energy Plant, but adjusting for that, we would still be up in the mid-to-high single-digits. In special waste, we had several large jobs that did not repeat in 2017 but our pipeline continues to look good. Regarding pricing, we achieved core price of 2.6% in the landfill line of business and MSW yield was the highest that we've we seen in nine years at 3.1%. This is the third consecutive quarter of improvement in both of these pricing metrics. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total income from operations growing $30 million and operating EBITDA growing $45 million, each of these measures improved by 10% compared to the third quarter of 2016. We also saw income from operations margin in the landfill line increase 130 basis points and operating EBITDA margin increased 190 basis points. Moving now to operating expenses, in the third quarter, total operating cost increase increased $75 million, when compared with the third quarter of 2016. The cost increases were largely due to higher recycled commodity rebates, primarily related to our recycling brokerage business and rising fuel expenses. Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, improved 80 basis points from 62.5% in the third quarter of 2016 to 61.7% in the third quarter of 2017. The combined cost of recycling rebates and higher fuel expenses increased 75 basis points as a percent of revenue. However, through efficiency gains, and our cost control efforts, particularly in the labor and transfer and disposal cost lines, in our traditional solid waste business, we were able to more than offset the increase in commodity based costs in that quarter, which is particularly notable given the hurricanes' impact on our operating cost. Our traditional solid waste business improved operating expenses as a percent of revenue by 125 basis points during the quarter. Thanks to the strong execution of our field and our corporate teams. And I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Just as we have seen all year, the strength of our operating results continues to drive significant growth in our cash flow from operations and free cash flow. In fact, in the third quarter of 2017, we achieved the highest cash provided by operating activities that we have ever seen at $856 million. This compares to $758 million in the third quarter of 2016 and that's an increase of $98 million or almost 13%. We are particularly pleased with the continued leverage we are achieving in our cash flow from operations conversion metrics. In the third quarter, our operating cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 23% which is a 160 basis point improvement in the measure from the third quarter of 2016. Our free cash flow as a percentage of operating EBITDA was about 48%. These results demonstrate the operating EBITDA growth and margin expansion we are seeing in our business and that contributed $69 million to cash from operations in the quarter. Our diligent focus on more efficient working capital management also benefited the third quarter performance more than offsetting the impact of higher cash taxes. Over the last year our corporate and field teams have been working to leverage a more efficient procure to pay process and the resulting extension of days to pay continued to provide real value and expansion in our cash conversion metrics. In the third quarter, our capital spending increased about 5%. We expect the year-over-year increase to be even more pronounced in the fourth quarter and we now expect our full year capital expenditures to be at the upper-end of our guidance of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. We generated $512 million of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $79 million or 18% from the third quarter of 2016. Through the first nine months of the year, we have generated over $1.4 billion of free cash flow. And as Jim mentioned, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to between $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion. The strong and consistent free cash flow we generate supports our focus on returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and growing the business by funding acquisitions. In the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to repurchase $500 million of our outstanding stock over the remainder of the year. We also paid $185 million in dividends and we continued to identify and fund tuck-in acquisitions. Through the first nine months of the year, we have returned over $1.3 billion to our shareholders and we have spent $80 million on acquisitions. We fully expect to close on additional acquisitions in the fourth quarter, which will bring our full year acquisition spending to our target of between $150 million and $200 million for the year. Each year around this time we review our financial performance and begin to consider how we will allocate the free cash flow of the business in the coming year. As we have discussed for many years, we target and deliver a dividend that will grow as the cash flow generation of the business grows. Two years ago we communicated that we had moved from a baseline free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, to a new baseline of new baseline of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and we made a corresponding step change in our dividend. With the strength of operating cash flow over the last two years, we are confident that the company's baseline free cash flow has again increased, now to $1.6 billion. While we have yet to finalize the coming year's capital allocation plan, this new baseline free cash flow positions us well to recommend to our Board of Directors a corresponding step change in the per share dividend beginning in 2018. Turning to SG&A. For the third quarter of 2017 as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.6%. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $356 million in the third quarter of 2017 or $26 million higher than in the prior year period. The third quarter increase is largely attributable to a favorable insurance recovery that benefited the prior year quarter and increases from incentive compensation cost. We also had increased cost in the quarter for charitable donations we made in the wake of the hurricanes that impacted some of the Texas and Florida communities that we serve. We remain confident that our SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue will approach 10% for the year. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants remained at 2.4 at the end of the third quarter, underscoring the strength in our balance sheet and we remain well positioned to make strategic acquisitions at the right price. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2017 was approximately 35.8%, which is slightly below our projected full year 2017 adjusted tax rate of about 36.5%. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 33.5% and included about a $0.02 benefit from favorable return to accrual adjustments. The increase in our tax rate from 2016 is due to the year-over-year change in these adjustments and growth in our pre-tax earnings which is meeting the benefits of tax credits. In summary, we have performed very well through the first nine months of 2017. We have the best employees in the industry and they continue to execute at a high level on our core operating objectives, serving our customers, growing profitable volumes, improving core price and controlling costs. I want to thank all members of the Waste Management team. I know they are hard at work on continuing to deliver fantastic results in the fourth quarter and preparing for a great 2018. With that, Nova, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. It's Derrick Laton on for Brian. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Hi, Derrick. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at free cash flow there, the conversion's been strong the last couple quarters and just looking at the revised guidance now, I think, it would imply that, you'd have maybe $300 million, $310 million in free cash flow in the fourth quarter. How should we think about free cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA kind of going forward as we look ahead to 2018? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: It's early for us to consider giving guidance for 2018. What I mentioned is that our capital expenditures are going to be higher in the fourth quarter than what we've seen thus far in 2017. And as a result, free cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA will actually tick down a bit in the fourth quarter and we expect that our full year right now should be in about the same range as what you saw in 2016, maybe a little higher given the EBITDA operating leverage that we've seen from the business. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe shifting gears to recycling, if I heard correctly I think you said is you're expecting about a $0.04 decline year-over-year in recycling earnings in 2018, kind of heavily weighted to the first half of the year. I'm assuming that kind of implies a recovery there in recycle commodities prices, and is that based more on your thoughts that China is going to return to the market and things will begin to normalize or is that more based on maybe your ability to find some alternative dispositions for your recycle commodities material? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I think it's all of the above. The way we came up with the $0.04 is that we looked at September pricing. September OCC pricing \u2013 and OCC is the commodity that's been most impacted by this, and so September OCC pricing, export pricing was down about 24% from the peaks in July. So we took a look at it and said, another 5% decline from there puts us at about export OCC pricing, about the same export OCC pricing that we saw in Q4 of 2016, which felt reasonable to us and that's the number we used to build up to a $0.04 decline in recycle earnings for 2018. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Derrick, I might add to this, to that specific answer, that we're seeing orders now. China has granted a few licenses and we're preparing shipments here in Q4 to their mills. Their mills need the product. We all know there's a growing need for more product based on e-commerce activity. There are more and more products being delivered to my front door every day and probably yours as well. So, we see that activity happening at pricing above that low point here in Q4. Not at the same rate that we saw in the summer or in the spring, but it's starting to happen. Derrick, they've been in our plants for a few years now, their inspectors looking at the material, making sure the quality is right and they're now not only inspecting, but they're granting approval for shipments that meet their requirements, so we're seeing that activity. And then, I guess lastly, and as you mentioned in your question, we have developed for four years or five years now, other markets around Southeast Asia primarily and in India to receive materials. Our large brokerage business requires us to find alternative markets and we've done that and that's helping us as well as we look for ways to get around the short term blip we think in what China's doing. Granted, I don't mean to imply that what they're doing truly is short term. They're looking we think at the long term. But they need material and we're shipping to them, but we're also finding alternatives, so we \u2013 I think that bodes well for the numbers that Jim gave you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, I think, Derrick, I think Jim's color there reinforces why we don't feel that the October lows are the right baseline to use, that we're already starting to see, as Jim said, some promising signs coming into November. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate the color there, guys. And then just one final one for me, just to confirm, on an annual basis, is it still the same sensitivity to recycle commodities prices for you guys for a $10 move is roughly the $0.04 impact on an annual basis? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, that's the same number we used. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Great. I'll turn it over. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just on free cash flow. You mentioned a step change in the dividend. Is that \u2013 what free cash flow base, is it $1.7 billion that we should think about with regard to the step change in the dividend? And then, just in conjunction with that, does that change your view on larger M&A given the step change in the dividend or is that just a catch-up to your new baseline? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure. So what I would say, Hamzah, is that the new baseline is $1.6 billion and that varies from our current outlook for the current year, because of the impact of proceeds from divestitures. As a reminder, we include proceeds from divestitures in our free cash flow measure, but because that's not recurring activity that's easily predictable, we've backed out the $50 million to $100 million of current year activity that we are projecting. So we're using a baseline free cash flow of $1.6 billion as we look forward to the discussion about capital allocation with the board in December. And when we think about dividend policy, we really target a 50% payout ratio on a consistent basis over the long-term, and expect that the dividend will grow as our free cash flow grows from operating leverage in the business. And so, when we look at the baseline free cash flow moving from $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, that's an increase of 6.5% to 10% depending on which data point you use of the existing \u2013 or the previous baseline of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. So we'll be looking at our capital allocation in more detail with the board in December and determining what we think the appropriate step change is. But know that we are confident that the baseline has increased to that $1.6 billion. We also continue to be confident that we have the balance sheet to execute large strategic M&A acquisition activity and this in no way changes our outlook for that. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And then just on gross margin. It feels like the highest since 2011 for you guys. Maybe if you could just parse out high level how much of that is mix versus just better operational execution and I know, Jim you touched a little bit on the landfill cost side but just curious on the sustainability of that performance. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I think, when you look at the adds (32:21), whether you look at EBITDA margins or gross margins, I mean that was certainly a good story for us this quarter. And last quarter we \u2013 it was something we talked about our brokerage business dampening it a bit and it still did. But we were just able to overcome that this quarter. I think it is sustainable going forward. We've talked about, on the EBITDA margins line being 50 basis points to 100 basis points up year-over-year and we think we'll be right in that range when we finish 2017. We continue to focus on operating costs and I mentioned it, I think, in \u2013 well, in my script and I think, Devina mentioned in hers, that \u2013 or Jim in his, that we have some technology that we're putting into place. We are continually focused through our onboard computers on improving operating costs through efficiency gains. Devina, I know mentioned that SG&A is an area that we have always been focused, at least over the last five years to six years and we're pleased with the results there, so. And then, I think the last thing that I would say, Hamzah, is that what we're really seeing and it's affecting margins, is that we're starting to see the leverage of kind of 2% price and 2% volume. It's something that Steiner mentioned several times over a couple year period and we were never quite able to get there, although we made good strides. We've finally gotten there and it's really, really showing up in spades in our \u2013 not only in our EBITDA and free cash flow, but also in our margins. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Hamzah, if you look at, as I have mentioned and Jim as well, the growth in the commercial line of business and in the landfill line of business, both in volume and in core price or yield, you see two highly leveraged lines of business that have created a lot of that margin expansion and we don't see signs of that slowing down in the future. It's really a solid business model. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. And just lastly, I'll turn it over. As you look long term from the hurricane, are there any puts and takes investors should look at when comparing the cleanup activity versus what was in Hurricane Andrew or other hurricanes. It feels like a lot of private pickup this stuff, but at the same time, you have a Texas Attorney General probe on some of the cleanup activity. Just curious, is this going to be a big benefit long term for you on the landfill side in 2018 and just curious on your thoughts there? Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Here's what I would say about the hurricanes. I mean, first of all, in terms of predicting the benefit to us and there will be a benefit to us. But in terms of predicting that benefit for \u2013 whether it's Q4 or the first part of 2018, it's a bit difficult and I'll give you an example of why it's hard. In Texas for example, in Houston specifically, a lot of that Hurricane debris has gone to these temporary holding areas. And I assume that the reason for that was to get it off of people's yards as quickly as they could. So a lot of the debris has not yet made its way to landfills and so we think there is some real opportunity. The collection side of the business is really handled for the most part by FEMA and so we don't see a whole lot on the collection side. Where we ultimately see benefit from natural disasters is in the landfills. And then once reconstruction begins, we see it in our roll-off line of business. And then as I mentioned in my script, Hamzah, we saw a bit of it just through the temporary suspension of recycling programs in the recycle line of business. To kind of put a cap on this, we think that it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of a $0.02 impact for us, a bit hard to predict because we're not exactly sure how much volume is out there in either Florida or in Texas, but we think it's probably a $0.02 benefit, could be a little bit higher, could be a little bit lower, but somewhere in that neighborhood over the coming months. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you all for taking my questions this morning. Ed, you made a point of drawing out the context of this workday significance, can you sort of tell us why you drew that out this time in the preamble? Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.: So, the volume, we had $0.07 of workday difference year-over-year on volume. So, if you look at as-reported volumes, it shows down to 0.7% positive, adjusted for that workday, it shows 1.1% positive volume for the quarter. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: That's total volume, Ed (37:26). Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.: That's total volume on \u2013 so for traditional solid waste it's 2%. So just to show you that it's \u2013 the volume change really hasn't been significant. If you look at just the raw numbers, it looks like there is a significant drop, but we still see the steady volume that we've seen all year. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: But that we've always called that out. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. We've always done that. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then on the free cash flow, Jim Fish, if this was July and you had to do it all over again, would you have actually raised your guidance then given what you knew? Because this is an enormous change in three months. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Look, it's not that we didn't see this coming, but we felt like in July, look, we're halfway through the year, let's \u2013 I think every time we've ever raised guidance in the past, we've waited until the third quarter to do it, because things can happen throughout the year that \u2013 and what you don't want to do is raise your guidance and then find out that you didn't anticipate something or something happened that's caused the other direction. So I mean, I would answer your question by saying two things. One is, we knew we were having a good year when we were on our second quarter earnings call, but in the interest of being reasonably conservative, we wanted to wait until third quarter to really kind of reaffirm that, and that's why we're raising guidance in Q3. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And I would add to that, Michael, that some of the strength that we've seen in 2017 that we didn't anticipate is related to working capital changes and some traction that we've seen in the procure to pay initiatives and as you know, working capital improvements are really difficult to predict and we're still working through the processes there. And so, rather than over predict what we expected over the remainder of the year, we wanted to be sure that the traction we had seen in the first six months was going to continue, particularly because we had a couple of working capital headwinds that we've discussed with the swap termination and higher incentive compensation plans. The remainder of the cash flow drivers, particularly EBITDA growth, has come in line with our expectations and are outperforming in a way that's consistent with the earnings growth that we're reflecting in our updated guidance. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, I think, Michael, just to tag on to Devina's comments. Really, the two things that have \u2013 this is a story about EBITDA and working capital when it comes to cash from operations. And it's \u2013 Devina mentioned, the reasons behind working capital and the procure to pay program, or technology we put into place, but also really strong landfill volumes, really strong volumes across the board, and those landfill volumes and our overall volumes continue as we look at the month of October. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So to parse that, if we're starting with the original $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, you're going to $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion, that's a $200 million to $250 million move, how do I break that up between the two. Is it $150 million in working capital and then it's $50 million to $100 million in EBITDA? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, when we gave guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in free cash flow that included $240 million to $290 million in EBITDA growth. We now think that we're at the high end of that range and potentially even above the high end of that range, thinking more in the neighborhood of $280 million to $300 million of EBITDA growth on a year-over-year basis. So that's part of your increase. We also have seen better than expected decreases in our cash interest paid and then the remainder is related to the change in working capital. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So to parse that there is \u2013 say again? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I was just going to say, CapEx comes in right where we said it would, which is the high end of the original guidance. We originally guided $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion and I believe last quarter we said we'd be at the high end of that. And so we're going to come in right at the high end of that CapEx number. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right, right. So, if I take the $240 million, $290 million and parse the midpoint, that's $50 million, cash interest is $20 million to $25 million. So that's \u2013 we're still talking about $100 million to $125 million is working capital, that's the way to think about it? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: That's right. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And so to be clear then \u2013 and congratulations \u2013 there is no storm debris leverage in that number? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: That's correct. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: There isn't. I mean, if you look at the storm debris, Michael, for the third quarter and I went through kind of our expectations for Q4 and beyond. But if you look at the third quarter, really the revenue impact for the third quarter was only $1.28 million and that seems amazing, but it's not that surprising when you consider that there is an initial kind of hit both on revenue and on operating cost. The operating cost impact was almost $3.1 million and add to that the SG&A impact from the donations and you get to a negative $6 million for the third quarter and that's where you get the $0.01 in Q3. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. So, your total storm related \u2013 because you did made that very nice $4 million donation, that $7 million of storm related costs are in your P&L in 3Q? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: $6 million. Yeah, a little bit less than $7 million. About $6 million. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. And then \u2013 okay. So, help me with why your baseline then isn't $1.7 billion instead of $1.6 billion because it would imply there is about $50 million to $75 million of non-recurring in the way you're thinking about that baseline? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Right. So, we talked about the $50 million to $100 million of proceeds from divestitures. The remainder, I would tell you, has to do with the uncertainty associated with working capital contributions and just wanting to see more time before we put a stake in the ground with respect to the sustainability of working capital growth over the long term. As a reminder, these step changes that we see from working capital initiatives really give you a one-time lift. They don't provide lift year-over-year going forward. Now as we sustain these and that's absolutely our expectation on our plan, we're going to continue to see the free cash flow as a percentage of revenue conversion continue at this new rate of 22% to 23%, up from more like 20% in prior years. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Of cash flow from ops, that's what you're referring to? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. So, which that's the other \u2013 if I translate that through, you've been a long-term sort of circling 40% as your free cash flow conversion of your EBITDA. The 50s that have been running the last couple of periods seems like that's not sustainable, but 45% possibly is, is that the way to think about that? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, right now, we expect 45% or higher for the full-year of 2017. I would tell you that given the higher capital expenditures that we expect in the current year with the business growth, we're going to break through the traditional 9% to 10% of revenue that we've typically run on CapEx as a percentage of revenue. And so, when we're thinking about the growth of the business, investing in that capital now is going to provide real value, particularly if you think about the Los Angeles and New York contracts that we've spoken about over the last several calls, over the next 10 years, 20 years. And so the capital as a percentage of revenue being a little higher than our traditional run rate is something that we expected, but it's not something that we expect to be sustained over the long-term at this point. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So just to put all those pieces together, CapEx in 2018, you should think about, goes back to 9% to 10%, the cash flow from ops runs at a 22% to 23%, which is going to put you in that low-teens as cash flow as a percentage, free cash flow as a percentage of revenues? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: That's correct. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Pretty soon you're going to talk us into giving guidance here for 2018. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Well... James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: (45:48). Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The biggest question \u2013 and I don't mean interrupt, I apologize. The $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion brilliant, but can you grow it in 2018 or am I in a pause because all of the things you just described and then another lift in 2019? That's what I'm trying to understand. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, look, I think we feel \u2013 here's the bottom line. I mean I think, we feel very good about the operating leverage of the business. We feel good about the volumes that we're seeing and the kind of 7% to 8% growth that we're seeing in EBITDA. As Devina mentioned, CapEx is a bit of a \u2013 I wouldn't say a wildcard because that implies that we don't control it, we do. But we may or may not be in that 9% to 10% range in 2018. She talked a bit about why. One thing she did mention was investing more heavily in our CNG fleet, because we're seeing a very nice payback for a CNG truck versus a diesel truck in terms of not only the cost of fuel, but also maintenance cost. So I think, we feel good about the long-term growth prospects of the business and we'll talk more about where we think free cash will be for 2018, when we get to the beginning of the quarter next year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Two last ones for me, 2% plus 2% has been your mantra forever, 2% price, 2% volume, do we hold that going into 2018, everything we know today? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: So, far that's what we're looking for. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then why not buy stock more consistently throughout the whole year instead of doing that program you do, which investment bankers make a lot of money and maybe you get a lower average price, but somebody makes a lot of money on the backs of your shareholders doing that as opposed to buying it ratably all year? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: I hear you, Michael. What I would tell you is the way that we structure our accelerated share repurchase agreements ensure that we are buying ratably over the entire year. The $500 million that we executed in the third quarter will run through December of this year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning, Tyler. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Devina. I know I asked about this a few quarters ago, but I was hoping for an update, but where do we stand with the sun setting of some of those alternative tax strategies. And I know it's early, but can you give us a sense of where the tax rate may pan out in 2018 or is it more of a 2019 story? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, it's definitely more of a 2019 story. The EPS benefit of those just for specificity is about $0.04. And so, it's a penny a quarter of a benefit to our effective tax rate is the way that you can think about that. And those don't sunset until beginning in 2019. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And they will provide maybe a cash flow headwind, though it sounds fairly modest? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: It's very modest. And what I would tell you is from a free cash flow perspective, you would see a headwind potentially because the benefits that we get from those show up in cash taxes and some of the cash outflows that we pay show up in other parts of the free cash flow (49:13). Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And \u2013 yeah. No, that's helpful. And then, Jim, just real quick so are you saying there is $0.02 in the Q4 expectations from incremental landfill volumes maybe in Texas and at Okeechobee? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. We think it's probably $0.02 in the fourth quarter. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay. So, how do we think about maybe MSW landfill volumes next year, I mean, we had this huge Fairfax diversion, you've got some incremental landfill volumes from hurricanes, but do you think that those 2018 MSW landfill volumes will be down? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well. No, I don't think they're going to be down. I mean, there are always some reasons why year-over-year comps can be difficult and Jim talked about that a bit for Q3, actually having one that was a positive for us that will cause next year to be a difficult comp for us. But, I think largely MSW volumes are driven by two things, driven by us differentiating ourselves and taking potentially a bigger slice of the pie and then driven by the overall growth of the pie itself. I would tell you that on the overall growth of the pie, that the economy feels reasonably good right now. As we look out into 2018, we don't see any storm clouds on the horizon, not that they couldn't show up, but right now it looks reasonably good. And then part of why we're excited about putting Nikolaj in the technology position is that we're already starting to separate ourselves through the use of things like customer analytics and use of data reporting and then technology to our customer in terms of a customer interface. So differentiation in the economy give us some room for optimism here as we think about MSW volumes and total volumes going into 2018. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Hey, Tyler you mentioned the Virginia waste to energy plant. I think, I stated it in the script, but that would have lowered our MSW volume growth but it still would have been mid, high single-digit numbers. So it's still very strong and that trend as Jim mentioned, although it might have a headwind or two to it, is still going to be positive. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then was incentive comp a notable headwind in Q3? Devina, it sounds like maybe there's a catch up accrual either in Q3 or Q4. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So in the prior year, our incentive compensation cost accruals were more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter. In 2017, those have been more ratably spread over the first nine months of the year. And so there's a slight increase in total costs expected in 2017, but for the most part you're going to see just a timing difference and we are \u2013 you would notice if you looked at SG&A on a quarter-by-quarter basis that we're kind of at around $350 million a quarter. And so we think that's a reasonable run rate to carry out into the fourth quarter and our expectation is that we'll finish the year right around that $1.45 billion or 10% of revenue. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then my last one. Yeah, sorry, go ahead. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: It was just going to say, for Q3, Tyler, it was about $8 million, right. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: So the $25.6 million increase in absolute dollars in SG&A cost year over year, about $8 million of it was related to that. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And this is my last one just, Jim Trevathan, I know it's small, but can you give any high level thoughts on the hazardous waste side of the house? Is that notably strong just on the better industrial outlook? Thanks. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Tyler, we're doing fine with that business. We've got five facilities that are extremely well positioned in the marketplace and they're taking advantage of some of the petrochemical growth that's occurring in the market. Some are up and a couple of them are down, but overall, it's a solid business for us and we expect that to be part of our future strategy. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, great. Thanks. Great quarter. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you so much. Just wanted to go back to the recycling issues and what's going on in China. From talking to people in the industry, it's not only the limitation of certain streams of waste that they're accepting, but they're also pushing more quality initiatives to try to reduce the contaminant percentage. If that's something that continues going forward, are you able to handle that? Are there going to have to be investments that you're going to have to be making in your facilities to meet those quality initiatives? Thanks. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Jeff, I mentioned that earlier as well, but a little more color to it. We've been looking at reducing contamination for years. It's part of our recycling strategy, when we started two or three years ago talking about improving that business model itself. So we're already ahead of that game. We've got excellent people. We've got really good assets. We have invested in those plants to be able to sort material better and properly. We've got a really good accountability process in place. I mentioned that we've got some of the Chinese inspectors that have been visiting our facilities for a number of years that now look at each prepared shipment and grant approval. So we're meeting their current expectations for that material now. At the same time, I don't tell you that's not a long-term focus for us, it's even going to be stronger focus to make sure that we meet those requirements. We think we generate the best material in the marketplace. It's the same thing for service. We believe we're \u2013 that's our goal is world class service, but it's also world class product. We think the companies, the facilities that generate the best material will win in the long run and we're doing that. And I don't want to miss the statement though that we're looking for alternative markets and we've developed them for years to help that brokerage business. It's a real risk aversion support for our recycling business overall when we've done that and we'll do more of that in Southeast Asia and in India, where we ship material in the fourth quarter when China granted no licenses for a period of time. So you're right to focus on it, but we are as well. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears a bit, there was an article in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week about increased wages for truck drivers. I know that's something you've talked about in the past. Can you give us some kind of quantification what you've been paying, how that's been going up and if you think that'll continue to be a pressure on your operating expenses going forward? Thanks. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Jeff, it has been a pressure, but I'll tell you, we look at it also as an opportunity. We've gone at it from a district by district standpoint. We look with our HR team at where are we versus the marketplace by MSA on payment for drivers and for technicians and we adjust accordingly. We've been doing that for a year or two year now. We're going to strengthen that focus to make sure that we're competitive in the marketplace while we look for opportunities to differentiate why a driver ought to work for us versus another trucking operation. So it has been a pressure, but we've overcome that with efficiencies and other opportunities, so you don't see it dramatically on our P&L statement. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I would tell you, Jeff, that while wage inflation is certainly a consideration for us, maybe an even bigger consideration is tackling turnover and making sure that we are doing everything we can to limit the amount of turnover that we have. It's a fact of life for us but to the extent that we can limit it, is a huge, huge value for us. There is a significant cost to every employee, be that a driver or a technician or an accountant when we turn them over and the training cost and kind of the ramp up are all costly to us. So we have put a real focus on reducing turnover. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks so much for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Hey, good morning. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Morning, Corey. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Just a couple quick questions. I don't want the call to go longer than last night's game, so everyone sounds fully recovered. Congratulations on the outcome there. The quick questions I had were, first of all, Devina on the G&A, so you were very clear on what you expect for the year. If the incentive comp is more ratably spread throughout the year, what drives the dollar amount higher in Q4? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: The fourth quarter will just be flat with what we've seen in Q2 and Q3 is our current expectations, so there are elements of SG&A that vary with year-end accruals that we can't currently predict and so there may be a plus or minus $10 million range on that current outlook. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Okay. That's helpful, thank you. And then on the \u2013 you've addressed a bunch of pieces of this, but the volumes, so given the moving pieces in the quarter with a little bit of the hurricanes and the waste energy plant and the extra work, I'm just trying \u2013 can you just comment sort of a summative statement on underlying volume trends if you kind of adjust for all those things relative to what you saw in Q2? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, look, I think the underlying trends are good. I briefly mentioned when Michael was questioning us about October. And so October looks very strong. It's always hard to tell what volumes are going to do, looking six months out. We do have a pipeline in our special waste stream that looks promising. C&D was a bit of a \u2013 kind of, I wouldn't say a disappointment, because it was expected after the hurricanes, but C&D was definitely impacted by the hurricanes. It's coming off of a small base. And when you don't take in C&D material for a period of two weeks to three weeks in two big C&D markets, Florida and Texas, that affects C&D. So we think C&D will return to more kind of normal numbers. MSW we talked about. And then on the collection side we're very encouraged with the commercial line of business. That's been performing very well for us, continues to perform well when we look at the month of October. Resi has been the one that has been negative for us, it's the only one that's been negative for us and we continue to focus on that, on improving the residential line of business, it's an important line of business for us. We've made some progress there, but still negative and need to continue to work on it. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Really helpful. And the last quick question I had was, can you just remind me on your \u2013 for the portion of your business that's contractual, it's tied to CPI, what the timing of kind of the mix of contracts is and do you expect that to benefit price in Q4 relative to Q3? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, generally, Corey, I mean, we've got a grouping of those contracts that are in the summer range and another in the third quarter where most of that occurs. Remember, that we've worked really hard to move away from just the old fashioned CPI metric or a percentage of CPI, to a wastewater sewer number, it's a little better reflection of our cost structure in our industry and we're doing a pretty good job of that for public sector work and for the national account business. We're not quite at 50% of that revenue but we're \u2013 the target is to continue as they expire to move to that number, that again, better reflects our cost and the opportunity in the marketplace. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Corey, it's about \u2013 10 basis points of CPI equates to about $0.01 per share for us. Based on the most recent 12 months, we've seen about 10 basis points, I mean a little more, about 12 basis points improvement in CPI and so that will equate to about $0.01 per share in 2018. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning. Two quick ones from me. First, the guidance for divestitures and M&A. So, I guess around $70 million to $120 million in M&A spend for the remainder of the year, plus something like $30 million to $80 million proceeds from divestitures, that's some shift and I was just wondering if we could get a sense of the profile of the businesses that you're expecting to shed and that which you're expecting to add? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure. The additions are traditional solid waste businesses and the divestiture is noncore. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. And then, the Chief Digital Officer, so congratulations to you, Nikolaj. But I think, in the past, the company referred to bringing on a Chief Technology Officer, you referred to it as the Chief Digital Officer, I guess I just wanted to understand is that sort of functionally the same, maybe, Jim, you could talk about your expectations for the role and what are some of the key initiatives you're really looking at here under that role? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. So, just the title itself, we felt like Chief Digital Officer was probably more representative of the job that Nikolaj was going to do coming in. It felt a little bit more like kind of a 21st Century title than a 20th Century title. So that's why we changed it a bit. But, I mean, look I would tell you that Nikolaj has a big job in front of him, because it's such an important part of our growth strategy, and it includes things like customer facing technologies, both internal customers and external customers. We tend to think solely about external customers and it's both. It's the use of big data. We've talked a bit about predictive maintenance and how we're already starting down that path and it's already starting to show some promise. And then asset management technologies, there is a whole list of things that I think you'll see this Chief Digital Officer position and Nikolaj in that role, really start to leverage. We visited our national accounts group last week and look, national accounts competes against kind of low margin, low frills brokers all the time. And what we're doing is putting some advanced analytics to use and rolling out a sophisticated reporting tool that really separates us, that differentiates us from those low margin low frills guys. Those are all technologies and difference kind of under that big technology umbrella that that we hope to help differentiate us in the coming years. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: You know, Noah, Nikolaj has been around for several years now and he sees clearly what we've done on the operating side with onboard computers on every truck. We now \u2013 Jim and I look every morning at yesterday's results by area. And we can drill down by district and see the true operating metrics, whether it's quality of service or other factors. And we're going to leverage off of that to provide more real-time data for those largest customers, as Jim mentioned those nationals, and truly attempt to differentiate ourselves. We've already begun that with tools for the last year and we'll leverage that as we move forward and connect the operating side with the customer side and provide real value that aligns with the customer strategy. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks. Maybe if I could just squeeze one in. You called out last quarter the dilutive impact of recycling brokerage to overall margins. Can you just tell us what that was this quarter, just the brokerage part of the business? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: It was 50 basis points to operating expense margin. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much for taking the questions. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. When we think about \u2013 you mentioned volumes is 2%, pricing 2%, what should we typically think is the right margin expansion more or less on your business model? And then maybe especially when we think about the mix of the business, certainly turned more profitable with commercial and landfill, is there an incremental margin framework we could think about? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well. So, we've said for this year at least, 50 basis points to 100 basis points of margin improvement on the EBITDA margin line. Going forward, we haven't kind of nailed those down yet, but we did say, we still believe that we have margin expansion opportunities either on the gross margin line or down at the EBITDA margin line in 2018 and we'll be more specific about that in February. And then what was the second part of your question? Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then \u2013 no, that's helpful, Jim. And then I guess... James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Okay. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : ...think about on the M&A, I know that when you talk about strategic opportunities, I know recycling was one of the things you listed. Obviously there's a lot of disruption now with what we're seeing in recycling. Is recycling still on that list and what exactly are you looking for when you talk about that and strategic opportunities with the M&A? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure, no, recycling certainly is still on the list and we have done a couple of small strategic recycling acquisitions. They tend to be really almost exclusively where we have either not had a presence or where we can really \u2013 where we're buying into a recycling business that is a strong return, strong business, strong margin business. There are a couple of places, specifically in Florida, also in Tennessee where I think we bought recycling operations over the past two years. And so, it is certainly still on the list for us as are some of the other kind of ancillary businesses that are not necessarily straight down the middle of the fairway, core solid waste. But for the most part, the $100 million to $200 million range that we've given is going to be comprised more of straight down the middle of the fairway, solid waste tuck-ins. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That makes sense. And then can you just remind us I mean, obviously your leverage is the lowest it's been in years, the free cash flow baseline stepping up. What is your leverage target range and how much room do you have to take on debt and still be able to maintain that investment grade rating? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, So, our leverage as of the end of the quarter, as I mentioned is 2.4. We've talked about not really targeting a specific debt-to-EBITDA measure. We think of it more in terms of ensuring that we always have that dry powder so that we are well positioned to be opportunistic if the right transaction presents itself and we're confident that that's absolutely where we are today. We don't see a reason to chase up our debt to EBITDA measure just because we're seeing fantastic growth in the earnings of the business and we're going to continue to look at capital allocation in a disciplined way over the long-term. When I think about how much capacity we have, I'm not sure if you saw, but we actually did just get an upgrade from one of the three main rating agencies here recently. I can't specifically tell you how many dollars of capacity we have, but it's definitely several billion. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: And I would just add that that's the really encouraging part about this quarter is \u2013 and really the last several quarters, is that it's really almost been all organic growth. It has not been driven by acquisitions, nothing wrong with acquisitions, we like acquisitions, but I would tell you that we're growing cash from operations by 13% and EBITDA by 8% or 7% and free cash by 18% and we're doing it organically and that's the encouraging part about these last couple of earnings reports. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini of Morningstar. Your line... Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hey, good morning. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning, Barbara. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning. Just a quick one from me. With the OCC prices falling off at the end of the quarter. Should we expect to see a corresponding decline in rebate costs over the coming quarters? I know over the years you've done some work on improving your contracts and the rebate structure in particular. So I'm curious how you expect a steep decline in commodity prices may flow through your rebate expense line this time around? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Barbara, you're exactly right we do monitor that closely and make sure that our areas are rebating the correct amount to our customers. So that's absolutely part of our business strategy to make sure that alignment occurs and it occurs as quickly as we can as OCC or news or other commodity prices change So, you're exactly right. Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Jim Fish for closing remarks. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Well, this was an excellent financial and operating quarter for Waste Management. We're very proud of that. But at the same time we recognize that the hurricanes in Southeast Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and the fires in California have taken a heavy toll on the lives of people who were in the path of those disasters and I tell you, it reemphasizes to all of us, the roles that we play as compassionate human beings and those are truly the most important roles we play each and every day. So, thank you again for your time today. We'll see you next quarter and go Astros. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 1 :00 PM Eastern today through November 9 Eastern today.

Now, I'd turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Ed. And thank you, all, for joining us this morning. 2017 was arguably the best year we've seen as we exceeded expectations on all of our operational and financial metrics. About one year ago, I mentioned that each of our operating income, operating EBITDA, and net cash provided by operating activities were at all-time highs. I'm very pleased to say that, in 2017, we exceeded those highs and set new records in each of those metrics. Our continued focus on improving core price, adding profitable volume in a disciplined manner, and controlling costs produced $3.22 of EPS, another year of double-digit improvements with EPS improving more than 10%. In addition, operating income margin and operating EBITDA margin both achieved all-time highs. Our operating EBITDA exceeded $4 billion for the first time and we achieved free cash flow conversion close to 45%. During 2017, we generated strong free cash flow that allowed us to return $1.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We continue to see solid growth in the cash generation capability of our business. The success that we achieved in 2017 sets the foundation for continued growth into 2018 and beyond. For the full year, our strong growth in EPS, operating EBITDA and free cash flow is driven by solid growth in revenue. Revenues increased $876 million, or 6.4%. This is the best revenue dollar increase that we've seen since 1998. And more importantly, the majority of the increase is organic price and volume. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4.8% with yield of 2%. In 2017, total company volume for the year was 2.3%, marking the first time in this cycle that we've exceeded 2% volume for the full year. In 2017, we continue to focus on improving price and growing high-margin volumes, all while delivering exceptional customer service. Our strong results reinforced our conviction that these are the right areas to focus on. And we look forward to continued progress into 2018. For 2018, we expect EPS to be between $3.97 and $4.05 and free cash flow to be between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion. Before turning the call over to Jim and Devina, I want to point out our recent 8-K filings for those of you who may have not seen it. Jim Trevathan, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Jeff Harris, our Senior Vice President of our Northern Tier Operations, both announced their plans to retire at the end of this year. Both Jim and Jeff have made tremendous contributions to the success of Waste Management throughout their distinguished careers and we have an excellent succession planning process which has produced a very solid group of internal succession candidates. The strength of that group was demonstrated by our recent promotion of Tara Hemmer to Senior Vice President of Operations, Safety and Environmental Compliance. As we approach Jim and Jeff's retirement date, we will provide additional details on our succession plans. But suffice it to say, our operations are in excellent leadership hands today and will continue to be in the future. I will now turn the call over to Jim and Devina to further discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2018 guidance in more detail. And I will conclude with a brief strategic commentary on 2018 and beyond following their comments. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. In the fourth quarter, our business continued to drive income from operations and operating EBITDA growth. We saw both price and volume in our traditional solid waste business exceed 2% for the third consecutive quarter. As a result, total company income from operations grew $61 million, an increase of almost 10%. And income from operations margin expanded 80 basis points to 18.6% when compared to last year. Our operating EBITDA grew $90 million, an increase of 9.7% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. And our operating EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points to 27.9% when compared to last year. Revenues in the fourth quarter were $3.65 billion, an increase of $192 million, or 5.5%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The growth in revenues was predominantly driven by our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume of $172 million. Fourth quarter revenues were negatively impacted by lower recycling commodity prices and lower volumes, which drove a $25 million decline in recycling revenues. In the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.8% and yield was 2.2%. On the volume front, total volume was 3.4% and traditional solid waste volume was up 5%. Volumes in the fourth quarter benefited by about 140 basis points from hurricane cleanup in Texas and Florida, and 60 basis points from increased volumes from the new Los Angeles franchise collection and the new New York City disposal contracts. Looking at other revenue metrics, service increases exceeded service decreases for the 16th consecutive quarter, and new business continued to exceed lost business for the 11th consecutive quarter. Our churn increased in the recent quarter due to the transitioning of accounts related to the new City of Los Angeles franchise contract, but remember that the contract result in a net gain of customers with this new franchise. Excluding the expected churn from these customers, our churn rate was 9.7% in the fourth quarter, a 30 basis point sequential improvement. For a density-based business like ours, we have historically measured churn based upon the number of customer locations, and we will continue to do so. However, if you look at churn on a revenue basis, it was 7.7% excluding the churn from the City of Los Angeles contract. With strong improvements in our quality of service metrics and our focus on providing customers with a differentiated offering, we expect continued improvement in all these metrics. Our collection lines of business continued to perform exceptionally well. In the fourth quarter, commercial core price was 6.5%, with volume up 2.5%. Industrial core price was 9.4%, with volume up 5.9% in the fourth quarter. In the residential line of business, core price was 3.2%, while residential volume was down 2.1% in the fourth quarter similar to the third quarter. The combined price and volume increase in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing $39 million. In the landfill line of business, total volume increased 18.7% aided by increased volumes from the hurricane cleanup in Florida and Texas. More specifically, MSW volume grew 12%, C&D volume grew 23.6%, and combined special waste and revenue generating cover volume grew 4.5%. On the MSW front, we saw strong volumes in our base volumes, which were up 10.4%. We continued to benefit from an outage at our Virginia waste-to-energy plant, which added another 160 basis points to our MSW volumes. Our C&D volume increase included the impact of the California wildfire cleanup. Excluding that cleanup, our C&D volume was still a robust 10.7% in the fourth quarter. Regarding pricing, we achieved core price of 2.5% in the landfill line of business and MSW yield was 2%. The combined positive price and volume led to total income from operations growing $49 million or more than 16%, and operating EBITDA growing $74 million or more than 18% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We also saw income from operations margin in the landfill line increase 110 basis points and operating EBITDA margin increased 230 basis points, including 100 basis points from hurricane cleanup. For the full year 2018, we expect to see the same strong price and volume results that we saw in 2017, with core price projected to be 4% or greater and yield of 2% or greater. In addition, we expect total company volumes to grow in the range of between 2% and 2.2% for the full year in 2018, consistent with the volume results that we achieved in 2017. Looking at our recycling business, in the fourth quarter, average recycling commodity prices declined 8.1% and volume declined 2.9%, as we saw the impact of China canceling import licenses or delaying the renewal of import licenses to their mills. As we anticipated in October, the decline in price and volume and the cost impact of meeting the new quality control standards impacted EPS by a negative $0.03 in the fourth quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. When we gave preliminary guidance for the recycling business in October, we expected recycling to have a negative $0.04 per share impact in 2018. Since then, China did not grant any import licenses until the end of December and those they did grant were fewer in number with lower volumes than expected. The contamination limit that China proposed of 0.5% is now expected to be strictly enforced, which will result in continued increased costs. OCC remains under continued pricing pressure, as we currently see in the first quarter. Based upon these factors, we now expect our recycling operations to have a negative $0.08 to $0.10 per share impact on 2018 EPS, weighted to the first half of 2018. Moving now to operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, total operating costs increased $116 million when compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. The cost increases were largely due to increased volumes leading to higher collection, repair and maintenance costs, and fuel expenses. Our operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved 10 basis points from 62.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 62% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Efficiency gains and other cost control effort, particularly in the labor and transfer and disposal cost lines, more than offset increased costs at our recycling facilities and the higher fuel expenses of 75 basis points as a percent of revenue. So, in summary, our traditional solid waste business improved operating expenses as a percent of revenue by 120 basis points during the quarter, thanks to the strong execution of our field and corporate team. And finally, on a personal note, and as Jim mentioned, I am retiring at the end of 2018. I believe our company is in great hands moving forward. Our senior leaders, corporate and field, are as aligned on our strategy as we have ever been in my tenure with the company. I'm proud to say that we've worked diligently at developing and aligning our field and our corporate leadership teams, and I believe we have the best group of field leaders in our history. As you all know, I've had the privilege of working with Jim Fish, both at corporate and in the field, and I know him well. When our board chose Jim as CEO over a year ago, from my perspective as a member of the senior team and as the largest internal shareholder in our company, I was very pleased. Jim and the board asked me to stay for a couple of years after that transition and I welcome that opportunity and I appreciated their confidence. Jeff Harris and I have been a part of this business for a long time. He and I both believe that after we retire, the superb leadership here at corporate and in the field are more than ready to move Waste Management to the next level of success. Along with the Jim's extensive experience in the field and in corporate, we have leaders like John Morris and Tara Hemmer with decades of operations experience. And, of course, with people like Devina and Chuck, who are here in the room today, my other colleagues on the senior leadership team, including our corporate department heads, the company is in excellent hands today and in the future. My decision regarding the timing is based solely on two beliefs. First, the future leadership is in place and will succeed. Second, after 39 years with the company, it's time to move to spend more time with my wonderful wife of almost 46 years. She deserves it and I desire it. And also, more time with our 10 grandkids. Well, I desire that and I trust they will as well. Rene (18:56) and I have many goals, otherwise, that we want to accomplish outside of family and our company as we transition to what's next for us. But please remember, as I have reminded members of our WM family, I have 10.5 months remaining to create value for our customers, our people, and our shareholders, and I plan to sprint to the finish line. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our financial results and guidance. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In 2017, our strong operating results helped us to achieve our financial priorities of converting more of each revenue dollar to cash from operations, growing free cash flow, and then allocating that cash flow to grow our business and provide value to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated $790 million of cash from operations, that's an increase of almost 5% from the prior-year period. Full year cash from operations was $3.18 billion in 2017, an increase of over 8% if we adjust 2016 for the $67 million swap termination benefit. Our cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue grew 40 basis points from the prior year to 22%. But more importantly, we demonstrated that the 350 basis point increase in this metric, when compared to our long-term average, is sustainable. We are going to continue to focus on the operating efficiencies, cost control, and working capital management efforts to not just maintain but grow this metric in the years ahead. We generated $342 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017, that's a $46 million decline from the fourth quarter of 2016. We, again, saw a strong growth in our operating EBITDA. And so, the year-over-year decrease was due entirely to a $151 million increase in our capital spending in the fourth quarter. This increase was planned, allowing us to realize permanent tax benefits from asset placed in service in 2017, but more importantly, to support the business growth that we've been experiencing. For the full year, we generated $1.77 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $60 million from 2016 and above the high-end of our revised guidance for the year. The strong and consistent free cash flow we generate supports our focus on returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and also growing the business by funding acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we paid $184 million in dividends and spent $120 million on tuck-in acquisitions. As Jim mentioned, for the full year, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders, growing our dividend for the 14th consecutive year and spending the full $750 million of share repurchase authorization to buyback over 9.7 million shares of our stock. We also spent $200 million on acquisitions, which was at the high-end of our plan for the year. Turning to SG&A. For the fourth quarter of 2017, SG&A was $369 million, a $9 million decrease from the prior-year period. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 10.1% for both the fourth quarter of 2017 and the full year. When looking at the full year, this is the best SG&A margin we have seen since 2005 and a 30 basis point improvement from 2016. In 2018, we expect SG&A expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion and we continue to target SG&A as a percent of revenue of about 10%. Before turning to our guidance for 2018, I want to spend some time talking about tax reform, which will certainly benefit our earnings and cash flows in future years but it also had about $530 million net positive impact on our 2017 earnings and balance sheet as we re-measured our deferred tax liabilities and estimated the costs of a one-time deemed repatriation of our stimulated Canadian earnings. We excluded this net benefit of $1.21 per share from our as-adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. After this adjustment, our recurring effective tax rate for 2017 was about 36%, which was slightly below our expected rate. With tax reform, we expect our recurring effective rate to decline by 10 to 11 percentage points in the year ahead to about 26%, making this a clear benefit to the future earnings and cash flows of our business. The reduction in our effective rate is less than the 14% decrease in the corporate rate due primarily to a decrease in the benefit of the deduction of state taxes, a modest increase in state rates, and then the non-deductibility of certain costs. We estimate that the lower rate will reduce our cash taxes by about $275 million from what we would have otherwise expected to pay in 2018. We see corporate tax reform as a positive step for the U.S. economy for the long term, and an opportunity to continue to invest in our employees and our operations. The reduction in cash taxes will certainly bolster the company's free cash flow growth immediately, but we will also focus on investing a portion of these tax savings to grow our business in the long run as the economy continues to grow. So, as we think about our guidance in 2018, we project that our operating EBITDA will increase to $4.2 billion to $4.25 billion. This guidance includes the impact of our previously announced plan to pay approximately $65 million in bonuses at the end of 2018 to our hardworking employees who do not get the opportunity to participate in our salaries incentive plan, as well as the $55 million to $65 million headwind we currently expect in the recycling line of business. We expect that this strong operating EBITDA growth will in turn drive free cash flow of between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion, that's an increase of about 10% to 15% compared with 2017. We expect our capital expenditures to increase by $100 million to $200 million in 2018, as we make incremental investments to support business growth and invest in our fleet. This will put us temporarily above our long-term stated range for capital expenditures of 9% to 10% of revenue. But as we demonstrated in 2017, we are making this incremental investment in a disciplined way to provide accretive returns and drive long-term EBITDA and cash flow growth. With this strong growth in free cash flow, we expect to, again, increase the cash allocated to shareholders in 2018. Our board continues to demonstrate conviction in the cash generation of our business as evidenced by the intended 9.4% increase in our per share dividend for 2018 and then the authorization to repurchase up to $1.25 billion of our shares. This is the largest increase in our per share dividend in a decade and a $500 million increase in the share repurchase authorization from the prior year. We remain committed to returning value directly to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, but we also see value in complementing our organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions. We continue to have the strongest balance sheet in the industry, finishing 2017 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times, positioning us well to make strategic acquisitions at the right price. I will now turn the call back over to Jim. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Devina. Devina discussed the impact of corporate tax reform on our 2018 cash taxes and the use of a portion of those dollars for the $2,000 bonus to 34,000 of our employees, and some incremental capital spending on the fleet in 2018. Long term, however, our strategic focus will include our people, our technology including our fleet, recycling for the future, and growth of the business both organically and through acquisition. In a company where a large percentage of our 42,000 jobs are hourly, skilled positions with a manual component to them, our people must be given a lead position in our strategic objectives list for the long term. It's no secret that the millennial generation is not gravitating towards the skilled trade careers the way the baby boomers and the Gen Xers did. With that in mind, a big part of our people strategy is to design a 21st century approach to hiring, training, leadership development, and retention. An important component of our strategic approach to our people is to encourage our employees to stay and make a full career with Waste Management. Our $2,000 bonus was a first step in that process and we will continue to analyze the impact of turnover on our operations and our financials to be able to evaluate the merits of a retention program beyond 2018. On the fleet and technology front, we're driving our strategic fleet replacement program more quickly as we standardized the fleet across the company to reduce maintenance and operating costs and improve our service offering to our customers. In addition, our new digital team is hard at work, building a comprehensive digital strategy that includes projects that greatly improve our customers' digital experience. The ultimate outcome of our fleet and our digital strategies is the creation and accommodation of top-line and bottom-line growth through continuous improvements within our fleet operations and differentiation of our overall customer experience through technology. As a management team, we've been giving much thoughts to our recycling business in the future. Our customers expect us to provide recycling services to help them meet their sustainability goals, and we believe our management team, our network of recycling plants, and our valuable brokerage business distinguish Waste Management from all others. Over the last several years, we've proactively re-tooled our contracts by removing floor pricing, adding contamination and processing fees, and streamlining processing operations. Now, with the recent steps taken by China to strictly enforce its new quality control standards for recycled commodities which, we believe, are here to stay, we have an opportunity to build a recycle plant of the future that will provide solid, less volatile returns for our shareholders, meet the quality control requirements of our mill customers and continue to provide a sustainable recycling outlet for our customers. Building that plant of the future will involve, among many things, partnering with our OEMs to innovate on next-generation equipment that can improve processing times, throughput and, ultimately, produce a higher-quality product. We're currently piloting a fully robotic sort line. Depending upon the outcome of our pilots, our plan would be to move from test to production in the next few years. And lastly, as part of our strategic growth plan, we will continue to invest in acquisition opportunities that surpass our return criteria and create value for our shareholders. With more companies now meeting our hurdle rate of return due to the lower corporate tax rate, the primary determining factor as to whether we add to our normal annual acquisition guidance of $100 million to $200 million will be the extent to which sellers' expectations may have changed. Rest assured, though, what won't change is our financial discipline with those acquisitions. In summary, 2017 was a very successful year for Waste Management and we expect that 2018 will be just as successful as we stay focused on our strategy. Our employees are hard at work on executing our 2018 plans, which should position us to continue to grow our earnings and cash flow in 2018 and beyond. We have the best employees in the industry and I want to thank each member of the Waste Management team for our success. And with that, Theresa, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning, Tyler. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Morning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Jim. So, really strong on the guide on the volume side, but I think you mentioned LA and New York were additive in Q4, but can you talk about how much in the 2018 guide both of those contracts will add? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Tyler, Jim Trevathan. They will add some volume. They obviously will roll forward. But it's, I don't know, 10 basis points or so basis points, in that vicinity 20 basis points. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: It's not huge. Our base core business is doing very well, Tyler, and we expect that to continue into 2018. But they're there and they're helping, but New York City, for example, will not be up full speed until the fourth quarter of 2018 as they continue to move volume from current locations through those MTSs. So, that won't hit until late in the year, the full... Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: ...strength of New York City volume. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And then, how much do you expect Fairfax to be a drag as that plant comes back online? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: About the same; about 10, 20 basis points. We'll get you more firm numbers, but it's in that vicinity. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, okay. That's okay. And then, on the $200 million in tuck-ins, pretty strong this year, really strong number in Q4, but anyway you guys could talk about kind of what maybe the internal hurdle rates are, or maybe EBITDA multiple on the capital that was deployed this year? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, look, we don't normally talk about our hurdle rate. I mean, I think, though, as I said in my remarks, that we do think that more companies will now hit that hurdle rate because when you think about NOPAT, I mean, the key portion of that... Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: ...has obviously changed. So, I think the big question in our mind as we think about our normal kind of $100 million to $200 million, Tyler, is what happens to seller expectations, because I think the pool is a bit broader now. We will have more candidates out there that meet our return requirements. And so, then the question becomes what happens to sellers' expectations with things like individual income tax reform. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: But I think you can look \u2013 Tyler, I would just add that I think you can look at our return on invested capital as a good indication of how we think of hurdle rates. As we talked about for many years, we intend to invest the capital that we have available to us through our free cash flow in a way that's accretive. And so, our return on invested capital growth over the last few years, because we're acquiring business and investing capital in a way that will continue to create growth for the return on invested capital over the years ahead. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Okay. And then to be clear, though, there's about $100 million to $200 million of M&A assumed in the guide, is that correct? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, we've talked about $100 million to $200 million as our annual target. As Jim mentioned, we've got the balance sheet, we are well-positioned in order to allocate that and then some in the year ahead, but it's going to be largely dependent upon whether we can get transactions done in a disciplined way, and whether seller expectations will align with our own view of value in this new environment. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And this is my last one. Jim Trevathan, this is a question for you. It's on the transportation side. So, there's a lot of talk about rising truckload rates here in 2018. I'm just curious if you can talk about how subcontract or hauling contracts really are structured? Do you guys buy on the spot? Do you buy it annually, or is it usually under some sort of like multiyear contract? Just curious on how some of the subcontractor expenses were? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Tyler. They're primarily at least annual, in most cases, multiple year contracts when we commit, for example, moving volume from transfer stations into our landfills. So, no immediate impact. There may be, in many cases, fuel surcharges like we charge our customers that are impacted as fuel rates change, but overall, it's not a huge impact on a one-year basis. Over time, if we see the same trend happen, that'll occur, but we'll get that price back from our customers as we move \u2013 as our cost goes up for transportation, we're going to raise the pricing on disposal. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right. Well, thanks, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. The first question maybe for Jim Fish, if you could maybe \u2013 actually for Jim and Jim, maybe if you could just frame for us how much self-help is there in your portfolio? I know you mentioned churn and you can measure that at a few different ways, but how much room is there to improve churn going forward? And then, specifically also on working capital, it feels like the industry turns cash a lot faster than you guys. Is there any self-help in the portfolio going forward? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Hamzah, I'll start with your churn question. As we've said on almost every one of these calls, we don't see an end to improving churn. It's one of the reasons that, as Jim mentioned, we're looking from a digital standpoint at improving our offering to customers to create more stickiness. It's the reason that we focused so heavily on a quality of service metric on the collection lines of business. We see opportunity in churn whether it's on a revenue basis, as I mentioned, or on a number of customer locations like we've historically measured churn, there's continued opportunity. We haven't put a number to it and it's not a guidance topic that we're going to give you a guidance number on, but we're going to seek improvement every year in that metric. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And then. Hamzah, I would say, the same is true on the working capital front. You speak to the cash churn rate for our business as it compares to the rest of the industry and that's certainly something that we pay attention to. And you'll see in our 2017 results that we made good strides with regard to working capital, and we expect that those strides will continue to bear fruit in the year ahead. It's difficult to predict how quickly we can make changes. As an example, we got an additional day-and-a-half extension on our DPO in 2017. It'd be great to see that same results in the year ahead, but it's difficult to say that that's going to be what we target because, as you know, when you focus on continuous improvement, you tend to address the easier parts of change first and the parts that will provide the most value, the quickest first. And that's certainly the approach that we've been using. We're going to continue to move the needle, both on our DSO and our DPO in the year ahead, and that continuous improvement mindset is something that applies to all parts of our business. So, I guess, that sums it up with regard to your view of self-help, it's in the guidance. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Sure. And then, just on the free cash flow guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, how much of the tax reform savings is flowing through into that number on sort of a bottom-line basis? Any color there? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Sure. So, as I mentioned, we expect about $275 million of a reduction on a pre-tax reform basis versus tax reform basis. That $275 million is inclusive of both the reduction in the rate, the corporate rate, and then also moving from bonus depreciation to full expensing of capital. And so, that $275 million is offset then by $50 million to $75 million of an increase that we can expect as our pre-tax earnings growth. And then, when we look at 2017, we did have some tax planning benefits that won't repeat. We talked about pulling forward some of our capital spend into the fourth quarter. We also accomplished a number of other tax planning initiatives in the fourth quarter that provided us some benefit. So, all in all, I think you focused on that $275 million and the $50 million to $75 million of increase and that says, what kind of flow-through that we would expect in free cash flow in the year ahead. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got you. And just on capital allocation, Jim, how are you thinking about M&A? I know there's antitrust issues in the solid waste business, maybe there's some tuck-ins, seller expectations are higher, as we heard from one of your peers earlier. What's your priority in terms of M&A as you look at the business on a go-forward basis, whether it's industrial waste or other avenues, energy? I know you want to be investment grade, so that maybe you don't limit sort of the sizing of M&A, but just any color on capital allocation, specifically M&A? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. Specific to M&A, Hamzah, I think we've said many times on calls that right down the middle of the fairway seems to be working pretty well for us. So, solid waste, if I had to kind of order these, I would say solid waste would be first, but there are some tangential businesses that may not be straight down the middle but are very good businesses that we like. Certainly, energy services is a business that shown some real nice growth, particularly in the latter half of 2017, and we expect that going forward into 2018. So, that's a business that we like. The haz waste business we like as well and anything related to the industrial services business, because it does appear that the economy is growing and will grow in 2018 and 2019 in those areas. And then recycling, even though recycling is down, it's a business that we still are committed to. So, those are probably the key areas. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Congratulations, Jim, on your retirement and the 10 grandkids. Thanks. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks. I'm still here, Hamzah, and no more grandkids, I hope. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much for taking the questions. Devina, can we start \u2013 or Devina and Jims, can we start with the CapEx, the incremental $100 million, just to understand that. That's replacing vehicles faster, it's not necessarily adding trucks faster, it's the way to think about that. Plus growth would be \u2013 you had a really good volume here. So, you got some incremental sell development you need to deal with, that's the way to think about that? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, I think with regards to the fleet part of the answer, Michael, I would actually revise that to say it is both. So, it's replacing some of our existing fleet faster and it's investing in trucks \u2013 incremental trucks as we see core commercial and industrial collection growth. And then you're right, we've seen accelerated landfill volume increases. And so, we'll build out more on the sell development side as well. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, following through on the route additions, this is being driven by true underlying volume growth. I mean, in my 30 years of covering this, there was a time where a garbage company would add a truck at 45 hours' worth of utilization and hope it grew into 50 hours' worth of utilization. And now, my sense is that collection is fundamentally full and you're starting to find yourself at 55 hours on average, so, let's add the 11th truck when the 10th truck route to get back to 50 hours; that's the way to think about it? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Michael, the way I look at it, we grew commercial and industrial volume, as I stated in the script, I mean, at very healthy numbers, yet our routes grew about 1%. So, we're at a local district level, we probably \u2013 we look at it your way, but across the company, we're looking at it on a gross metric standpoint and then seeing where the biggest growth opportunity is as we look forward. We look very closely at each fall when we do strategic planning with our areas at what MSAs are growing. What's our GDP? And what do we expect from them? And that also affects the truck side of the house. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Jim and Michael, I would say that speaks to the success, which we've talked about for a couple of years, the success of our service delivery optimization program. I mean, when you're only growing your routes by 1%, and you're growing your volume by 2.3%, that tells you that you're doing something right on the efficiency side through John and Jeff Harris. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. We, for example, Michael, owned the SDO, our efficiency and process that we rolled out several years ago. We've got 98% of our districts that are up about 98% of our routes are certified. So, we're really pushing to continue to get that efficiency. And your overall concept is right, but we may look at it metric-wise a little differently. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And if I follow-through then on the CapEx, is this an 2018 \u2013 I'm running at a higher rate of normalized pace and therefore, I can think of your free cash flow as actually having \u2013 there's another (46:41) $100 million of play there to the upside, that's the way to think of \u2013 because the other way to put it -look at this is and I would pursue it further with Devina, is if you finished the year at $1.77 billion, but you're going to a midpoint of $2 billion, and I got something in the $200 million as tax related, then it doesn't look like there's a lot of operating growth there when in reality there is. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: We've got a great deal of operating growth in the free cash flow line. So, I would say, first, with regard to capital and how we think about it over the long term, we've talked for a long time about 9% to 10% being our target capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue. And certainly, our pricing focus in growing our revenue through price is one of the tools that helps for us to maintain that discipline in capital expenditures. But when you look over the long term, in years where volume growth is lower, we didn't just trend toward the bottom of that range, we often broke through and were in the 8% range. So, when we're looking at capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue over the long term in the future, if we continue to see the level of volume growth that we saw in 2017 and expect in 2018, you can expect our capital expenditures to be above the high-end of that typical range, because we're going to be really focused on making sure that we deploy assets in a way to participate in growth. And so, we finished 2017 at about 10.5% of revenue. And if you look at 2018 in the plan, it'll take us to about 10.7% to 11% of revenue in capital in the year ahead. And so, it's too early for us to start to give guidance on 2019 and 2020. But I can tell you that if we see the economy responds the way we expect it to with tax reform and potentially infrastructure spending ahead, then you can see us continue to spend a higher level of capital. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Michael, I would add one thing to what Devina said, and that is that, in my mind, the best indicator of how the business is doing is the single biggest component of free cash flow, which is EBITDA. And if you look at our EBITDA guidance that we gave and you factor in that we've got $65 million in there that was for the $2,000 bonus, you've got somewhere between $55 million and $65 million in headwind on recycling and still providing growth of kind of $200 million to $225 million, which is kind of 4.8% to 6%, something like that, in a 2.5% to 3.5% economy, whatever it is; that's pretty darn strong. I think it tells you that the core business is really performing well. We're pleased with the business, we're pleased with the economy that we're handed here. And so, that free cash flow number, Devina went through it well, but I think the number \u2013 the underlying number that is most impressive is that EBITDA number. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. And to that and Devina, in 3Q, you reset the baseline and free cash flow to $1.6 billion. What's that number look like now post tax reform? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: So, I think at this point, with the higher CapEx we're seeing and somewhat of a position that the American economy is not really used to, the corporate America is not used to, which is lower corporate taxes and what to do with those. I mean that really, honestly, Michael, has been the central question around corporate tax reform is will companies return it directly to shareholders? Or will they inject it in the economy and see it come out the other side in the form of higher economic growth? I think before we give a number that is a higher baseline \u2013 by the way, it is going to be higher. I mean just to be clear here, our free cash flow baseline is going up, but we need the next few months to figure out by how much. And some of that is because the way we handle taxes or this tax or these tax reform dollars is a little different than just simply tacking them on to free cash flow. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. In your guidance, the 2% for price, if I look at your summary datasheet the way you disaggregated for collection, disposal, recycling, season, fuel, that 2% would imply about a $290 million growth in dollars. How do I break that up in \u2013 at least what's the recycling headwind of that in \u2013 when I think about that to get to the $290 million on the revenue line? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: When we look at revenue, you're speaking about our 2018 guidance? Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Yeah. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So when we look at the expected headwinds from recycling to revenue, we think it's about $100 million in the year ahead. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then, retention, where do you stand at this juncture in your retention within the 20,000 employees that are drivers and mechanics? And what is the opportunity there and at what pace do you think you can improve it? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we're probably close to 20% when we think about turnover. And so, what's interesting about that, Michael, is that in our first two years, our turn \u2013 half of our turnover takes place with employees. I'm really talking about those two job groups that you mentioned. But half of that turnover takes place in the first two years. So, if we can get them to that whatever the magic is to that date, if we can get them to year \u2013 the end of year two, then we hang onto them. They choose to really make a career with Waste Management. That was part of our objective with the $2,000 was, first of all, we buy ourselves a year and so somebody that is at currently at 14 months with the company, now we get them pass that to your point to the extent that there is some magic to that. And then, we'll also have the next 11 months, 10 months to really analyze and see is there merit to some type of longer-term retention program? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And, Michael, we've spent a lot of time looking at this issue of driver and technician retention. And the other thing that I'd just add just a little bit of color to Jim's point, that was right on target, was that if you'd look at efficiency or our risk cost or our customer scores from drivers, those longer-tenured drivers just kill it compared to that first year or two new driver. So, not only do you get the value, the obvious value from retention, you get it on the true core business side as well that, we think, will add real value long-term as we get that number down as low as we can. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: And by the way, we haven't baked any improvements in that number that I gave you, Michael, into any plan. And we've got some numbers that show that the cash cost of a turnover employee can be in the range of $12,000 to a higher number. I mean, I've seen some numbers that are higher than that, it's quite a bit higher than that and none of that's baked in. So, to the extent that we actually improve our turnover in 2018 with the $2,000, that ends up being just gravy for us. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. And then, on the volume side, is Fairfax out now in 2018, it's out of the number? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. It's back up. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. It's back up. And then, on deals, I just want to make sure I get the $100 million to $200 million, but you're referring to what you're spending, not dollars or revenues, or is it dollar or revenues? I just want to make sure I was... James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: That's what we're spending, right. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You're spending, okay. And so, you're staying with the $100 million to $200 million for now, and we'll see what the pace of activity, and people (55:10) James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. And, look, I mean, that number is kind of a squishy number because last year, it was $200 million and the year before, it was $100 million, but then there's been years where we've \u2013 all of a sudden a deal has come across the table that looked really good to us and we spent deaf and bar (55:25) and we spent $500 million or $450 million or whatever so. So, that number is kind of a guidance number but that number can change, and particularly, this year as we think about corporate and individual tax reform. We've given a number of a $100 million to $200 million but that could very easily change. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: We didn't build anything about that $100 million to $200 million in our guidance. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. And then lastly on the recycling, the 4 to \u2013 goes sense in 3Q, it goes to 8.2% some of that has to be taxes, but the rest of it is there's more expense, there was less lower price. And I was curious to mix and then the other is just you're pretty big exporter to China, I'm assuming you have found alternatives. And so you've found places for the volume to go now and we have to wait and see how the market pricing behaves once the Chinese New Year is over. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I'll share this with Trevathan on the first part. Really it is low \u2013 this is the low, this is a slow time of the year for China. So, they're not buying a lot of cardboard at this point. So, this is the right time of year for them to do it, not coincidence that they did this with a Green Fence a few years ago during the same time a year. And how that's kind of plays out for us is that we're seeing because of the lower demand you're seeing prices drop off. So, we've seen, I think Jim, a 24% decrease in price in the fourth quarter and we're projecting something in that neighborhood maybe even a little more in Q1. And then starting to normalize in terms of commodity prices in Q2, but particularly in Q3 and Q4. And then the other side is, is cost, and because of these contamination limits of 0.5%, we are seeing our processing cost to go up. And so we're \u2013 that's something that we have some control over and we're in the process of addressing that going forward. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Hey, Michael, to your first part, yeah, we have outlets for our materials. We talked about it quite a bit on the last couple of calls. We've spend a lot of time, our team at corporate, we think, are the best in the industry at finding outlets for materials. And we've done that aggressively. It doesn't affect cost, cost is still down, but we absolutely have outlets for our materials. But Jim mentioned contamination, I also want to mention, we're looking to reclaim part of that contamination cost over time. We did a lot of work as we've talked about the last three or four years, around the business model itself. And contracts are part of that and we've gotten real value, this is still a really valuable business to our shareholder, but to our customers. And we've gotten value out of those contract changes that got rid of floor pricing. Most of them added contamination charges, we \u2013 for third-party volumes, we're charging contamination charges and it started to get more aggressive in that regard. For the public sector contracts, most of them have the clauses in place, but getting it from those residential customers is a little different task. And we're aggressively ramping-up that effort as well, to try to reclaim that cost. And again, improve the business model itself, so that long-term, these kinds of changes are managed properly. But without a doubt, we're getting rid of our materials, have no issues there, but it is affecting price and cost because of the transportation. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I don't think it's overstating it, Michael, to say we're going to go to battle against contamination here. And I think that's better for us economically. It's also better for the environment. So, it's the right thing to do on all fronts, but we are definitely going to go to battle against contamination. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: This is fascinating \u2013 I realized this is in the form to continue that part of the conversation, but it's the fascinating part of the conversation, because it means getting back to the municipality and everybody having an honest conversation about how this has been approached from the start, at the point of collection... James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: You're exactly right. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And it's about creating a sustainable business model, as well as sustainable benefit to the environment. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: All right. We better let Corey talk or he's going to hang up. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Corey is next. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, one last thing, Jim Trevathan, I've known you for most of that 39 years and I can say that you are leaving just better than you found it, both your business and the community you're serving. It's been a pleasure and thank you. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Good morning. I love that previewing that I'm next. I can prepare; thank you. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: I see it on the board, here. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yeah. And Jim Trevathan, congratulations on sprinting into the sunset and hope it's a good final year. So, just a couple of questions. So, first of all, actually maybe hitting on a couple of things you've been talking about. On the cost side, so as you mentioned, Jim Fish, the EBITDA improvement includes that $65 million in bonuses. Can you just talk a little bit? I'm looking for more about how you're thinking about this, not like a definitive answer, but it's kind of philosophy, why did you decide a one-time bonus was kind of the right thing to do? And how you're thinking about like for modeling out 2019, should we say that well that $65 million goes away, or you're thinking about ways you're going to reinvest, maybe now with another bonus, but other things you're going to do along similar lines for retention purposes? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Corey. I mean, look, there were a couple of objectives and we've talked about them on the call and in other forms. But beyond just injecting dollars into the economy and giving something, as Devina mentioned, to those employees that don't participate in the salary and incentive plans, we've talked a lot today about the fact that we \u2013 that part of the objective was to encourage our folks to make careers at Waste Management. Keep in mind, this is somewhat of kind of uncharted water for us, because we haven't \u2013 I would argue that nobody on the call or at this table has been through something where we've seen a big tax reduction like this and how that is best returned to shareholders. I mean, is it best returned to shareholders just through a straight share repurchase, or is it best returned to shareholders through injecting it back to the economy and then seeing that growth? And so, as we've thought about what to do with some of those dollars as it relates to our employees, we felt we don't really know the answer. And so, a piece of that objective was to buy ourselves a little bit of time, hence the payout at the end of the year and help us by doing that in designing programs for the future, potentially that help us with retention. So, I don't know whether that answers your question, but that was really our thinking. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yeah, that's fine. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: I think one more \u2013 just one more piece of color there. I'd like to stress that that $2,000 per employee was not in place to combat wage inflation in any sense. We we've got a process in place. We work really closely with our HR teams. We look at the demand, the competitive wages by MSA, and we adjust accordingly. We've found a few that we think needed changes and then we changed them, and we'll continue to look at that. This has nothing to do with just normal wage inflation. It's to look strategically at our employees and how do we improve that retention issue. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: That's absolutely right. It wasn't promised, by the way, either, Corey. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: No, I appreciate that answer. And then on the volume front, maybe this is another slightly hard question to answer but, Jim Fish, in the past you've talked about focusing somewhat, I think, disproportionately on opportunities for growth in parts of either the economy or the country that are growing as opposed to looking for volume kind of everywhere. Is that still the case? And part of what I'm looking for is kind of an adjustable market opportunity number like how much of the country do you put in that bucket now, and how much of the country would you say is not in that kind of growth, so we're not seeing \u2013 you're not going to go after volumes as much? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I think, the good news here, Corey, is \u2013 and you're right that's how we used to talk about it was that, hey, it looks pretty good in Texas but the rest of the country doesn't look very good. It looks good in Florida but not so good in the Northeast. I would tell you right now as we go through our monthly financial reviews and talk to our area vice presidents, boy, it's hard to find an area that doesn't have some strength. Now, there are some areas that are stronger than others. California for example is absolutely fantastic for us right now as is Florida. Texas has been, excluding the hurricane cleanup, has been a little slower because of the energy business but that's starting to come back. But even places that historically have been slow for three decades that's kind of rust belt area, have started to show some real promise in terms of growth : Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania. New England's been good for us as well. So, I've named just about every area for us. Canada is doing well for us as well. Western Canada is a little bit more like Texas because it's more energy-driven. But I would expect that Western Canada will start to pick up just like Texas is. So, hard to come up with one that's not doing pretty well right now. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Great. And just one last quick one. As we're modeling out the quarters of the year, is there anything you'd point out to us as far as like particularly difficult comps or event-driven work or I don't know if the hurricanes make a big difference, but where you see kind of meaningful changes in volume relative to the full year numbers as you look quarter-to-quarter? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I think, really, we've talked about this a lot as we prepared for this call. And the only business that gives us pause right now is recycling. We, obviously, increased from $0.04 to kind of an $0.08 to $0.10 so, basically a $0.09 number in terms of headwind for 2018. If something unexpected were to happen, if something crazy were to happen in China, if they just simply decided not to buy OCC, which I don't know how they could do that, as a huge exporter. But if they decided they're going to stay at the same level of purchase for the remainder of the year that they are today, yeah, that would throw a wrench into our operation a bit. But keep in mind that that's still, on a revenue basis, recycling is still 10% or less of our overall revenue base. So, the only thing that causes me to say, okay, this one could impact us would be recycling. The rest of our guidance, including our traditional solid waste, looks very, very strong right now. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And Corey, the only other one is on the landfill side, all that storm debris happened in the second half of the year. So, just landfill comps will get more difficult in that regard. But the core MSW shouldn't be affected; it should be still strong, regardless of the quarter. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Got it. Thanks for the answers. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : And your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. And just to pick-up right there, amplifying Corey's question. It looks like the volume comps were actually stronger in the first half of the year, all-in, for 2017. So I mean, just picking a little bit more precisely about the cadence of volume for 2018, that 2%, I mean, should it be a little bit lower in the first half of the year and gathering strength maybe in the third quarter? Is that the right way to think about it? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Well actually, Noah, in 2017, those volume comps, the way they trended, had a lot to do with the anniversary of the National Account business. And so, that's what you saw impact 2017, particularly in the commercial line of business. So, we don't have that same, kind of, large contracts that we'll be anniversarying in the year ahead. So, other than what Jim mentioned with regard to the landfill volumes and the storm debris, there's not anything that would dramatically influence the quarter-by-quarter volume trends in 2018. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I will say, Noah, what is encouraging to us, as we look into 2018, is that we're through the month of January, obviously, and when we look at January's volume, with slow volume on recycling, we still had a very good month. So, we're encouraged with what we saw in the month of January; it's a small sample, it's 1 out of 12, but January looked encouraging. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for that. And then I think, just thinking about price/volume mix, for many years, I think at least going back five years' average yields on collection and disposal was always higher than volume. I mean certainly, we're shedding some unwanted or low-margin business strategically. Now in 2017, we've seen volume actually outstrip yield and looks like they're kind of on par for 2018. So, can you just comment as to how the strategy is playing out? I mean, is this basically the result of many years of kind of leading with price, because now the way it looks, it looks like it's not necessarily price-like growth? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: I think, no. We're \u2013 we have not changed our strategy regarding price at all. We will go get our core price guidance numbers and we'll execute that. Those processes are in place and we're pretty good at it at the area level with corporate leading the way. The volume change, the economy has helped some, obviously. We think we've gotten better. We know we have on the defection side. We've gotten some again, the storm debris kind of things that helped that volume to price relationship, improve the volume side of the house. The outage that we've talked about in Virginia did; special waste was strong last year especially in the second half of the year and should move forward. But most of that has come from economic change from our focus on defection and from our attempt to go put the right resources in the right cities and MSAs to take advantage of the volume that's occurring per GDP. That's what Jim talked about. So, as the opportunity is there, we've gotten better at getting that volume. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: One question, Noah, that hasn't been asked which has direct bearing on your question is CPI. I mean, we typically don't talk about CPI because for the last few years, it's worked against us and we've just said we'll get our price numbers irrespective of what CPI does. But CPI does impact about \u2013 and we have kind of indexed base pricing on about 35% of our total business. And we've always said that about a 10 basis point increase in CPI equates to a $0.01 per share. We've built in some increase, call it, 20 basis points into our pricing for 2018. But we all saw the CPI numbers that came out yesterday, that we're higher than most people expected. So, there could be some upside there, albeit kind of on a half-year basis because we've already taken, we tend to take our index-type price increases in January and July with a few of them lingering into October. But on a full year basis, once we get a full year of the CPI, I would expect that there will be some tailwind for us from CPI, but we won't get the full tailwind in 2018. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much for answering the question and anticipating it, Jim. I'll jump back in the queue. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Noah. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, good morning. It's Henry Chien, and I'm calling for Jeff. Thanks for going into the pricing. I was going to ask of how much of that is embedded in the core price? But I was just curious to hear your thoughts on how sustainable achieving that kind of 4% core price growth? And are you seeing any competition in getting the new contracts? And then, just trying to understand how much of this kind of seems like above market pricing growth that you're able to achieve over the next few years? Thanks. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Henry. I don't see any different competitive landscape than we've had for the last couple of years. It is a very competitive business, and I think it always will be. It has been and will be. Volume obviously helps in that from \u2013 it comes from the economy. There are more start-ups that give all of us a better opportunity to get some volume growth, but our core price strategy isn't going to change for our core collection customers. We're still \u2013 the marketplace allows it, we go get that core price increase and we will in 2018. And I think the teams are set up and ready to do again in 2019 and 2020 and on. I just don't see that changing, and I don't see a competitive difference today than two or five years ago. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. Great. That's good to hear. And in terms of \u2013 I just wanted to switch back to M&A and your acquisition strategy. With growth kind of accelerating all throughout the U.S., do you imagine any shift or are you thinking of any shift in the types of acquisitions you're looking at, whether it's expanding your routes or putting more of a focus on that in the collection business, or I know you mentioned industrial is the kind of potential opportunity, but just curious in your thoughts there? Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: The only thing, Henry, that could come to mind that might be a little different, and we certainly haven't identified anything down this path but would be something technology-related. I think other than that, you won't see us stray too far outside of kind of our norm in terms of M&A. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You bet. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'm just curious, though, like what is your view on the optimal leverage ratio for this company? Clearly, free cash flow is going up. You have a higher baseline of free cash flow. I guess I'm just trying to think what should we be thinking about the leverage at this part of the waste cycle? I mean, surely we're below that right now. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, are you speaking to debt to EBITDA? Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Is that what you're asking with regard to leverage? Yeah. We're certainly below our long-term averages. We're at the best level, I think, that the company has ever been, certainly in my tenure. And we've talked for a long time about the fact that our goal is a solid investment-grade rating. And so, we'll continue to prioritize that when we think about leverage. We don't chase leverage up as our business grows and as EBITDA grows by allocating more cash to things that aren't accretive to the business for the long term. That's our first priority, is ensuring that we continue to invest dollars to grow that return on invested capital and grow our business over the long term. So, we don't want to make short-term decisions that would affect the leverage. We, certainly, are comfortable with where we are today and we're comfortable up to around 3.25 times because we think that is what \u2013 is needed to maintain our investment-grade rating. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. And just lastly, you guys are clearly investing in the business, investing your fleet, and using tax reform as a benefit. You mentioned how routes, for you guys, are up 1%, is there any concern that you're seeing smaller players maybe adding routes or adding trucks ahead of the underlying volume growth? I know you guys are being disciplined. I'm just trying to get a sense of what you're seeing in the tightness of the market and out of the smaller players. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Michael, I haven't seen any change in the 2016 or 2017 versus the historical view that all of our competitors whether they're small third parties or the majors. I think, in general, this is a disciplined business that rewards those who act in a disciplined manner and, I think, the industry is for the most part. I mean, there are always one-offs, but not that would affect any of us over the long haul. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And if I could just lastly, I mean, you mentioned recycling is part of core. You're exploring that that's part of the pillars of what you're looking at with M&A. Just to push you a little bit on that. Is that more looking at trying to have more scale or is it more looking at a certain technology? And what would you actually be kind of focusing on with M&A when it comes to recycling? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You're right. I answered it maybe at an earlier question about technology, and that might be a place where we would look at, at technology. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're already looking at and testing, piloting some technology in the recycling line of business. We're always looking for where there's kind of innovation within our business. But recycling might be an area where we would find some. It would be nice to smooth out the volatility of that business. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Okay. In closing, first and foremost, our sincere thoughts and prayers go out to the Community Park on Florida. Look, no one should have to go through what they faced yesterday. With such a horrific act and, I would tell you, this has become all too common in today's society. So, Parkland, you're in our prayers for sure. Secondly, and on a far more positive notes. I'd like to say a few words about two really great friends and great executives Jeff Harris and Jim Trevathan. Their retirement date is still 11 months away but at that date, Jim and Jeff will have dedicated 59 years between the two of them to Waste Management. And really a lot of where we are today, the heights that we've achieved of late are due to those two guys, to Jeff Harris and Jim Trevathan. So, we'll, obviously, talk more about them as we get closer to their retirement dates. But over the next 10 months, I plan to try and absorb a lot of the knowledge and wisdom and expertise that they have and that they've developed over those 59 years. And I'm sure that the rest of our senior leadership team will be doing the same thing. Thanks for your time today and we'll talk to you next quarter.

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James Fish : Thanks, Ed. And thank you, all for joining us this morning. The first quarter of 2018 was an excellent quarter that continued the strong growth we saw throughout 2017.  Over the past year our traditional solid waste business has proven to be a strong as we have ever seen at Waste Management and the first quarter was continuation of that trend. Much of the strength can be attributed to our focus on discipline growth, our commitment to delivering exceptional customer service and our improving cost structure, aided by solid economic growth in the United States and Canada. In the first quarter, we saw collection and disposal revenue grow by more than 6%, total company operating income grow by 9% and operating EBITDA grow by almost 8%. Once again our strong operating EBITDA performance translated into excellent free cash flow, which continues to demonstrate the cash generation strength of our strategy.  The strong performance in our free cash flow allowed us to repurchase shares and spend $248 million on acquisitions, in addition to our previously announced 9.4% increase in our dividend. The acquisition pipeline remains robust and we continue to look for opportunities that surpass our return criteria and create value for our shareholders. Our operations produced $0.91 of EPS in the quarter, and we have built a strong foundation for the remainder of 2018. Excluding the $0.12 EPS benefit from tax reform, our EPS grew close to 20% when compared to the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter, revenues from our collection and disposal business grew by more than $183 million with most of this increase being organically driven. A key driver of our revenue growth was the disciplined execution of our pricing programs. In the first quarter our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and our yield was 2.3%, in line with our full year goals.  Looking at volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 3.4% in the first quarter, an increase of 200 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017. The volume growth continues to be driven by our highest return and best margin businesses, commercial, landfill and industrial.  Our plan to focus on delivering excellent customer service and directing our sales efforts and growth capital to the portions of the U.S. and Canadian economies that are seeing the strongest economic development is generating the results that we expected. Our traditional solid waste performance is as good as we have seen it. On the other hand the recycling business is in a state of transformation. In the quarter, recycling commodities -- recycling commodity prices declined 36% and volumes declined 1% at our recycling facilities. And while recycling is only one-tenth of the size of our traditional solid waste business, it still impacted the first quarter EPS by $0.08 on a year-over-year basis.  We\u2019ve said for years, that recycling is a business that Waste Management is committed to and we still are. But we simply can\u2019t continue with the model in its current state. The original concept of recycling was to reuse materials either in their existing form or in some other form to minimize the consumption of natural resources. Unfortunately in North America today the word recycling seems to have been replaced with a new word, diversion. When diversion away from your trash pan is your primary goal then putting more material in the recycle bin does not necessarily mean that we're saving more natural resources. What it does mean is that the recycle bin almost inevitably has a higher percentage of trash or as the industry calls it contamination. Last year, the Chinese government decided that they were tired of importing increasingly contaminated recyclables. So they changed their policy to only accept recyclables with the 0.5% contamination content. Some of our plans see material come in the front door that is 40% trash. So we have to try and pull out almost 99% of that trash from the recycle stream in order to sell it to China as recycled commodities. Even our best-in-class inbound streams, which have only 10% contaminations still have to pull out 95% of the trash before they can sell it. As diversion goals have increased so too have our contamination percentages, which have increased from 10% to 15% five years ago to 20% to 25% today.  In addition to that, China temporarily suspended import licenses, which caused global commodity prices to plummet last fall and they have yet to recover. Clearly, this is not a sustainable recycling business model. We must address higher operating cost in our recycling facilities and shrinking revenues from the sale of recycled products. As a result, we are continuing to educate our customers on how to lower contamination by recycling right and partnering with industry stakeholders on expanding these efforts. At the same time, we are auditing loads received at our centers [ph] and we are rejecting and charging back for contamination where we can. These efforts should enable us to recoup part of our increased processing costs and residue disposal costs. In our new contracts, we are looking to shift even more of the commodity price risk to our customers and more easily recapture our actual processing costs going forward. We started this shift several years ago by restructuring contracts and this is the next evolution in that shift.  Lastly, we are communicating with our customers on the extent of these global recycling market changes. Our customers appreciate the transparency Waste Management provides and they seem willing to work with us to ensure the longevity of the recycling business. While these are difficult times in recycling, our goal in this transformation is to build a recycling program for both Waste Management and our customers that ensures environmental and economic sustainability for the long-term. Ultimately, we hope to see a shift in thinking away from the value being placed on how much gets put into the cart to how much truly gets recycled into new products. So while our recycling results in the first quarter were about what we expected, our recycling outlook for the remainder of 2018 has changed from our original guidance. We're already hard at work to combat contamination and control our costs, but the financial benefits of our actions will likely take time to materialize. And since our previous guidance, OCC prices have declined to nine year lows and mixed paper has dropped 80% to prices at zero or negative in some markets. So we now believe that the year-over-year decline in our recycling line of business will be between $0.12 and $0.15 per share versus our original guidance of a negative $0.08 to $0.10. To come full circle, in spite of these significant challenges in the recycling line of business, the large majority of our business is hitting on all cylinders. And therefore we remained confident in our ability to deliver strong performance throughout the remainder of 2018. As a result, just to be clear, we are reaffirming all of our full year guidance including operating EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss the first quarter operating results in more detail. James Trevathan : Thanks, Jim and good morning. Our results in the first quarter continue the strong trend as we saw throughout all of 2017. We saw both price and volume in our traditional solid waste business exceed 2% for the fourth consecutive quarter. As a result, total company income from operations grew $50 million, an increase of 9% and income from operations margin expanded 110 basis points to 17.3% when compared to the first quarter of last year. Our operating EBITDA grew $69 million, an increase of nearly 8% when compared to the first quarter of 2017. And our operating EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points to 27.2% when compared to last year. Revenues in the quarter were $3.51 billion. First quarter revenue growth in our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume was a $160 million. First quarter revenues were negatively impacted by lower recycling commodity prices and lower volumes, which drove a $77 million decline in recycling revenues.  Looking at internal revenue growth in the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.3%. Traditional solid waste volumes improved 3.4%, while total company volumes increased 3%. Volumes in the first quarter included about 40 basis points natural disaster cleanups in Florida and California. Volumes in our transfer station line of business were 6.4%, primarily due to the new New York City disposal contract. Looking at our other revenue metrics, service increases exceeded service decreases for the 17th consecutive quarter. And new business continued to exceed lost business for the 12th consecutive quarter.  Our churn rate was 9.6% in the first quarter or 8.9% excluding the expected churn from the implementation of the City of Los Angeles franchise contract. And our rollbacks were 18.8%. Our collection lines of business continue to perform exceptionally well. In the first quarter, commercial core price was 5.9%, with volumes up 2.7%. Industrial core price was 9.9%, with volumes up 3.9% in that first quarter. In the residential line of business core price was 3.3%. Residential volumes were down 1% in the first quarter, but that is 110 basis points sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2017. The combined price and volume increases in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing $64 million, income from operations margin, growing 130 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $68 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 100 basis points. In the landfill line of business, total volume increased 9.5%, MSW volume grew 2.2%, C&D volume grew 28.1%, and combined special waste in revenue generating cover volume grew 4.5%. We achieved core price of 3.3% in the landfill line of business. For the first quarter our landfill line of business grew income from operations by $30 million and income from operations margin by 90 basis points, while operating EBITDA grew $42 million, and operating EBITDA margin rose by 100 basis points. Moving now to operating expenses, in the first quarter, total operating costs as a percent of revenue improved 80 basis points to 62.2%. On a dollar basis, cost increased $18 million when compared with the first quarter of 2017. Our cost of goods sold decreased year-over-year, primarily due to the 36% reduction in recycled commodity prices. We also had lower fuel expenses in the quarter due to the 2017 fuel tax credits, which reduced our current quarter costs by about $28 million. The costs of goods sold and the fuel benefit were partially offset by an increase in labor costs due to the $2,000 employee bonus and volume increases in our commercial and industrial businesses. When we isolate the impacts of these items to focus on the operating costs and margins of our traditional solid waste business, we are pleased that our costs control efforts are working in a growing volume environment. If we net the positive impact from the fuel tax credits with the negative impacts to margin from our recycling line of business and the employee bonus operating expense margin from our traditional solid waste business improve over 50 basis points.  Overall we are very pleased with our operating performance in the first quarter and I know our employees are hard at work to make 2018 another successful year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Devina, to discuss our financial results. Devina Rankin : Thanks, Jim, good morning, everyone. In the first quarter we continue to see our strong operating EBITDA translate into free cash flow growth. We generated $809 million of cash from operations and that\u2019s an increase of 12% from the prior year period. Our cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue grew more than 200 basis points from the prior year to 23%. We continue to demonstrate the ability to convert more of our operating EBITDA into cash from operations, positioning us very well to continue our commitment of investing in growth and returning cash to our shareholders. During the first quarter we spent $400 million on capital expenditures, that\u2019s an increase of $68 million from 2017. It is in line with our expectations as we intentionally spent more of our fleet capital early in the year to support our growth. As we have said before, we have seen significantly organic growth in our business and we\u2019re investing in our fleet and our landfills to respond to the needs of our customers. We continue to expect that our capital expenditures will be between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion for 2018. We generated $423 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, that\u2019s an increase of $26 million or more than 6% from the first quarter of 2017. In the quarter we converted more than 44% of our operating EBITDA into free cash flow. This strong performance puts us well on our way to achieving our free cash flow guidance of between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion for 2018.  In the first quarter we returned more than 100% of the free cash flow we generated to shareholders, as we paid $206 million in dividends and paid $250 million to repurchase shares. In addition we spent $248 million on traditional solid waste acquisition, demonstrating our commitment to identifying accretive transactions in growth market. That will allow us to more effectively leverage our people and our assets to service our customers. Turning to SG&A, for the first quarter as a percent of revenue SG&A costs were 10.6%, a 70 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2017. On a dollar basis SG&A costs were $373 million in the first quarter or $17 million lower than the prior year period. The reduction in SG&A costs is due to our continued focus on managing our discretionary funding, as well as a decrease in our labor expenses that can largely be attributed to prior year executive severance costs. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately 23% and we now expect our full year 2018 tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. Each of these rates is a little more than 1 percentage point less than we previously expected, this revised outlook is due to additional clarity we now have on the impacts of tax reform. The EPS benefit of this revised tax outlook was $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2018 and is projected to be about $0.06 per share for the full year. Our key financial metrics remain strong, as we continue to see the benefits of earnings growth and disciplined allocation of our free cash flow. At the end of the first quarter our debt to EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.4 times and our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 4%. The floating rate portion of our debt was 17% at the end of the first quarter.  In summary, 2018 is off to a strong start, with the first quarter reflecting the continued execution of our core operating objectives and focus on continuous improvement. Our strong traditional solid waste business performance overcame headwinds from recycling to produce a healthy increase in both cash and earnings. We expect that trend to continue throughout 2018. The Waste Management team has once again demonstrated that our disciplined focus on serving the customer, while optimizing our business generates strong operating results and we look forward to that continuing throughout the year.  With that Kevin, let\u2019s open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hi, good morning everyone. James Fish : Good morning, Brian. Brian Maguire : Hey, Jim appreciate your comments on the recycling markets these days and sounds like you guys are taking a leadership position there as you should and trying to clean up the industry and change some of the habits, practices being employed just into the new environment all seems very logical. Just some questions around the impact in 1Q from because I noticed you said there was a $0.08 hit to EPS on I think it was about $77 million of sales. I think last year\u2019s total benefit was around $0.085 on roughly 3 times the sales amounts so just wondering if you could maybe dig into that a little bit more why the sensitivity in the margin is a little bit different on the way down than it was last year on the way up. James Fish : Yes, so the EBITDA impact was about $46 million for us for the quarter and that\u2019s driven by those things I mentioned in my prepared remarks. The big decline in OCC mix, paper down 85%, but what\u2019s maybe a little different from prior years is that we\u2019re seeing a big uptick in operating costs that\u2019s as a result of that 0.5% contamination limit that China has put on. And then in addition to that think of it this way, we were shipping about 30% of our cardboard a year ago to China and it\u2019s now about 2%. Fortunately we have markets that we can ship to not everybody is that fortunate. But there\u2019s a higher transportation costs that comes with that, those markets are markets like India and Vietnam, and so the haul is longer to get to those countries versus China. So we\u2019ve seen an increase in our transportation cost as well. But I think maybe more directly to your question as we think about what this looks like going forward. There is a bare case to be made here about recycle, as well as a whole case to be made about recycling and that is that not only are we going through those steps to improve the business in the short-term, but look China needs cardboard and there\u2019s probably 5% growth of cardboards in China expected for 2018 and they really have three sources of it, one is OCC, imported OCC which I mentioned we\u2019re -- really we\u2019re not sending ours and most are not either. So they\u2019re not getting OCC from the import market.  The domestic Chinese OCC market is drastically insufficient to satisfy their demand so they\u2019ve resorted to pulp, which is just spite as a result of the artificial shortfall in supply without OCC. So I think there\u2019s a case to be made that theirs is ball case to be made here. And I think the other side of that is that we\u2019re looking for the medium and long-term at changing some of our technology and our plans, so that we can better handle contamination coming in the front door. I don\u2019t know whether that answers your question, but that\u2019s kind of the bull on bear case for us. James Trevathan : Jim maybe for Brian benefit mentioned too that alliance with your bull case right now that $0.12 to $0.15 revised guidance is based on about $80 a ton for our commodities. We\u2019re now at about $70, $72, $73 in that vicinity. So it\u2019s not a huge upside that\u2019s built into that guidance on the commodity side we have some upside expected, but we truly see that because of Jim\u2019s bull case we not fully expect that to happen. In addition if you just look at the commodity trends right now domestic OCC and we see it trending up from that April level that we saw that\u2019s exceptionally low as Jim pointed out. The export OCC we also see that trend up for the Jim\u2019s bull case example, export OMP, we see moving up from the April level significantly and that\u2019s in our guidance number. And really down one is that mix paper that we\u2019ll see moving forward as we move forward. But the point is that in that new revised guidance we got about $10 of commodity price that we build in on the upside into that guidance. James Fish : But I think the wrench in the mask there really is the operating cost that\u2019s what\u2019s -- that\u2019s kind of the short answer, we gave a long answer to your short question, but that is if you're just looking at kind of commodity prices, you should be able to kind of do the math that you were doing. The wrench is operating cost and then that\u2019s something we haven't necessarily seen and seen a big spike is what's caused the difference. Brian Maguire : That's a great answer. Just do you think then we need to maybe update the sensitivity that we've been using the $0.04 per $10 move. And then just sort of to Jim's point on what's baked into the guidance, it looks like an incremental $0.04 to $0.07 hit for the rest of the year after the $0.08 this quarter. It seems awfully low considering I think the 2Q comp will be even tougher. I would think that 2Q number would be even bigger than the $0.07 high into that range. So are you sort of assuming that it's a year-over-year good guide for the second half of the year is that what I'm hearing? Devina Rankin : So Brian, I would start by saying with regard to the guidance that we've always provided with respect to that $0.04 impact for the $10 shift in prices. What's important there is to reiterate Jim's point is that is the commodity price piece only. And so that speaks to revenue sensitivity. The operating expense sensitivity is the other piece of the equation. So we wouldn't break with that guidance, because they're not necessarily connected. So what we did see in the first quarter is that in addition to the EPS impact, which were about 75% to 80% of the $0.08 of negative impact that we saw in the quarter from commodity price changes, we also saw that OpEx be about 20% to 25% of an impact. With respect to the last part of your question, I think what's important to remember is first quarter was really the strongest quarter for recycling in the prior year. And the comps and the decline in commodity prices we really started to see in the fall of 2017. And so the more positive outlook for the remainder of the year relative to what we saw in the first quarter really has to do with the impacts of those year-over-year comps, and then to some extent starting to see some benefits of the specific action that the company is taking. James Trevathan : Yes Brian, we also on the operating costs side we expect that it's built into that guidance. We expect to see operating costs improvement versus the first quarter. We've got some strong actions underway. We look by Murf [ph] at where their commodities are being shipped. And then address the contamination cleanup level to the end marketplace. And perhaps in the first quarter we weren't as good at that as we implemented that Chinese the new standard. And you'll see operating costs on the recycle side get better that will help us meet that new guidance number versus the trend for Q1. James Fish : I know we're spending a lot of time on this question here, but this is really the -- it's the major detractor everything else was really, really strong in this quarter. And yet when you look at recycling, we knew there were going to be some questions on it. And we can go into the strength of solid waste, we talked a bit about it in our scripts. But Brian, last thing I would say is about second quarter and then guidance for the remainder of the year is when you see China do these -- kind of take these types of steps, they always do it in the first quarter. Because that is -- that's the quarter where they can afford to see OCC drop from 30% to 2% from Waste Management or from anybody else for that matter. But they do have a need as I said for cardboard and it's 5% there really is -- their options are pretty limited. I gave three and really that second option is not much of an option domestic OCC. So it's going to have to be imported OCC or pulp and pulp has doubled. So at some point they have to come back to import OCC, which is why we think the price as Jim said has some upside, much more upside potential than down side. Brian Maguire : Okay, appreciate the detailed answer. Sorry to lead off with this quirky wheel you will, but appreciate the color. James Fish : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari : Hey, good morning. The first question is just around more work you plan to do with your cash, leverage is at an all-time low, free cash flow is at all-time high, does it probably antitrust issues in growing in the core business. So the question really is do you return 100% of your free cash flow back like one of your competitors. Or are there better options for that cash? Devina Rankin : So Hamzah I would say the first quarter is a really good indicator of our confident in the free cash flow generation and the balance sheet strength that you mentioned. And as I mentioned we allocated more than 100% of free cash flow through a combination of share buyback and the dividend and then on top of that acquired $248 million of solid waste businesses. And so I think that\u2019s a really good indication of how we think about capital allocation going forward. We\u2019re continuing to commit to growing the dividend over the long-term as we did this year with a 9.4% increase on a year-over-year basis. And then we\u2019re looking at $750 million baseline of share buyback for the year, so committed to that strong allocation, as we have always been. James Fish : Hamzah those $248 million of acquisitions that Devina mentioned it\u2019s seven or eight transaction in Q1 of excellent tuck-ins that are in really good markets for us, where we\u2019re asset strong and can internalize and get some synergies out of that material. So we\u2019re excited about that revenue that was added. Early pipeline for 2018 is strong as well, and we\u2019ll still look for really good acquisitions at a fair price, they are accretive to our business and expect to do more of them in 2018. Hamzah Mazari : Great. And then just second question, I know you gave a lot of detail on recycling, but my question is a little more specific around recycling is, overtime you have restructured some contracts, you have tried to derisk that business. But I guess the question is, is the real issue that you need to restructure contracts to get processing costs back or is it protection of downside of pricing and is the issue is more municipalities that you are dealing with. Question is more from a contract structure perspective, can you do anything? James Trevathan : Yes, Hamzah, we are doing something about that, this week in fact a few of us from the SLT met with our public sector team they work from each of our 17 areas. We had already rolled out a three phase plan to do just that and look at contracts in their existing form, where we can make operating changes around contamination and then look for opportunities to renegotiate current agreement. Some will have to wait till the end of the term and take a hard look, but our customers fully understand the situation that we\u2019re in with contamination and we\u2019re taking strong action in that regard. The last action what three or four years ago is primarily around floor pricing and getting the price right. What we\u2019re having to do now because of the reset button of recycling business is take a look at that contamination and make sure that we\u2019re getting that fair payment for processing. And as Jim mentioned in his earlier statements, make sure that the customer's taking the risk on commodity price not just us. James Fish : Really Hamzah -- this is Jim and I just going to reiterate this point that Jim has made. Contamination is the route of this, it is -- and it goes back to that statement I made earlier, which is we\u2019ve kind gone away from recycling to diversion. So there is this lack of congruency here between recycling more meaning putting it to an alternative use or turning it back into the same thing, turning a plastic bottle back into another plastic bottle. And we have gone to diversion, which means I divert more away from my trash bin into my recycle bin. And inevitably that ends up meaning that you\u2019re going to have more trash in your recycle bin and that is what we\u2019ve seen. The numbers that I gave are actual numbers, five years ago we\u2019re in the 10% to 15% contamination range at our single streams, and now we are 20% to 25% and that I think is what caused China to ultimately say we\u2019re tired of importing your trash, so get your act together. So it may not be a message that\u2019s necessarily pleasing to hear for our customers, but it\u2019s not our trash that we\u2019re creating. This is coming out in the inbound side and when you have some plans that are 40% contamination in the inbound stream, that simply can\u2019t continue. Devina Rankin : And Hamzah I would add that the contract renegotiations that we did over the last three to five years really did provide some real value to the company in 2018 we expected to provide value over the course of the year, it could have been that much worse. If you think about where we resulted -- where our Q1 results reflect the recycling line of business to be, which as Jim said was a $46 million year-over-year decline in EBITDA. We actually estimate that the impact from recycling for 2018 could have been as much as $0.08 to $0.10 worse than we\u2019re projecting is not for the work already done by our teams. Hamzah Mazari : Got it, very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much for taking the question and if I can ask your different thread on the recycling, because I thought your explanation of the demand was good, but can you help us think about if they use 1Q to do whatever they want to do, what's the pattern look like typically April, May, June, July, August. What do you see and one of your biggest customers is Nine Dragons and they are adding 2 million tons of capacity in middle of the year, how does that layer into some of the thinking? Can you get a little more color around that? James Fish : Yes, I mean I think Michael, first of all the pattern tends to be as they prepare cardboard for shipping for the Christmas season, it tends to be kind of Q2 and Q3, it's not Q4. So we've typically seen pricing, commodity pricing drop off in Q4. Couple of years ago it did not and that was somewhat unusual, but historically you've seen kind of the low course be Q1 and Q4 and the stronger quarters be Q2 and Q3. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And so your anticipation is given the fundamentals and all the little brown boxes that show up in all of our houses that demand driver is going to be good in 2 and 3? James Fish : Well, look it\u2019s not as if China is not going to ship cardboard boxes. So, if you believe that their growth year-over-year is going to be 5%. They\u2019ve got to find the cardboard somewhere, but we don't take issue with their point on contamination, I mean, if what's coming into their -- to Nine Dragons is heavily contaminated, it increases their costs. So I think they have taken a stance and it's hard to argue that stance, but once we start cleaning out the stream and that's why we spent a fair amount doing that. And I think you'll see them start to import where we're seeing a bit of that already and then I think the price will come along with that. We're not projecting prices up where they were in 2017, but certainly as Jim said, we think prices will bounce off of where they were in March. James Trevathan : Michael, we think we'll come out of this reset even stronger than before. We -- our brokerage business is the great example of that, what we shipped to China in Q1 for example two-thirds of it came from our brokerage volumes very clean materials. And that we could combine with materials from our Murf that we appoint appropriately. So, we think that we'll come through this fine and that demand has to be there. We expected to grow and as I mentioned earlier with the Brian's question that export OCC, we think has some real upside over the April numbers and we bake that in and we see signs of it. Michael Hoffman : And are you still approximately 50-50 brokerage versus your own Murf rev when the rev dollar? James Fish : Might be a little bit higher or our own but more like 60-40 maybe, but yes, I mean, in that neighborhood. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then switching gears to solid waste business, a year ago you had a 19% year-over-year growth in C&D and you come back in 2018 and done 28% and we had a regular winter. Can you talk about what's going on across your 17 regions and what you are seeing because that's really good? James Fish : Yes, I think Michael, you've talk about a lot in some of your reporting, I mean, if you look at housing starts, housing starts have been on a really nice consistent upward trend with March I think being the highest number that we've seen over the last few years and I think 1.3 or something like that. It's not up to where it was in 2006 at 2.1 or a big number like that. But it's been a nice consistent upward trend. And so hence we're seeing that sharpen our C&D business and I might kind of answer a question for you in advance here, but because we've spend so much time on recycling, let me just give you Michael and everyone a number here that that is really eye opening about the strength of the solid waste business and that is our EBITDA growth. When you think about EBITDA, and we showed a number of $69 million in growth in EBITDA for the quarter, but what's included in that is the bonus, which the $2 bonus, which was $18 million we already talked about the $46 million headwind in recycling. And then the fuel tax credit, which was $28 million positive for us. If you said let\u2019s adjust for those and just see what the solid waste business is doing, the traditional solid waste adjusting those three things out, you get $105 million in growth, which is 11.9%, almost 12% almost all organic growth in an EBITDA line and a 2.5% economy. So -- and if you do that math on a free cash line it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous the number is so good. So I think Mike I\u2019ve kind of answered a question that you didn\u2019t asked, but maybe you were going to get to it or somebody else was. But I know we\u2019re going to spent a lot of time talking about recycling, but I want to everybody understand first of all recycling is one-tenth the size of the solid waste business and the solid waste business is absolutely rocking and rolling right now. James Trevathan : And Michael the 28% that you mentioned on C&D you\u2019re right that\u2019s a really strong number. I don\u2019t see that moving forward at that level in future quarters that\u2019s a lot of that volume for the national disaster clean ups in Florida and in Northern California. Yet it will be positive it was last year even before given the construction activity in North America. So it\u2019ll be positive, but it isn\u2019t going to be a 28% in my estimation, I\u2019d love for that to happen. The other point to mention is that C&D is about 10% of our total landfill volume. So although very positive the rest of the lines of business in landfill were really strong as well. Michael Hoffman : And that was where I was going to go with this is, ultimately this is a very consumer sensitive business because what happens in commercial collection and when you look at weight on a same-store basis in commercial collection, how do you frame that trend? James Fish : Yes, Michael I don\u2019t see it up dramatically it\u2019s in fact slightly down by container, which is unusual because the total volume looked really healthy. You saw it for all of the lines of business both price and volume were extremely healthy. So I'm not sure that\u2019s -- I know that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving it is the weight by container, it\u2019s the total volume of our business. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And if weight is not rising there, but you\u2019re getting the level of pricing, so what\u2019s supporting that, because you are heavily urban model. So the level of pricing you\u2019re getting given as urban as you are and as much competition as you have to deal with, is impressive. James Fish : Yes, you look Michael at the two lines of business that are driving that, the commercial and the industry line of business. I think Jim nailed it in his opening comments and that\u2019s we have excellent asset in those urban markets. We have moved some really strong process and people and to those growth markets and are getting at least our fair share of the growth in those MSAs in commercial and in the industrial lines of business. It\u2019s helping the collection side, but it\u2019s also supporting the landfill line of business because we internalize that volume. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Devina at a 21% tax rate have you started a dialog with the rating agencies that say listen you used all of us to a standard of 3% to hold on to a Triple B leverage, but that\u2019s a 35% tax rather 21% will they adjust your leverage up and allow you to be Triple B still? Devina Rankin : Yes, we\u2019re actively engaged in conversations with all of the rating agencies Michael and I would tell you we have some positive outlook associated with where our ratings are today. And hopeful that we\u2019ll see those come through in the short period of time. Michael Hoffman : So in a consolidating climate what I'm hearing is that you could get levered and hold on to your rating and because of the difference in the tax structure and that they are opened to that dialog? Devina Rankin : We haven\u2019t specifically talked about a new kind of turn of leverage that would acceptable in order to maintain investment grade. But we certainly are seeing that they see the fundamentals of the business have always been the cornerstone of what allows solid waste to be more heavily levered than other typical industrials that are more cyclical. And we expect that they\u2019ll continue to see that not just for us, but across the companies that they rate with the lower tax environment it\u2019s just difficult for us to say how high we would expect leverage to go. We\u2019ve always talked about 3.25 kind of being the max level of leverage for investment grade rating and what would be comfortable for us. We don't know how much that will change with tax reform. Michael Hoffman : All right. And then last question, just a detail, you have foreign exchange and other line as negative at 1.6 yet the Canadian dollar actually is up. So what's causing it to be negative because that should have been positive? Devina Rankin : Yes, it's a combination of two things. One is the change in accounting standard that you guys are aware of. And then the other is a change in some of our pass through revenues. Michael Hoffman : So if that's where the rev rec is being adjusted? Devina Rankin : It is. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And am I supposed to assume there is $40 million of added or $40 million to $50 million for the next three quarters? Devina Rankin : That's about right. Michael Hoffman : Okay, thanks. James Fish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I'm not going ask about recycling. My first question you mentioned the employee bonus, I know it's still very early. But I'm just wondering if you could talk about the impact either in terms of retention in moral recruiting what you\u2019ve seen so far? James Fish : So retention we haven't seen -- the first two months at least January and February didn't see a big change in retention. March, we saw a bit of a change. I would guess that as we get later in the year that we'll see additional change in retention. We have not made any decisions on what we're going to do with respect to retention programs going forward. And as far as moral goes, I said a lot of time out in the field as does the entire SLT and hopefully the view that we get is an accurate view. But it seems to be reasonably good right now, now I don't know how much of that is attributable to $2,000 bonus and how much is attributable to just a strong performing business right now. But I'd like to think that the moral is pretty decent right now. Jeff Silber : And how about from a recruiting perspective, is this something that you're using to recruit folks? James Fish : Well for sure the $2,000 bonus in 2018 because one of the things we said was that it's not just for people how are employed as of January 6th or whatever the day was we announced. If you start in 2018, and you're in one of those groups it's largely hourly employees then you qualify for this bonus. You have to wait a year to get it and that was the retention aspect. But if I start on December 15, 2018, I qualify for the $2,000 bonus. I don't get it on December 31st, like everybody else, but I have to wait a year. But there is a value in it that if I start sometime in 2018 I qualify for the $2,000. Jeff Silber : Yes, I guess, I understood that, but I'm just wondering has it been easier to recruit folks using this. I know it's still difficult out there? James Fish : I don't know that we've enough data to say one way or the other, but it\u2019s a good question I just don't know that we have enough data to say one way or the other whether it's made our job easier or not. Jeff Silber : Okay, fair enough. And then just shifting gears to the acquisitions, the market spend this past quarter I think was more than you spend last year. Was it just an issue with timing or are you becoming a little bit more aggressive on the acquisition side. James Trevathan : Yes, I think it was timing Jeff, but plus one of them probably a little higher average size than in our typical tuck-in that drove that dollar value up, but primarily collection business that tucks-in really well. I think that the opportunities are out there and we're aggressively seeking them as the other industry participants are. And the climate is just good for those tuck-in acquisitions at this point, whether the number gets close to that I can't say it takes two of us to agree on a fair price. Devina Rankin : And Jeff I would just add that, it probably goes without saying, but I think it's worth saying anyway. With tax reform more deals are going across our hurdle rates. And so we certainly are committed to continuing to invest in consolidation of the business where it make sense and where we think the there is real value. And so I think the first quarter number is an indication of that. Jeff Silber : Great. And what do you think the impact on revenue growth from those acquisitions will be this year? Devina Rankin : I don't have that number right on my fingertips, but we'll get back with you. Jeff Silber : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning, guys. James Fish : Good morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey. Devina real quick, was the CNG tax credit about $0.04 was it in OpEx or the tax? And then to be clear, was it contemplated in the guidance from last quarter? Devina Rankin : Yes so it was about $0.05. And it was in operating expense, a little bit in tax so not much. And it was contemplated in our guidance for the year. Tyler Brown : Okay perfect. Obviously on -- yes, sorry go ahead. Devina Rankin : One thing I would add though is that is not in our free cash flow for the quarter, we\u2019ll see it later in the year. Tyler Brown : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then obviously $250 million in M&A in the quarter obviously very strong, maybe to the prior question, do you have an expected EBITDA contribution or maybe would it be safe to assume you allocated it call it mid-single digit type multiples? Devina Rankin : You\u2019re right there, that\u2019s a reasonable assumption. What I would say and we always talk about is where you do see our tuck-in acquisitions show up is on the EBITDA line, it\u2019s harder to see them on the EPS line because of some of the purchase price impacts to intangible amortization. So we do expect these transactions to be EBITDA positive and contributing right away. In our guidance for the year we did expect about $200 million of tuck-in acquisitions, it\u2019s just more heavily weighted towards the first quarter than we anticipated. Tyler Brown : Right. So should we assume that there is any more M&A included in the guide? Devina Rankin : Not at this point. Tyler Brown : Okay. Then quickly on recycling, did I hear you right, is the commodity basket today at about $72 a ton right now, is that right Jim Trevathan? And then for a quick clarification, is that just OCC or is that a broader basket? James Trevathan : That\u2019s a broader basket and it is about $70. And in the current guidance, the revised guidance it\u2019s about $80 for the whole basket of materials. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. Yes, I just want to be clear on that. And then Jim Fish, I hear you on the difference between diversion and recycling I completely agree. Maybe you guys won\u2019t agree with me maybe I am being a bit too colorful, but am I crazy to think that this maybe the best thing that ever happened to recycling? Meaning, I assume this is got to materially change the conversations as you go back to those municipalities? James Fish : Yes, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019d characterize it as the best thing that ever happened to recycling after seeing the $46 million decline. But I do think you are right, it is something that needs to change, when we all think about recycling, recycling is a good thing, but unfortunately it has shifted away from this recycling for the saving of the world\u2019s natural resources to diversion, which just means how much less can I put in my trash bin and how much more can I put in my recycle bin. And I think that has kind of a bad unintended consequence. James Trevathan : Tyler, I think somebody pointed aspirational recycling versus the real recycling that I think we all is right and our customers get it. They fully -- they understand it, some of them don\u2019t like it, but they truly understand it. And I think you\u2019ll see overtime, we will make this business better in the long run. James Fish : Maybe one last example here Tyler is, kind of a funny example, but maybe the -- maybe where the misunderstanding is, is that look a lawn mower has a lot of recycle material on it, it doesn\u2019t mean that you can put it in your recycle bin and send it to our single stream, because we don\u2019t have the equipment to breakdown the lawn mower, I mean yes the blades made out of steel, but we -- our single stream equipment cannot process a lawn mower or a baby stroller or name any other item like that. And so there is -- I think there is a misunderstanding about what our recycle facilities will actually process, they obviously do the good job of processing tin cans, and aluminum cans and plastic bottles and cardboard and papers, but they can\u2019t take the rubber out of a hose and they can\u2019t take the metal out of a lawn mower. Tyler Brown : Right. Devina Rankin : And we can\u2019t keep the economics working to where that whatever even be feasible. Tyler Brown : Okay. So this all comes back to the same kind of talking about the same thing here, it\u2019s contamination really is the route of the problem, then why not abandon single stream and just go back to the simple basic, maybe call it dual stream or just simple commercial recycling? James Fish : Yes, look I mean, first of all our customers want single streamer recycling and we\u2019re committed to the single streamer recycling. So what we do want do is make sure that we improve the process. Now some of these as I said can be done through technology improvement and we\u2019re looking at different technologies to improve the stream, but I think we\u2019re too far down the path to do anything other than what we\u2019re doing today in terms of single stream. And I think lot of people reference Europe and what they do with their sell sort, but we\u2019ve become a single stream society and I think our best course of action is to improve the model both on the financial side, but also on the material side. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then Jim Trevathan, I apologize for being uninformed here, but what is the roll back has been I think you said 18% what does that mean is that a spread between new and lost business or is that the percent of volume that\u2019s all roll back or I just frankly don\u2019t know what that is? James Trevathan : Yes Tyler, the easiest way I can tell you is as we roll out price increases some customers question and challenge that number and we to retain very profitable accretive business will roll back a portion of that to retain that customer and that\u2019s\u2026 James Fish : So simple. Tyler Brown : Yes, no I understand what a roll back is, I mean, what does the 18% mean now is that how much you rolled back like in percentage wise I'm just\u2026 James Trevathan : Yes, 18% of the total price increase we rolled out in the marketplace. Tyler Brown : Okay, thanks for the clarification. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Ken Wang : Hi, thanks this is Ken Wang, on for Corey. Pretty much all my questions have been asked at this point. So maybe I\u2019ll just ask any notable changes in competitor behavior seen during the quarter? James Fish : No, I think, everybody seems to like the current environment that\u2019s for sure, with the economy doing as well as it is and solid waste is a good business right now. Ken Wang : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. So in this quarter resi volumes still down though improving and really getting the growth, more growth both on price and volumes is in the C&I the higher margin part of the business. So obviously a very good trend for overall company financials. I want to ask as you look out to the book for the rest of the year, how do those sort of the underlying trends look to you do you expect resi volumes to maybe turn positive or get back a little closer to the C&I side of the business in terms of volume growth? Or do you think C&I will kind of continue to really outpace on both metrics? James Trevathan : Yes, Noah I think that the commercial and industrial volumes will always outpace the residential volume. We look at it differently in that return on capital is really the focus on that residential line of business. It requires generally when you add customers, new capital, new trucks to service, a new marketplace. And so we look at that differently than those volumes that can fit if you will on our current route structure. So we\u2019re not hungry and aggressively seeking that residential growth. We like the fact that it is improving, but I'm not going to forecast that it gets positive or moves into that 2% or 3% range like the commercial and the industrial business are. Yet we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re doing in that line of business. We\u2019ve got real focus to move that margin up and to improve that return on invested capital, but the trend is good, but don\u2019t expect it to get to commercial and industrial level. The other thing I\u2019ll mention on the commercial side, it\u2019s very positive the last few quarters. Remember that we added that business. And so we got a little headwind we\u2019ll anniversary that in the second half of this year, it will stay positive and we\u2019ll beat our guidance number there, but it won\u2019t probably be at the same high levels unless the marketplace continues to improve. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. Thanks so much I\u2019ll take the rest of questions offline. Operator : Our next question comes from William Griffin with UBS. William Griffin : Hey, good morning guys. So you may have already touched on this, but I just wanted to confirm quickly, was there a change in 2018 related to re-classing, recycling rebates from expense to counter revenue? Devina Rankin : There was. William Griffin : Okay. And could you tell me the approximate dollar amount for 1Q and the EBITDA margin impact from that change? Devina Rankin : So as I mentioned earlier it\u2019s in that foreign currency line item in the internal revenue growth table. And so in total you saw 1.6% change in revenue associated with that, but it\u2019s included with other things. With regard to margin impact, the margin impact was in total around 50 basis points on OpEx as a percentage of revenue. William Griffin : Got you. And I guess can we expect sort of that relative amount to be consistent going forward over the course of this year? Devina Rankin : Yes, but I would say generally though is that the impact of Q1 is a little higher than the full year run rate because Q1 is a lighter revenue quarter than the other quarters. William Griffin : All right, perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys thanks for squeezing me in. Just on the recycling just curious, I mean, on the 40% of this brokerage can you just walk us through how the economics for that portion of your business is perhaps different? And with the contamination issues you mentioned how some centers were clearly just starting to turn away I'm just curious is that just all going to end up -- will some of that end up at landfill like is that what could play out probably you could just address that? James Fish : I\u2019ll take the second question, I\u2019ll let Jim address the broker question, but yes, I mean, ultimately what happens and that\u2019s the irony of all this is that when this material comes in the front door if you have a plan where the inbound stream is 40% contaminated materials, today we sent a piece of it out as commodities, but that 40% as much of that as we can pull out ultimately ends up in a landfill and that is the irony of diversion. Is that while it may get diverted at the first step, which is at the curb, it doesn\u2019t get diverted overall that\u2019s why we believe that recycling should be the goal not diversion because diversion ultimately just means that it ends up getting processed through our plant, but still ends up going to a landfill. So there\u2019s really no economic gain in pushing that through a plant. But Jim the broker question. James Trevathan : Yes, and maybe just to comment too for Michael on that last point and that\u2019s why we are working with our customers, our largest residential customers in cities and communities around education that is -- that can be a true mitigator of that factor is to not contaminate if you will some of the recyclables, but we\u2019re not going to wait for that to happen. We\u2019re going to execute as the contracts allow and as third parties bring us material contamination charges that are allowable and reject materials that can\u2019t be recycled because it can\u2019t be sold. On the brokerage business it really are they are large volume customers that we end up just marketing their product for them. So we have a very low margin, low mid-single-digit kind of margin, but no capital involved, there are no trucks involved, we\u2019re not collecting the material. We\u2019re just helping them broker their material and combining it with our excellent team that has the outlets all over the world.  So it\u2019s again low margin, but really valuable for us and aligns us better with our customers as well. Michael Feniger : That\u2019s helpful. And then on to I mean obviously the CapEx was high this quarter like you said you\u2019re making some investments in your fleet and your landfills does that mean you\u2019re actually adding -- are you adding routes, are you also seeing some smaller players investing in their fleets and trying to add routes as well maybe because they\u2019re seeing the higher growth in the market? James Fish : Yes, Michael I can\u2019t speak to the competitors, but we have added routes, but at a lower percentage in the commercial, in residential and industrial all three lines of business than our volume growth of course resi is not growing. But -- so we\u2019re getting some efficiency there in routes versus the volume growth. But yes we are adding routes in those two lines of businesses. Michael Feniger : That\u2019s great. And then just on the margin performance I guess big picture if you\u2019re in an environment where volumes are 2% your yield is 2% core prices like 4%, 5%, I mean, what tenure now to fully expand your margins in the solid waste business in that backdrop? Devina Rankin : So aspirationally we look to expand margins 50 to 100 basis points for the year. We certainly outperformed that in the first quarter some of the outperformance came from the fuel tax credits, but even if you peel back the impact of the fuel tax credits to traditional solid waste business did see that 50 basis point plus margin expansion for the year, I mean, you really are hitting on it. If you look at price we\u2019ve always known that price is one of the levers that helps us to expand margin. But to Jim\u2019s point when you\u2019re adding volume at a pace that outpaces meaningfully the rate of routes increases and labor costs you\u2019re going to get leverage from that as well. And so we\u2019re certainly seeing that show up. James Fish : Michael I think if you look at margins, I mean, margin is maybe an underappreciated, really good story. If you look back over the last four years, Q1 of 2014 our EBITDA margins were 23.1%. And then -- and you continue down the road I mean 24.5% and 25.8%, I mean, it\u2019s been on a continuing upward trend. So does it continue on a straight line, I don\u2019t know but boy it\u2019s sure it has been a good story that I think is a little bit under appreciated. Michael Feniger : Yes, I would agree with that, I mean, I am just -- I guess I am curious, could you guys just remind us like what has changed to be able to get this type of margin performance, is it just better cost control, is it removing costs during a low CPI environment. Just curious if you could touch on some buckets of how you guys have been doing that and why we could expect the 50 to 100 basis points, which we might not have been able to expect in the prior cycles, why we can expect that going forward? James Fish : Look some of it is -- you have said on the kind of the key items, I mean, we\u2019ve -- as you know I mean we\u2019ve kept control of SG&A, since I was CFO. So SG&A has -- and that SG&A percentage as Devina said in her prepared remarks has come down. So SG&A, operating costs controls with SDO which we\u2019ve talked about for years.  And then when your top-line growth is coming in C&I and landfill that\u2019s going to be good for your margins. So we think we\u2019re doing some things with the customer in terms of customer -- improving customer experience, we\u2019re very, very focused on a best-in-class customer experience. And we think that is showing up in our growth numbers in the commercial and industrial lines of business. James Trevathan : Michael Jim called it in his early statements of disciplined growth and our term for that what that includes is that point of where we grow and at what price we grow our business. We are very careful to make sure we\u2019re not just adding volume, we are adding it in the right places that add that margin expansion and with where we can internalize that volume. So it\u2019s not just the economic growth, it\u2019s the discipline of grow at the price with the right customer base that adds to that margin expansion. Michael Feniger : That\u2019s perfect, guys. And I know -- and lastly I know we touched a little bit on April with recycling price, I am just curious anything on the solid core waste, is it the trends you kind of saw in February and March continue in April and any impact from weather at all? James Fish : Are you asking about pricing for solid waste? Michael Feniger : Yes, price and volume basically\u2026 James Fish : Yes, so I would say, well look through it\u2019s early in April, but our volumes still look good in April. Price continues -- price is something that we have been focused on for a decade and we\u2019re certainly not -- what helps us with price is taking this very strong stance on customer experience. I mean, the better our customer experience the more differentiated we are and easier it is to command a higher price. And then what was the last part of your question? James Trevathan : Weather. James Fish : Weather, yes, so we didn\u2019t really use the W word in because it happens every year, what I would say is that this is a little bit tougher winter than last year, last two years actually were pretty mild, we actually pulled the field and we had 30 more lost days to weather this year and that\u2019s area days. So the areas themselves had 30 more lost days this year than last year. So the weather did affect us, but look we work through that, it\u2019s winter. Michael Feniger : Yes, thank you. James Fish : Thank you. Operator : And I am not showing any further question at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to our host. James Fish : Okay, well thank you very much. In closing today look I\u2019d just like to say I know we talked a lot about recycling, I think it was the right thing to talk about, it\u2019s an important part of our business. But as I said it is a smaller part of our business compared to the solid waste and with respect to solid waste I would just say that maybe more than any other quarter my carrier of Waste Management this quarter highlights the strength of core, the core of this business. So we look forward to the rest of the year and we look forward to seeing many of you next week in Los Vegas at Waste Expo. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to waste management President and CEO, Jim Fish. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Ed. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Our traditional Solid Waste business once again demonstrated exceptional performance, generating strong free cash flow and earnings growth. In the second quarter, our collection, landfill and transfer station lines of business saw organic revenue growth of almost 5%, which translated into income from operations and operating EBITDA each growing nearly 7%. Overall, we generated EPS of $1.01 Our strong operating performance, once again, produced robust cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow, both growing by more than 19% in the second quarter when compared to the second quarter of 2017. This achievement was in spite of a more than 45% increase in capital spending in the quarter as we accelerate and execute our fleet strategy and address additional airspace needs to accommodate growth. Given the outstanding performance in the Solid Waste business and a lower than anticipated tax rate, we are increasing our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.05 to $4.10. We are also reaffirming our adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of $4.2 billion to $4.25 billion and free cash flow guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. While our strong performance from our traditional Solid Waste business is propelling us forward as demonstrated by this EPS guidance increase, we continue to see pressure from our Recycling line of business as commodity market challenges persisted in the second quarter. During the quarter, EPS Recycling declined by $0.07 when compared to the second quarter of 2017, largely due to lower demand for recycled materials following China's import ban. And we are no longer assuming a second half recovery in recycled commodity prices. Based upon our revised outlook, we are further updating our expected EPS impact from Recycling for the full year to be a negative $0.17 to $0.20 compared to the full year of 2017, which is based upon our blended full year average commodity rate of around $68 per ton. This equates to a year-over-year decline in operating EBITDA of approximately $100 million, which is twice the impact we expected in our initial guidance for 2018. Keep in mind, we believe that more than three-fourths of the impact is now behind us. We expect the headwinds to moderate in the second half of 2018 as we continue to take steps to improve the recycling business. Recycling aside, 2018 is tracking better than our expectations. So I want to spend a couple of minutes on the big picture beyond this year. Obviously, we're not just focused on 2018, we're focused on delivering sustainable growth for our shareholders over the long term. One area of focus is developing and retaining the best workforce in the industry. Many industries are seeing pressure from labor costs and shortages, particularly with regard to drivers and technicians. We're being proactive in attracting and training talent to handle the increase in collection volumes. To that end, we are developing a second driver and technician training facility. By investing more in our frontline employees early in their careers, we've seen an improvement in safety, performance and retention, and a second facility will allow us to accelerate and improve the training delivery process to our drivers and technicians. In addition, using technology, we are piloting a program with Caterpillar that allows us to remotely operate equipment at one of our landfills in Colorado. Technology like this modernizes the jobs for our workers, enables us to work more efficiently and provides us with a further opportunity to hire military veterans, which currently make up 8.5% of our new hires. In particular, we see the potential for wounded service members as well as other qualified workers to fill some of these higher-tech, less labor-intensive jobs in the future. Another big area of focus is maximizing the return on our disposal network. We have the best-positioned landfills and transfer stations in the industry, and we've started to see increased volume being disposed at our facilities. We believe that is due to a strong economy and benefits of volumes from third-party haulers choosing our close end disposal sites. We see an opportunity to leverage the logistical benefits of our disposal network and increase the returns on our large investment in that network. To close, the 2018 story is a good one. Our Solid Waste business is in great health, outperforming even our own expectations. At the halfway mark for the year, we are well on our way to meeting or exceeding our operating and financial goals for 2018. We could not accomplish this without the greatest employees in the industry. They've been able to deliver strong performance and I'm confident that they can execute throughout the remainder of the year. I will now turn the call over to Jim to cover our second quarter operating results in more detail. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our traditional Solid Waste business continues to build momentum. For the fifth consecutive quarter, both price and volume growth exceeded 2%, putting us on track to achieve our full year pricing and volume guidance. Our strong organic growth in the quarter helped drive revenue, $62 million higher compared to the second quarter of 2017. In our Collection and Disposal business, price and volume increased $135 million or 4.3%. The strong growth in our Collection and Disposal business was partially offset by an $85 million decline in revenue from our Recycling line of business. Total company operating EBITDA increased $32 million or 3.1%, and operating EBITDA margins expanded 40 basis points to 28.4% despite a 40-basis point headwind from Recycling. Our revenue metrics continue to demonstrate the strength of our underlying Solid Waste business. Service increases exceeded service decreases for the 18th consecutive quarter and new business exceeded lost business for the 13th consecutive quarter. Our churn rate was 8.7% in the second quarter, a 90-basis point year-over-year improvement, and rollbacks improved 40 basis points to 25.2%. Turning to internal revenue growth in the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.3%, a 60-basis point improvement from last year, and yield was 2.3%, up 40 basis points. Traditional solid waste volumes grew 2.3%, while total company volumes improved 1.8%. This growth was achieved despite the favorable impact in the second quarter of 2017 and through the end of that year when we received additional landfill volumes in Virginia due to a competitor outage. Transfer station volumes grew 4.7% primarily due to the New York City disposal contract. Let's go through the results by line of business again, with Collection, where we saw robust growth. Commercial core price was 6.6% for the quarter, with volumes up 3.2%. Industrial core price was 10.9%, with volumes up 3.1%. In the Residential line of business, core price was 3.3% and volumes increased 0.2%. The combined price and volume increases led to Collection income from operations growing $47 million and operating EBITDA growing $56 million with margins essentially flat. In the Landfill line of business, total volumes increased 3.6%. MSW volumes grew 1.7%, C&D volume grew 3.9%, and the combined Special Waste and revenue-generating Cover volumes grew 2.5%. We achieved core price of 3% in the Landfill line of business. For the second quarter, our Landfill line of business grew income from operations by $23 million and income from operations margin by 50 basis points, while operating EBITDA grew $37 million and operating EBITDA margin rose by 100 basis points. Looking at Recycling. As we discussed on the first quarter conference call, we took further steps to improve our business as we rolled out an approach to address contamination and recover cost for excess contamination. We are pleased with the results so far and expect to see improvement in the second half of the year. We will continue to work on improving the Recycling business because it's a service that our customers desire and our shareholders deserve an appropriate return on invested capital from our recycling assets in any economic climate. Turning to operating expenses. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenue were 61.9% in the second quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points compared to last year. Operating expenses increased $23 million over the second quarter of 2017. The main driver is labor cost related to volume increases in our Commercial and Industrial businesses and our bonus for hourly employees. As Jim mentioned, with the increasing collection volume, we are hiring additional drivers and adding new routes in high-growth locations. When we do this, we do incur additional training costs and lower efficiency as drivers learn their new routes, which increases our labor cost per unit. But historically, these pressures have been short-term in nature and they should provide opportunity for future margin expansion as we fill in those routes and improve efficiency. Labor cost were offset by lower cost of goods sold due to the reduction in recycled commodity prices. Removing the impacts of recycling and the hourly employee bonus, operating expense margin for the traditional Solid Waste business improved 130 basis points. We are pleased with our progress in the first half of 2018 and we remain focused on disciplined pricing and profitable volume growth to deliver another exceptional year for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. As you've heard this morning, our strong core Solid Waste performance drove impressive financial results in the second quarter. These results give us confidence that in spite of Recycling pressures proving to be even more significant than we expected just one quarter ago, we will achieve our full year EBITDA and free cash flow guidance and exceed our original EPS guidance. The strong core price in Collection and Disposal volume growth that we saw in the second quarter combined with disciplined focus on controlling costs and optimizing working capital drove $975 million of cash from operations. This is the best single quarter cash from operations we have ever achieved. We are seeing the expected lift in cash flow conversion from tax reform. And when you combine that benefit with our strong operating performance, the results are markedly improved. Our cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue grew more than 400 basis points from the same quarter of last year to 26.1%. The incremental cash from operations is being directly invested in the assets that will support and drive continued growth. During the second quarter, we spent $436 million on capital expenditures, bringing our year-to-date capital investment to $836 million, putting us on pace to spend the high end of our full year capital expenditure guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. With our strongest return businesses growing at a pace not seen in many years and an economic backdrop that is generally supportive of continued growth, we're making valuable investments in our fleet and our landfill. We generated $621 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, an increase of $101 million or nearly 20% from 2017. Year-to-date, our free cash flow is $1.44 billion, putting us well on our way to achieve our full year guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that prioritizes return of value to our shareholders and accretive growth through acquisition. In the second quarter, we paid $200 million in dividends and bought back $300 million in shares. We've allocated over 90% of our 2018 free cash flow to dividends and share buyback in the first half of the year. In the quarter, we completed another $21 million in accretive tuck-in acquisition bringing the total for the first half of the year to $269 million. This represents about $200 million of annualized revenue acquired in 2018. Our continuous improvement mindset is helping in our diligent approach to managing SG&A costs. SG&A was 9.8% of revenue in the second quarter, which is in line with the prior year period. This is a particularly strong result when you consider the margin impact of the revenue decline from commodity prices as well as the $9 million accrual in the quarter for legal matters. This charge increased our SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue by 30 basis points and negatively affected EPS for the quarter by $0.02 per share. As Jim mentioned, the primary reason for raising our EPS guidance is the strong performance of our traditional Solid Waste business and that includes managing SG&A. Our employees are focused on making sure that every dollar that we spend on SG&A is invested in providing exceptional customer service, driving continued revenue growth or improving efficiency in our back office and support function. We have seen good discipline in eliminating unnecessary spending and we expect these benefits to continue even as we invest in technology to improve our business. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 23.2%. We now expect our adjusted full year 2018 tax rate to be about 24%. I want to take a moment to recognize our tax professionals who do an outstanding job in tax planning. In the second quarter, we recognized a $0.09 benefit from tax planning and the settlement of outstanding audits. We excluded $0.07 of this benefit from our as-adjusted EPS, but the entire amount represents real value that our teams worked hard to capture for our shareholders. They identified an opportunity, worked with the IRS, and generated a win for Waste Management. Looking at our financial metrics, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenant remained at 2.4 times at the end of the second quarter. Our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 4.1% and 17% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates. We delivered solid performance in the first half of 2018 and the outlook for the remainder of the year is strong. Our traditional solid waste business performance once again overcame the recycling headwinds to generate a healthy increase in both cash and earnings. We appreciate the hard work of the Waste Management team this quarter and look forward to continued success in the second half of the year. With that, Amanda, let's open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Congrats on the solid results in the core business. Just wanted to dig into that a little bit more. Just what surprised you the most about the results in the MSW business so far in the year to give you the confidence to kind of raise the EPS guidance despite the Recycling headwinds. Is it the Landfill part of the business, pricing, retention? Just maybe any comments about what areas are surprising you the most. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You know, Brian, I don't know that anything really surprised us. We've seen this coming for a couple of quarters now. We have maybe if there was a surprise it's the fact that with this steeper downturn as we have seen in Recycling over a short period, that Solid Waste has been so strong that it's been able to completely eclipse that. And so, if there is a surprise, it's that. To get a bit more specific about the individual pieces, certainly, the Landfill business has been good. I mentioned a bit of it there in my script and Jim as well. The volumes that we've seen have been up. I'm not sure I would call them a surprise, but they're certainly a welcome addition to several years ago where we weren't showing really any volume improvement. It's not been that long ago that every quarter we talked about strong core price and yield, but always had to answer questions about poor volumes. So the fact that these individual lines of business are showing a 3.2% in Commercial and 3.1% in roll-off, those are strong. If maybe I had to pick one surprise, it's that Residential \u2013 Jim kind of stressed it, but it's that Residential is now actually positive. I'm going to call it positive. It's only 0.02% because it's been negative for a long time. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That sounds good. Just switching over to the recycling and obviously every month or every week it keeps changing, the news coming out of China, the latest sort of news is they might ban all imports. First they said maybe by 2020, now they said maybe sooner. And I know you guys have been looking at ways to try and change the business model in the U.S. One idea or concepts we've heard in the industry is that they may look to import more what, I guess, they're calling recycled pulp where you can take some of that paper and run it through their front end of a pulping process here in the U.S. and send it over there and you kind of get around the restrictions. It could be a win-win for everybody. I've heard some rumblings with some of the waste guys who are looking at that business. Is that something that you would be interested in getting into, whether it be through a partner in the paper or pulp industry, but some way to stimulate more demand for recycled paper domestically by either restarting some old mills or trying to develop some kind of a recycle pulp market to China? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I think we look at a business that's fallen off the table like recycling has over such a short period. We're looking at every single option to improve it whether it is, as you suggest, vertical integration, or whether it is bringing really radically different technology to our recycling facilities, or in the short term what we're doing and maybe I'll boil down the math equation a little bit this way, recycling basically is \u2013 there's three things going on here. And so, we've seen obviously the commodities really fall off to the tune of about $45 is our expectation for the year, which equates to $0.18 right in the middle of the range we gave. The other pieces are the processing costs have gone up 12% to 15% year-over-year has attempted to meet these contamination limits. And transportation costs have gone up because we're not really importing much to China anymore. It's going to places like India and Vietnam, which are a longer length of haul, and then the offset to the cost of piece has been this short-term approach, which is a three phased recycling improvement plan. So, what you're talking about is a little bit longer term and we're going to look at both short-term fixes and long-term fixes to make sure that this recycling business gets back on solid footing. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Just related to that one last one from me, just within the surcharges bucket that $32 million, any of that related to recycling fees that you could call out and what kind of success are you having trying to implement those fees on your traditional customers? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So that surcharge line in our IRG table is specifically related to fuel. All of the behaviors associated with a three-phased approach that Jim mentioned is included in the recycling commodity price line. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just around the comments on having sort of the best-positioned assets on their Disposal side. Jim, maybe if you could frame for us, are you just referring to that you have further room to push Disposal pricing and historically sort of it wasn't done, or is there anything else around either bidding of future contracts where you can maybe bid better and leverage that asset positioning? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Hamzah. I think it's probably a bit of both. But I certainly the former. We certainly would be looking to price those assets accordingly. I mean, those assets do have a finite life to them. And so, with assets that are as well-positioned as ours, we need to make sure that we price them, price them accordingly. When we look at our MSW pricing, we've done pretty well for the last four quarters in kind of the 2% to 3% range. But I think aspirationally, I'd like to see us in more kind of the 3% to 4%, maybe even the 3% to 5% range. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And then just secondly, you touched on technology, you touched on some of the autonomous equipment at the landfill. Maybe high level, if you could frame for us how many technology projects are you looking at and any high-level view as to how much that can take out of your cost structure either efficiency or structural cost take out. And I know they're in pilot stage, anything you can share qualitatively or quantitatively would be great. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I would tell you that the benefits of technology is \u2013 particularly as we think about customer-facing technologies and our digital team is doing a fantastic job, they've just rolled out an open market residential tool. The benefits on a cost side are kind of the secondary benefits. The primary benefits are differentiating ourselves from competitors and giving us an opportunity to gain a bigger slice of the pie. So as a result, I would say we haven't fully quantified that second piece that you're asking about. There will be some benefits. I mean, as you think about a customer-facing tool, it's more efficient for the customer and less cost, by the way, for the customer to go through an app than it is to go through a call process because the call process takes longer. But with that said, we are very pleased with the job that our call centers do. So may be a way for us to as we think about turnover and, in the case of our call center, help mitigate that a bit. But the primary benefit of technology is going to be getting us a bigger slice of the market share pie. And I think the technologies that we're looking at, Hamzah, are both on that the traditional technology side, which we've talked about, customer-facing type technologies. But also, what I mentioned in my prepared comments and that is we're just beginning this partnership with Caterpillar, and that will involve remotely operating a piece of heavy equipment, a dozer in this case from \u2013 we'll be operating it from several thousand miles away to this landfill in Colorado. It's the very, very first step in this. But we're excited. Caterpillar is excited. And I believe it's something that Caterpillar has done with other customers and other industries, but this is I think the first foray into our space, so we're excited about that. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And, Hamzah. Maybe I would add to that the birth of robotics that we've talked about at our site doing a pilot stage. The landfill automated heavy equipment all really cool, sexy stuff and really good future. But what we've done just the last few years with onboard computers or an older technology but we have computers on all those sites, and then we've had the Commercial and Industrial and Residential for the first quarter volume increases, it helps us reroute, it helps us manage the efficiency of those new routes that are coming on with that volume growth. And it's also helping us as we use those tools on the truck to provide lead opportunities where there's service increase opportunities from our current customer base. So, there's some technology that's helping us with as Jim said that differentiated you from a customer perspective, it's in existence and helping us every quarter. Last point on this, Hamzah, and I really want to hammer home and that is I mentioned, but this really starts to redefine the job that is the operator job today. We have 17%-ish turnover in that job today. So that means, in theory, we turn over almost all of our operators in a little bit more than five years. This starts to redefine it. As you think about a kind of a gaming chair with a remote operation and basically a joystick they're operating a piece of heavy equipment, that's much different. And potentially, we're more able to not only attract, as I mentioned, wounded vets, but also attract folks that that may not otherwise be interested in working on the face of a landfill, but maybe very interested in working in air conditioned room sitting in front of some screens in a leather chair. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: That's very helpful. Just last question. I'll turn it over. On the volume side, is the 90bps improvement in customer churn a sustainable figure going forward? I know there's a floor to customer churn at some point, maybe it's 7%. But any view there? Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, Hamzah. We're very happy with that result in Q2. But if you look back, we've had 11 straight quarters now with single-digit churn rates. So it has been sustainable and we've done very well in that regard. Part of it is all of the focus on service delivery to a customer. Part of it's some of the technology that we've talked about. We're doing very well. And I do expect further improvements. Maybe that's just old school seeing opportunity, but I think that that number can continue to improve. Not as dramatically as it could when it was a double-digit number, but it can continue to improve and we expect that. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. Jim, just to pick up on one of the areas you highlighted at the beginning of the call around developing and retaining best employees. And I guess this really gets to the question of managing costs as well. What kind of an environment do you see the industry and in terms of overall cost inflation now? How much for things like labor and maintenance that are more specialized? And what is the ability of the company to kind of recover that and continue to get margin expansion through price, not necessarily just focusing on this quarter, but looking over perhaps the medium term? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, so the rate that we're seeing is still in that 3% range. And our turnover of employees has stayed relatively constant. Hard to know whether that is driven by things like this new training center that we're bringing on, or whether there is \u2013 I'm sure as we get closer to the end of the year, there's an allure of the 2,000 that becomes kind of closer and closer and feels more and more real to them. So I think that's going to start affecting turnover, but we haven't seen that yet. Clearly, whether that means that turnover would have been higher and it actually is having an effect, or whether it's not having an effect at all, and I'm not sure we're able to tell. But I think longer term, Noah, and that really is the big question, not only as a company, but I think as an industry, we're looking at how do we provide a job that is an attractive career for folks. For us, it means providing an excellent form of training. We've seen the drivers \u2013 that's when we've rolled out our first training center, the drivers and technicians that went through that training center had a markedly lower turnover in their first year to year and a half. And that is really the critical point for us with turnover. Once they hit year two or year three, there seems to be some magic to that. They seem to stay for their careers. But that first couple of years is really critical. And so adding another training center we think will help that. We think doing some things, as we mentioned, with Caterpillar and a little bit farther down the road on the collection side of our business and additionally in recycling, those types of technologies bringing to our business will help. But for right now, I would characterize it this way : we're seeing some local pressure but not anything that expands across the network and we address it locally. By the way, we've been seeing local labor pressure for several years. This isn't something that's just cropped up in the last 12 months. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Right. Right. And then, on Recycling. The company is no longer assuming a price reversion. If the ban is implemented, do you think we see another leg down on prices? And then, how should we think about any potential decrementals or incrementals? Because if I got my math right, you're decrementals were maybe mid-40s, and that's lower than other peers in the industry. It would seem that there may be an opportunity to improve that even further through some of the initiatives that you have highlighted around improving processing costs and rationalizing the cost structure. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah, I'm not a prognosticator, but I would tell you that if I were asked to place a bet on this, I would tell you that we're closer to the bottom. And so there's probably more upside potential than downside. As I mentioned, we didn't put any upside in the remainder of the year, so we're basically flatlining commodity prices from this point through the end of the year. But here's the silver lining to all of this. Because we've taken a conservative approach with this $0.17 to $0.20 and because Solid Waste has been able to completely overcome it, there could be some upside for the remainder of the year. We certainly think that in 2019, as we think about this expense reduction effort and the three-phased Recycling improvement plan really not being rolled out in earnest until May, that if all things remain equal, Recycling could be a tailwind for us in 2019. And if we are closer to the bottom of commodity prices than it would, in fact, to be a tailwind because we really didn't get much in either of those improvement plans in certainly the first quarter and even into April and May. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And, Noah, I might add to that you'd be open with the China impact. And just so we're clear, we sent less than 5% of our volume in the first half of this year to China. So we found other outlets and, yes, it's affected cost and transportation \u2013 both the commodity price and transportation costs. But what China does next is not as significant an impact, given the fact that we found other outlets both domestically and internationally. So, with less than 5% of our current fiber going to China, I'm not sure how that impact would be huge for us in future months or quarters. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Right. Thanks very much for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning, Tyler. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Devina. So I just want to make sure I understand it. But if my notes are correct, so year-to-date you've seen about a $0.15 drag in Recycling. You're guiding to a $0.17 to $0.20 for the full year, which implies that you really aren't expecting much of a back half drag, even though I thought peak commodity pain would be in Q3 and even at current prices. But it sounds like you're not assuming any change in price. So what's going on in the back half, the short-term fixes that are really softening the drag? Or am I thinking about this all wrong? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So you've got that part of it right. The one piece that I would correct is from a commodity price perspective, the pressure that we saw on a year-over-year comp basis was much heavier in the first half of 2017 and 2018 on a year-over-year basis than it will be in Q3 and Q4. So that's part of the reason that the incremental up to $0.05 from the current year-to-date impact of $0.15 that you noted at the high end is so much less than what we've already experienced in the year. And then, as Jim had mentioned, our efforts on both cost reduction and our particular interest on contamination fees with our customers, should provide lift over and above what we've already experienced given the delay in execution of some of those in the current year. With regard to Solid Waste, I think that the big picture there is that if you only have $0.05 of impact in the back half of the year relative to the $0.15 of impact that we've had from the Recycling line of business and Solid Waste has more than overcome that $0.15 drag, that tells you that there's a lot of lift that will come from Solid Waste in the back half of the year. And then on top of that, we'll have some lift from the lower tax rate that we have provided. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Okay. And then on the tax rate real quick, how should we think about next year? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: I would tell you that our \u2013 the only item that I don't see continuing until 2019 is the current quarter $0.02 benefit that we had from tax planning activities. Aside from that, there are impacts as we start to see some roll-off impacts of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Investments and Renewable Energy Tax Credit. But we're looking at those and it's too early for us to say specifically. But about that 24%, 25% is reasonable at this point in time for our current outlook for 2019. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, Jim Trevathan, I'm curious about the application on the Hours of Service Exemption. So can you talk a little bit about the reasoning behind that move? Is that really a way to cope with some of the tightening in frontline labor? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. You're talking about the ELD issue? Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Okay. It is. I mean, right now we're operating under the requirements just as they're written, but we did file that exemption. Most \u2013 about over 90% of our routes are less than \u2013 have been less than 100-mile radius. So there are several people that are part of that exemption request, I mean, the kiln industry, other short-term type haulers. And whether that happens or not I'm not sure yet, Tyler, but we filed the exemption. And if things are looking good but we're living with the standards today and operating as if it won't happen, but we sure expect it. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, maybe my last one here just, Devina, going back to the margins. So you had a 40-basis point improvement in margins year-over-year this quarter. I think you mentioned that Recycling was a 40-basis point drag. Is that correct? And did that have any impact from maybe the shedding of some of the lower-margin broker tons? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, you're exactly right. That included the 40-basis point impact from the recycling line of business. Brokerage impacted us actually positively. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, the MORS business was a drag of 70 basis points in isolation. So, the 40 basis points that you mention for Recycling is inclusive of the mix in business between brokerage and MORS. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So Solid Waste was a, call it, 80? But was there any benefit from rev rec in there? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, Solid Waste by itself was up around 50 basis points actually. There are some other gives and takes. The rev rec standard implementation, as well as some other changes in our pass-through revenues had a total impact of 50 basis points. But we also had the hourly bonus plan, which was a negative 50 basis points. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay. So it was it was up core, core, core is what I'm trying to get at. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right cool. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Your line is open. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you very much. One of these days I'll get these people say Stifel. I wanted to look at the mix of EBITDA as you thought about the beginning of the year and where we are today because I think, if I have parsed this correctly, you were looking at approximately a 7% growth in solid waste-driven EBITDA with a down-recycling at the beginning of the year. But now we're really looking at probably more like a 9% growth in solid waste EBITDA versus the revised outlook for recycling. Have I parsed that correctly? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: You have. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yep. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So that's the power that you've been talking about. And does the acceleration of that in what you just alluded to, Devina, going to the second half is that you're expecting that to be on a first half versus second half basis to be even better. Is that right? If I split the 9% in halves, it's greater than the second half than it is in the first half. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: The one piece that I would remind you about though is Q1 was particularly strong because of the Fuel Tax Credit. So we have had some of the benefit in the first quarter. But Solid Waste, because we're talking about on an EPS basis, comparing the $0.15 that had to be overcome to a $0.05 detriment from the Recycling line of business. But on the EBITDA line at $1.061 billion, the level of growth that we've seen should provide us confidence to hit somewhere between the $4.2 billion and $4.25 billion of EBITDA growth, which would be full year growth of around 5% on a consolidated basis. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I think, Michael, what we're really saying is that as the Recycling headwind moderates in the back half of the year and Solid Waste stays as strong as it's been, then you really do see that that lift coming in the back half. I'm not sure whether I would say it's Solid Waste getting even better than it is. Solid Waste is as good as it's been in over a decade. It's just that the Recycling comps get easier in the back half. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And while the Recycling gets a little bit easier in the second half, the Solid Waste comps, Landfill volumes, for example, the comps... James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. The point there is, there is a little bit of \u2013 you have some tougher comps with the Landfill because of the storms. And we're in the middle, by the way, of the tougher comps for the Virginia plant, the Covanta plant, that went down last year. And so, were beneficiary in some of their volume. But that started in Q2. So, we're seeing those tougher comps already for that plant, obviously, as we get into particularly Q4, we'll see a bit of storm comp difficulty year-over-year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And again, back to that analysis, am I right that the Solid Waste business then is going to have margins up something around 120 basis points gross, and it's 50 basis points for rev rec so, that's kind of 70 basis points is what we're seeing out of Solid Waste ex-rev rec? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, the Solid Waste year-to-date has been around the 50 basis points to 70 basis points of growth, and that's ex-rev rec and ex-the hourly bonus. And so, that's how we're looking at it and what we are expecting as a continuation of that performance and then hopefully some upside as Jim Trevathen mentioned earlier, when we think about the labor cost inflation that we saw in the second quarter because of training hours and the incremental routes, as we start to see those routes gain better efficiency through the rest of the year, we would expect some upside on that margin expansion in the Collection line of business in the back half of the year. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Michael, I mean, the big contributors and detractors, I mean, you've kind of hit on them. But the big contributors and detractors when we think about EBITDA margins are the Recycling business, Solid Waste, Rev Rec, and the hourly bonus. And it's really everything else is kind of small. But those are kind of the big four with kind of a couple working for us and a couple working against us. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So I've heard you all talk in the past about $1.5 billion. I'm following up on Devina's comment about labor, a $1.5 billion of direct labor. Talk about if you can things you're doing to try and reduce that number and the timing of it given these training efforts and focus on the labor retention and the like. What can we see that do over the next 12 months to 24 months, that $1.5 billion? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, some of what we've talked about is automation in the fleet, particularly in the Residential line of business. That's been a big step forward for us and it continues to be something that we're focused on. In addition to that, I think it gets back to the onboard computers and the efficiency in our routing and fleet structure and optimization of that part of our business. And that's provided benefits for us, substantial benefits for us over the last several years. The second quarter impacts that you saw really are volume and growth-related. And as we take up our routes, we've increased our route structure by almost 1%, which is impressive given over 3% volume expansion in both commercial and industrial Collection volumes. So the focus really from a labor perspective is ensuring that we flex as we see volume growth and we find ways to use automation and technology to improve the working environment. And that doesn't just impact direct labor costs, but it also impacts safety and risk management costs as well. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And, Michael, a couple of additional items just to add color. I completely agree with Devina on her points. But most of our efficiency gains over the last couple of years have come at the beginning at the end of our route structures using the new tools that we've rolled out. We started early this year with a project looking at the middle of the route. We rolled out some tools that allow a route manager, a district manager, to clearly see the efficiency, the timing versus a plan for every driver, and they see that real time. And we've just begun that effort that led us target some of the time opportunities in the middle of the route. And that'll help. It's a longer-term project. But just given the number of routes that we have on the street, but that'll help. The bigger issue is that as we've talked about we had a later seasonality impact in Q2 than in previous years. A lot of our volume growth on the Collection side of the business came in that May and June period. And I love 3% commercial and industrial volume growth. I'm not sure, Michael, I remember that happening in a quarter at the same time where both of them did. So, we overwhelmed some of our larger-growth districts with a lot of volume, and therefore because we've talked about, Jim and I both mentioned it earlier, with new drivers, with new route structures, with new training, it's underway with a little bit of overtime to handle that structure. As we get our arms around that and manage that growth, you'll see margin expansion on that Collections line of business closer to where we expected in the second half of the year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, Devina, two for you quickly. The CFO upside, how much of that was working capital versus operating leverage in the Q? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. In the second quarter, we had about $15 million of benefit from working capital, but most of that actually related to the Fuel Tax Credit benefit that we got in Q1. We got the cash for that in the quarter. On DSO and DPO, actually we continued to make progress on DPO and got an incremental day. But we saw DSO slide and so net-net that was actually a bit of a detriment to us. We continue to be focused on both pieces of that equation and there's upside from the performance we've seen so far in the first half of the year in the second half of the year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, this upside to 26% is really operating leverage. That's the other point to be made? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, the 26% really the other thing I would say there is we elected not to make a federal tax payment in the second quarter. So, we moved from our base of around 22% to 26%, a 400-basis point improvement. I would say more normalized, we should look for that improvement to be more like a 200-basis point over the course of the full year. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's good to know. And then, on the EPS the $0.05 to $0.08 incremental change, how much is tax and how much is operating leverage? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, we view tax and recycling really is offsetting each other and the entire upside is operating leverage. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then last for the operators, force majeure, is that an for this recycling issue at this point? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: It's an option, but it's not an option that we prefer. We think we're making good progress taking the approach that we're taking at this point. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: And, Michael, we talked to most of our, if not, all of our largest franchise and residential contracts. That were more than half of our MORS volume comes from. And they get very clearly whether it's news media that exposed them to the commodity issues and contamination issues. They see it whether they want to accept it in the short term is a question. But we have some of them with the restructuring plans already in place. So, I don't see us going to force majeure. But, as Jim said, it's always an option. We'd rather work through with our customers on a positive basis and with absolute clarity of what's going on in the market that they see, and not just from our standpoint, but they see across North America, and then change the contracts accordingly. We think that's the best approach. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Terrific. Thank you for taking the questions. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you so much. I wanted to go back to some of your earlier comments about the new training facility that you're building. If we can get a little bit of color on that, is this something from an operating expense? Is there going to be CapEx? Is it included in your guidance? And over what timeframe should we be seeing that? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Jeff, there is capital. Capital is part of the equation with property and building. We're looking at it whether we look at internal locations or external locations. But we're going to move out West. We've got one center in the East and covers really well all the training. But, remember, we do training today at the local level. So from an operating cost perspective, I'd like to see it go down over the long term so we'll get more efficient in training. Because right now it's done where we don't have the capacity to use \u2013 utilize the Florida training center we do it locally. We just don't do it as efficiently. And we also think we do it more completely and more efficiently. And we also think we do it more completely and more comprehensively as well when we centralize that training. We give them a full perspective of what the company expects and we also include route managers and technicians that are part of this so that the message is consistent and clear and aligned across the whole company, rather than just a localized training operation. So it improves retention. It improves our safety results. And we expect it to improve efficiency as well. We're excited about it. And that won't be until next year when it opens. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: That capital is included in our outlook at the high end of the $1.7 billion. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Just wanted to confirm that. I appreciate that. And then just a couple of numbers questions. I don't think you mentioned in your remarks the percentage change on the average commodity cost, both on the cost side and the volume side. Is that something we can get? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: We'll get that to you. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. And then, finally, what share count is embedded in your adjusted EPS guidance for the year? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Around 432 million shares. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fantastic. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Your line is open. Ken Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Hey. Thank you. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Just a quick one for me. I think this may be the strongest quarterly free cash flow, at least, for the last few years. Just wondering any change in your thoughts on use of cash going forward? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: We remain committed to balance between the dividend, share buyback and M&A. And what I would tell you is we are really committed to the organic growth part of the equation as well, which is why you've seen a step change in capital expenditures. And so while you're focused on the strength of free cash flow and how we allocate that free cash flow, we're thinking about it in terms of how we allocate cash from operations. And so, capital investment in the core and organic growth is an important piece of that, too. Ken Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in. When we think of 2019 costs are going up with labor pressure but you're seeing the pricing momentum. Volumes are strong, Recycling headwinds anniversary next year. So, can you help us with the puts and takes on how to think about 2019? What pricing do you need to be able to get let's say like 100 basis points of margin expansion next year? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Michael, you've hit on most of them. I do think Recycling has a better chance of being a tailwind for us next year because if we assume the commodity prices have come pretty close to bottoming out, then everything that we're doing is as I mentioned will eventually become a tailwind for us. So, Recycling, we think can be a tailwind for us next year. Labor is a question mark because as you recall we've got the \u2013 we have $2,000 bonus out there this year. We haven't decided what we'll do next year. We know that there will be some \u2013 we think there will be some labor inflation in the economy. So, there's some puts and takes within labor itself that we haven't fully quantified. We do think pricing particularly as I mentioned at the landfills and transfer operations, we think pricing is an opportunity for us not only for 2019 but for the remainder of 2018. And we will continue to push on that. And then all of those things that primarily Jim went through efficiency improvements to managing the middle of the day basically through technology. All of those we think start to build some momentum and ultimately contributes to the bottom line and to margins. So I would tell you, we're pretty encouraged about \u2013 if I look at the puts and takes for next year, we're pretty encouraged about 2019. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, Jim. And just based on your comments on core waste, it sounds like you have confidence on the cycle. Now, that said, your balance sheet could indicate a different story since it's pretty conservative. Can we get an understanding more on why the balance sheet is conservative at this part of the cycle? Is it goal to not overpay for acquisitions right now and have a fortressed balance sheet for that next downturn and maybe shift more towards buybacks and dividends? So if you could just kind of walk us through and flesh that out for us. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So I'll start, Michael, and then Jim can add on. But what I would say is that the conservative balance sheet is a result of really strong core growth. And so we've not done anything in recent years to reduce our indebtedness. In fact, we're committed to ensuring that we're allocating 100% or more of our free cash flow to that combination of share buyback, dividends and M&A. And we're going to continue to do that. With regard to taking a firmer stance or potentially a more aggressive stance on any piece of that, I think you hit the nail on the head with regard to ensuring that we're not overpaying for M&A in this environment. We are interested in ensuring that we continue to look for those acquisitions where the combination of the parts is greater than or provides a whole that is greater than those two pieces individually and we'll keep doing that. But we also focus on return on invested capital and we have to be sure that we continue to deliver the best in industry return on invested capital and growth in that return on invested capital over the long term. So, we're not going to overpay for M&A. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Michael, she said it right. The only thing I would say is, by the way, I think our long-term debt balance has been the same since I've been here in 2001. I think we had $9 billion and we have $8.9 billion now. So, she's right. It's really been \u2013 when you think about leverage, it's really been the growth of the business, not really any material changes in long-term debt. But with respect to the dividend itself, what we really have made a real effort to do is mirror changes in that base free cash flow with changes in our dividend and I think we've done a pretty good job of that. It doesn't happen every year. It doesn't even happen every other year although recently it seems to have happened every other year. But it's really more a function of when we see established kind of new norms with base free cash flow. That is a number that's gone up dramatically over a period of kind of six years from this kind of 1.1 up to, close to a 1.6, 1.7 number. And to the extent that we believe that has changed again, as I said, we'll try and mirror that with changes in the dividend. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. That's great. Just to sneak this last one in. I mean based on all the comments you're saying on volume and kind of what you're talking about landfill pricing, even not just 2019, but even the second half of this year, has there been any step change in July that you saw compared to the trends that you witnessed and observed in the second quarter? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You mean as far as volume goes, Michael? Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Yeah. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, so I'll just say this, and it's a kind of a small sample here, but July looks really good so far. In fact, we've talked about July looking as good as most of us, maybe with the exception of Jim, who's been here forever. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And, at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference over to Jim Fish for any closing remarks. <<[0BVPZY-E Jim Fish]>: Great. Thanks, Amanda. So, in closing, our theme today really remains consistent with our theme for the year. While we certainly had our challenges in Recycling, the Solid Waste business and the overall macro economy are as strong as we've seen them in well over a decade. And at this point, we don't see any storm clouds on the horizon as we look out towards 2019. Even the Recycling business itself becomes a tailwind, as we mentioned, for next year. And as we bring new technology to our operations, as our digital team makes great strides in rolling out differentiated customer-facing solutions and as we truly focus on providing an unmatched customer experience, we're very excited about what the future holds for Waste Management. I'd like to again thank all of our 43,000 teammates who really make this possible and thank all of you for joining us this morning. We will talk next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Ed. And thank you all for joining us this morning. The recurring theme for the first two quarters of 2018 was one of historically strong solid waste more than overcoming a weak recycling market. In the third quarter, we generated strong operating EBITDA growth and we expect that growth to continue and accelerate into the fourth quarter and into 2019. We executed very well on our plans to refine our recycling pricing model and pass on the higher cost of contamination to customers and we saw tangible benefits from the investments we're making in our employees. Our collection and disposal business generated strong organic revenue growth of 6.4% in the quarter. With the exception of last year's fourth quarter which had significant hurricane-related volumes, this quarter was the strongest core price-and-volume quarter in our company's history. And our commercial and industrial volumes continue to show steady growth trends, which we view as clear indicators that the overall economy remains on solid footing. Our operating EBITDA margin was 29% for the third quarter, and our collection and disposal operating margins improved by 40 basis points from the same quarter of prior year. When you combine this with our disciplined cost control on the SG&A line, we delivered solid growth in our income from operations and operating EBITDA, despite $22 million of continued recycling headwinds, about $17 million of unexpected third-party transportation and disposal costs, along with other inflationary cost pressures. We fully expect to pass those cost increases through to our customers with price increases in late Q4 and early Q1. Our current quarter operating EBITDA growth of 3.4% outpaced our second quarter growth of 3.1%, leaving us confident that we will deliver full-year operating EBITDA growth of approximately 5% in 2018. Overall, in the third quarter, we generated EPS of $1.15. Given the outstanding performance in the solid waste business and a lower than anticipated tax rate, we're once again increasing our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance. Our new EPS range is $4.13 to $4.15. With respect to our full-year operating EBITDA guidance, we expect to meet or exceed analysts' current 2018 consensus of $4.204 billion and we're narrowing our range to $4.2 billion to $4.22 billion. Similarly, we expect to meet or exceed analysts' current 2018 free cash flow consensus of $1.95 billion, as we narrow our free cash flow guidance to $1.95 billion to $2 billion for the year. In the first quarter, we talked a lot about investing a significant portion of our tax reform proceeds into our people. We know that our people are the key to our success and that's why we're focused on developing and retaining the best workforce in the industry. We're investing heavily in our employees and identifying future leaders of the company through succession planning and leadership development. In 2018, we will have invested over $135 million of compensation benefits in our employees, over and above our ordinary merit increase. That $135 million has come in the form of the $2,000 hourly bonus, which is unique in our industry, market-driven wage adjustments, and full absorption by the company of healthcare increases in 2018. Additionally, we've spent significant dollars in training, equipment, and facilities upgrades this year, all aimed at providing our employees a safe and effective work environment so that they can deliver top-quality service to our customers. There are a number of benefits to our customers, communities, and shareholders from the investments we're making in our employees. One measure we use to assess the effectiveness of these efforts is employee turnover, and I'm proud to say that in the third quarter we saw this metric improve. This is an impressive result considering we're in essentially a full employment economy and would normally expect our turnover to increase in such a strong job market. We also see the value of these investments in our quality of service, efficiency metrics and the overall profitability of our business. There's not a single solution approach to improving retention and employee satisfaction. But we're committed to making investments in our employees and driving a people-first culture at Waste Management. This focus on investing in our employees will continue into Q4 and 2019, as we further upgrade our fleet, facilities and technology, and as we look to build a world-class people organization. Lastly, regarding succession planning, as you know, this is Jim Trevathan's final earnings call, and as recently announced, we promoted John Morris from our Senior Vice President of Southern Tier Operations to be Jim's successor in the Chief Operating Officer role. John is a long tenured industry and Waste Management veteran with significant operating experience. And most of you have met him during investor meetings. I have no doubt he will be successful in this role. With Jeff Harris from our Northern Tier also retiring this year, we need to fill the operation's Senior Vice President positions for both tiers. We're pleased to announce the promotion of Tara Hemmer to the position of Senior Vice President of Southern Tier Operations; and Steve Batchelor to Senior Vice President of Northern Tier Operations. Tara and Steve both have extensive field operations experience and have both also led corporate operational functions. The success that they've demonstrated in their current roles gives us confidence in their ability to drive continued operating improvements in their respective tiers. Also with Jim's retirement, we're losing an important role within our company as head of sales, marketing and customer experience. Through our succession planning process, we've identified Mike Watson to be our Chief Customer Officer. Mike will be responsible for all sales, marketing, pricing and customer experience centers. Mike has both sales and operational experience, and we're excited to have Mike leading the customer organization and continuing to drive exceptional customer service. In summary, we feel good about our organic revenue growth and the earnings growth the business is generating. In 2018, we expect to deliver approximately 5% growth in our operating EBITDA in spite of the challenges we're overcoming in recycling, the investments we're making in our people and inflationary cost pressures, particularly in third-party transportation. As a result, we're optimistic when looking out to 2019, as our internal indicators point towards sustained strength in the overall economy. We'll give our detailed guidance in February, but suffice it to say that our base case for operating EBITDA growth in the year ahead is a repeat of the strong 5% growth we've seen in 2018 with real potential for an acceleration of that growth in 2019. I'm very enthusiastic about the direction of the company. We continue to deliver strong financial and operating performance and have promoted strong leaders to continue our high standard of operational excellence. With the hard work our employees have demonstrated so far, I'm confident that we can achieve our goals for the remainder of this year and set the stage for an even better 2019. I will now turn the call over one last time to Jim to cover our third quarter operating results in more detail. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning. 2018 has been a great year. So, in this case, we don't mind sounding like a broken record when we say that our traditional solid waste business is firing on all cylinders. For the sixth quarter in a row, revenue growth from both price and volume exceeded 2%. We continue to see strong organic revenue growth this quarter from the collection and disposal business, driving $200 million of incremental revenue or a 6.4% increase compared to the third quarter of 2017. Jim's earlier statement about the historic significance of this quarter is our company's best ever core price-and-volume result in a quarter without storm volume is worth repeating. Our laser focus on customer service is showing up in our results. Churn was 8.9% in the third quarter, a 110-basis-point year-over-year improvement. Rollbacks improved 210 basis points year-over-year and 410 basis points sequentially to 21.1%. Service increases exceeded service decreases for the 19th consecutive quarter and new business exceeded lost business for the 14th consecutive quarter, reflecting both our continued focus on our customers and the strength of the economy. Turning to internal revenue growth, our collection and disposal core price was 5.4% in the third quarter, a 70-basis-point improvement from last year. And yield was 2.5%, up 50 basis points. Traditional solid waste volumes grew 3.4%, while total company volumes improved 4.4%. The strong growth was driven by our most profitable lines of business : commercial, industrial and landfill. We also saw transfer station volumes increase by 24%, primarily due to the New York City disposal contract. Strong volume growth was achieved despite the additional volumes we received from hurricane cleanup and a competitor outage in the third quarter of 2017. As a reminder, our volume comparisons in the fourth quarter will be tougher due to the significant volume increases we saw from those two storms last year. So let's walk through the results by line of business, beginning with the tremendous growth in collection. Commercial core price was 6.7% for the quarter with volumes up 3%. Industrial core price was 10.7% with volumes up 3.3%. In the residential line of business, core price was 3.6% and volumes increased 0.7%. The combined price and volume increases led to collection income from operations growing $42 million or 6.8%, and operating EBITDA growing $54 million or 7%. In the landfill line of business, total volumes increased 5.1%. MSW volumes grew 2.2%, C&D volume grew 10.5% and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 7.2%. We achieved core price of 2.9% and, in the third quarter, our landfill line of business grew income from operations by $7 million and operating EBITDA by $26 million. In recycling, our field and corporate teams are working together to execute the initiatives we outlined to you earlier this year to improve the business model, including the contamination issues we face. While we're transitioning our contracts as they renew to ensure that we always recover processing costs before paying any rebates, we are currently passing back the cost of excess contamination to customers. In the quarter, we saw a larger year-over-year commodity price decline than we saw in the second quarter. Yet due to our efforts to address contamination, the EPS recycling impact improved $0.03 per share sequentially, even with no improvement in commodity prices, to about a negative $0.04 per share. Year-to-date, the impact is a negative $0.18 per share. As we expect pricing comparisons to ease in the fourth quarter and continued success on our approach to address contamination, we expect the year-over-year EPS recycling headwind to remain in the negative $0.17 to $0.20 per share range that we laid out last quarter. Total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 62% in the third quarter. Total operating expenses increased $79 million over the third quarter of 2017. The drivers of the $79 million increase were core solid waste volume growth, acquisitions, inflationary cost pressures, and investment in our employees. One of the investments we made in our employees, the hourly employee bonus, added about $16 million to our third quarter cost of operations. With pressures on labor, you might expect to see an increase in turnover. But, as Jim mentioned, we've actually seen an improvement in turnover. We have also seen a 14% increase in our subcontractor expenses as our vendors face labor and fuel cost pressures. Generally, we're able to pass on these higher costs in our prices for third-party volumes received at our transfer station. While the cost pressures are real and we are managing them, we also are experiencing strong revenue growth to cover higher cost. We're working hard every day to make sure that our pricing programs are outpacing our cost. And with improving technology and process changes, we are improving our collection efficiency. These positive results are reflected in the strong operating EBITDA growth that Jim discussed. And after 39 years with our company, 19 years on the senior team and 25 quarters, helping report our results as Chief Operating Officer, I'm pleased to end on a quarter with such strong results. Waste Management has great assets. Our greatest asset is our people, including our front-line team members, their local and area leadership teams and our corporate departments. We are better aligned on executing our strategy consistently across North America than at any time in my tenure. We have an excellent senior team, and it's been an honor and a privilege to be on this team with leaders who have vision and have proven that they can execute on that vision. And more importantly, they're just excellent people who I call friends. I'm confident that when I retire as an employee at the end of the year and yet remain a shareholder, Waste Management will continue to be in excellent hands, working hard to create more value for all of us. And I will now turn the call over to Devina for my last time to discuss our financial results. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter operating and financial results were solid, positioning us well to finish 2018 strong and start the New Year with momentum for continued growth. As Jim mentioned, we are going into the fourth quarter confident that we will deliver on our 2018 guidance for EPS, operating EBITDA and free cash flow. As has been the case throughout 2018, our third quarter results were driven by strong organic revenue growth in our traditional solid waste business, as well as our focus on controlling costs through operating efficiencies and our efforts to manage discretionary spending in SG&A to respond to other cost pressures. Together, these things positioned us to deliver another quarter of increased cash from operations. In the third quarter of 2018, cash from operations was $874 million, compared to $853 million in the same period last year. The growth in cash from operations was primarily driven by the strong operating EBITDA performance that Jim discussed. The current quarter growth was less significant than our operating EBITDA would imply, due to some timing differences in cash taxes and other components of our working capital. But we remain focused on improving working capital to provide even better cash flow conversion in the year ahead. When you look at the year-to-date results, the combined benefits of our earnings growth and working capital discipline are clear. Year-to-date, our operating cash flow as a percentage of revenue is an impressive 24%, which is a 200-basis-point improvement over full-year 2017. When we think about allocating our cash from operations, a critical piece is capital investment in the core business to support the strong organic growth we are seeing. This quarter we spent $404 million on capital expenditures and our year-to-date capital investment is $1.24 billion, keeping us on pace to spend the high-end of our full-year capital expenditure guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. We are seeing very strong organic growth in our highest return businesses, and we expect that to continue. So we are making valuable investments in our Sweden (21:22) landfills that position us well to continue to respond to growth. When we evaluate these investment opportunities, we're applying the same discipline and rigor that has made us the clear industry-leader in return on invested capital. We generated $480 million of free cash flow in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $1.52 billion, almost a 7% percent increase from the same period in 2017 and in line with our long-term growth expectations. We paid about $200 million in dividends and bought back $200 million in shares in the third quarter. So far this year, we've paid $605 million in dividends and repurchased $750 million of our shares. We also completed another $79 million in core solid waste tuck-in acquisitions this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to nearly $350 million. Our balanced allocation of free cash flow to shareholder returns and acquisitions in 2018 reflects our commitment to a disciplined and consistent capital allocation plan. While we do not formally review our long-term cash flow outlook until later in the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the growth that we are seeing in our cash conversion and baseline free cash flow. We're using almost all of the lower taxes from tax reform on employee investments and increased capital expenditures in 2018, and we expect that these investments will continue to be valuable in the years ahead. In spite of a more muted lift in free cash flow from tax reform, we are pleased with the increased profitability and cash flow conversion of the business, and expect that we will continue to provide a healthy increase in shareholder dividends as a result. Turning now to SG&A. These costs were 9% of revenue in the third quarter, a 60-basis-point improvement over last year. On a dollar basis, SG&A decreased $11 million from the same period last year to $345 million. As we've seen upward pressure on our operating costs, we've worked hard to rationalize discretionary SG&A spending. For the first time, we expect to finish the year with SG&A as a percentage of revenue under 10%. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 16.6%, and on an as-adjusted basis, it was 21.3%. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was slightly lower than we expected due to favorable return to accrual adjustments that are typical of our third quarter. We now expect our adjusted full-year tax rate to be about 23%. Turning to our financial metrics, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenant remained at 2.4 times at the end of the third quarter. About 17% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, and our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 4%. We're pleased with our results so far in 2018. And I know that, as I speak, the Waste Management team is working diligently to deliver a strong finish to the year. With that, Amanda, let's open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Your line is open. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Hey. Good morning. And Jim Trevathan, congratulations, way to go out on top. So, just a couple of questions. In terms of the narrowing of the guidance and taking down the high end, I think you're saying primarily that's because of kind of labor cost pressures that you expect to recover with pricing going until 2019, but can you just elaborate on that? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, look, I think here is the point, Corey, and I want to make sure this comes across clearly. When we sat in this conference room a year ago and we're building our 2018 plan, that plan did not contemplate $135 million that I mentioned. It didn't contemplate a $2,000 bonus that was $70 million. It didn't contemplate the labor cost increases and it did not contemplate a \u2013 it certainly expected a downturn in recycling. But it was kind of in the $0.10 range, $0.08 to $0.12. It did not expect recycling to be $60 million worse than that. So, all of that is kind of about $200 million in EBITDA. And I think that's the point that I really want to make which is, yeah, we're down kind of in the lower end of our original range. And so, call it, $4.210 billion, the original range would have had us at $4.225 billion, right? So, call it a $15 million difference between the original range and where we are today and consider that we've got an awful lot in there that solid waste has overcome. So, while, as Jim said, we sound like a broken record, I think that needs to be reiterated. The solid waste market for the industry and specifically for WM, and I say specifically for us because we have the $70 million that nobody else has in our cost structure, is incredibly good. It's making up for all of this other stuff that's touching us. We can talk a little bit about inflationary costs or whatever. But I just want to make sure that we understand it. Yes, we are coming off a little bit from that very original guidance, but when we sat here a year ago, there was a bunch of stuff that did not get baked into that plan that is hitting us today. But most importantly, solid waste is overcoming all of it. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yes. Understood. And just trying to understand the moving pieces. So, since you're talking about 2019, without giving guidance, I'm assuming it's somewhat fair game. So I know you said you think you're positioned to accelerate bottom-line growth in 2019. So, two questions about that. Have you already thought about what \u2013 and you're probably not going to announce anything now, but what you're going to do as far as like the bonus in 2018, are you going to do something like that in 2019, or how are you going to address that? And secondly, do you expect that, if you just look at the solid waste business, could bottom-line growth \u2013 do you expect it would accelerate in 2019? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. So, a couple of things in 2019. First of all, we haven't made a decision on the $2,000 at this point. I wouldn't expect to make this $2,000 a recurring payment over a period of years. But we have not made a specific decision around the $2,000. I do think that when you look at solid waste, when you look at the operating cost piece, that $135 million over and above our annual merit increase, we will look at that bucket and say how much of that are we going to spend, how much do we need to spend to remain competitive in the marketplace from a labor standpoint? Don't know the answer to that yet. And we'll scrub that as we get closer to February when we actually give guidance. But we think that there's a number of things that look like they may be tailwinds for us. Of course, we've talked a lot about the fact that we think recycling is going to be a tailwind for us, and that tailwind could be kind of somewhere in the $40 million to $50 million range and that assumes commodity prices hold flat where they are today, I tend to think they're kind of closer to the bottom than they are to the top. So, if they show any improvement then that number could be better. But the $40 million to $50 million basically is the carryover effect of these fees that we've put into place throughout the year. But more of those fees have been hitting us in Q3 and Q4 than in Q1 and Q2 last year. So, without saying where we think we're going to come in because we just haven't scrubbed all those numbers yet, it's why I said in my prepared remarks that I think EBITDA growth can at least at a baseline be as good as this year, which is 5% and there's a real possibility that we could exceed it in 2019. Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Yeah. Understood. I'll turn it over. Thank you, Jim. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Good morning. The first question is just around the potential impact of U.S. housing slowdown on your business. I know you're not seeing it right now, but maybe if you could talk about past cycles when the housing has slowed, how has your business reacted? And maybe what you're seeing currently as it relates to business indirectly or directly impacted by U.S. housing potentially continuing to slow? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, Hamzah. Good question. Look, let me say this about housing. First of all, our business is quite a bit different than it was in 2008, 2009. We had 10 years ago a lot more exposure to the residential housing market. Today, our exposure to the residential housing market we think is kind of in the $100 million to $150 million per year in revenue range. And so let's say, housing let's say dropped off the table and was down by 20%, which by the way it's still growing today, it's just growing at a slowing rate. So this certainly doesn't feel like an 2008, 2009. But let's say it was, let's say it dropped off by 20%, our exposure there, because we're a small participant in the residential housing market, is probably $20 million a year. So it's pretty small. We're much bigger when it comes to construction and demolition in the commercial and industrial sector. And I would tell you from that standpoint, and Jim can probably talk about our volume numbers specifically there, but those two segments look increasingly strong for us. So I would tell you that we're not really seeing this kind of \u2013 the big macro number that's getting talked about a lot is housing start, and we're not really seeing it primarily because it's being overcome by bigger pieces of business for us and, secondarily, it's just much, much smaller than it was 10 years ago. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Jim, to that point, the commercial business has always been a really good indicator of what's going on in that sector because as you build out houses in new neighborhoods, you get that commercial growth that surrounds those new neighborhoods. And, Hamzah, if you look back, I mean we were positive in commercial volume through every quarter of 2016. Since the first quarter of 2017, it's been over 2.5% and we're past 3% right now on the commercial line of business. This is our most profitable line of business from a margin view and from a return on invested capital view. This looks like a really strong economy. I mean I think the commercial line of business is an excellent indicator of that. It's hitting on all cylinders as we've talked about and it's supported by both our people. Our folks are doing an excellent job. We've added volume in the national account front in the commercial line of business. Our inside sales center had their best year. Our area teams have had their best year that I can find on the commercial side. Our operating guys are really focused on service and they've helped us reduce defection. It's a real success story from a commercial standpoint and I think that connects to your question about housing and just the general economy. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Very helpful. And just second question, we talked about labor cost pressure as the subcontractor expands amongst some discretionary labor costs. Do you expect operating leverage on the gross margin line to improve in 2019? Is that the takeaway that we should take because you're going to essentially be able to pass on some of these labor inflationary costs? So I'm specifically just talking about op leverage on the gross margin line, not EBITDA growth. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. And it kind of goes to Corey's earlier question. I mean, we really have some kind of inflationary pressures in, but they're limited to kind of three cost categories. We've talked about labor, which is up 4%-ish, and that excludes the $2,000. I mean, repairs and maintenance are up about 4.5%, and the third-party transportation's up 9.5%. I mentioned the third-party transportation, we look to pass that through. There really are two anecdotes to inflation, one is pricing and one is efficiency gains. So we'll use pricing to pass through the third-party transportation increase. It takes us a little while to get to it. So it'll be kind of end of Q4 and into Q1 of next year to offset that 9.5% increase that was pretty unexpected that hit us in Q3 this year. Repairs and maintenance up 4.5%, but that should really start to come down considerably next year because a lot of that's driven by an old fleet. And we have bought more trucks this year than at any year in our history and a lot of that was back-end loaded. So those back-end loaded fleet purchases in 2018 will start to positively impact repairs and maintenance as we get into 2019. So I wouldn't expect to see the 4.5% in repairs and maintenance going forward. And then the 4%, look, I think that one is where you use efficiency gains. And 2019, as with 2018, we will spend a lot of time focused on how do we become more efficient. We're looking to roll-out a routing optimization software that we think will really help us with operating efficiencies. So we think there's some real opportunity. And it goes a bit to Corey's question about kind of that 5% EBITDA growth next year. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And Hamzah, I would just add on that the other two things that should provide lift to that gross margin you're speaking of in 2019 are disposal pricing focuses that Jim spoke about last quarter that we're going to continue to execute upon in the year ahead. And also as we integrate these businesses and optimize them that we've acquired in 2018, we expect those to provide some lift for us in 2019. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Jim and Devina, one specific that shows the margin opportunity is we've all seen the investment in our fleet this year, and if you look at most of \u2013 a big portion of those trucks were in the commercial line of business to support that volume growth. And if you compare September as well as Q3 maintenance cost for that line of business, it was roughly flat with prior year, where maintenance cost for the other two lines of business that have not had a significant new truck influx were what created the operating cost increase. So, as we move forward and in Q3 and Q4, we're seeing more trucks of the new trucks on the industrial and the residential line. I expect the same maintenance cost margin opportunity as we get those trucks there routed and servicing customers better. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Good point. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Congrats, Jim, and enjoy spending time with your 10 grand kids. Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you, Hamzah. Appreciate it. And you as well, Corey. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. There seems to be a very common theme already emerging from some of the questions really around price and cost and in your comments as well. And I just want to make sure we're all thinking about this right. You're on track to deliver kind of 2% and 2% yield plus volume, or frankly well above that on volume this year. But as you look at what you talked about with disposal pricing, getting better pricing to account for rising third-party costs. As we look to next year, are we headed toward something more like a 3% and 1% environment? And what does that imply potentially about your ability to really make these core price increases stick at a higher level? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Hey, Noah. Let me jump in, and I know Jim will have something to add to this. But you heard it a lot, my previous boss talked a lot about 2% and 2%. We've done that now for six consecutive quarters. As that retiring employee of the company and a big shareholder, I really like the idea from my current boss talking about 3% and 3%. But 2% and 2% is good as well. So, not a forecast, that's a existing executive but a shareholder loving 3% and 3%. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, so here's what I would add to that. Look, I think we're going to finish the year around a yield number of maybe not for the whole year but certainly in Q3, Q4 of around 2.5%. And so, Devina talked about disposal pricing and getting more aggressive with that. We've talked about taking some cost pass-through, price increases for things like third-party transportation. So, Jim, I don't think it's unrealistic to expect that we couldn't finish 2019 for the entire year at a 3% yield. You did say 3% and 1%, and... James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: I didn't. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, no, you didn't but... Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: I did, yes. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Noah said 3% and 1%. So I think you're a little pessimistic on the 1% there. Unless the economy does something different than what our internal indicators are portending, then I would tell you that we're kind of more where Jim Trevathan is, 3% and 3%. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: I hope my (39:47) will be proven wrong. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. Let's not build that into models yet. I would tell you we're still looking at it. But to Jim's point, we are more optimistic than that 1% would imply. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: I appreciate that. And then, Devina, maybe one for you as well. The improvement in OCF conversion this year, well noted. Obviously, there was some working capital drag in the quarter. Just want to talk about kind of, first, any kind of areas of concern within the customers in terms of accounts receivable build, not being able to get that back? And then kind of more looking at 2019, any reason why you can't get, say, another 100 to 200 bps improvement in that conversion rate? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So I'll start with the first question with respect to receivables, and I can tell you we did have a drag in the current quarter on the receivable front. But I would attribute that more to business mix and revenue growth; both things are good for us. On the business mix side, it's the revenue growth that we're seeing in the industrial line of business, in particular. Those customers tend to be a little slower pay and some of the national accounts business as well. So we see pressure on the DSO line, but no pressure on bad debt expense or collectability that causes us any pause. And as a result, the revenue growth side of the equation is really what we focus on there. And it's okay to us that we see a small drag on DSO, because for us it's the long-term EBITDA growth that we're going to focus on. And I really think that that leads to your second question and really circles back to what we've talked about already with regard to the leverage that we see in the operating expense line in the year ahead to provide incremental growth in cash flow conversion for 2019. It's difficult to say if we'll get incremental cash flow conversion at the level that we saw in 2018, because a piece of that is tax reform-related and you have the one year lift that will come from tax reform and some of the proactive tax planning that we did at the end of 2017 that left us in an overpaid position at the end of the year and allowed us to capture some of that benefit in 2018. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: That's extremely helpful. Thank you so much. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Morning, Tyler. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Devina, back to that point. So can you update us on where cash tax as a percent of the book taxes will end up this year? Obviously, I'm assuming it's less than 100%, again, given some of those tax planning strategies. But how should we think about that maybe in 2019 and 2020? Will it move up? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, in 2018, we think that's going to be around 65%, though we're still scrubbing that number. Because as you saw in the current quarter release, we had some tax benefits from return to accrual and that will impact that relationship. And I haven't quite gotten through that impact yet because we finalized the tax return so late in the quarter. So I'll get you more color on that as we get it. But with regard to how we think about it looking long-term, we expect it to tick up to more like a 75% to 80% ratio on a long-term basis. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And... James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I think, Tyler, the big question about 2019 is, with respect to cash from operations and then ultimately free cash flow, I mean, taxes are going to be what they're going to be. I mean, we're managing them a little bit, as Devina said. I mean, we had, related to tax reform, some prepayments and then recapture of that. But the big question's going to be around working capital management, which was asked of her, and then also around CapEx. And I would tell you, and that may be your follow-on question, so I'll go ahead and preempt you. But I think CapEx, when we've talked in years past about it being kind of 10%-ish of overall revenue, and this year is a much bigger number than that, some of it just is kind of recovering some of the old fleet and replacing some of that old fleet. But as we think about 2019, 2020 and beyond, it's really a matter of looking at kind of growth capital versus replacement capital. And as you have heard from Trevathan, there's a fair amount of growth in the system. So we've invested fairly heavily in growth capital this year. But I think scrubbing that CapEx number to come up with a number that's acceptable to us, acceptable to shareholders, is going to be an important aspect of our free cash guidance that we give in February. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Yeah. No, that was definitely what I was looking for. But to wrap it up, so you're on track for let's call it around $2 billion this year, maybe you're hot on CapEx, maybe you're a little cool on cash taxes. And you presumably have I think a $70 million cash bonus payment, but also recycling prices are close to a decade-low. I know you really haven't talked about baseline free cash flow recently, but is there any reason to believe that this $2 billion is not a very good jumping off point when you kind of think about the next couple years forward? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Like Jim said, we'll definitely scrub some of the details, particularly on the capital side of the equation, as we get closer to providing guidance for 2019. I think the most important piece in the baseline free cash flow assumption comes down to EBITDA growth. And the long-term EBITDA growth rate that Jim mentioned of 5% and being confident in that, we're going to peg our expectations for long-term free cash flow growth at that level. And so, if we look at 2018 guidance of $1.95 billion to $2 billion, our expectation at this point would be that the EBITDA growth will translate into free cash flow growth. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Right. And maybe just one quick last one for Jim Trevathan. This kind of goes back to Hamzah's question. But I know you mentioned that industrial volumes were up 3.3%. Can you bifurcate that between temporary and permanent pulls? Do you have that data? James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. No, I don't have it here, Tyler. We can get you the (46:26). But it was \u2013 I mean, I think it's roughly the same and I don't think you're going to see a wide disparity between that temporal outgrowth and our base business that the permanent customers is \u2013 the economy is sound and doing very well and that's where you see the permanent business is doing exceptionally well. And we focus more there because we can expect that to continue long-term. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you so much. Sorry to circle back to recycling. I know there was an issue in prior quarters and becoming a less of an issue now. But can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of how the restructuring of your contracts are going so far? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. I would tell you this. There's kind of a question of short-term receptivity of these fees and long-term. Short-term receptivity has I think been pretty good. And we've got two different types of fees here. So we're talking about a recycle materials offset fee, which is really more driven by commodity prices. And then, we have a contamination fee that's really not driven by commodity prices. It's driven by the amount of contamination that comes on the front door, which we've talked about in the past has increased a fair amount over the last 5 to 10 years. So we're charging both. As we broke it out I think last quarter into phases and I won't go into that level of detail, but we are \u2013 it's still getting customers onto those fees. So, that continues and that will continue into 2019. We really had very few customers on those fees in the first quarter of 2018. A few more in second quarter and then really started to ramp up into third quarter and fourth quarter. So, that's why we think we have kind of, assuming commodity prices are flat, a $40 million to $50 million tailwind potentially in 2019. The other side of that is kind of the long-term receptivity and that one's hard to gauge. I don't know how receptive customers will be over the long-term, which means that we have to take a more strategic view of recycling. And what I would tell you is that we're looking to fundamentally change our processing plants where we're actually looking at building a recycle plant of the future. And that recycle plant of the future, which could open as soon as kind of Q4 of 2019, would fundamentally change our processing cost, it would fundamentally change the quality of the recycle product coming out of the back-end of the plant. And that's more of the long-term solution in our minds. Doesn't mean by the way that we would stop charging fees, it's just we've got to change the way we process materials. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: Jim, I might add... Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: ...that those first two phases that you mentioned that are more temporary or the initial phase, are going very well every month, every week. Yesterday's report showed an improvement versus the prior week. So we're moving those two categories forward much quicker. That third is that long-term residential contract change. And that although we have some contracts that we've gotten agreement from cities to change in the middle of the contract, most of them kind of go till the end. So, every month, every quarter as they expire, we're changing the fee. That receptivity is different than the first two... James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: ...but still positive. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. And then just circling back to some of the, I guess, unexpected third-party costs that you had mentioned. Is there anything that you can do different fundamentally in your business to reduce that from happening in future quarters? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Look, most of that third-party \u2013 I mean, I would tell you that that third-party cost increase that hit us in the third quarter was largely from our transportation providers seeing the same type of labor inflation and fuel cost increases, and then also some DOT hour limitations recently imposed. So I think that's what is the cause of that. And so, is there a way to mitigate that? I think the best answer to that is through price increase of our customers. I mean, we can always go back and we do go back to our procurement group and try and make sure that we have fair rates with our providers, and we think we do. So, when they pass through their own cost increases, we just have to make sure that we turn around and pass them back through to our customers as well. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Feniger of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Hey, Mike. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. I'm just trying to square something, what I mean, you're seeing the momentum on your business, you sound optimistic, message is clear. Like how should I square that away with your balance sheet? I think your leverage is just the lowest we've seen in a decade. We're talking about closer to a 3% and 3% type scenario rather than a 3% and 1%. So how should I square that away with kind of where your leverage is now and how you're thinking about that? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: You're right, our balance sheet is in the best shape that it's been not just in the decade, but really probably in our history. And from our perspective, we are going to focus on long-term return of value to the shareholders in a combination of dividends, share repurchases and then strategic M&A. And what I think the balance sheet tells you is that we believe that we're really well-positioned for future strategic M&A decisions that we could make at a different point in the cycle. I think if you look at where we are, we all talk about the fact that the economy is probably at a peak, and there's definitely some room to go from here. But we've talked about the length of growth in this economy and the expectation that it could turn from here. And we like the fact that we're as well-positioned today as we are to be able to act in a different economic environment should opportunities present themselves. We have also proactively done tuck-in M&A in this environment. And so, when you look at 2018 free cash flow, we expect to allocate more than 100% of free cash flow through a combination of those shareholder returns and M&A in 2018. And so we won't see a tick down in leverage from here because the health of the balance sheet gives us that strategic flexibility that we think is important from this point forward. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That makes \u2013 thank you. And just for my follow-up, you guys invested in growth CapEx, the market's strong, I totally get that. I'm just wondering if you could maybe comment on the industry. So we know demand is strong. I'm just trying to gauge the supply side of that. Are you seeing the smaller- and medium-size companies also really reinvesting in their fleet or adding a lot of trucks to their route as well? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I don't know, I don't know. I mean, obviously, the big integrated guys are, just like we are. I don't know about the smaller guys. I guess I don't follow them closely enough. I can tell you the guy that picks up mine hasn't reinvested in his fleet recently. So I don't know. I would tell you one last thing and then Devina had some. I think a lot of our CapEx in 2018, I mentioned fleet, but a lot of it has transitioned to CNG and automation. So it's not just replacing older trucks. It's transitioning to natural gas and automation. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. The one piece of color on the smaller provider that I think is important is they're going to have a different capital structure than we are and they're going to be very sensitive to the rising interest rate environment. And so, that actually should speak well of the larger providers who are going to be able to continue to fund their capital with free cash flow in this rising interest rate climate. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for that, Devina. And if I can just squeeze one in. When you were talking about the capital allocation, like, can you just remind us how you think about with what you were commenting before about the baseline free cash flow, how do we think about that in terms of your dividend policy? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, over the long-term, we just look to increase the dividend annually in a way that's consistent with our long-term growth expectations in free cash flow. We're currently at about 45% of free cash flow on the dividends. Because of the nice healthy growth in free cash flow over the last several years, we expect that you'll see another healthy increase in the 2019 dividend in the year ahead. Last year it was about 9.5% of an increase on a year-over-year basis. I would expect that \u2013 we're going to be in a position to consider an increase that's along those same lines, although it's too early for us to say. And we'll be reviewing that more specifically as we review that baseline free cash flow assumption that we talked about. Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. This is Derrick Laton sitting in Brian. Thanks for taking my question. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Good morning. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just if we could circle back to M&A for a second. I appreciate you guys aren't looking to maybe do any large strategic acquisition given at this point in the cycle. But maybe if you could comment a little bit on the environment for tuck-in acquisitions. You guys \u2013 I think you mentioned you already spent about $350 million so far this year on those. Just kind of the pipeline that you have for acquisitions and then the opportunities as you look ahead to 2019? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. So, look, I always tell you that there's still some good companies out there with reasonable expectations, as evidenced by our increase in M&A in 2018. It also feels a little bit like there's some elevated expectations. I think that was kind of Devina's point with the economy being hot right now. There are some companies that have pretty elevated expectations. And we have said since the beginning of time that we're going to be disciplined about how we look at acquisitions from a pre-synergy multiple standpoint, and we're just not interested in paying 13 times or whatever for some of these folks. But to reiterate the first point, there are some good companies out there with very reasonable expectations that are very attractive to us. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And I would add to that, if you look at the third quarter, we spent $79 million. And so I think that's a good indication of the fact that we still have a healthy pipeline and we're going to continue to execute deals where we can integrate them well into our existing business and get good operating leverage in the years ahead. The revenue that we've acquired in 2018 is around $215 million. And so, while that might get muted on our internal revenue growth pace that you guys look at because we had some offsets from divestitures, the acquisition piece is healthier from an EBITDA contribution perspective and we're really optimistic that you'll see a nice lift in 2019 from that M&A activity. Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Your line is open. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. And Jim Trevathan, it's been a pleasure. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: I agree, Michael. Good to hear from you. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, Devina, I can't help but ask you about working capital specifically around payables. And I have talked about this, six days in your hand and I'm curious what it takes to pay your bills slower to get some help there. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. So what I would say is that, if you look at our days payable over time, we're really satisfied with the work that we've been doing and that we continue to do to move this metric in the right direction. In 2017, we got a two-day lift. In 2018, it's been more like a half a day over the course of the year, so certainly a slowdown. But I would attribute that to the fact that when you implement continuous improvement-type initiatives, you focused on the biggest levers first and that's what you see in these results. When you look at the benefits that we've gotten so far, it's in the spend categories where we had spend concentrated with few vendors. As we continue to move this initiative forward, it's harder to move the needle because you're looking at spend in the hands of many, many more vendors. So, that takes time to roll out. We, though, are not taking our foot off that pedal. We continue to move it in the right direction. The headwind that we saw in the current quarter really was on the DSO side of the equation. And as you know, DSO has a far greater impact on the dollar impact to cash from operations than the DPO part of the equation does. So when you see that kind of impact to the DSO calc, you end up with a headwind even though you're making progress on the other side. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. But do you still think if I looked out three to four years you're going to get that six days out? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: It's certainly an aspirational goal. I kind of would equate it to the aspirational goal that we had in SG&A to get SG&A as a percentage of revenue below 10%. And I can tell you we had that goal when I started with the company 16 years ago and we're getting there for the first time this year. So I can't tell you how quickly we'll get those six days. When I look at working capital, I do think that there's about $300 million of lifetime enterprise value to free cash flow. But I would remind everyone that when you get that lift, it's a one-time lift. It's not something that you then see in recurring free cash flow going forward. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: But it's not going to take us 16 years. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. And you were asked about the baseline; it resets the baseline, and that's where I was really getting, is I think there's more baseline upside than $2 billion. But shifting gears to... Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, Michael, I... Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Go ahead. Sorry. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: I would just like to clarify that working capital really can't reset the baseline, because similar to \u2013 if we went back and looked at 2017, and as I mentioned, we got a two-day lift in DPO, in the aggregate working capital benefited us about $100 million last year. We have to get that same kind of lift in 2018 in order to just replicate that in the baseline. And so we actually are behind the curve because we're not getting the same year-over-year lift. And that shows up as a decrease on a year-over-year basis. So it's not lifting the baseline when we get this free cash flow contribution from DPO extension. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. We maybe are talking about that philosophically differently, but I'll push that to a different time. Given the commentary, humorous or not, about a 3% and 3%, let's temper it and just say it's still a 2% and 2%, but you don't have the headwind from recycling. In fact, we have to sort of ask where does the process fee show up now as a revenue number, is it a price issue? You are probably going into next year with a 4% or 5% starting number, if not better, which means 5% in EBITDA is flat margins. And yet I would assume you're expecting to improve margins in 2019. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, yeah, and that's why \u2013 I mean, look, when I say 5%, that's why we're not giving guidance; we're still in the middle of our planning process for next year. But just more of an indication of our view of the overall economy and our view of our business less specifically. I would tell you that I think that 2% and 2% is, assuming the economy stays strong, that 2% and 2% is probably conservative. I think we can do better than 2% and 2%. There is a bear case out there for volumes within the industry. We are much closer to the bull case and it's not just kind of an aspiration. When we look at the bull case and we look at the impact of tax reform that is still being felt, we look at reduced government regulation beginning to positively impact the special waste market, we look at the construction business continuing to grow, cranes in just about every city and even housing starts, which I mentioned earlier. It doesn't have as big an impact on us, but housing starts potentially kind of bottoming, all of that is kind of a bullish case that would tell you that volumes have more upside than downside in this type of economy. And look, I don't want to be blindly optimistic here, but it sure feels like when I look at some of our advanced indicators that we're closer to the bull case than the bear case, which kind of leads me to believe that 2.5% is more doable than 2%. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: And I would certainly say that there is an expectation for margin expansion in the year ahead. So the revenue side of the equation we're very optimistic about, but we also, as we mentioned earlier, have a great deal of optimism on the cost and efficiency side. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, to that end, if we stripped away the recycling headwind this quarter and the rev rec headwind, can you in fact articulate margin expansion in solid waste? Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Yes. We had 40 basis points of margin expansion in solid waste in the quarter. And then your comment about rev rec, rev rec and the hourly bonus that Jim mentioned actually offset one another. And so, when we look at the recycling line of business, that was a 20-basis-point headwind. So, that gets you to the 20 basis points of EBITDA margin that we saw in the quarter. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, if you took \u2013 the things you've done this year in recycling, if you hadn't done them, what would the $0.17 to $0.20 been? Maybe that's another way for us to understand the power of this going into 2019. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: So, in the current quarter, we think it was about $0.03 of benefit and you can see that most easily if you look at the first and the second quarter impact for a total of $0.15, and in Q4 we only had a $0.04 impact. So, if you take the... James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: With lower commodity prices. Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.: Absolutely. And so, that shows you the value of those fee programs that we've put in place. There's more work that we can do on the cost part of the recycling line of business, and Jim mentioned the automation and recycling plan of the future. But we are also optimistic that as we really start to see contamination efforts take hold, we can do a better job of managing the gross operating expense of the plant going forward. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: And Michael, we've seen about 3% improvement in the operating cost sequentially, as we've tackled this since the Q1 high number. So we're better in Q2 and Q3 sequentially on the operating side, without the fee impact, just the operating cost side. So we're making those improvements. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: I think, Michael, actually the answer to your question might be that $40 million to $50 million number that I gave you for next year because the assumption there is that we hold flat on commodity prices. So, if we hold flat on commodity prices from this year, that $40 million to $50 million is really the effect of those fees on a year-over-year basis. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: In both revs and EBITDA? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. So that's EBITDA, yeah, let's call it $0.07. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. That helps. And then you all have talked in the past about $1.5 billion of direct-to-labor cost and you think you could take that down by 10%. Where are we in that in the context of helping manage some of this inflation that's going on? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, so I think that's an important question because, as we think about 2019, we've talked a lot internally about the fact that this 2019, there's really going to be a focus on operating costs in 2019. John Morris is sitting here at the table, so I'm looking right at him. But, seriously, I think 2019 we have a real opportunity with some of the technology that we're looking to roll out and the continuation of improving that middle of the route that we've talked about. We've gotten really good at managing the ends of the route being pre-trip and post-trip. The middle of the route is an area where we think we still have a real opportunity. So I think you'll see, specific to labor, improvement in 2019. And then as we think about other things like repairs and maintenance, we talked about that and of course there's been an operating cost headwind for us this year, and we expect that not only with new trucks, but also with process improvement we can begin to whittle away at that. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, 10% is still realistic and maybe you keep most of it, not all of it, because of inflation? James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Yeah. I don't know \u2013 it kind of goes to Devina's comment about working capital. 10% I think is realistic. I'm not sure I can give you a timeframe on that. Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. All right. Thank you very much for taking the questions. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And with that, this does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Fish for the closing remarks. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, thank you, everyone. Lastly today I'd like to say a few words about Jim Trevathan and Jeff Harris. As Jim said, he's been on the senior leadership team for almost 20 years and has been with Waste Management for almost 40 years. And I've spent every quarter preparing for these calls since I took the CFO role and he took the COO role in 2012. And I have to tell you, there's many times that I've looked across the table in amazement at Jim and how well thought out his answers were, how well articulated his answers were to difficult questions. Jim's been a confidant, a strategic partner, a voice of reason and, most importantly, a friend to me for many years. And now I look forward to spending some time with Jim outside of the office at the cabin and steamboats and on a golf course somewhere. Jeff Harris, our Senior Vice President of Northern Tier Operations, as we said, he's also retiring at the end of the year and he's dedicated almost 25 years of his distinguished career to Waste Management. He's been a very important sounding board for me as a senior leader and Jeff's leadership in the Northern Tier is going to be a tough act to follow. I think Jeff's probably going to spend some of his retirement making more trips to Columbus to see his Buckeyes, although after last weekend he might just watch it on TV. But, look, I really want to express my sincere thanks to Jim and Jeff for their many years of valuable service to Waste Management and for their invaluable contribution to our continued success. We wish you both the very best in your coming retirements and we expect to see you guys at our Phoenix Open in February. James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.: On behalf of Jeff and myself, Jim, it's been a pleasure and a privilege. Thank you. James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.: Well, thanks very much. We'll sign-off with that. Thanks for joining us today. We'll talk to you next quarter.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed. And thank you all for joining us this morning. At this time last year, I was telling you that 2017 was arguably the best year we've seen. I'm pleased to report that 2018 results were even better. Through our continued focus on customer experience, our cost management and our price discipline, to name a few, we had a great year. For the year, the business produced a record high in operating EBITDA, which is the best reflection of the health of our business. We grew operating EBITDA by more than 5%, in spite of the strongest recycling headwinds we've seen in over a decade. Overall, in 2018, we produced $4.20 of EPS, another year of double-digit improvement. Devina will cover our 2019 guidance in more detail, but we are forecasting another record year in operating EBITDA this year with our growth rate expected to be about 5%. Included in our 2019 forecast is our expectation that the strong recycling headwinds from last year will turn into a tailwind, thanks to our focused efforts on reducing operating costs in our plants and charging fees for contamination. To the extent the Waste Management is a good proxy for the overall U.S. economy, our 2019 guidance of another record year in operating EBITDA clearly demonstrates the strength of our own business and of the economy as a whole. As we mentioned, our operating EBITDA is the best reflection of the health of our business and our strong growth translated into the strongest free cash flow we've seen ever with the exception of 2014 when we sold our waste energy business. We allocated close to 90% of that free cash flow to shareholder returns, growing our dividend for the 15th consecutive year and spending $1 billion on share repurchases. We also spent $466 million on acquisitions, an indicator of the active M&A environment we\u2019re in and our ability to complete transactions at our targeted returns. In 2018, we continue to focus on our people, disposal optimization, technology and profitable growth, all about delivering exceptional customer service. Our strong 2018 results validate that our execution on our focused differentiation and continuous cost improvement strategies drive strong growth in our business, and we expect further progress in 2019. Our strategic direction in 2019, will look very much like 2018, as we move forward with a cultural transformation that places Waste Management employees at the head of the class in terms of focus and importance. In December, we announced the hiring of our Chief Human Resources Officer, Tamla Oates-Forney who was formerly an HR executive at GE. Tamla's moving forward quickly in putting world-class processes in place, upgrading talents and helping to direct this valuable cultural shift at Waste Management. Similarly, after only 15 months under the leadership of Nikolaj Sjoqvist, our new digital team is beginning to show how our investment in operating, customer facing and back office technologies, as we migrate towards more agile cloud-based systems, can serve to differentiate Waste Management going forward, and propel profitable growth. Lastly, on the strategic front, our 2019 sustainability forum which was held two weeks ago, in conjunction with the Waste Management, Phoenix Open, broke all previous forum attendance records and built on our message of sustainability, that is collectively good for the environment, good for our customers, and good for our investors. That's best demonstrated by the shift in our fleet from higher cost, higher emission diesel trucks to quieter, much cleaner burning, lower cost CNG trucks. To complement and aid shift towards sustainability and benefit from the geographic breadth of our landfill assets, Waste Management is investing in higher return energy plants at our landfills in 2019 and beyond. This investment provides an avenue to close the loop between our renewable energy plants and CNG fleet, creating favorable returns for the Company. Our strategic focus on people, technology and growth to a superior customer experience is moving Waste Management from a leader in the waste business to being a leader in the Fortune 250. That was no better acknowledged than with our recent recognition by Fortune as one of the world's most admired companies. Finally, as part of our strategic growth plan, we will continue to invest in acquisitions that surpass our return criteria and create value for our shareholders. Our pipeline looks robust and there are plenty of opportunities to invest in acquisitions at a rate similar to what we achieved in 2018. So, in 2019, we expect another year of above average M&A activity. To that point, you may have seen that we recently received Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance to proceed with the acquisition of landfill assets in West Texas. We will be buying these assets at an operating EBITDA multiple well below our trading multiple and we\u2019re excited [technical difficulty] core Waste Management service offering. We hope to close in March and we will provide additional details once the deal is closed. In summary, our hardworking employees made 2018, a very successful year, and we expect to see strong growth again in 2019. We will continue to make investments in our employees and technology and in capital equipment this year to further grow our business, improve customer service and generate strong returns. We are confident that these investments will position us well for 2019 and into the future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John and Devina to discuss our results, and our 2019 guidance in more detail. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter results, as we executed extremely well on our core price disciplined growth strategies. Our industry-leading organic revenue growth continued to drive strong income from operations and operating EBITDA growth, both ground 7% in the fourth quarter. Throughout 2018, and particularly in the second half of the year, we've been very focused on our pricing programs to overcome inflationary cost pressures and grow margins. As we continue to experience cost pressures in 2019, particularly labor, transportation and landfill operating cost, we will ensure that these increases are being passed along to our customers so that we can continue to generate appropriate returns and grow margins. This strategy is best demonstrated by our collection line of business. We generated strong growth in 2018 and expect that trend to continue into 2019. As we think about the year ahead in our collection line of business, we expect to see the benefit from our investments in people, fleet and technology. First, as Jim mentioned, focusing on our people is the most important priority in 2019. Last year, we invested a portion of our tax savings in our employees, and this year in addition to upgrading and automating our fleet, we will continue to invest in our employees through a proactive wage increases, facility improvements and additional training at our driver and technician training facility, which will open in the first half of this year. In regard to fleet investments, 2018 truck purchases and further fleet investments planned in 2019 are beginning to drive meaningful improvement in our maintenance costs. By the end of 2019, we expect to have over 60% of our routed vehicles running on natural gas, and we know there is a significant maintenance savings with natural gas, as compared to diesel trucks as they age. 2018 proved to be another solid year with respect to our efforts around continuous improvement and modernizing the work environment for our employees. We believe the steps we\u2019re taking to move towards an automated fleet will continue to drive not only safety performance, which is paramount, but also the meaningful efficiency and employee retention. This was again validated with several recent contracts that we were able to convert from the traditional rear-load model to an automated sizeable service offering. We recognized almost immediate improvement in all of those critical elements of our performance. We are also advancing our fleet strategy through partnerships with the truck manufacturers to implement the same safety technology we have in many of our cars today. We are looking to implement features like lane departure warnings, brake assist and collision detection that are worthwhile for enhanced safety alone, and they have the added benefit of making our operations more efficient as we avoid lost time and costs associated with incidents. Finally, the use of technology is important to the continued growth of our collection business. We've been collecting and using data from the technology on our vehicles to anticipate and respond to our customers\u2019 growth and needs. This is translating into lower customer churn, volume growth above U.S. economic levels, and it's creating value for our customers and shareholders. Looking at our disposal network, as we have discussed, we have the best positioned assets in North America but we are seeing cost pressures from our third-party haulers at our transfer stations and higher landfill operating costs. We\u2019re focused on disposal pricing opportunities that will continue to create healthy margin in a rising cost environment. In addition, we look to continue to make technology investments, like our pilot with Caterpillar for remote operated equipments that will continue to increase the returns in these valuable assets. Turning to recycling, we performed well in the fourth quarter as a direct result of our continued focus on improving operating costs, restructuring our municipal contracts and successfully battling contamination. In 2019, we will look to continue to improve in recycling by investing in the MRF of the future to further improve operating costs and optimizing our plans by being thoughtful about meeting our customers' requirements. In addition, we will continue making progress on reducing contamination, assessing fees to cover our cost of service and reduce cost of managing materials. Last week, we closed on above average amount of acquisitions in 2018, and as Jim mentioned, the pipeline looks strong for 2019. Integrating these acquisitions is a key priority for our operating teams to ensure we manage cost, extract the value of these transactions and deliver superior service to our customers. I'm excited about the future opportunity for Waste Management, as we believe that focusing on our people, optimizing our disposal network, better using technology and growing our business will provide strong returns for many years to come. I'll now turn the call over Devina to further discuss our financial results and 2019 outlook. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results were in many ways the strongest we saw all year, allowing us to close our 2018 on a strong note as we either met or exceeded all expectations. I'm going to start by reviewing those results in detail and then turn to our outlook for 2019. Our top two financial priorities are growing operating EBITDA and leveraging that growth to convert more earnings to free cash flow. In 2018, we delivered on each of those priorities. Operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter grew on a year-over-year basis by more than 7%. For the full-year, operating EBITDA was $4,216 million, over a 5% increase from the prior year and in line with our original guidance, in spite of a recycling headwind that was far greater than we could have predicted. We converted every dollar of operating EBITDA growth into incremental free cash flow in 2018, growing free cash flow to $2,084 million, that's an increase of over $300 million or almost 18%. This is higher than expected as the strong performance in the traditional solid waste business was supplemented by the sale of over $200 million of non-strategic businesses and assets over the course of the year. While these proceeds are always a part of our free cash flow measure, in 2018, the amount was over $100 million more than we expected. And so, as we normalize for this difference, the result is free cash flow of about $1,975 million, right in the middle of the guidance range that we gave at the end of the third quarter. These results highlight the value of our balanced execution of disciplined pricing and targeted volume growth. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth in our collection and disposal business was 5.8%. Achieving this result in the fourth quarter of 2018 is particularly impressive on the volume front, when you consider the year-over-year comparisons we were facing given 2017 hurricanes volumes. Our notable volume performance has been driven by our commercial collection business, and our focus on customer progress has reduced our churn to 8.6%, which is over a 100 basis-point improvement from the prior year. We have also seen service increases continue to outpace service decreases, making this the sixth consecutive year for us to achieve that result. And we are happy to see momentum on that front build. In the landfill business, volume growth has been driven by strong C&D and special waste volume, both of which grew by double digits in the fourth quarter. As we have discussed on prior calls, the California wildfire volume contributed to the increase in our C&D volumes, which we expect to continue into 2019. We never like to see events like this occur, but we have positioned ourselves particularly well as a strong community partner for those devastated by the fires, and as a result, expect that we will continue to see a significant fire volumes into 2019. However, given the magnitude and uncertainty inherent in this effort, we have not specifically considered these volumes in our 2019 outlook. Turning now to cost and margins. In 2018, our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were about 62% for both the fourth quarter and the full-year. There were a number of variables that impacted the comparability of operating margins in 2018, but when we isolate the impact of the revenue accounting change, the special benefits we paid to our frontline employees and recycling, we are pleased with our operating expense margin improved for the year in spite of higher third-party transportation and labor costs. These results tell us that we are growing in the right ways, executing our pricing programs to cover cost increases and create incremental margin, and continuing to operate more efficiently. In 2018, our SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue were 9.6% for the fourth quarter and 9.7% for the full-year. This is the first time since 2005 that full-year SG&A as a percentage of revenue has been below 10%. In fact, when you compare our 2018 SG&A cost to 2012, you'll see that dollars spent on SG&A had actually come down; that's a testament to the hard work our team has done to manage our spending, even in a strong growth environment. Together, these results drove more than 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion in the fourth quarter of 2018, and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full-year. As we think about guidance and outlook for 2019, we see the strong performance from 2018 as a foundation for continued earnings and cash flow growth. We project that our operating EBITDA will increase to $4.4 billion to $4.45 billion in 2019, growing again at about 5%, with this growth fueled by our focus on delivering industry-leading organic revenue growth. We expect core price of greater than 4%, yields of greater than 2% in collection and disposal, and total Company volume growth of around 2%. We expect our strong operating EBITDA growth to drive free cash flow of between $2,025 million and 2,075 million, an increase of approximately 7% after adjusting for the above average asset sales in 2018 and normalizing for tax planning benefit that won't repeat. We project capital expenditures required to support our business to be between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion in the year ahead. We will continue our long-standing commitment to our shareholders of using excess free cash flow to pay dividends, prioritize well-priced acquisitions and investments that will bolster our long-term organic growth, and repurchase shares. Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $4.28 and $4.38. Our 2019 guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 24%, which is almost 2 percentage points higher than what we saw in 2018. Normalizing for that as well as 2018 benefit from fuel tax credit that we are not counting on in setting our 2019 guidance, this represents EPS growth of about 7% for 2019. We are all very pleased with the strong financial performance we accomplished in 2018 and are particularly proud of the commitments we made and will continue to make in the years ahead in building the best team in the industry. Jim, John, and I can't thank the Waste Management team enough for the fantastic year they delivered. With that, Sia, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first will come from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can we just talk about on the SG&A, obviously it's a great year in 2018. So, I was wondering how we're thinking about SG&A as a percentage of sales and going into \u201819? Devina Rankin : Sure. So, you're right. 2018\u2019s SG&A performance was fantastic and definitely a result of very-focused and dedicated attention to controllable costs When we think about the baseline, what you'll see is that we\u2019re ensuring that we manage our baseline cost of it, we can invest in the future. And so, thinking about 2019 you'll see an increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenue to about that 10% level that we think is the right level for us long-term. And that increased SG&A is going to be dedicated towards the two strategic priorities that Jim discussed, and that's continued investment in technology and people. Jim Fish : The only thing I would say in adding to what Devina said is that this is not a one-year trend, this has been a continuing trend since 2012. And it's something that I talked about when I was CFO way back in 2012 and Devina has really taken the ball and continued to run with it. So, this is something that -- it\u2019s ongoing, but it's not something that just started to happen in \u201818. Michael Feniger : And on the pricing, guys, I mean, core pricing was strong in the fourth quarter, 5.6%; you're guiding it to be up 4%; I think \u201818 was up over 5% for the full year, even 2017 was up close to 5%. I'm just curious, how you're seeing that pricing playing out, at least the momentum there, and how we should think about that as we go to the second half of the year? Jim Fish : Look, I think, you are right to talk about core price, Michael, because yield -- it's a bit more complicated, includes some mix component, but the core price is probably the best representation of what we\u2019re actually passing to our customers in terms of price increase. You mentioned a couple numbers there in \u201818 and core price was 5.3%, 5.6% in the fourth quarter, which is outstanding. And honestly when I look at early indications in January for the month, I mean January was excellent in terms of core price, in terms of yield and in terms of volumes. So, we\u2019re encouraged to see that it is continuing. We think we\u2019re really in a sweet spot right now in terms of driving both strong price and accretive volumes and really no reason to see a trade-off between the two. Michael Feniger : Understood. And just lastly, you might have mentioned this, but I think we were talking about 40 to 50 bps -- $40 million to $50 million EBITDA kind of uplift just if prices remained flat. I mean, that was -- this was a few months ago. Obviously we saw prices take it down. Could you guys clarify what\u2019s actually baked into the \u201819 guide with recycling? Jim Fish : Yes. I mean, look, we -- it's a little bit of a hard to predict number, because there is a couple components to it. There's what we're doing on operating cost that John mentioned and what we're doing with contamination fees, and then of course there is the number which is commodity prices. And so, we\u2019re sticking with our prior comments that the recycling is going to be a tailwind for \u201819. The extent of the tailwind honestly is difficult to quantify right now because of this continued softening in commodity prices. But, really, for the year, the reason we\u2019re sticking with our prior comments about the tailwind is because of our efforts that were solely driven by contamination fees. The confirmation fees really didn't start until second quarter and they continued to ramp throughout the year. So, first quarter, should be certainly a tailwind from those and this reduced operating cost. And then, that lessens as we get through 2019. Devina Rankin : If you think -- Michael, just to add a little bit of color there, because there is so much variability that can happen in the recycling line of business. The key point there is that Waste Management\u2019s done a really good job of ensuring that commodity price volatility is no longer going to be the driver of how we think about the earnings profile of that business, moving to a model that prioritizes fee for service and getting a return on the assets that we deploy and then using technology to reduce cost over time. Those are going to be our priorities. I think that the one data point that I would additional, if you look at our estimate for average commodity prices, we ended 2018 in the $65 to $70 range for the full-year on average. We predicted that we would be at about $70 in 2019. And you guys know as well as I do that early in 2019, we are seeing levels that are softer than that. So, that's why we're hesitant to specifically give you a number that confirms what we had told you at the end of Q3. John Morris : I think, Devina, what I would add is the beginning of the year was certainly volatile and it\u2019s reflected in our OpEx through Q2 but we've seen steady improvement in the last couple of quarters in our OpEx. And if you look at our results for Q4 in recycling despite kind of flattish commodity prices Q3 to Q4, we showed improvement. So, I think it validates what Jim and Devina were talking about, Michael. Operator : The next question is from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hi, Jim. It\u2019s good seeing you golf [indiscernible] in Phoenix. I didn\u2019t get to see how your game was though, but was obviously very topical talking about those real waste initiatives you've got there and that's been -- seems like picking up a lot of steam and momentum, both with consumers and in the industry. Obviously, you guys are making a lot of investments there MRF of the future and some of the -- a lot on the recycling side, a lot on the CNG vehicles. Just wondering, how you view these investments in general. Are they -- do you sort of view them as almost defensive to sort of sustain current profitability in the industry and protect some of the turf that waste guys have or can these be offensive sort of investments that lead to new lines of business down the road that don\u2019t really exist today? Jim Fish : Actually my golf game was a little better this year than last year. So, I\u2019m happy. But, regarding your question, we really are looking at this as being an offensive move. When I said all along about sustainability and I said it at our forum this year, and as I spoke with Kevin Johnson of Starbucks this week about it, and my point is sustainability has to be both environmentally and economically sustainable for it to really work. And so, that's our kind of upfront goal going in. When we think about the investments themselves, our venture group is run by Chuck Boettcher and Chuck's looking at what -- is there something we can invest in that improves the backend of these recycle plants? For example, we have a lot of waste plastics that go out of the backend. And so, we\u2019re charging fees on the frontend as we've said earlier for contamination. But, is there something we can invest in that produces really good returns but also is able to handle some of these waste plastics out of the backend of the plant. From a sustainability standpoint, both economically and environmentally, that would be ideal. So, that's what Chuck and his team are looking for really around the world. And I think, we\u2019ll find it. I think we\u2019ll find something that helps us improve the sustainability of our model, our recycling model, but doesn't concede, somebody is still going to contaminate their trash and we\u2019re still going to charge them fees and we\u2019re still going to work on to our new recycle plant of the future, reducing operating costs. Brian Maguire : And sort of tying with that a little bit, I can't -- some of your comments from the prepared remarks, I think, you said you were maybe spending a little bit more CapEx. And I think it maybe was methane recovery at the landfills in 2019, can you give a little bit more color on that? And just in general, the step-up in CapEx doesn\u2019t seem like a huge amount, but it is a little bit higher from already elevated 2018 levels, just wondering is that continued fleet modernization or some of these new initiatives that you're just talking about on sustainability and environmental things? Jim Fish : Right. So, you\u2019re right. I mean, it\u2019s -- well last year, actually on a percent of revenue, which is kind of how we look at CapEx on a percent of revenue, 11.4% of \u201818 and middle of the range is 11 percentage, maybe 10.9 this year. But keep in mind that doesn't include -- our guidance does not include capital or EBITDA for these renewable energy plants. The renewal energy plants are a way for us to close the loop. We've made a big investment in natural gas trucks. It\u2019ll be over 60% of our fleet at the end of the year, will be CNG; they are cheaper from a maintenance standpoint; there is all bunch of reasons why natural gas trucks are good for us. But, what this allows us to do because now we have such a big natural gas fleet is really close the loop through the modernization of these credits that are available to us by building these plants. The reason I say that it's not in either the CapEx guidance or the EBITDA guidance is because there's a timing difference. It takes 12 to 14 months to build these plants. So, when we go through our capital committee process, if we decide that we're going to build out a renewable energy plant, the paybacks on those are excellent in three to four years. So, they\u2019re kind of no-brainers in terms of investments. But we also have to -- investors have to recognize that there is a timing difference. And we don\u2019t attempt to match them on a calendar year with the returns, simply because you're looking at a 12 to 14-month construction period for the plants. And so, the CapEx obviously takes place upfront. Devina Rankin : And I would add on the normal capital number to your point that it being elevated from kind of those historical norms of the 10%, really has to do with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in the solid waste business. We've invested in the fleet and we're also investing in additional airspace at the landfills. I mentioned CNG and special waste volumes, both being up double digits. And so, constructing airspace to keep up with that growth is something that we\u2019re committed to. And so, those are the main drivers of the elevated spend that in a growth economy and a growth environment for our business we\u2019re certainly seeing that as a worthwhile investment. Brian Maguire : Okay. Last one for me. Jim, I think you mentioned you get some regulatory clearance in March; you're closing some landfill assets in West Texas. I recognize that was kind of a hole in the portfolio out in the Permian for you guys. But, I'm just wondering with the decline in oil prices, why now is the right time to be investing in there? And do you feel like you got the appropriate multiple on those businesses, given where oil prices are now? Jim Fish : Yes. We feel really good. As I mentioned in my script, we feel really good about the multiple that we\u2019re buying this at. And we really didn't have a presence in the Permian basin, which if you are going to be in that energy services space in the United States, that's the big void. That's the one you have to be in. And so, this is something we've been looking at for a while, and this one, we really felt like was the right fit for us. So, we will give more details on the financial side of it, once we close this, but we\u2019re excited about the strategic value of this and we\u2019re certainly excited about the multiple that we're getting it at. Operator : The next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari : My question is around capital allocation. I realize you have a $1.5 billion authorization. But, just any thoughts as to how to think about the pace of buybacks in \u201819 and as well as any kind of updated as how you're thinking about large M&A, either in solid waste or outside solid waste? Devina Rankin : Sure. So, I'll start, Hamzah, good morning, and then, turn it over to Jim to talk a little bit more about the M&A landscape. But, as he mentioned during his prepared remarks, if you look at 2018, we spent over $450 million on acquisitions, and at the same time bought back $1 billion of our stock. In 2019, we expect that M&A spending could be in the $200 million to $400 million on that core solid waste tuck-in spend where you are more accustomed to seeing that being more in the $100 million to $200 million range for us. So, when we think about that level, we're planning share repurchases of about $800 million for 2019. And should we see a different outcome on the M&A side, we will flex that as appropriate to maintain a strong balance sheet. Jim Fish : Yes. And Hamzah on the M&A front, really as Devina said, I mean, we tend to do a handful -- probably several handfuls of these smaller tuck-in type acquisitions where the benefits are really exciting synergies. And those are right out of the middle of the fairway. And then, we\u2019re looking at -- as is the case with this -- with Petro Waste, looking at something that's core to us because it is landfill assets, but it\u2019s also in place that we wouldn\u2019t normally be otherwise, if we wanted an energy space. We're not going to be out in the middle of West Texas if we weren't doing this for energy purposes. So, I think with respect to the latter, that's why we really had to buy that at well below our trading multiple because it doesn\u2019t come with the synergies that a tuck-in comes with. But, we feel good about that multiple. And then with respect to those tuck-ins, we always feel good about the fact that we buy those at multiples, and then wheel them down to the tune of 2, 3, even 4 turns through synergy monetization. Hamzah Mazari : And then, just in terms of -- are you thinking about cyclicality of this business differently, if things were to slow? I know 2009 volumes were down 10%, nobody expected that. That was obviously a great recession. But, how do you think about cyclicality of your business and defensive qualities, if things do slow down? Jim Fish : Yes. I mean, look, here is what I would say. We do think about it. We\u2019ve talked a lot about what happens if the economy turns down, there has been a lot of chatter about that a bit earlier. It feels like that's tapered off a bit. We\u2019ve said this I think many times and that is that 2009 -- I mean, we all know there's a recession coming at some point, we just don\u2019t know when. And 2009 was a bit different than the normal recession because it was so driven by housing. And so, our business really on the housing side has not returned to where it was in 2009. But, when we look at the indicators that might lead us to believe that a recession is on the horizon, the best indicators for us are our volume numbers in our commercial collection business, our special waste business, which is a good indicator of the industrial economy and our C&D volumes at our landfill. And really, all of those look strong right now. We tend to be more of a lagging indicator than a leading indicator. But, those tend to be somewhat leading. And all of those look strong right now and that carries over into January when we looked at our volume numbers in January and they were very strong on those three measures as well. So, we do focus on it and we want to make sure we're not caught off guard by a downturn in the economy. Hence, the real attention that we pay to efficiencies and cost control. But the good news is right now we're not seeing that softening that's been talked about over the last few months. Devina Rankin : And from a defensive nature, Hamzah, I mean, it's a very good point anytime it's made about our industry and our business, there's a great deal of discipline in the industry today. But, I think last time around, maybe we weren't always good at. So, we can certainly flex down our capital expenditures. You've seen us flex our SG&A costs. And we would be well-positioned to do those things that we saw from softness in the volume environment going forward. Hamzah Mazari : Great, just a follow-up question and I'll turn it over. On customer churn, could you remind us how you're calculating churn? Is it on a dollar basis, is it something different? And then, is there any more room to improve that further? Thanks. Jim Fish : I think there is -- John go ahead. John Morris : Yes. I was going to say, we're doing on a customer -- we look at both ways [indiscernible] and the customer count. And yes, we\u2019ve talked about how much of that is structural, but as you're seeing year-over-year, even in a growth environment, one of the ways we're getting that growth and that growth is that we've improved service, and you're seeing in our churn rate, which has come down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Jim Fish : And I'd say, your last point there, Hamzah, I still think we have some opportunity. You asked a question and rightly so, over the last few quarters. And I still think we have some opportunity. We were really happy with the improvement and we finished at 8.6%. But, look, I think we can get down below 8%. And then where we go from there is more aspirational. But, I think structural, I think, the business can certainly be below 8%. Operator : The next question is from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey, Devina, couple of modeling questions. But, what are your expectations for total revenue growth in \u201819? So, basically, what I'm driving at is, what is your assumption for the net benefit from M&A in \u201819. It looks like you had quite a bit of action at the end of the year including maybe some divestitures. Devina Rankin : Right. So, both acquisition activity and divestiture activity were a little elevated for us in 2018. The net impact to revenue in the year was about $65 million to revenue rollover, we expect to be about the same, and then with incremental acquisitions I would say that it's about a 1% increase in revenue. And if you add that to the 2% yield plus guide and about 2% volume, it'd be around the 5% mark. Tyler Brown : Okay. And to be clear, is Petro Waste in that guidance? Devina Rankin : No. It's not specifically included in the guide. Tyler Brown : Okay. That's helpful. Devina Rankin : Acquisition growth in the $200 million to $400 million range was included in the guide. So, you can think about the Petro being a piece of that puzzle potentially. But, we're going to wait until after the first quarter to revisit the total M&A guide for the year, beyond the $200 million to $400 million. Tyler Brown : And then, I just want to make sure we all have it. But, how big of a headwind in Q1 specifically will the CNG tax credit and recycling be in terms of EBITDA or EPS? Devina Rankin : So, the CNG tax credit was $28 million in operating expense benefit in Q1 of last year; it didn\u2019t show up in cash flow until the second quarter. From a recycling business perspective, we actually expect some upside from recycling, though with the softness in commodity prices we've discussed, it's hard to predict how much that will be. Tyler Brown : And then, Jim, just a bigger picture question, but it seems like the solid waste market is really a affording maybe 4% to 5% organic growth. You're looking at call it 2 plus 2 in \u201819, which is obviously very healthy. But, conceptually, is 2 plus 2 a function of your to go-to-market strategy, or is it a function of what the market is affording? I mean, obviously, volumes require capital, the airspace et cetera. Maybe why not turn up the pricing dial and turn down the volume dial, particularly in an inflationary environment? Jim Fish : So, look, Tyler, here is what I would tell you about the kind of the 2 and 2 for a total of 4 here is that it's very similar to what we gave last year; in fact, I think it was 2 and 2 and 4% on -- also 4% on core price. And it's not that different from what we gave in \u201817, although it's higher on volume. I think in \u201817 we kind of gave 4% core price 2% yield and 1% volume. So, it's pretty consistent with what we've been giving over the last couple of years. Obviously, when you look at our 2018 performance on those metrics, you might say well there is some upside, and we wouldn\u2019t disagree with you on that. But, we don't want to get out of -- over our skis too much. There has been, as I mentioned earlier, there has been some conversation in kind of the -- with respect to the macroeconomic climate that things might be softer. Again, we're not seeing that, but for guidance purposes, we wanted to be a bit cautious when we gave our guidance on top line. But, we do recognize that that could be a bit of upside. John Morris : I think, the one area that we've talked about and we're going to continue to talk about and focus is post collection pricing, both landfill and transfer station. You heard us all talk about some of the pressures we\u2019re seeing from our third-party transporters and all the pressure on the network to be able to move volumes. I think, if you look at the results you're going to see that our focus on the core price side and the transfer and landfill piece has improved. But, as Jim mentioned, I think, that's the one opportunity there, particularly as we see the volumes improvement, and we\u2019re trying to mitigate some of these cost pressures that we\u2019re facing. Devina Rankin : And Tyler, I would add that I really don\u2019t think for us in this environment we view price and volume at all as a trade off. We see the incremental volumes that we\u2019re achieving in the marketplace providing better flow through than our existing business, and that's important. And so as long as we continue to see EBITDA margin on incremental volume exceed our existing margins, and we can control the capital at a reasonable level and see return on invested capital grow at the same time, we\u2019re going to continue to see volume growth as a good addition to the price discipline that we bring to the market. Tyler Brown : And maybe lastly, Devina, if I walk down the EBITDA to free cash flow waterfall, so I start with EBITDA add in stock comp, maybe take out closure, post closure, cash interest, cash taxes, all the CapEx, it still feels like you need a little bit of a working capital benefit to get to the free cash flow guidance. Am I right there? Devina Rankin : We're expecting about a little bit of a repeat of the working capital benefit that we saw in 2018 and the in the year ahead. But other than that, yes, I think, you have it exactly right. The one thing that I would say is we have a $75 million -- I think, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had a tax planning benefit in 2018 that won't repeat. So, that does provide a little bit of a headwind, if you look at the interest and tax piece of the equation in 2019. But that is included in our guidance. So that emphasizes your point on working capital. We expect to see some value there. Operator : The next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : So, you know that the volume guidance of 2%, as you said that that doesn't contemplate or include the fires, and obviously you're coming off a tough comp year-over-year including some large new contracts that you talked about. Any large new contracts or items that you would call out as drivers for the volume growth this year? John Morris : I think, the one that we spoke about which we just about anniversaried is the city of Los Angeles, obviously that was a big implementation for us and drove a lot of the puts and takes in our volume last year. But outside of that, there's not one that I would call out. Jim Fish : John, we may see a little bit of impact positively in \u201819 with respect to the city of Los Angeles was the start up cost side. So, while the top line may not show much due to the anniversering, we did see some start up costs that really persisted through a big part of last year, and that should start to mitigate. John Morris : We should start to lap that. Jim Fish : Yes. Noah Kaye : Understood, thanks. And then, I guess, I wanted to follow up on Devina\u2019s previous comment that you're seeing the EBITDA margin on new volumes exceeding additional volume. I guess, if we look at the revenue guide and EBITDA guide, if we\u2019re doing our math right, it kind of assumes flattish EBITDA margins year-over-year. So, I guess, the question is, should we be seeing higher operating leverage at this point? Is there anything you can do to get margin expansion in \u201819 considering that we don't have the recycling headwind, and it is a very healthy environment for growth? Devina Rankin : Yes. I think, it\u2019s a great point, Noah. And when we look at the guidance for 2019, what I think is important to point out is that we do expect solid waste margins to improve by about 50 basis points. And in 2018, we saw the same results; they were just muddied up a little by the impact of hourly bonus as well as the recycling line of business that you mentioned. And so, when we strip away all of that, we generated 50 basis points of solid waste margin expansion in 2018. We expect to do the same in 2019. Where you're going to have an offset on the EBITDA line is the incremental SG&A dollars that we expect to invest in technology and people. And so, the solid waste business is performing exceptionally well and we're getting the right leverage also with that incremental volume. John Morris : Noah, it's John. I would probably revisit or add to that, one area we're clearly focused on has a lot to do with the cost pressures and transportation pressures that I mentioned earlier is on landfill and post collection pricing and making sure that we're recognizing that all the pressures that we're seeing through the transfer and landfill networks to make sure that we're overcoming those cost pressures. Devina Rankin : And perhaps a finer point as well that\u2019s worth mentioning is we actually are seeing increases in our recycling volumes. A lot of those increased recycling volumes are in our brokerage business. And so that does mute the margin expansion of the overall business a little as well. Noah Kaye : Right. So, that shift to brokerage is as you said in the past, it's about 5% EBITDA margin business, so that will have an impact as well. All right. This is very helpful color. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : I know, it's tough on the recycling to give a number on the anticipated tailwind for \u201819. But perhaps just assuming a stable underlying commodity price environment, I'm trying to get a sense for what portion of the benefit is coming from the contamination fees relative to the operating costs. And maybe if you can provide some context on how far through the portfolio you guys have worked through on the contamination fees, and perhaps on a percentage basis, how much those operating costs have come down over the last year or so? John Morris : Let me start with kind of kind of -- we\u2019ve kind of broken out this -- the contamination fees in a couple of different buckets. One is municipal contracts, obviously, which I mentioned. And I would tell you, we\u2019re mid innings on there. As you might imagine, the contract cycle is longer there. So, we\u2019re working our way through that. So, that's where we expect to see the upside going into \u201819 and beyond. The first two phases were a little bit easier, if you will, to execute on, although the buckets weren\u2019t quite as big, which is making sure that our own internal customers -- commercial customers are giving us the material that we expect. And then, lastly, it is making sure that when material hits the floor that the contamination levels are not above what we can otherwise process. So, there is three buckets around that. I mentioned earlier, our OpEx from a MRF standpoint kind of peaked in Q2, which probably shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone because there is a obviously lot of volatility in the market at that point. And off the top of my head, we've probably come down about 4% to 5% in our operating cost per ton since then. But, if you look at Q3 and Q4, we kind of stabilized revenues, and we've continued to make improvements and the overall MRF performance at those cycling plants suggests that what we're doing around contamination is that -- it is driving a big piece of that improvement. Jim Fish : And Sean, I think the original number we gave in terms of tailwind was $40 million to $50 millionish, something like that. And that was -- we always qualified it by saying that assumes flat commodity prices from where they were. They have come down a bit. So, they\u2019ve softened a bit more, and that's why we\u2019re a bit hesitant to give a number. But, I think, suffice it to say, it's going to be somewhere of between -- it's going to be a tailwind, we just don\u2019t know exactly what it's going to be. If it flattens from here, I would say, we're going to stay where we are now. We haven't -- I don\u2019t know that we know the number, but I think it's probably in the 20 to $30 million range would be my guess. But, then, again, I'm not sure it flattens here. It may return back up to where it was a couple months ago. So, that's why we\u2019re a little uncertain about it. But, the number that we gave originally, assuming flat commodity pricing back at the end of the third quarter was 40 to $50 million. And if it does return to that, I think you will see us kind of in that range with the things that John mentioned, as well, continuing to work on kind of that phase 3 of contamination fees with the municipalities and then also an added focus on operating costs. John Morris : Sean, this is probably the toughest quarter to call just because this is generally a volatile market from a commodity standpoint with what\u2019s generally going on overseas. Sean Eastman : And the second question I have is, you guys are talking a lot about technology, it's -- those investments are having a visible impact on the SG&A line this year. You guys did mention a few initiatives. But, I just want to make sure I understand exactly what the big technology goals are in terms of implementation for this year relative to those investments flowing through SG&A. Whether there's some core sort of KPIs you guys are targeting or some sort of payback period on those investments, just want to understand those dynamics? Jim Fish : So, certainly, Nikolaj and his team are looking at -- once we came an investment in a -- whether it's a customer-facing technology, whether it is really a use of data and analytics, they do have a very prescriptive scoreboard, if you will, and they're looking to see what kind of returns we get for those. So, we\u2019ve recently rolled out a tool for our open market residential customers, and it's showing really, really promising results. And so, the payback on it is we think is very short. But it\u2019s -- open market residential was not a huge business for us. The big question will be what happens when we roll out a customer-facing technology for one of our bigger lines of business, like commercial. We wanted to walk before we ran. And so that's why we chose to go with OMR [ph] first. It is very promising in terms of the results that it's generating. Once we move to some of our bigger lines of business such as commercial or roll-off, we expect that those will also have short paybacks on them. But, we're in the process of kind of building those out right now. And then, the use of data and analytics, largely for John's purposes right now, I mean as you think about, he's talked about maintenance cost and how we use data and analytics to really help us with things like predictive maintenance, we're doing some pilots on that. And those we think will definitely bear some fruit and we do have a metric that we're using to gauge that. Operator : The next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Hey. Thank you. Jim, you sound like you have a cold too. Devina, am I correct -- we're talking about $100 million is what the SG&A swing is for investing in Nikolaj\u2019s projects? Devina Rankin : That's about right. Yes. Michael Hoffman : And just to follow up on the last one. So, typical three-year paybacks, way to think about that and mid-teens unlevered IRR, and that's the way to think about the sort of leverage on that? Devina Rankin : Yes. That's a great way to think about it. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then, on free cash flow, I get you sell things periodically. That's the swing in the numbers. If I strip that out over the last three years, and I look at the sustainable growth between them, like \u201817 to \u201818 you are up 12%, but \u201818 to \u201819 you're up sort of mid 5s. Is it appropriate for me to sort of smooth those two numbers and say that we can talk about a 6% to 8% sustainable free cash flow growth rate under the current business climate? Devina Rankin : That's where we are. Yes. We definitely are happy that if you normalize \u201817 to \u201818 for taxes and interests and the proceeds from divestitures and do the same for \u201818 to \u201819, we're in about a 7% annual growth environment. Jim Fish : I think, Michael, one of the questions that you\u2019ve all had of us is how is this -- you're EBITDA, which is really the long pole in the tent, right? I mean, how is that converting to cash, how is it converting to free cash flow? And if we look at \u201817, \u201818, \u201819, \u201819 of course is our guide, so if we look at that we're pleased, very pleased with that. I mean \u201817 was 42.2; \u201818, if you strip out some of those one-time tax planning and normalize the divestiture, I mean we're always going to have some divestitures in there. So, I'm not saying take it out completely but more of a $100 million in divestitures than the big year that we had this year. If you normalize \u201818, 45.1 and then when you look at our guidance for \u201919, 46.3. So, somewhere between 90 basis points to 120 basis points of the annual growth in that conversion ratio. And by the way, remember, it was too long ago that we\u2019re -- that number started with a 3 and it was really the mid-3s. So, we\u2019re now on a path to something that starts with the 5; we\u2019re really pleased with that conversion from EBITDA to which is 5% last year, 5%ish this year to cash. Michael Hoffman : And then, to do this waterfall bridge differently on your EBITDA $4,216 million, midpoint 4,425, that's 209. But, I got to factor in there, there is a $100 million of the SG&A. So, the solid waste and recycling is really up 300 something is that the way to think about that? Devina Rankin : That's exactly right. Jim Fish : That's why, Michael we -- it's pretty easy to kind of say, hey, -- and nobody has actually this morning, but it's easy to say, what about your bonus, why not add that or why not add your recycling benefit. And there -- as we all know, there's a lot of puts and takes on the EBITDA number. And the -- what we\u2019re really focused on is the big number itself, which is -- grew 5% last year and will grow another 5% this year that was 2 times the economy last year, 2 times GDP last year and it could be as much as 2.5 times. So, so we're very pleased with the EBITDA growth, which in our mind is that is the best indicator of the health of the business. Michael Hoffman : And to that last bit, Devina, what's the number for 2018 when you talk about the solid waste business? So, that when you make that statement, the solid waste business, what is that revenue number? Devina Rankin : The revenue number? We\u2019ll have to get back to you, Michael. And we've got good information in the tables, but we\u2019ll clarify how we\u2019re thinking about that. So, when we look at the solid waste business in the 2018 relative to 2017, we saw over $300 million of EBITDA growth in that business, which makes sense because the $210 million of EBITDA growth that we talked about had that $90 million of headwind from the recycling line of business. It was really a stellar performance. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's part of what I was trying to get at, but I also -- it's hard for people to see the margin expansion in that business, given the way that that is provided but maybe a little clarity on that would help. Devina Rankin : Okay. We\u2019ll take that into consideration. Michael Hoffman : And then, one last thing for you, Jim. I'm assuming these renewable energy projects, as you experience in CNG credits, come and they go, so they are good return on capital, not counting on the RINs are there forever? Jim Fish : Yes. That's right. And look, the RINs are -- there is some volatility to those RINs. But, we feel like they're really good investments for us and so -- our interest in them. And they made available to us because of the not only our landfill gas but also this CNG conversion that we\u2019re making over a period of years. Operator : The final question is from Jeff Silber with BMO. Henry Chien : Hey guys. Good morning. It\u2019s Henry Chien calling for Jeff. I wanted to ask about the volume guidance for 2019 just in relation to some of the comments, that sounds like there's a little bit more skew to commercial and C&D. I am just curious how you're thinking about the sort of sensitivity of that number and volume growth to different parts of the economy. So, just thinking if housing starts continue to get weaker or stronger or any other -- or the industrial economy and so forth. Is there any kind of changes in the sensitivity of that volume, as you look forward to this year? John Morris : Yes. Henry, I think Devina mentioned it earlier. I think, when you look at our special waste pipelines and our C&D pipelines. We obviously had a strong 2018 and we still see health in those pipelines. I think, Jim and Devina both commented on the commercial line of business. And we -- service increases versus decreases is certainly a good barometer along with our other sales activity. And while we're kind of looking out at the horizon to make sure we're not missing something, the short-term outlook is still strong. In fact, as Devina mentioned, the service increase and decrease ratios actually improve as the year goes on. So, we have not seen softening in those buckets as of yet. Devina Rankin : And we certainly take into consideration a lot of attention in our business is paid to housing starts and new business formation. And so, those two data points are important to us. We're a lot less directly tied to housing than we were with the last downturn. And that's valuable for us in thinking about the confidence we have in achieving that 2% margin growth in the year. John Morris : I would also add, Henry, when you look at the tables in the back on MSW line, if you net out some of the one-time things, we really look at that as being about a 3.5% to 3.7% increase in volume when you kind of normalize it for some one-time issues. So, all our volume fronts look pretty consistent and strong as we sit here. Operator : There are no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments. Jim Fish : Great. Thank you. So, to conclude, first, I do understand Ron Mittelstaedt was not on his call this morning due to a family emergency. And Ron is a friend of mine. And I just want to say to Ron that we're thinking about him. He's definitely in our thoughts and prayers this morning. Regarding the business, the last few years and we've talked about it this morning, but the last few years and our expectations for this year really demonstrate our consistency in managing our business. And we're producing what we consider to be excellent growth in all of our financial and operational metrics and very solid returns to shareholders, and I could not be more proud of this team for doing that. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And we will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We're excited to share two good news stories this morning. Our excellent first quarter results that demonstrate continued strength in our business as well as the agreement to, the agreement we announced last week to acquire Advanced Disposal Services. The year is off to a great start with organic revenue growth of more than 6% in our collection and disposal business, translating into about a 7% increase in operating EBITDA in that business. But before diving further into the quarterly results, let me spend some time discussing the compelling, strategic and financial benefits we expect from the acquisition of ADS early next year. On April 15, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of ADS for $33.15 per share. The acquisition advances our growth strategy and aligns with our financial goals, including growth and earnings per share and margins and free cashflow. It will bring to Waste Management a high quality complementary asset network and customer base in both new and existing areas across the eastern half of the United States. We are joining two teams of dedicated employees who are passionate about helping to manage the environmental needs of customers and communities with outstanding service and a commitment to safety. We expect to achieve more than a $100 million in annual costs and capital expenditure synergies. We anticipate closing by the first quarter of 2020 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. We're enthusiastic about this catalyst for long-term value creation for our shareholders in 2020 and beyond. We believe we can leverage benefits of the investments we're making in technology and people to achieve enhanced efficiency across the ADS network in the coming years. ADS has talented and dedicated employees and we look forward to capitalizing on the strengths of both organizations. Moving onto our strong company performance, we remain keenly focused on the execution of our 2019 plan and delivering the strong results we expect for this year. In the first quarter operating EBITDA was $987 million. We continue to believe that this is the best measure of the health and performance of the business and are pleased with this solid result. The growth and operating EBITDA is underpinned by impressive organic growth with core price of 5.8%, yield of 2.7% and volume of 4.1% in the collection and disposal business. Our operating EBITDA growth translated into excellent free cash flow of $431 million demonstrating the strength of the cash generating ability of the business. To enhance our performance, we're investing in the same areas that helped make us successful in 2018, our people, technology, asset network, and the customer. As we've mentioned in the past, we're opening our second state-of-the-art driver and technician training center, extending our commitment to providing centralized training for our drivers and technicians across the organization. Participating in this training not only helps improve retention, it helps make our employees safer. In the first quarter, we saw a meaningful reduction in safety incidents of drivers with less than a year of experience. Focusing on our on-boarding process for new drivers is clearly paying off. We also made strides with respect to technologies. We launched a new online buying experience for U.S. commercial and industrial customers. This followed the rollout of a similar online tool for open market residential customers last fall. Engaging with our customers in their channel of choice helps to differentiate our customer experiences and is driving measurable volume increases. In closing our base business is delivering strong, reliable growth. That puts us on track for another banner year. And we're very excited about the new platform for growth with the addition, or with the acquisition of ADS by early next year and the recent addition of Petro Waste in the Permian Basin. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter as well as initial integration planning for the ADS acquisition. John Morris : Thanks Jim and good morning everybody. We're pleased with our first quarter results as we continue to execute extremely well on our organic growth strategy. Our disciplined pricing programs have been driving consistently strong core price and yield results the last several years. In addition, we continue to execute on targeted growth of profitable volumes. This strategy has produced both industry leading volumes, demonstrating that we can profitably grow by driving both price and volume. Our volumes grew 4.1% in the collection and disposal business during the first quarter and much of that growth can be attributed to our focus on increasing service to existing customers and reducing churn by improving customer satisfaction. For the quarter Churn was 8.1%, a 150 basis point improvement from the prior year and the lowest churn we've seen in the last three years. Additionally, service increases outpaced service decreases again for the 21st consecutive quarter. Our customer focus has also helped us to selectively grow profitable volumes including our strategic national account business. As you've heard us all say, improving our customer's experience is generating results. In the landfill line of business our well positioned assets continue to attract volumes and enable us to increase yield. Previously, we have discussed the importance of pushing pricing to cover post collection cost increases and maintain returns, and we're pleased with our progress on that front. In fact, in the first quarter we achieved the highest MSW yield in more than a decade at 3.4% and we did this while growing volumes, 5.8% versus 2.2% last year. A large portion of the volume increase relates to new customers in the Northeast as our well-positioned assets continue to attract incremental volumes. We've also talked in previous quarters about our strong special waste pipeline and many of these projects are coming to fruition as we saw special waste volumes up more than 18% for the quarter. As mentioned last quarter, we're well positioned to accept volumes from the wildfire cleanups in California. In the first quarter, volumes associated with the cleanup provided about $8 million of operating EBITDA. Overall, there was a negligible year-over-year impact to our first quarter volumes and our financials from natural disasters since we had hurricane and wildfire impacts in the first quarter last year as well. The cleanup up activity is still ramping up in California and we expect to continue to receive landfill volumes from the cleanups throughout the year, but it's still too early to estimate the impact of 2019 volumes, operating EBITDA and capital spending because of the uncertainty around timing. So we expect to have additional information next quarter. During the first quarter, total operating cost as a percentage of revenue, we're in line with prior year at 62.2%. We did do a good job of managing our cost as we had to overcome an 80 basis point headwind from the federal natural gas fuel credits, not repeating. We still have opportunities for further improvement, particularly around maintenance and leachate management cost, and our team is focused on identifying and making these improvement as well as adjusting our price for rising third-party subcontractor cost. On the maintenance side, we continue to expand on maintenance initiatives, MSDO, to reduce downtime and improve cost. The results continue to be positive as we have seen our certified sites improved maintenance cost per unit by about 6% on a year-over-year basis. Looking to labor, our M100 program provides our frontline supervisors a view of each of their routes throughout the day. As a result, they can work to remove elements of a driver's day that are costing them efficiency. We're focusing on the commercial line of business first, and we are in the early stages of expanding the program to roll off and eventually, residential. Turning to recycling. We performed well in the first quarter as a direct result of our ongoing fees for contamination, improving operating costs and restructuring municipal contracts. We have taken these intentional steps to improve our recycling business by passing through the increasing cost of processing and the cost of higher contamination rates to our customers, and our results demonstrate that. Although, our blended average recycling commodity price fell 28% year-over-year, we increased our recycling operating EBITDA by $11 million from breakeven in the first quarter of 2018. We are still well below a typical operating EBITDA level and a normalized recycling commodity price environment, and as such, we remain focused on changing the business model for recycling with improved MRF technology and relationships with our customers that recoup processing cost and protect us from commodity price downside. We're pleased with our recycling teams' efforts to improve the recycling line of business and continue to find the most sustainable markets for our customers' materials. We see in the remainder of 2019 pricing to be soft with some additional domestic mill capacity coming online later in the year. Despite these factors, we expect our overall business to continue to overcome any issues from recycling, putting us solidly on target to achieve our full year guidance. Lastly, I want to briefly cover integration planning for the ADS acquisition. While the agreement is certainly exciting news, it's just the first step in bringing the two companies together. Over the coming months, we expect to assemble an integration planning team to determine how best to join our operations. Like our operations, the two companies' cultures are very complementary. We have a shared commitment to outstanding customer service, safety and operational excellence. Waste Management has a strong record of successfully integrating the assets we acquire, and we expect a smooth integration and transition process for this acquisition as well. We will be ready to execute as soon as the deal closes to capture the targeted synergies. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our first quarter financial results and capital allocation priorities in light of the ADS acquisition announcement. Devina Rankin : Thanks John and good morning, everyone. As both Jim and John has discussed, our first quarter results were strong, and they\u2019ve been driven by organic revenue growth in our traditional solid waste business and our focus on controlling costs through operating efficiencies. In the first quarter of 2019, the conversion of earnings growth into incremental cash from operations was particularly strong. Our cash flow from operations was $890 million in the quarter and that's a 10% increase from the first quarter of 2018, which puts us well on our way to achieving our full-year target. During the first quarter, we spent $471 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $71 million from 2018. The increase in capital spending is related to the strong volume growth that our business continues to generate, particularly in the landfill line of business. And then also some year-over-year differences in the timing of some of our spending. In the quarter, our business generated $431 million of free cash flow versus $423 million in the first quarter of 2018. Timing differences in capital expenditures muted our free cash flow growth for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, but we're confident that with our strong operating cash flow growth and disciplined approach to capital spending, we will deliver on our full-year free cash flow guidance. In the first quarter of 2019, we used our free cash flow to pay $223 million in dividend and repurchased $68 million of our stock. Share repurchases in the first quarter were less than our plan due in part to the nearly $400 million in acquisition spending in the quarter. That was primarily related to our previously announced acquisition of Petro Waste that closed in March. Our 2019 guidance considered $200 million to $400 million in acquisitions for the year, and so we have already achieved the high end of that targeted range. Turning to SG&A. For the first quarter, our SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue were 11.1% compared to 10.6% in the first quarter of 2018. Our planned investments in technology accounted for 30 basis points of this year-over-year increase. The remaining increase was due to a litigation reserve. In spite of the impact from this litigation reserve, we continue to target adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 10% for the year. We are confident in the strength of our business. And as we announced last week, we fully expect to achieve the full year guidance we laid out in February before considering the impact of the ADS acquisition. As Jim and John has discussed, we are all very excited about the value that we will create for our stakeholders from this pending acquisition. I would like to review our 2019 capital allocation plans in light of the ADS acquisition and give you some insights to how we expect these plans to impact our 2019 outlook. In 2019, our free cash flow will be directed to dividend, payments, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases sufficient to offset dilution from stock-based compensation plans. As I mentioned earlier, we've already completed the high end of our acquisition guidance for the year. Our tuck-in acquisition pipeline continues to be strong, and we remain focused on pursuing valuable businesses in markets other than those where ADS operates. As a result, we will see free cash flow allocated towards tuck-in acquisitions exceed our initial range of $200 million to $400 million. We are, however, scaling back on our share repurchases from the planned levels and that will have about a $0.06 per share impact for the year. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.4x. We have a strong balance sheet today, and we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and solid investment-grade credit profile with a pro forma leverage ratio within our targeted range of 2.75 to 3x after the acquisition. We're still in the early stages of determining our financing strategy for the acquisition, which makes it difficult to estimate the 2019 earnings and cash flow impact with the incremental debt needed to position us for closing. As we finalize those financing plans, we will provide additional details. The ADS acquisition will immediately enhance Waste Management's cash flow growth and support our commitment to grow total shareholder return. Long-term, our capital allocation strategy will not change. We will continue our commitment to our shareholders of allocating 40% to 50% of free cash flow to dividends. We will prioritize well-priced acquisitions and investments that bolster our long-term organic growth, and we will opportunistically repurchase shares. Our Waste Management team has worked hard to deliver a fantastic start to 2019. We have a lot of exciting things going on at Waste Management, and our team remains focused on delivering superior results. We're confident in the performance of our business and our ability to achieve our 2019 goals. With that, Lauren, let's open line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning, guys. Jim Fish : Good morning, Tyler. Devina Rankin : Good morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, congrats on the strong start to the year. I appreciate the core business is very solid, but Jim, Devina, I would like to start with the proposed ADS deal. We obviously haven't had a forum really to talk about it. But I was hoping you can talk about some of the mechanics of the deal, including, one, what is the termination fee if you do decide to walk away? And two, how does this $200 million, what I'm going to call divestiture cap work that's built into the agreement because frankly, the agreement isn't exactly the easiest thing to read. Devina Rankin : We can appreciate and understand that the agreement's a lot to get through, but we really do think that that's the best source of information for those specific terms and conditions, and we point you back to that. But I would say is all of those terms and conditions were well negotiated and thought through in the process, and we've done a really good job of making sure that we're positioned well to move forward. Tyler Brown : But specifically on the divestiture, again, I'm going to call it divestiture cap, if it's required to be over that, what would then happen? What would you be able to do or not do? John Morris : Tyler, this is John Morris. I mean, certainly we\u2019re comfortable with the range that\u2019s been published and is in the merger agreement. And I think the details of what the options are for both sides are best learned by reading the merger agreement. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then on the $100 million of proposed synergies, is there any breakdown of how that would break down between G&A, OpEx and capital? John Morris : Tyler, this is John again. Yes, I mean, it's early innings for sure. But roughly, we estimate about 80% is going to come from the operational SG&A and interest buckets and about 20% will come out of the capital efficiency bucket. Tyler Brown : Okay, great. And then maybe some mile markers that we should be looking for as this deal progresses. I would assume shareholder vote is next then you\u2019d go on to DOJ review. And then assuming passage, maybe we'd move off to close. Is that kind of how the process will work? John Morris : I think you've got the timing down. There's really three elements, obviously, ADS\u2019 proxy filing, and obviously, the HSR process that's going to have to occur here in the coming months. Tyler Brown : Okay. My last one here so I want to switch over to recycling really quickly. You mentioned that it's up $11 million from breakeven despite commodity prices. I'm assuming the processing fee is driving that. Is that correct? John Morris : Yes. You broke up just for a second there, but yes, the processing fee is included in that for sure. We talked about, Tyler, the fact that this would be \u2013 back in February talked about the fact that this will be a tailwind for us this year. That didn't \u2013 we still think it's going to be a slight tailwind for us, but we didn't contemplate this significant drop off in commodity prices. With that said, I think we've done a great job of really passing this through. I mean, we can't bear all of this. As John said in his script, this is a breakeven for us last year. It's now an $11 million better than breakeven, which still there\u2019s not anything to write home about, but we're in the process of passing that through in the form of these fees. And that's what's caused us to mitigate some of this in the first quarter. Devina Rankin : We've also done a good job of managing the cost side of the equation, and we'll remain focused on ensuring that we're working through the contamination headwinds that we see on the inbound material to manage those more efficiently in our processes. And as John mentioned earlier, the focus on technology and the MRF line of business will be important to us, and we're continuing to advance those efforts. Tyler Brown : Okay, yes. Jim Fish : Go ahead, go ahead. Tyler Brown : Yes, go ahead. I\u2019m sorry. Jim Fish : Just back on ADS for just a second, look, what I will say about this is we are very, very excited about this. This is really something that's \u2013 we haven't done in a period of 20 years a deal of this size. We can't say a whole lot about some of the details of it for obvious reasons that as John said will end up showing up in the background of the merger and will become public when they filed their proxy. But we just can't see a whole lot about it. We'll give details where we can, but we're \u2013 suffice it to say, this is being looked at as being transformational. And the two companies are so complimentary from a cultural standpoint that it really makes a ton of sense for us. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. And then just real quickly, but would you expect going back to recycling? Would you expect recycling to be a positive EBITDA contributor this year under the current circumstances? Jim Fish : Yes, year-over-year, I mean, certainly it\u2019s going to be positive in total. Year-over-year, that's why I said we think it can still be a slight tailwind for us on a year-over-year basis from an EBITDA standpoint but it's also hard to tell because these commodity prices have become pretty difficult to predict. And with that 30% headwind on the commodity prices, we are exclusively reliant on our ability to reduce cost and pass this through in the form of fees. Tyler Brown : Okay, all right. Thank you. I\u2019m going to turn it over. Thanks. Jim Fish : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. I realize you can't give a lot of details on ADSW, but maybe Jim, you could talk about why you're doing this deal now? I mean as we look back, ADSW IPO'd $18. There was no real buyer when High Star was looking to sell this or exit. Your balance sheet was still very underlevered at that point. So maybe talk about what has changed? Why now versus when the stock was at $18 or pre-IPO? Jim Fish : Well, here's what I\u2019d say, Hamzah. I mean, first of all, the transaction represents a really nice multiple for us to have. It's 11.6x ADS's 2018 EBITDA $427 million. And after you take the $100 million in synergies into account, you're talking about something that's 9.4x their 2018 numbers. So it is compelling for us when we look at \u2013 when we started looking at this several months back. It was very compelling for us.  The other thing I would say about it is strategically, it's such a nice fit for us. It's really, I'd say, we're looking at this as three million customers that we bring in that we can add our focus on the customer, that we can add our focus on digital technology. All of that fits very nicely into our strategy and it's three million customers who honestly, whether it was organic customers, a lot more difficult to get three million organic customers than it is to fix them up through a great acquisition like this. But it is, in effect, the same end result, which is we bring our processes, we bring our technology, we bring our focus on the customer to a big batch of new customers. Hamzah Mazari : That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe, I guess, you're having an Analyst Day on the 30th. I think the last time you did one was a decade plus ago. Maybe if you could preview sort of what we should expect there, what investors should expect? Devina Rankin : Hamzah, this is Devina. We\u2019re excited about the Investor Day. And certainly, something that was in the works before the announcement of the ADS acquisition. Our focus at Investor Day will be on the great things happening at Waste Management, the leadership team being sure that the investors have an opportunity to meet all of the members of Jim\u2019s senior leadership team, hear about the operating efficiency work that we're doing, our focus on people first from a culture perspective and what that's doing to drive our customer focus and the customer-centric culture that we want this organization to continue to push forward. And then the financial results that are coming out of all of that great work that we've proven in the last several years but we really expect and are excited to see continue in the years to come. Hamzah Mazari : Okay. And then just lastly, just a clarification question. On the volume side, the 3.6% volume, how much of that was sort of wildfires? Devina Rankin : The wildfire impacts were actually very small. On a year-over-year basis, if you recall, Hamzah, we had fire and hurricane volumes in Q1 of 2018 as well. So we were virtually flat from a volume perspective as a result of natural disasters on a year-over-year basis. Hamzah Mazari : Okay, got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First just make sure I understood this right, you're backing full year guidance but you're pausing share repurchases that hits you about $0.06. So should I read that as effectively you're not formally raising guidance, you're effectively raising net income guidance by 1% or 2%... Devina Rankin : No. Let me clarify. Thanks for asking the question though. I didn't intend for that to be interpreted that way. What we're saying is we're confirming guidance without the impact of the ADS transaction and we view that $0.06 reduction in EPS specifically as ADS-specific because of the change in our capital allocation plans that we guided for the year. So we are sticking with core solid waste to EBITDA performance driving the EPS expectations aside from that $0.06 impact. Noah Kaye : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And then I guess just a question looking at large mergers in the past history of the waste industry. It seems like a little bit of an elongated timetable for closing compared to some. Can you just talk about what's giving you reason to kind of give that timetable? Is it something the regulatory environment or anything we should be thinking about? Jim Fish : No, I mean, it's recently been reported that DOJ is \u2013 DOJ approval process has been taking about 10 to 11 months to complete. With that said, each merger is different and as waste mergers go, they're valued it on a local basis so they present different issues for resolution. But the process seems to be taking 10 to 11 months based on what we've heard, and that's why we said we think it's going to be somewhere in that time frame. And with all of that said, I think what I would finish with is we will be working cooperatively with the DOJ to assist in this review of the transaction, and we'll do our best to expedite the process where we can. Noah Kaye : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just one last clarification question. You pointed to the $100 million of synergies, and that really looks like a cash flow number I guess because it's cost some CapEx. So just to understand, is that $100 million net of the interest that you're going to take the extra interest expense to finance this transaction because you\u2019re going to have to take on some debt? Or is that independent? Devina Rankin : No, not \u2013 that is independent. You're right, Noah. And as I mentioned earlier, we're still working through those financing plans. We're thinking about that $100 million more as an indication of our run rate synergies over the long-term and not providing information about capital structures specifically because those costs of the incremental debt is too early for us to specifically to quantify. Noah Kaye : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Derrick Laton : Hey good morning. This is Derrick Laton sitting in for Brian. Jim Fish : Hi Derrick. Derrick Laton : While we're on the topic of the synergy capture there for the deal, just wanted to see if you guys could highlight if you have any sort of timeline that you might expect for that synergy capture, assuming that the deal closes as you expected? John Morris : Hey, this is John Morris. I think it's safe to assume that there is going to be some early dollars we\u2019ll get but we are also early in the process here. I think it's going to take some time. We've got kind of a lot of woods to chop here between now and closing in order to kind of refine the timing of when the synergies are going to occur. Derrick Laton : Okay, thanks for that. And then just to kind of circle back in recycling for a second. I think you said you're still expecting overall a tailwind for you year-over-year. I wonder if you can just maybe clarify what you have assumed in the reaffirm guidance there for recycling prices and your expectations there? Jim Fish : I think we said in February, I think, I said $30 million to $50 million or so we thought\u2026 Devina Rankin : $20 million to $30 million. Jim Fish : $20 million to $30 million, okay, sorry. So $20 million to $30 million is what I thought the tailwind would be in February. And as I mentioned earlier, we've didn't \u2013 that did not contemplate this heavy downturn. So it's hard to say exactly what that will be for the remainder of the year. We do know that the fees are somewhat front loaded because of the fact that last year, we started the implementation process for those fees. It's kind of mid second quarter April-ish right around now. And so the comps, at least from a fee standpoint, become more difficult in third quarter and then particularly in fourth quarter. What happens with respect to comps in terms of the commodity prices is TBD. So it's a bit hard to pin down the number, but I think we're willing to say we think that there's certainly still a possibility of a tailwind. It's not going to be in that $20 million to $30 million range. John Morris : I would add to that, Jim. I mean, I think the comments of both you and Devina made is that we continue to make progress on the operating expense side, and we've referenced on the last call that we're looking at these contamination and other fees through kind of three phases. And we've done a nice job in Phase 1 and Phase 2, Phase 3 is still developing, which is really where about 60% of our volume comes from. That's a single stream volume that we're still continuing to address through Phase 3 through the municipal recycling contract. Jim Fish : And I have two kind of other comments on recycling. First of all, we said it for a number of quarters, and that is that it demonstrates how strongly our core operations are exclusive of recycling that we can continue quarter-after-quarter to have these really good results. In the face of \u2013 I mean, look, we're talking about 10-year lows from a commodity standpoint. So our \u2013 the rest of our business is really operating well. A lot of you have reported on that and that is absolutely the case. The second thing I'll say is we're not just sitting back \u2013 here's what's going on in recycling. There's real extreme supply and demand imbalance, and we talked about China a lot so I won't go into details on that. But there is a really extreme supply and demand imbalance. So for us, we feel strategically it doesn't make sense for us to sit back and rely on the rest of the world literally to try and figure this out. So that's why we talked about it last quarter, maybe the quarter before, that we're building what we call a recycle plant of the future to address some of this downturn in the market on our own. So that recycle plant of the future that's going up in Chicago and will be starting to take materials sometime in Q3 or Q4. We believe we\u2019ll significantly reduce operating cost at that plant because the technology that we're putting in, a lot of optical technology in that plant. So we think it will be a very different plant in terms of operating cost. And that's part of our answer to try \u2013 trying to address this downturn in the business that really we don't have much control over and don\u2019t have much view of when it will resolve itself. So we're going to try and fix something that we control on our own. Derrick Laton : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just one more really quick one for me, you have strong volume number in the quarter, I think you guys said the impact of natural disasters was effectively a net neutral with first quarter of 2018. But [Audio Dip] wetter weather and weather impacts being a headwind in the quarter, just wonder if you could quantify, what headwinds you might've had there to your volume number in 1Q. Jim Fish : Yes. No, we looked at that. I think when we looked at weather kind of year-over-year, it was negligible between what it happened last year in different regions versus this year, so we didn\u2019t see a big impact on a year-over-year basis from weather. What I would tell you on the volume side though, and we commented that on the prepared remarks, is we continue to see obviously MSW volumes in our landfill be really strong. We had a really, really strong special waste quarter. And when we dug into that, we're seeing that across not one or two areas, but really seven or eight of our regions, which suggests a couple of things to us. One is the general overall economy is that's usually a bellwether for that. And then the pipelines we\u2019ve talked about in the back half of last year and last quarter continued to produce this year. And I think overall, I think when we will look at our volume for Q1 and trends; I think we're on pretty solid footing. Devina Rankin : The one place that I do think that we saw some weather impact is actually on the operating cost line, where we saw whether it be efficiency impacts or in the leachate cost for the Northern part of our business as we had a wetter winter season this year. And so we do expect some moderation in some of those costs as we move throughout the year. Derrick Laton : Great, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to start on ADS. I know it's early days, but you guys are highlighting a very complementary asset base there. But I was hoping you can maybe comment on the \u2013 compare and contrast the operating structure. It's my impression that Advanced operates considerably more decentralized relative to Waste Management. I'm just wondering kind of what challenges or opportunities that means from an integration perspective. John Morris : Well, I think \u2013 I'm not going to comment on their structure, but I would tell you that when we look at their portfolio of business and the work we've done thus far, I think what we find is a business and a set of assets that are very complimentary to ours. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, this is certainly a business in an industry that\u2019s been very acquisitive. And we feel very confident in our ability to tuck-in kind of this core business that is kind of down the middle of the fairways as Jim referred to it before. Jim Fish : One thing I will say just to check on John there is that we can't say about their structure, not so much their operating structure but that is the makeup of their lines of business is a little different than ours. They are kind of 80% collection, 20% landfill. And we're more like 65% collection, 35%. It's another factor that gives us confidence that we will certainly make it through this process and complete this by kind of the 10- to 12-month period. Sean Eastman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as it relates to the guidance being intact, I just want to understand some of the moving pieces. So obviously the commodity \u2013 recycled commodity price is kind of an incremental headwind relative to that $20 million to $30 million guidance earlier. So I'm just wondering exactly where the positive offset is. Is it kind of that strength in the special waste volume? Or is it a mixture of a lot of things? Some color there would be great. Devina Rankin : Yes. And I would say it\u2019s entirely the performance of our solid waste business being led by the strong landfill volume, whether it\u2019d be the 5.8% MSW volume that we spoke about or in the special waste pipeline, both the strength that we saw in Q1 and then our expectations for that strength to continue over the remainder of the year. The outperformance of solid waste in the quarter far exceeded the impacts of the negative commodity price drag in the recycling line of business. And so we\u2019re optimistic that pattern will continue over the remainder of the year. John Morris : I would add, Devina. I mean, we called out a few headwinds we had on the post-collection side and M&R within the collection side. But outside of those, we're making progress. And I commented about what our OpEx was as a percentage of revenue in my prepared comments and some of the headwinds we overcame. So we're clearly making progress on the operating expense control side as well. Sean Eastman : Okay, super helpful. And then just last quick one for me. So, obviously, you\u2019ve really outsized volumes in the first quarter, and I believe you guys guided to a 2% volume growth outlook for the full year. So I'm wondering from this base here, like, what the big swing factors are to watch, is it really just that wildfire opportunity? Or is there some other volume growth elements we should be thinking about as we move through the year relative to that 2%? Jim Fish : Yes, I mean, I think that you've seen a couple of things. John has talked and touched on a few of them. John and Devina both with respect to special waste and landfill volumes being strong. We didn't touch on it, but by the way, we're, when you look at 3.4%, yield at the MSW line, that also is impressive in and of itself. But on volume, in addition to those items that they mentioned, I mean, look, I think what you're seeing is that that technology, our focus on technology and our major emphasis on the customer, all of that is coming to roost in the form of strong volumes. The key is here are things like, are the data reporting tool that we've put into national accounts that's driving strong growth in our national accounts business at good margins. The focus on the customer has as driven the lowest churn number that we've seen in years at 8.1%. And again, John mentioned the strong special waste pipeline that's the highest number we've seen in quite some time. And all of that has been discussed in the past as being part of a good pipeline. But now it's actually showing up. By the way, I think that's, that's actually a good sign. And I think he mentioned this, but I, that is somewhat of a barometer for the economy. These big companies look at those, that event type work as being somewhat discretionary and in a strong economy, they're more willing to spend those discretionary dollars in a very slow and weak economy. You oftentimes just see them trim back on those projects. So, I think that to the extent that that says anything about the economy in 2019, for the rest of the year and possibly into early 2020, I think it's a good sign.  : Okay, thanks. And best of luck to the integration team. John Morris : Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I'm sorry to go back to the recycling issue, but I guess the industry has been dealing with this for about a year and a half. Are you finding it easier to go back to your customers and asking them to focus or shift more to this fee-for-services model? Has it gotten easier over that timeframe? John Morris : Well, I think a couple of things. The fact that this been a sustained situation, I think customers are understanding that there are real pressures that, the service providers are facing in order to continue to provide them not only recycling but sustainability services that they're looking for. I don't think it's ever easy to go back to a customer. And this was a good example to tell them that they're going to have to share more of the risk and pay more for the services. But I think as evidenced by what we referred to as these three phases and we've been working through for the better part of a year, we're finding that with good messaging and communication with our customers, in giving them real feedback, real time feedback. Jim mentioned some of the technologies we're using some of that technology advancements that we have to give our customers real feedback and give them an opportunity to address some of the behaviors of their employees or their constituent base to try and improve recycling. Jeff Silber : Okay, appreciate that. And then if I could switch back to the ADS potential merger, you mentioned the potential synergies on the cost side and the capital structure, the capital expense side, excuse me and the complimentary nature of the deal. I'm just wondering, are there any natural areas of overlap either geographically or end market focus? Jim Fish : Well, okay, here's what I would say about that. I mean, when you look at the two companies east of the Mississippi, there's a lot of dots on the map, but I think it's important to recognize that many of those dots are in these large markets where there is no shortage of competition whatsoever. So, certainly there will be you know, there is some overlap there just looking at a map. But there's, there are a lot of we're in a lot of large markets, they are in a lot of large markets and there's a lot of competition in those markets. Jeff Silber : Okay, great. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael Hoffman : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So I actually want to talk about trash, so in solid waste when you give us the price compare on collection and disposal, what's actually that base of revenue on a net basis in 2018 coming into 2019 Devina Rankin : The collection and disposal revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was a total of $3.07 billion and that grew $200 million on a year-over-year basis to $3.27 billion in Q1 of 2019. Michael Hoffman : Perfect. And then could you give us what the Petro Waste annual revenues are so we can figure out how to layer that into our model. Devina Rankin : So not necessarily Petro Waste specifically. I'll point you to total acquisition spend in the first quarter and total acquisition spend in Q1, which to your point Michael is largely Petro Waste driven. On an annualized basis that revenue is a little over a $100 million. And when you think about what that revenue number is based on, it's the landfill line of business and therefore relatively high margin when you compare it to a traditional solid waste tuck-in that can usually be more collection business and therefore a little narrower on the margin side. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then hey John, so on recycling. If I take the 11 million as the profit and you did 291 that's kind of 3.8% margins, what should a good margin be? And it kind of gets to a bigger question about cashflow. I'll come \u2013 circle back to that, but what, what should we think about that margin? Because when you get it, it should all be cash, right? John Morris : Well Yeah, certainly Michael where we're at, I mean we're very happy with what our recycling team has done. And really keep in mind, what we're talking about recycling in a vacuum. It does penetrate other elements of the business. So not only our recycling team, but our entire operating team has done a really nice job of taking what is a headwind and increasingly a headwind as evidenced by the recent price decline and turn that into a positive. But you're right, I mean going from break-even to $11 million, while we consider that a victory is clearly not where we're satisfied. And a good margin on that based on the capital as deployed mid-teens. I mean, if I thought just, just like what part of this is understanding that this $1.2 billion business, if I pick up 10 percentage points incrementally, that's another $100 million of cash. Jim Fish : Yes. Mid-teens would certainly be better than where we are now. Michael. I'd like mid to high teens. I think the other thing that we obviously take into consideration is looking at returns on those assets as they also require capital. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That helps a lot. Go ahead. Sorry. Devina Rankin : I was going to say at normalized commodity prices, we were accustomed to being able to say that the recycling line of business was our second highest return on invested capital business. And so everything we are working on today is about returning this business to that model, because it can be a very successful business and sustainable over the long-term from an economic perspective. It's about making sure that we're achieving that in spite of this volatility in commodity prices that we're seeing. John Morris : I would follow that. Just Jim made a comment before. I mean we're not \u2013 our \u2013 are trying to change this recycling model and in that we're certainly not relying on benefit from commodity prices a lot of things that have gone the wrong way there. I think what we're doing to try and lower operating costs through some of the investments we're making in technology trying to reduce the labor component, which by the way is a very hard, hard positions to staff anyway. I think that's really where our focus is in balancing the capital deployed to do that versus the returns we're going to get back. Jim Fish : Michael it\u2019s Jim here. I mean, you know this, but when, when the single biggest customer for recycling \u2013 for recycled commodity materials comes out basically. I mean, China was two years ago, was 27% of all of our recyclables. We're going to China, they're now 3% in a period of 18 months. When that customer comes out, you're going to have a real, oversupply condition. And we've tried to move that around. So, a lot of it has gone to the United States. Actually, we were 63% of all of our commodities stayed domestic two years ago. It's now 77%. Some of it's been replaced in Southeast Asia, which has gone from, like 1% to 7%. So, we've done a good job of finding other homes, but there is going to be this big supply and then demand imbalance too. I mean, part of the issue is demand related and that means that the companies will have to use a higher percentage of recycled material in their products. And today that has not been the case. So there, there is a, and in finding other uses for low value, recyclables is also more on the demand side. We think over time this does, we're optimistic that over time this really balances out. But as I said earlier, we're, we're not willing to just sit back and let it balance itself out. And see this as a kind of a low margin, low return business over a period of years. So that's why we're investing at things like this recycled plant of the future that takes a considerable amount of cost out, operates at as much as 30% or 40% lower unit costs than our current single streams. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's great. And to that speed question, does this incremental pressure allow you to accelerate the pace of the phase three or we just stuck in contract cycles? John Morris : Michael, I wish I could, if we could have accelerated it, we would have done it already. I think as you know, a lot of the life on these contracts is generally three to five years. So, we're being as aggressive as we can to work through them as quickly as we can, but I don't know that the additional headwind it might help the conversation with some of our customers, but, I wouldn't say aside from that, that it's going to accelerate just based on the further commodity price decline. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So now I have to switch gears to ADS for just a second. If I can read all the legalese and I'm in the document, you've got this, you've talked about breaked up fees in two places. You talk about the 200 million of asset sale potential. Just to be clear, do I understand the writing correctly that even if you decided to walk away because it was more than 200 million, you'd still have to pay $150 million breakup fee? Jim Fish : That's right. Michael Hoffman : Okay. I just, the lawyers ought to get paid extra for how confusing they wrote all that. Okay. That helps. And then, I think an important comment would be one way to think of this as, so right, so you're around 15 billion. They are a billion six, let's say it's 200 million. So it a billion four, so that's kind of a 9% growth rate. But more importantly, you're telling me add three million customers. If I remember correctly, you have 22 million, so that's a 14% increase in the customer growth all in one fell swoop. Jim Fish : Well, that's why I talked about the fact that, this isn't really a, you could try and go do this organically. It just would take you forever to do it. So, it gives us the ability to pick up a company that is very similar to us culturally ADS. I mentioned earlier though, a multiple that's very attractive, particularly when we packed her in the synergies. And it gives us the ability to bring those efficient processes and new technologies, data and analytics, differentiated customer focus, all that stuff to these three million customers very quickly. Michael Hoffman : But I'm right, it's about a 14% here. You\u2019re about 22 million, right? Jim Fish : Yup. 20. Probably 20. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right. Well, so now it's 15%. So that's a huge customer growth fast, which is really the essence of this. Devina Rankin : Actually that goes back to Jim\u2019s comment earlier on the difference in the mix of business, because customer account is higher in the collection line of business than on the landfill side of the business. And so but your point is exactly right. And that's one of the reasons that this deal is so exciting for us because it's about extending our customer focus and our use of technology to a broader customer base. Michael Hoffman : Well and because of the collection layer of them higher, the density play of, I mean it's just now hundreds of little tuck-ins in a sense at the local level for you and the, and it's the classic route rationalization and customer overlay. That's what we get to look for eventually. Devina Rankin : We're, certainly optimistic about all of the opportunities that we have in front of us with this transaction. I think, we\u2019ve discussed it well and those synergies that we talked about include how we're thinking about the operating efficiency opportunities that are in-front of us. John Morris : Yes. I mean so the extent that it doesn't affect every single market then yeah, I mean the, the it is somewhat similar, I mean much bigger but somewhat similar to tuck-in. I mean they're really done. I think there's nine markets that have even touches out of 17 Jim Fish : And it\u2019s got a piece of the footprint in nine markets. I mean there's overlap in all John Morris : I think the main point I made earlier, which is that it's the, there are a lot of dots on the map east of the Mississippi between the two companies, but the preponderance of them are in these heavily competitive markets. So there's no shortage of competition where these two companies operate. Michael Hoffman : Yeah, you'll pay the $500 an hour lawyers to figure out how to talk to the Justice Department into what the size of the market is and how it'll all work itself out. At the end of the day, it's a 14%, 15% increase in the customer growth all in one fell swoop. That's huge. Jim Fish : I think they're more than 500 bucks. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Last question from me is whatever the leverage has increased, or the [debt] is going to be for this basically, I can look at the interest expense approximately being offset by the $100 million in savings. So, that kind of washes itself out. I start with your 2.05 billion midpoint of 2019 cashflow, add a 140 is what Advanced is, pick-up 100 on recycling potentially not all at once, but I get it eventually. So, we're really talking about a company that should be sitting here looking at about a $2.3 billion free cashflow number and then some sustainable organic growth. Devina Rankin : It's too early for as they get a new baseline free cashflow number. But we appreciate the effort that you've taken to help us bridge from where we are today. But I would tell you that our cost of capital I think is better than what you just outlined. We're optimistic that we're going to be able to pull in a nice return on the ADS business immediately and now our cost of capital is actually one of the things that makes this feel so attractive. Michael Hoffman : Yeah. But you are going to add more debt, so it's just going to end up increasing your interest expense about the amount of the, of 100 million. Devina Rankin : Certainly going to add more debt, but that incremental debt class is nothing compared to the incremental cashflow and synergy value that we're looking at bringing on. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right. Thanks very much. See you guys in a couple of weeks. Jim Fish : Thank you. John Morris : Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Levine with Bloomberg Intelligence. Your line is open. Scott Levine : Hey, good morning guys, So I actually wanted to ask about Petro Waste a little bit and was hoping you might be able to elaborate a little bit. And remind us about the size of your energy waste footprint right now and what attracted you to that opportunity at this point in time and maybe elaborate a little bit more on your strategy and any plans to grow that business maybe outside of Texas, which I think is the primary focus for the acquisition you just made there. Jim Fish : Yeah, so at its peak and that, and I'm talking kind of 2014, 2015 that energy services business, which was largely just grown organically was in the $200 million to $250 million in revenue range. And of course, that trailed off considerably with the drop in oil prices. It has returned, maybe not to that peak, just and of course oil prices haven't gotten back to where they were there either. But the business has grown nicely over the last two years. So, 2017 to 2018 and then again 2018 and so far in 2019, the Petro Waste acquisition, really for us is very strategic, particularly as it relates to geography. I mean, if you're going to be in this, if you're going to make a commitment to be in this energy services space, you have to be in the big eye, which is the Permian Basin. And we had a very small presence in the Permian Basin. This gives us a much more important presence in Permian. It's largely landfills as we talked about, I think last quarter. It is largely a landfill acquisition. So, we look at it as being core. It's core to what we do every day. And so we're very good at it. And so we're feeling confident that that this business will immediately be accretive for us. But when we bought it, we recognized that because it's an area that we really didn't have landfills at all, that it would have to survive based on the, or it has to be purchased based on the fact that it was a reasonable multiple, not one that is supplemented by synergies. There really weren't any synergies with it. So it's, we're very confident that we got it at a good price, that it's right down the middle of the fairway for us in terms of landfill. And it's in the best location if you're going to be in this space in the United States. John Morris : I think Jim, I would add too, I mean, we've been in the energy space for a handful, for a number of years now and I think even outside, we've got the resources within the organization already to really go after and address a lot of the customer needs out there because we have services \u2013 a lot of those same type of customers in other geographies. Scott Levine : Got It. And just to make sure I understand correctly, I think you said, for the balance of this year, the focus on acquisitions was strictly tuck-ins in solid waste outside of the Advanced Disposal regions. Did I hear that correctly or would that, would you still be interested in other opportunities, call it outside of solid waste, whether it be energy waste or otherwise, as you await approval and completion of the ADSW merger? Devina Rankin : So, I actually think, you've summarized it well from the perspective of tuck-in acquisitions outside of the market that ADS covers. But we are, we're certainly continuing to be interested in deals similar to the Petro Waste acquisition that we did in the energy and environmental services space. We view that as core business for us. So we're not limiting our pursuit of acquisitions to just traditional solid waste. We are looking holistically, on the traditional solid waste side though we are specifically looking at markets outside of the ADS market. Scott Levine : Got It. Thanks. Appreciate the time guys. Jim Fish : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Jim Fish : Great. Thank you very much. In closing, I just want to say that we're really pleased with the efforts of this entire Waste Management team, for quarter after quarter they do a fantastic job of focusing heavily on the customer, standing behind our commitment to our digital technology now and then executing on the overall strategy of continuous improvement of differentiation. This is truly a team effort and I think it really shows and with that, I think we're very excited to add the Advanced folks to our team in the near future. Thank you all for joining us today and we'll talk soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, again, this conference will be available for replay today, April 25, 2019 at 01 :00 P.M.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Waste Management 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It's now my pleasure to hand the call over to Mr. Ed Egl, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Ed Egl : Thank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Devina Rankin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover high level financials and provide a strategic update. John will cover an operating overview and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning, that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC including our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs. Jim, and John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume. During the call, Jim and Devina will discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS or earnings per share and they'll also address, operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization and operating EBITDA margin. Jim and Devina will also be discussing the planned acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services, Inc., which they may refer to as Advanced or ADS. Any comparisons unless otherwise stated will be with the second quarter of 2018. Operating and SG&A expenses, operating EBITDA, net income and EPS for the second quarter of 2019 have been adjusted and projected 2019 results are anticipated to be adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations, including costs related to the pending acquisition of ADS. These adjusted measures in addition of free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release in the tables which can be found on the Company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited. Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management, President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed and thank you all for joining us. Once again, our employees delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter, continuing to demonstrate our strategic focus on leveraging our asset network to serve our customers and drive growth. Just like in the first quarter, the strength of our collection and disposal business was the main contributor to our success. In the second quarter, we generated more than 7% organic revenue growth in our collection and disposal business with yield of 2.7% and volume of 4.4%, and we had strong core price of 5.4%, which translated into total Company operating EBITDA of more than $1.13 billion, an increase of almost 7% from the second quarter of 2018. We also saw operating EBITDA margin expand 30 basis points for the -- for the total Company and 60 basis points for the collection and disposal business. As we've said many times, operating EBITDA is the best measure of the health and performance of our business; and in the second quarter, all indicators point to excellent health. Our operating EBITDA growth translated into free cash flow of $440 million. We're pleased with our year-to-date results which we will discuss in a moment, but first I'd like to provide an update on the progress we're making towards the ADS acquisition. At the end of June, the ADS stockholders voted overwhelmingly to approve Waste Management's acquisition of the company. This stockholder approval is an important milestone in the process towards closing the transaction. In addition and as expected, we received a second request from the Department of Justice, and we will continue to work with them to satisfy this request. We remain on track to complete the acquisition during the first quarter of 2020. We will keep you informed as we continue our progress towards closing this transaction. We have a dedicated team working to position us to successfully integrate ADS upon close. These efforts are important, and we're pleased with the progress we're making on that front. Our team is also focused on a number of additional efforts to accelerate our growth and continuously improve our business. We continue to invest in our people, technology, our customer experience and our asset network. On the people side, we opened our second driver and technician training facility in Glendale, Arizona in June, and we continue to expand our program with Caterpillar to remotely operate equipment at one of our landfills in Denver. While this is a technology investment, it's also an investment in our people as technology like this modernizes the jobs for our workers, improves safety, enables us to more efficiently work, and provides us with an opportunity to expand our workforce in the future. On both the technology and customer experience fronts, in June we launched an upgraded wm.com that allows customers to order and manage service with modernized navigation and increased functionality. We redesigned the site with input from our customers, and so far it's been really well received. In the first month, we had 20% increase in customers shopping on the website and an 11% increase in overall online sales revenue. e-commerce is a small but growing channel for us, and we're in the early innings of maximizing its value. Another benefit we get from e-commerce is improving customer loyalty, because most online customers enroll in convenient billing and payment options. Finally, on the asset network front, we're seeing great results from our increased focus on enhancing our post collection business model. Our team is securing expansion air space capacity in key markets partnering with communities to ensure that they understand the role that landfills can play at achieving their waste management goals and optimizing our pricing methods to improve profitability and return. In the second quarter, core price in the landfill line of business was 4% and MSW yield was 3.6%, which exceeded 3% for the second consecutive quarter. This is the highest MSW yield in a decade. It's important for us to drive discipline in landfill pricing to ensure that we earn appropriate returns on this capital intensive part of our business. Our efforts to drive greater discipline in the pricing of our post collection businesses starts with the transfer station, which is often referred to as a remote gate to the landfill. This focus is also showing strong results with our second quarter transfer station yield improving to 3.4%, an increase of 70 basis points sequentially and a 160 basis points from the prior year period. We will continue to focus on maximizing our asset utilization to generate strong returns on all of our assets. We've had a great start to 2019. In the second half of 2019, we expect that our collection and disposal business will continue to generate strong earnings growth and more than offset the decline we now expect in our recycling line of business. John will give a bit more color, but suffice to say we're confident in our ability to execute our strategy, and we are reaffirming our full year 2019 guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share of between $4.28 and $4.38, adjusted operating EBITDA of between $4.4 billion and $4.45 billion, and free cash flow of between $2.025 billion and $2.075 billion. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Morris : Thanks, Jim and good morning. Second quarter results were strong, particularly in the collection and disposal lines of business. Collection and disposal organic growth -- on revenue growth topped 7% driven by strong execution on our core price program, continued progress of our strategy around customer differentiation, and robust post collection volumes at our transfer stations and landfills. On the landfill volume front, in the second quarter, growth was driven by the continued strength of MSW volumes, an increase in special waste volumes from our pipeline that remains strong and very strong C&D volumes as we were able to position ourselves as a community partner to assist with fire [ph] cleanup activities in California. The strong volumes that we're seeing in our landfills are also at attractive prices, MSW volumes grew 6.1% and yield was 3.6% in the second quarter. MSW yield of 3.4% and 3.6% in the first two quarters of the year represents a step change improvement from the last several years, and we expect this trend to continue. Our post collection lines of business are seeing increased operating cost pressures, as well as higher capital investments as the cost of constructions rise. We will continue to focus on disciplined pricing to recover these costs and generate appropriate returns on our investments in these assets. Turning to our customer focus metrics. Churn was 8.8% in the second quarter. Year-to-date churn is 8.5%, a 60-basis-point improvement over last year. Additionally, service increases continue to outpace service decreases. The strong collection and disposal organic growth and great operating performance led to operating EBITDA growth of $112 million and a 60 basis point improvement in the margins in those lines of business. In the second quarter, total Company operating EBITDA was the highest that we have ever generated. In the second quarter, total operating costs as a percentage of revenue were 61.5%, a 40 basis point improvement over last year, as our operations have been able to improve their efficiency and manage their spending as volumes increase. We still have opportunities for further improvement, particularly around labor, maintenance, and leachate management costs and our team is focused on identifying and making these improvements. For example, our M100 program provides our frontline supervisors a view of each segment of their routes throughout the day, which will allow for improved efficiency and additional labor savings. We saw early benefits from this initiative in the second quarter as efficiency improved in all three collection lines of business, driving a 25 basis point reduction in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. We expect to drive even greater efficiency improvements in our collection lines of business, as we continue the -- the deployment of these tools across the enterprise. Turning to recycling, there was a $21 per ton or 33% drop year-over-year in our blended average commodity price down to $43 per ton, but operating EBITDA improved $6 million. We're very pleased with the outcome of our team's hard work to improve the recycling model by lowering cost, restructuring contracts and assessing fees for contamination. Looking at the remainder of the year, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to be well below the $70 per ton commodity price, we expected when we gave our 2019 outlook. And as a result, we no longer anticipate a full-year tailwind from recycling. We now expect that our recycling business will be $0.01 to $0.02 headwind for the full year. As we mentioned previously, the traditional formula that a $10 move in commodity prices changes annual EPS by $0.04 no longer holds, due to our successful efforts to change and improve the business model. To emphasize this point, without our team's proactive steps to evolve the recycling business model, the full-year impact from depressed commodity prices would likely be closer to a negative $0.09, rather than a negative $0.01 to $0.02 that we're forecasting. We remain focused on changing the business model for recycling with improved MRF technology and contract structures that recoup processing costs and protect us from commodity price downside. To that end, we are on track to open our recycling plant of the future by the end of this year. With this plant, we expect to achieve labor and operating cost savings while creating the best quality material for sale. Impressively, we fully expect the performance of our collection and disposal business to overcome the headwind from lower recycling commodity prices. As we passed the halfway mark for the year, we anticipate that continued strong organic growth and a focus on operating efficiencies will keep us on target. Our employees have delivered a strong performance throughout this year. I want to thank them for the fantastic job, they continue to do service on our customers and producing breakthrough results. As a leadership team, we are absolutely confident they will continue to perform at high levels to achieve our full 2019 guidance. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. As you heard from Jim and John, the strong performance of our collection and disposal business continued to overcome the impact of a weak cycling environment. In our second quarter, we again delivered solid financial results. Collection and disposal operating EBITDA grew by over 9% when compared with the second quarter of 2018, driving total Company operating EBITDA growth by almost 7% and positioning us well to deliver our full year targeted growth of about 5%. We view, operating EBITDA growth, as the single most important measure of our performance, and we're very pleased to see our operations deliver these results. In the second quarter of 2019, cash flow from operations grew 3.6% to $1.10 billion. When you normalize the year-over-year comparison for the impact of the fuel tax credits that we received in the second quarter of 2018, the increase would have been 6.7%. We are pleased with this result and see our efforts to convert more of each revenue dollar to cash working. With cash from operations of the percentage of revenue improving 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis to 24.9%. This is particularly impressive when you consider that we achieved this result in spite of a $66 million decrease in revenues from yield in our recycling business due to the 30% decline in market prices for the commodities in South. During the second quarter, we spent $578 million -- $578 million on capital expenditures. This compares to $436 million in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in the current year is related to timing differences in our spending for landfill construction, trucks and containers. The difference in timing is the result of intentional steps we have taken to invest in our growth by pulling forward some of our planned capital spending. We remain disciplined in allocating capital dollars to our highest margin and return businesses and has proactively managed our capital spending in 2019 to address our robust volume growth. Volume in our landfill and commercial collection businesses exceeded expectations in the first half of the year, and our operators and their corporate partners have worked hard to accelerate construction and asset deliveries to meet our customers' needs. With the strength of our volume growth, our full-year capital expenditures will be at the upper end of our guidance of between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion. In the second quarter of 2019, our business generated $440 million of free cash flow. For the first six months of the year, free cash flow was $871 million. The timing difference that I just discussed for capital expenditures is the primary driver of the decline and the measures from the prior year. Additionally, our second quarter of 2018 included $28 million of fuel tax credits, as well as nearly $80 million in proceeds from the divestiture of non-core businesses. When you normalize for these two items, the year-over-year comparisons for both the quarter and year-to-date period more clearly reflects our strong operating EBITDA growth. When you -- we continue to expect our strong operating performance and disciplined capital spending will yield full year free cash flow in line with our guidance of between $2.025 billion and $2.075 billion. In the second quarter of 2019, we used our free cash flow to pay $217 million in dividends and we repurchased $180 million of our stock. When combined with our first quarter share repurchase activity, we expect this level of share repurchases to meet our goal of offsetting dilution from stock-based compensation. Given the pending acquisition of ADS and our efforts to position our balance sheet while for close, we no longer expect to repurchase additional shares over the remainder of the year. We continue to estimate that this will have up to a negative $0.06 impact on full year EPS. During the quarter, we successfully executed a $4 billion debt financing, which positions us to close on the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. The offering proceeds have largely been invested in stable money market fund that we also used a portion of the fund to retire several of our higher priced senior notes. We are happy with the results of both transaction. And our average pre -- our pre-tax average cost of debt is now below 4%, which is instrumental to executing well on achieving our targeted returns for the pending acquisition. We estimate that the incremental interest will have a negative $0.03 impact to 2019 EPS. We plan to adjust for both the impact of lower share repurchases and incremental interest costs through the ADS acquisition closing. Our debt to EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.95 times at the end of the second quarter. This is higher than where we have been in recent years. So well within our targeted levels, which is particularly impressive given that the measure does not yet have the benefit of ADS EBITDA. Our strong balance sheet continues to afford us the financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions at the right price. Turning to SG&A. For the second quarter, our SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue were 9.8%, in line with the second quarter of 2018, despite the increased investment we are making in technology. For the full year, we continue to target SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue of about 10%. In our business, the second quarter is often an important indicator of how we will perform for the full year, as we observe seasonal increases in certain parts of our business. With the strength of our second quarter results and the positive momentum that we are seeing early in the third quarter, we are positioned well to -- to deliver on our 2019 priorities. With that, Christine, let's open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James, your line is open. Tyler Brown : Hey, John, obviously landfill volumes continue to impress. At this point, you're running maybe north of 120 million tons of landfill volumes, but it feels like there's a couple of discrete projects in there like the wildfire cleanup. I know, you mentioned the pipeline is robust, but how should we think about those landfill volumes moving into next year? Is there maybe a few million tons that won't recur or anything there would be helpful. John Morris : No, I think -- fair question. I mean, we certainly have looked at that and I think there's a lot of puts and takes with that volume. I mean, we're pointing to the California wildfires this year, which is obviously an unfortunate event to say the least. But if you go back last year and the year before, although the geography changes, we've seen these events year-in and year out. It's hard to predict, obviously, where they're going to show up. But I think the other thing you should look at is aside from just that is our special waste volumes continue to be strong and we referenced that in some of the prepared remarks. So we feel good about the landfill volume. We also look through the transfer stations as Jim mentioned, the remote gate to the landfill, we continue to see both price and volume performance there. So we feel good about where \u2013 we\u2019re around the post collection side. Tyler Brown : Okay, that's very helpful. And then, Jim? Jim Fish : Well, I was just going to add to that. It really -- it really is almost like event work for us. I mean, and to John's point, it's -- it's extremely unfortunate, when you have these big natural disasters. We were there to help -- help clean up. We were actually up -- Tara and I were up last week in Northern California driving through Paradise, it's devastating. But -- but really when you boil it down to how it impacts our volume or how it impacts our EBITDA or revenue or free cash flow, as John said, it's a lot of puts and takes, it's very lumpy, hard to predict on an area-by-area basis but -- but we seem to have whether it's a big event or a big construction project or a natural disaster cleanup or whatever it is every year, and so we just look at it as part -- as just simply part of our overall business, albeit part that's tough to predict. Tyler Brown : Yeah, no that's. I appreciate that. But Jim, maybe kind of coming back to the economic data. I mean, if you look at it across The Street. It kind of remains disparate. Obviously, your business is doing extremely well right now, but you also tend to be a bit late cycle. So I'm just curious, what you're seeing out there and maybe what are the KPIs that you and the Senior Management team really watch that might foretell a trend change in that organic growth metric? Jim Fish : Yeah, you're right. Tyler, about the fact that our industry tends to be considered more of a lagging indicator for the macroeconomy. I would tell you that waste management specifically is a pretty good indicator overall because we service virtually every sector of the economy. What I would say is, there are couple of kind of leading indicators within our numbers. First and foremost, our commercial collection business is somewhat of a proxy for how small business is doing. And when you see service increases outpacing service decreases repeatedly and strongly, to us that's a pretty good leading indicator of how small business is looking at the, at the future in terms of the economy. And then secondly, John mentioned, special waste. Our special waste pipeline is very strong. We've seen double-digit numbers now again and -- and the reason special waste is a leading indicator is because a lot of North American companies, the confidence in the economy shows up in their special waste project work. When they see signs of a slowing economy, they tend to kind of pull in the reins on that event work and wait until times look a little rosier. So the fact that our special waste pipeline looks as good as it does, and the fact that our special waste volumes in the quarters both second and first have looked good is a good leading indicator for us. And then the last one, of course is, is just C&D volume and of course, part of our C&D number is driven by fire volume but -- but even without the fire volume, our C&D number has been very strong for at least five quarters. Every city I go to seems to have a sea of cranes on the -- out on the horizon. So, it looks like C&D is still quite strong and that is also a pretty good leading indicator of the overall economy. Tyler Brown : Okay. Yeah that's helpful. And then maybe, Devina, real quick. What was the divestiture made in the quarter. So one, you noted it was ancillary, maybe what was it? Two, is it in that other revenue line? And then three, just how should we think about divested revenue in the second half versus the $82 million in the first half just for modeling. Devina Rankin : So the $82 million was actually in the first half of 2018, and divestiture activity in the second quarter of 2019 was very immaterial at about $8 million, and that's just normal course asset divestitures. Tyler Brown : Okay, sorry I got my numbers all mixed up, but is there a lot -- going to be a lot of back half divestitures or no? Devina Rankin : There is not currently an expectation of any meaningful back-half divestitures. We certainly look all the time for underperforming assets and assets that we can shed in order to be sure that we're optimizing the business model. We're really looking at the reverse side of that and thinking about acquisitions, and you'll see that in the second quarter, we acquired almost $50 million of additional -- traditional solid waste businesses. And when we think about that in terms of acquired revenue, you're looking at about $120 million of acquired revenue thus far in 2019. What you're seeing is somewhat of an offset associated with divestitures from the prior year. And so, there were divestitures both in front half of 2018 and the back half of 2018 that are somewhat offsetting that strong acquisition growth, but you'll see some of that normalize in the back half of the year. Tyler Brown : Okay, that's helpful. All right, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Feniger : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just on the MSW yield. The 3.6% second straight quarter, can you just help us understand, what is out there in the market right now that should give us confidence that there is momentum there that we could kind of look at that number going forward rather than stepping back in to the, the old years, in old cycles where pricing was a little bit more competitive. Is it something with the cost pressure seeing at the landfill that -- that the market now can start passing that through. Is it disruption on the recycling front, is it some consolidation that's played out? Help us understand some of the factors that is really putting together two straight consecutive quarters of good yield at -- at the disposal. Jim Fish : Yeah, Michael, I think you've touched on a couple of pieces there. It's -- part of it is -- is an increased focus through the use of data and analytics. We brought that to -- to the collection side of the business as probably seven years or eight years ago, and we've really transitioned that over to the landfill line of business. And now, there is -- not only a use of data and analytics, but there is a real focus on it from our Senior VPs as they work with their teams in the field. So that certainly is having an impact. I think, there may be -- some of it that is -- is kind of necessarily as a result of -- of few other cost categories going up, specifically transportation-related costs and leachate management certainly are climbing at a, at a rate higher than CPI, but -- but I think some of it is just sort of recognition on our part that -- that these are really critical assets that we have to earn a better return on them, they're very capital intensive. And so I would say that that 4% core price in landfills and 3.6% MSW yield on the heels of 3.4% is good, but I still think there is opportunity to increase that at our landfills and transfer stations, not just to keep up with inflation in certain cost categories, but to help us expand margins and to me, that's kind of a breath of fresh air after -- it feels like it's decade of 1% yield at the landfill. Michael Feniger : That's helpful. And then just lastly, I mean, this year, had a -- had a nice little benefit from the inflation pick up last year. This year, though inflation has kind of disappointed at least on the headline numbers. Can you just talk about what that might mean for us, thinking about that going to 2020 and are some of your business lines clearly seeing cost inflation above CPI and the market is going to still have to try to raise pricing to offset that? Thank you. Jim Fish : Yeah, sure, Michael, I will -- really on inflation and CPI specifically, it's really been flat for the flattish. I mean, it was down, I think 10 basis points for the quarter. But we didn't see really much in the way of tailwinds from CPI as it was creeping up over the last few quarters and now, it started to reverse course a little bit. We're not anticipating much in the way of a headwind. As you said, we do have some cost categories that are, that are outpacing inflation. And so as a result, we've tried to transition some of our pricing of contracts over to that water sewer trash index that -- that is more representative of our overall cost structure, but there also, there are also a few cost categories that are, that are not increasing at the same rate, such as fuel. So overall, I think, we're -- we're kind of a bit above that CPI, but we don't expect to see much of a headwind as we move out towards the latter half of '19 and into '20, unless something really changes dramatically. I don't anticipate much of a headwind on the price side from CPI softening. Michael Feniger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. First one for me is just on ADS and the HSR review. I can fully appreciate that there's only so much you guys would want to disclose in the middle of this process, but it would be helpful if you could let us know, how this review has been tracking relative to initial expectations. And then maybe lay out kind of a rough timeline on what to expect in terms of next steps, coming out of this second request from the DOJ? John Morris : Yeah, fair enough. This is John. I think, in terms of what we've experienced to-date. I think, it's tracking about as we expected from a timing standpoint, a process standpoint. Clearly, we're not far enough along where we can really start to add any more color or detail as we said in the prepared remarks, we still think the first quarter of 2020 is on track. I will tell you, the process so far has not yielded any surprises. We're continuing to do everything we can from a regulatory standpoint to make the process with the DOJ goes as expeditiously as it can. So in terms of next steps, again, we're not far off along in the process -- far enough along in the process for us to really add any additional color. But I would expect probably in the next 60 days to 90 days, we're going to be further along to the point where we'll be able to add a little bit more color. Jim Fish : Sean. I think, we all can empathize with you on the -- hear in patience here because, but unfortunately when it comes to things like synergies, we gave that original $100 million number, but we don't know any more at this point, because they are still operating as a separate company and we have not -- besides that, we have a team in there kind of diving in right now, that team won't go in and dive in until -- until we close the transaction. And then in a -- in very short order, we will know whether that $100 million is conservative or not. But we're -- we're kind of equally and patient, where we're -- we're waiting for this to run through its cycles with the Department of Justice. And once it does, we expect that things will move along pretty quickly. Sean Eastman : Yeah. I get that. And I wasn't really trying to prod at an updated synergy number necessarily, I just wanted to understand kind of even just procedurally, what the next step is in terms of what will be released by the DOJ or filed by you guys and kind of when that next sort of filing or update would be? John Morris : Well, as you've seen, the second request is in process right now. That's probably the only update since the last call, we're obviously working our way to satisfy that request from the regulators. Sean Eastman : Okay, got it, thanks. And then -- and the next one for me is just on the 60 basis points of margin expansion in the collection and disposal business. From a year-over-year perspective, there is quite a few moving parts in terms of some of the bonus payments made last year, some seasonality nuances and then this year, some technology investments being made. If there is any kind of additional parsing out you could do -- you could provide us in terms of how much of that was newly gained operating efficiency versus some of these other nuances, I just highlighted. Any color around that 60 basis points would be helpful. Devina Rankin : I think, what's most important and thinking about that 60 basis points is one, that it's ahead of our expectations for the year. We look for about 50 basis points of traditional solid waste, core collection and disposal margin expansion annually. And so to be at 60 basis points in the second quarter is ahead of plan. What is also important about this is -- that it generated in the core business. And so the special bonus that you mentioned, did provide about 40 basis points, but that separate and apart from that 60 basis points that we're really focused on in measuring as an indicator of how our efficiency focus as well as our pricing execution is delivering upon the margin expansion goals of the organization. On the reverse side, the incremental SG&A spending that we've talked about for technology investments is on the SG&A line. And we talked about SG&A actually being flat on a year-over-year basis from a margin perspective. We do expect that you'll see some acceleration of our SG&A spending for digital in the back half of the year and as a result, you'll see some of that margin pressure from the digital and SG&A costs that we've talked about and anticipated come through and normalize out some of the EBITDA margin expansion that we've experienced in the first half of the year. But overall, when you think about the fact that in 2018, we have a fuel tax credit that gave us about 30 basis points of a headwind to 2019 on margin, we've overcome that nicely and generated strong EBITDA margin expansion and we expect that to continue strongly into the back half of the year and then into 2020. Sean Eastman : That's helpful, and nice job this quarter, guys. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Hey, good morning, everyone, thanks for taking the questions. So just wanted to go back to your comments about the commercial service increases, outpacing the decreases coupled with the strong industrial yield and a very nice commercial yield. I think, you also mentioned that the churn rate was 8.8% in the quarter, is that right? So that actually ticked up in 2Q. So is that just sort of seasonality, what drove the slightly higher churn rate, how should we think about that maybe trending going forward as you look at the business. John Morris : Yeah, this is John. You touched on it [indiscernible] there was a slight uptick in Q2, but when you look at on a year-to-date basis, we're still better through the first two quarters. So we're not concerned about that. In terms of what's driving some of the commercial volume, I think, Jim mentioned it in his remarks. We've implemented smart truck technology on our vehicles and we think that being able to gather data that we otherwise weren't able to certainly driving some of that volume. Secondly, I think when you look at the churn rate, part of its being driven by our customer service and customer experience improvements and it's coming from the lost business that is moderated a bit as opposed to how we've done well in the new business side as well. But part of its coming out of our ability to retain some of these customers. And then lastly, I would say, Jim, mentioned early, early innings. But I think, the experience that customers are starting to have with some of the online tools we put in place is showing nice progress albeit early innings. Noah Kaye : That's really helpful color. Thanks. And then just a general macro, I mean, new organic growth was outstanding this quarter. I think, you broke out at your Investor Day. The revenue mix across different sectors and that was very helpful. And it's pretty diversified. But just listening to some of the other companies, particularly in the industrial space this quarter, there have been some frankly warning indicators around some of the heavy industry and even in the transport space and I guess just looking at your industrial business, specifically, how should we think about kind of expectations for growth and price strength for the rest of the year? What are you hearing from customers that kind of gives you confidence and sustainability of these metrics you've been-- you've been delivering? Jim Fish : Yeah, no, I mean, I obviously can't speak to -- to what the other companies are seeing. But what I would say about our volume is, and I've mentioned a little bit earlier. The real kind of indicators that reflect the health of the industrial segments are special waste primarily, and then also, there's a component of it within C&D and maybe even MSW. But largely special waste and that special waste pipeline looks -- look still very strong, I mean, I think there's -- and there is reason for optimism there even on things like coal combustion residuals down the road. So it -- a little bit of that speaks to the lumpiness that we see in our overall business that we talked about early on, those things are hard to predict but they come as big chunks of business and they tend to come every year, we just have a hard time telling where they're going to be and when they're going to come. But, I would tell you that -- that this economy has been a real enigma, because it's -- there isn't a real clear sign as to the direction of it. And so we kind of have to look at our own numbers and say, what do we think as opposed to what do the pundits thinks, because the pundits think -- the Fed can't even tell you what they think about it. So, right now, our numbers look to be still pretty strong. When we look at July into the month that we're in now, our volume numbers that we look at each week still look strong and they look strong in the commercial line of business, they look strong in the landfill line of business and they look fine in the roll-off line of business as well. The one that's been historically weak for us has been resi and it has been weak for -- for quite some time and some of that's just been almost by design. But I -- not to sound like the blind optimist here, in a roomful of kind of naysayers but our volumes look reasonably good. Devina Rankin : Noah, I would add one thing on the industrial line of business. Specifically, I think if you think about how Waste Management has positioned itself to be more customer-centric and really ensure that as we've grown in the industrial line of business with the [indiscernible] profession, it's been about shifting from temporary business to permanent business and doing that by focusing on our customer. And so, I think, you're seeing the results of that, not just on the volume side of that part of our business but also on the price side. So we're happy that the overall focus on the customer is really showing us results and our ability to retain those volumes. I think, we're better positioned for that today than we were last time around. Noah Kaye : Okay. That is incredibly helpful color. Thank you, both. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. Actually wanted to shift back to the recycling discussion, despite the pressure on commodity prices, you're still able to increase operating EBITDA, which is phenomenal. Can you tell us roughly, how many or percentage wise of your contracts have been restructured to kind of shift the risk albeit to your customers. John Morris : Yeah, this is, this is John. Jeff. We look at, we're probably about 40% of the way through, and I will tell you, we think about it in phases. The customers we have on our own backs, if you will. Obviously, we can get to them, generally quicker than -- than the residential customers, the commercial customers, if you will. The volume that's coming into our MRFs directly is another phase. We've obviously began to tackle early on. And then the last phase is really a lot of the franchise in municipal customers which take longer just because the structure of those contracts is generally 3 years to 5 years and a lot of times it's related to other lines of business, it's integrated to a franchise, post collection contracts, etc. So, but to answer your question specifically, we're probably between 35% and 40% of the way through, probably middle innings on the commercial piece in the MRF volume and probably, if you use the baseball analysis, maybe the third inning on the residential side. So we've got, we've got room to go for sure. And when you look to your point for us to see another quarter of continued revenue drop in our recycling team, and the field team has been able to improve EBITDA. We're pretty impressive. And we're pleased with the progress and are pleased with where we're at. We have a bunch of work left to do and plenty of opportunity. Jeff Silber : Okay. Sorry. Jim Fish : I would say, Jeff, that. Yeah so, one more point here and that is that to what John said, about having still 60% left, albeit the tougher -- the tougher Group, which are these big contracts. The good news is, if there is a little bit of good news in a -- in a really low kind of 25-year low number and that is that our arguments is a lot stronger when we come into a municipality during a renegotiation and say, look, we're at a -- we're at 25-year lows on OCC pricing. We're getting zero for mixed paper and this business has -- has really fallen off a cliff that those are real facts that we're bringing to the negotiating table with some groups that have pretty big purchasing power as opposed to just coming in and saying, look these are the normal ebbs and flows of a business and we're in kind of the down cycle right now, but we think it will come back, I wish I was as optimistic as that. Unfortunately, there is some kind of things that are changing within the recycling business, things like Amazon's reduced packaging program and US retail stores. I think, last number I saw was US retail big box stores have -- there have been 12,000 closures so far in 2019, compared to 6,000 for the entire year, last year, so there is some permanent changes going on in the business. So if there is a silver lining to a dark cloud, is that when we go in for renegotiation on these big contracts, we -- we do have a pretty compelling story. Jeff Silber : All right, that's helpful. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the ADS merger. Besides the DOJ review, what other milestone should we be tracking before closure? John Morris : Well, I think, I mentioned earlier, one of the previous questions. The second request has been -- we're executing against that right now and that to me is the next milestone is getting through that. And like I said, I think in the next probably 60 days to 90 days, a little bit of speculation. But I think between 60 days and 90 days. We're going to have some more detail that we can share with you folks. Devina Rankin : And while it's typical for you guys to track this externally, internally, we're certainly tracking our integration planning efforts for you can imagine, a number of back office processes that are not on the customer side and certainly sensitive to how we're thinking about operating two separate businesses through close, but we're, we've got the right team in place that's focused on integration planning at this point and that's an important thing for all of us to be tracking within the organization, but not one that you'll be able to see -- see efforts of externally. Jeff Silber : Okay, I understand. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Thank you all for taking the questions. If I could just close the loop on ADS, Jim, when we were last together a few weeks ago, you suggested that -- the 12 months to 15 months that you thought this would take to get it done, now might be more like 12 months. Is that -- that could be a point of an update. Just to give everybody something to bite on. Jim Fish : Yeah, I mean, look, maybe that's just my own kind of optimism coming out. I just feel like the -- Chuck Boettcher always look to me sideways whenever I say that. But, but I think that's based on what we're experiencing so far with the second request, based on the fact that, that there seems to be a smooth process taking place within the between the DOJ and -- and our own inside and outside counsel. It gives me optimism that this is more kind of the front end of the range that we've given as opposed to the back end. Michael Hoffman : Great. And then Devina, on the free cash flow. Could you help us a little bit with cadence, so if I use the midpoint, the 2.05 that leaves you with 1.179. You got to generate in the second half. How should we think about the cadence of that between the two quarters? Devina Rankin : So I think in particular, if you look at the first six months of the year, we talked about the capital side. So at about a billion fifty of capital through six months. We're at about 60% of the full-year target at this point. So that's one of the items, it is weighing more of the free cash flow toward the back half of the year. The other piece is actually increased interest and taxes, which we talked about in setting our target for the year, we talked about $75 million of incremental cash taxes associated with cash tax planning benefits that we realized in 2018. That would not repeat in the current year. Three months to six months, our interest and taxes are up $90 million. So what you can see is that we've effectively paid that most of that incremental $75 million that we expected to incur. And those two items, really do explain what you're seeing in terms of distribution of cash flow relative to the overall target that we're still very confident that with the EBITDA growth being the leader of that cash flow generation coupled with our focus on working capital optimization. We're going to deliver right at that targeted free cash flow that we talked about of $2.025 billion to $2.075 billion for the year. Jim Fish : Michael. That's -- just to reiterate that one point. That is, I'll call it, the long pole in the tent. But that -- that EBITDA growth, which we've always said is, that's the best measure of the health of business. I said in my -- in my prepared remarks, but I just don't want that to be missed here, I mean 6.9% growth in EBITDA is pretty darn impressive and that's the number. We're proud of stuff as -- as we report today. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So just to close the loop on my question. And if I follow your line of thinking here, Jim. Your next best quarter and EBITDA is 3Q seasonally. So I -- is there anything timing wise of tax -- normal tax payment or interest payment that would eat into cash in 3Q and so our proportion that 179 more in the 3Q less than 4Q. Devina Rankin : And I would certainly say that as that long pole in the tent being EBITDA in Q3 being our strongest EBITDA quarter. We are confident that Q3 will be a very strong EBITDA quarter for us -- for a free cash flow quarter for us. Michael Hoffman : And there is not some timing issue around cash outflows like taxes or interest expense that moves that timing around the distribution of the free cash. Devina Rankin : That's right. Not in 2019. John Morris : I think the only timing, Michael, might be, Devina has talked a lot about it, but is CapEx and we [ph] CapEx. Michael Hoffman : Yeah. John Morris : Yeah, I mean exact. I mean, I think Devina, as we discussed yesterday, we're -- we're probably 60%. Devina Rankin : 60%. John Morris : Through our CapEx spending, through two quarters. Now that doesn't mean, you necessarily kind of straight line it from there. But it does give us optimism that this timing of CapEx in the first two quarters of the year is what's causing this -- this pretty high capital expenditure number. I think the other thing worth mentioning there, Michael, is that when we think about CapEx, a lot of it is about the growth -- the future growth of the business. We're spending -- you and I talked about this when we travel together, we're not talking about an immaterial number when we talk about building a brand new, for example, a brand-new single stream plant. I mean, whether it's a recycle plant in the future. A single stream plant. When you build it from the ground up and secure the land and put the building on there and then put all the equipment in there that's not cheap and that's all for the brand new recycle plant of the future in Chicago. That's all happening this year. We think that is, if it -- if it proves out the way we think it will while the impact of one plant on the income statement in 2020 is not going to be material. If it proves out the way we think it will from a process and from an equipment standpoint this then would start this -- this kind of cascading effect, where we replace every one of our single streams potentially with the plant that looks like that, so that is -- all that capital is showing up this year. And none of the EBITDA is showing up this year. So a piece of this CapEx is related to just an investment in our future. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. And thanks for that clarity. In the past you shared with us what your price volume trends were specifically in C&D and special waste. And by the way. Thank you for including that new table that shows price or yield and volume by the lines of business. Could we get some clarity on specifically what happened in C&D and special waste, in the quarter. Michael Hoffman : Looks like you did 10.1% volume in 1Q. Jim Fish : Yeah, I mean, I think, I've talked a bit about special waste today. And John, you can give some color here too. But special waste. As I said, there is a whole bunch of project work in there. I mean, Mike Watson, his team are very focused on it. We said that at some point, next year, CCRs they start to impact that number, which would be good for us. Right now, they're not. And right now, it's just a lot of project work, which in kind of reference to the macro economy is a good thing is some of North American companies are using that as I think, it's a sign that there is still is a level of confidence in the overall economy. But it's hard to point to one thing in the special waste -- waste stream. It's a whole bunch of things, and I would say, pretty much the same thing about C&D with the exception of the fire volume which was in there. And so when you look at our C&D volume, over the last few quarters, it's been double digits. It has not been as high as it is -- or it was in the second quarter, but that's -- that was really more driven by the fire volume. John Morris : \u2026when we look at it. Go ahead, Micheal. Michael Hoffman : Go ahead, John, sorry, no, no, go ahead, John. John Morris : All I was going to add was when you look at it quarter by quarter. You can see some of the lumpiness with some of the projects that have gone in and out of the C&D bucket. But as you look at it over the last handful of quarters last two years, really it's been generally up into the right. And as Jim mentioned, we continue to see strength in that overall from quarter-to-quarter. It is -- it does bounce around a little bit. Michael Hoffman : Yeah, fair enough. Devina Rankin : I do think that particularly, I am sorry, Micheal. One quick point. I do think that's particularly important on the volume side. Right, on the price side, we are talking about consistent execution. On the volume side, thinking about the landfill line of business and our outlook for the rest of the year. When you look at the first six months and 4.3% year-to-date of volume growth, overall in the Company, moderation from things like the California wildfire impact in the fourth quarter of last year. The anniversarying of the New York Department of Sanitation contracts that came had a step-change late in 2018. We do expect some level of moderation in volumes in the second half of the year from what you've seen in the first half. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. And so you did 10.1% in volume in the first quarter and 17.2% in special waste to year-over-year growth, what's that number in 2Q for both? Devina Rankin : Special waste was 13.3% and what was the other one that you were looking for? Jim Fish : You had C&D was 10.1% in the first quarter. And I was just curious, what it was in the second quarter, year-over-year growth. Volume? Devina Rankin : That's where the -- that's where the fire volume showed up, so that measure really isn't one of those that stands alone and tell you what the business did, but if you normalize for the fire volumes and look at landfill overall, our volume growth for landfill was 5.3% in the second quarter. Michael Hoffman : Perfect. All right. That helps a lot. And then last thing, I mean, are you correct in the way you've showed the data, you had positive contribution year-over-year from recycling for your own efforts, but because where prices are. It will be negative in the second half and therefore, negative for the year, is that right way for me to model it? Devina Rankin : That's exactly right. So the benefit in first half of the year from a recycling line of business totaled $17 million or about $0.03 of EPS. And we're now showing that we expect the back half -- or the total impact for the year to be a negative $0.01 to $0.02 which tells you a negative $0.04 to $0.05 of EPS is what we expect in the back half of the year. And that has to do with our execution on the contamination fees and our contract renegotiation efforts that really started to show themselves in the back half of 2018 and anniversarying those impacts. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derek Spronck from RBC. Derek Spronck : Okay, thank you for taking my questions. Are you seeing any pickup in landfill disposal volumes actually coming from recyclable material that otherwise would have been recycled because of the poor economics now instead of being recycled -- shifting into the landfill. And maybe, you could -- if you could maybe just touch on the coal ash opportunity as well. Thank you. John Morris : Yeah, I would say, this is, John. I would tell you, on the -- to the first question, the short answer is, no. We haven't seen any appreciable impact from recycling move into -- moving to our landfills, for sure. I think one of the things we mentioned on the previous call is we've had -- we have the good fortune to have a really talented team in our brokerage side of the business. So we've been able to continue to move material even through the -- even through the most -- the most -- the harshest downturn in commodity prices in 20 years to 25 years. Jim Fish : Yeah. And I'll take the coal ash question, I mean we've -- one of the reasons we feel good about the opportunity is because we've -- since 2010, we've managed over 33 million ton of CCRs for electric utility customers. But there is an awful lot left. We've developed -- we think a really good reputation for the safe professional handling of that, but there are 700 active and inactive ash ponds in the United States that are covered by state and federal CCR regulations. And so over the next -- probably decade, those electric utilities are going -- are going to have to address, somewhere in the neighborhood of 700 million tons. It's a big, big number and we -- we certainly believe, we'll get some portion of that based on past history and based on the fact that we -- we've built a really solid reputation as a good partner in this area. Derek Spronck : Are the land filling economics on coal ash relatively similar to the MSW land filling? Jim Fish : Yeah I think so. I mean in some cases there is -- we had a big customer a couple of years ago. And so the margins going into the landfill were comparable. There was a pretty big capital commitment there. But hopefully, some of that capital is reusable -- lot of it was in the form of trucks, some of it in the form of -- of monofill construction. So we think that -- that going forward, we will be able to leverage some of that capital that we stepped out for with this big customer several years ago. And so the returns there would be -- it would be actually better than that original customer. Derek Spronck : Okay, that's great. And maybe just one more for myself, if DOJ determines that you need to divest of more than $200 million of asset, does that derail the ADS acquisition at all? Or what are the recourse or mechanisms, if that were to occur. John Morris : Yeah, the $200 million is a negotiated point between the two parties and sort of an insurance policy. If you want to look at it that way. It's not a line in the sand that's going to dictate whether the transaction goes or doesn't go, it's simply a way to get both sides comfortable with the threshold of potential divestitures. But as Jim said, and I said earlier, we feel good about where we are in the process. All the feedback we've got to date has been consistent with what we expected. And that's why, we remain confident that sometime in the first quarter of 2020, we will be able to get the transaction closed. Derek Spronck : Okay, that's great. That's all from me. Thank you. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Derrick Laton : Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Derrick Laton on for Brian. Devina Rankin : Good morning, Derrick. Derrick Laton : Thanks for squeezing me in. Yeah, just one question around input costs in the quarter, did you guys see anything meaningful in terms of higher landfill operating costs leachate generation -- anything like that and if so, could you quantify that? John Morris : Yeah, we certainly -- leachate continues to be one of the buckets of cost pressure for us, as is -- as is transportation. But I think, the important thing to notice, when you look at the overall margins. And we've talked at length about core price and yield results for post collection and specifically the MSW, we're finding ways to obviously combat that and still show margin accretion. So as Devina, I think mentioned earlier, there are certainly a couple of buckets, two, I mentioned that are outstripping what we would extract from normal cost increases, but overall, I think we're probably tracking in the 3% range from a CPI standpoint. Devina Rankin : So Derrick, from a quantification perspective on the current quarter impact about 20 basis points of incremental costs was from leachate cost acceleration, specifically that that's incorporated in that 60 basis points of overall margin expansion that we talked about -- collection and disposal, shows you that leachate is certainly one of those cost categories like John mentioned that outpacing CPI growth. But at the end of the day, it's still a component of that 60 basis points of strong EBITDA margin expansion. Operating margin expansion that we're seeing in the business. Derrick Laton : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just one last one for me, you mentioned sort of a step change in pricing around the transfer station, what's sort of driving this -- this focus and maybe what's the opportunity for you guys as you look ahead for pricing in this , in this particular segment? John Morris : Well, I think, we've talked at length about the fact that we've got really well-positioned assets, not just the landfills, as Jim mentioned, the remote gate to the landfills and a lot of cases are the transfer stations which we think, we've obviously -- the team has done a nice job of making sure, we're positioned in the right places in the right markets. I think, that coupled with some of the strain that's been spoken about in terms of transportation network. We've been able to leverage that. And I think that's part of the reason why we're seeing the success through the transfer stations and I think that certainly, there's two components to pricing, one is overcoming obviously the cost headwinds that we've -- we've spoken to and secondly is leverage -- leveraging the position of not only our assets, but the network that exist between those post collection assets and I think that's what, you're seeing the results over in the last handful of quarters. Derrick Laton : Got you. Helpful, thanks, guys. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Mark Neville from Scotiabank. Mark Neville : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I think you just answered it, but just the yield that -- step change in the yield in MSW and transfer in around 3.5%. Again, I think you did clarify this point. You are capturing incremental margin. I mean, more than offsetting the cost pressures you're seeing in that business. And that's part of the 60 basis points. Correct? John Morris : Yeah, that is correct. Mark Neville : And I think, Jim, earlier you mentioned further gains potentially on the yield. I'm just, I'm curious is that, is that more incremental margin or is it again just more offsetting additional cost pressure? Jim Fish : Well, I don't know that we expect these operating costs, we've talked about today to continue to climb from where they are, but they are at this point running in excess of inflation. So, so I would guess that that continuing to -- to focus on pricing and drive higher price is probably as much margin accretion. But -- but I would say after -- after many years of 1%, 0.9%, 1.4%. I don't feel like, I'm doing something that should upset to me, folks. Mark Neville : Okay. And obviously with the volume growth, it's not impacting the volume, you're seeing in the landfill business either. Okay. Jim Fish : No, I mean, and I think it goes to what John said, just a second ago, and that is that, we really have well positioned disposal assets around North America, and so that -- that makes a makes a big difference for us as we think about our customers viewing it as the next -- they do what's consider to be the next best alternative analysis and in many cases, we're the best alternative when it comes to disposal. Mark Neville : All right, I guess, thank you. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : We have no further question at this time. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Jim Fish. Jim Fish : All right, thank you. And lastly, we've talked a lot about our people today and I just want to reiterate, how important this team of 44,000 people is into producing results. Without every single person, we could not do what we, what we do. Our reporting today wouldn't be what it was. We continue to make sure they know that by investing in them. And last week, I was in Chico, California, meeting with some of our teammates, we're about to open a brand new hauling facility. Next week, I'll be in Denver, we're visiting a recently opened Energy Services building. I mentioned in my script that we're opening a state of the art driver technician facility in Arizona and I'm giving the go-ahead this week for the fifth year in a row to fully absorb healthcare increases, so that our -- our hard working 44,000 employees don't have to pay extra for that very, very important benefit. It's -- if you were at our Investor Day, you heard me talk about something called People First, and it's part of that culture. One of the questions that I think was asked was, what's the key ingredient here to Waste Management's consistency in this, in this kind of volatile economic climate. And I would tell you that the answer is our people and so thank you to all of our 44,000 teammates today for all that you do. And thank you to all of you for joining us today. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, speaker Ed Egl, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ed Egl : Thank you, Nora [Ph]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You'll hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover high-level financials and provide a strategic update, John will cover an operating overview, and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs. Jim and John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless otherwise stated are more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume. All third quarter volume results discussed are on a workday adjusted basis. During the call, Jim and Devina will discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS or earnings per share. And they'll also address operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Jim and Devina will also be discussing the planned acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services which they may refer to as Advanced or ADS. Any comparison unless otherwise stated will be with the third quarter of 2018. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA and SG&A expense results have been adjusted and projected 2019 measures are anticipated to be adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations including costs incurred in connection with the pending acquisition of ADS and our related reduction of common stock repurchases from planned levels. These adjusted measures in addition to free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release tables which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure, and additional information about use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections. This call is being recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning approximately 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today until 5 :00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 6.

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, the fundamental strength of our collection and disposal business continue to drive positive results for the Company, confirming that focusing on our employees and customers and leveraging our asset network is the right strategy. In the third quarter, we generated more than 5% organic revenue in our collection and disposal business with yield of 2.6% and volume of 2.7%. And we had a strong core price of 5.3%, which translated into total Company operating EBITDA of more than $1.14 billion, an increase of more than 3% from the third quarter of 2018. We also saw operating EBITDA margin expand 50 basis points in the collection and disposal business, which translated into operating cash growing almost 9%. As we reflect on the year so far and develop our plans for next year, a couple of trends are starting to come to light in particularly in our collection and disposal business. Our results across the solid waste business have been strong through the first nine months of the year. But they've been particularly strong in our lines of business that are driven by the consumer portion of the economy, commercial collection and MSW landfill volumes. We have good visibility into these segments of our business and all indicators are pointing to continued strength. When we look at the portion of our business, driven by the industrial segment of the economy, namely special waste, we continue to see growth, however, the pace of growth is starting to moderate. We're starting to see generators take a more cautious approach to awarding new work. We still see our special waste pipeline is strong and we're in a solid position to capitalize on these jobs, as they occur based on the long-term relationships we built with our large industrial customers and the strength of our asset network. Overall, our collection and disposal business has performed exceptionally well in 2019 overcoming headwinds in our commodity-sensitive businesses, recycling and renewable energy. The results in our commodity-sensitive businesses, which make up less than 10% of our total revenue, have been below our expectations. We've discussed all year the historically low recycling commodity prices, but we've also seen a negative $18 million impact in our operating EBITDA plan through the first nine months of the year related to renewable and natural gas credits. We remain convinced that our strategy to close the loop between our landfill gas and CNG fleet is the right strategy and is an important piece of our commitment to drive sustainability within our operations. The good news is that the steps we're taking to transform the recycling business with restructured fee-based contracts and investments in technology will insulate the business from commodity price swings and we're starting to see results. We saw a 320-basis point improvement in contamination rates at our single-stream MRFs in the third quarter. On the technology front, we began running test material through our MRF of the future and are encouraged by the results. At multiple other facilities, we're testing robotics, advanced optical sorting technology, and improving the screening processes. We continue to expect a meaningful operating cost savings from these advancements in technology, while also creating the best quality material for sale through positive sorting processes. Finally, I'd like to provide an update on the progress we're making toward the ADS acquisition. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to make progress toward closing this transaction and we remain on track to complete the acquisition during the first quarter of 2020. As you might imagine, we received a high level of interest from other companies inquiring any potential businesses we might be required to divest. Our integration team continues to position us to successfully integrate ADS upon close. Overall, we're pleased with our performance in the first three quarters of the year, which positions us to achieve our full-year goals. The general macro economy seems to be stable as indicated by our strong price and volume growth with consumer spending steady, while the industrial segment seems to be taking more of a wait and see approach. The overall investment theme for Waste Management remains one where our solid waste business continues to produce excellent results and overcomes challenges in our commodity-based businesses. This is best demonstrated by our 7.8% year-over-year operating EBITDA growth in our collection and disposal business, and our 8.9% year-over-year growth in our net cash from operations. These strong results position us to deliver our full-year 2019 results. In closing, I want to highlight another accomplishment in the quarter that we're particularly proud of. For the second year in a row, we were named as Sector Leader for Commercial Services on the North American and World Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. This distinction is a reflection of our leadership in sustainability and the continued strides we are making in these areas. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We're pleased with our third quarter performance driven by organic revenue growth of 5.3% in the collection and disposal business. The headline here is at landfill MSW yield in the third quarter was 3.7%, a 250-basis point improvement over last year. And if you look at the monthly trend of MSW yield, the highest month in the quarter was September indicating continued momentum in this area. This has been a focus area for us and we've made good progress in 2019 with year-to-date MSW yield of 3.6% compared to 2.2% for the full-year 2018. This step change increase in pricing helps to overcome rising operating costs and generate appropriate returns on our high quality capital intensive post collection assets. We saw commercial volume growth of 3.2% for the quarter and continued MSW volume growth of 1.9%. We also continue to see service increases outpace service decreases in the third quarter and net new business remained positive, all evidence of a healthy consumer economy. We've heard from some of our industrial customers that they lack visibility to commit to some event work, however, special waste volume growth of 4% in the third quarter is still healthy growth, especially given the tough comparisons from last year. C&D volume growth of 13.6% was largely driven by fire cleanup activities in California, which wrapped up in August. Looking at the recycling business, our blended average commodity price in the third quarter was just under $40 per ton, a decline of 40% compared to last year and further 8% decline from the 10-year low reached in the second quarter, which led to an $86 million decline in our recycling revenue. Despite this precipitous drop, the steps we're taking to improve the recycling business held year-over-year decline to operating EBITDA to $7 million and EPS decline to about $0.01. In past years, an $86 million decline in revenue would have represented about an $0.08 to $0.10 decline in EPS. Mitigating this larger impact demonstrates the success we're having in restructuring contracts and assessing fees for contamination. Given our outlook for continued depressed prices in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect that full-year results for recycling will be a $0.01 to $0.02 EPS headwind in 2019 compared to 2018. Turning to operating expenses, in the third quarter, total operating costs as a percentage of revenue were 61.5%, a 50-basis point improvement over last year's adjusted results, as our operations continue to improve their efficiency and manage their spending as volumes increase. We are pleased with the improvements that we're seeing in operating costs, particularly with the strong volume growth that we're experiencing. We've been able to manage our labor costs through improved efficiency, and in areas where we have implemented our maintenance service delivery optimization program, metrics are improving. While we are seeing increases in the costs to serve our customers, we are focused both on managing these costs and recovering increases through pricing opportunities. Through the first nine months of the year, our operations have performed well and we expect that they will continue that momentum through the rest of the year and into 2020. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail. A - Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As Jim and John discussed, the strong performance in our collection and disposal business again translated into solid operating EBITDA growth. As we have seen all year, strong operating EBITDA growth combined with our disciplined focus on improving working capital have produced robust cash from operations. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations grew about 9% to $952 million. Year-to-date, cash from operations as a percentage of revenue has improved 60 basis points to 24.6%. The strong cash flow from operations growth we have seen all year has positioned us to proactively increase our capital expenditures from planned level. During the third quarter, we spent $483 million on capital expenditures, compared to $404 million in the third quarter of 2018. In 2019, we are benefiting from lower cash taxes for three reasons. First, our recently closed investment in low-income housing properties and resulting federal credits. Second, benefits related to financing activities we completed last quarter. And third, additional benefits resulting from the filing of our federal income tax return. We are very intentionally investing these cash tax savings in our landfills, fleet and recycling business. We accelerated capital spending in the first nine months of the year to position our landfills to respond to the higher-than-anticipated volume growth we have been seeing. We also made deliberate investments in our fleet, bringing the percentage of garbage trucks running on natural gas to about 60% and increasing the number of automated side-loaders in the fleet by about 9%. In addition, as we completed design and construction of our MRF of the future, we've invested capital in a facility that we think will become the gold standard for sorting and processing technology. As a result of these intentional capital investments, we now expect full-year capital expenditures to be above our guidance of $1.75 billion. As Jim mentioned, we've invested in our renewable energy business to close the loop between our landfill gas and CNG fleet. Our capital expenditure guidance excluded the potential increase in renewable energy capital given the uncertain timing of the potential investments. Because pricing for RINs declined significantly in 2019, we didn't make as large as an investment as we might have otherwise. Full-year capital spending for renewable energy plants is expected to be between $35 million and $40 million for the year. Moving to free cash flow. Third quarter free cash flow was $478 million, and year-to-date, our business has generated $1.349 billion in free cash flow. Despite the elevated capital spending during the first nine months of the year, we expect to achieve full-year free cash flow of between $2.025 billion and $2.075 billion, as our rate of capital spending moderates and we realize much of the cash tax benefit that I mentioned earlier. In the third quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $218 million in dividends and for $76 million in solid waste tuck-in acquisitions. Year-to-date, our acquisitions excluding the pending acquisition of Advanced Disposal totals to more than $500 million. As we have previously discussed, given the pending acquisition of ADS, we have suspended our normal course share repurchases, other than to offset dilution from equity compensation plans. The share buybacks that we executed during the first half of the year were sufficient to offset dilution, and so we have not repurchased any additional shares since the end of our second quarter. There was a $0.02 impact to EPS in the first nine months of the year from our reduced level of share repurchases compared to guidance, and we expect to see some impact in the fourth quarter. These amounts are adjusted from our results. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 19.4%. The rate is lower than previously communicated due to tax credits generated from the recently closed low-income housing transaction and benefits resulting from the filing of our federal income tax return, which is typically recognized in the third quarter. We now expect our adjusted full-year 2019 tax rate to be about 22%. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was about 3.1 times at the end of the quarter. The sequential increase in this measure from the end of the second quarter is related to additional debt financing we executed in the quarter to position us to fund the ADS acquisition. While the measure is trending higher as we approach the closing of ADS, it is within our targeted levels. This is particularly impressive given that the measure does not yet have the benefit of ADS EBITDA. Our strong balance sheet continues to afford us the financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions at the right price. Turning to SG&A, for the third quarter, our SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue were 9.7%, an increase over 2018, primarily due to the planned investments we are making in technology. Year-to-date, SG&A as a percentage of revenue is 10.1%, on track to achieve our SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue guidance of about 10%. We're proud of the results we've generated in the first three quarters of the year as we are positioned to achieve our full-year goals. I want to thank all members of the Waste Management team. I know they are hard at work on continuing to deliver fantastic results in the fourth quarter and preparing for a great 2020. With that, Nora, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Just wanted to understand the gas credit headwind a little bit more, I think you called out, it's a $0.03 to $0.04 headwind for the full year. So I translate that back to about $17 million to $22 million of EBITDA, maybe if you can just kind of confirm that. And then I think you mentioned maybe $8 million of it was in 3Q. I think you said $18 million was maybe the year-to-date impact. So just wondering if you can kind of confirm that. And then should we be thinking about a similar impact to 2020 or will this kind of largely be contained to a 2019 issue? James Fish : Brian. Good morning. Look, we really didn't talk about it in the first quarter or the first six months really because it was $4 million. So it wasn't really worth discussion. You're right, it was $8 million in Q3, we expect it to be another $8 million and we're talking to EBITDA here in Q4. It's -- interestingly, it's something that we -- that's been part of our business for a long time, we've turned landfill gas energy for forever, mostly it's been in the form of electricity, we do have, just to give a little context here, 13 of these RNG plants that are owned by third parties and then we have three of our own, soon to be four, we're building a fourth. We don't have any additional plans to build further plants, but it strategically makes a lot of sense for us to do it because our fleet has gone from 40% CNG to 60% CNG in two years. Regarding your question about what the expectation is for this in 2020, I would tell you that the front half of the year may see some challenges just on a year-over-year comparative basis, but it's awfully hard to really say with any kind of definitiveness here because as you probably know these RINs credits are bit of a political football and they've been getting kicked around quite a bit this year. So here's what I would tell you, I think we are much closer to the bottom than we are to the top. I mean when we -- these plants have really good returns and then we started building them, we were kind of right in the middle of where RINs credits had been, somewhere in that high of $3 and we were kind of in that $1.85 at the beginning of this year. They dipped down to $0.50, maybe a little bit below $0.50 in August and then they've come back a bit to I think $0.8250 was the last number I saw. So they are very volatile and so it's a bit hard to say what next year looks like. If I had to guess, I would tell you it's going to be a little bit of a tough comparison in Q1 and Q2 and then it gets quite a bit easier in Q3 and Q4. We'll know more as we get to February and we'll give guidance on that. Hopefully, we're in a position where we don't have to talk about it anymore, because it becomes non-material, it's not really material even with $8 million, but it's just something we felt like it was worth calling out. Devina Rankin : I do want to clarify really quickly, because you did mention the $18 million that we referred to in Jim's prepared remarks and that was relative to our plan, where when he spoke to the $4 million that we experienced in the first half of the year, combined with that $8 million in Q3, that was relative to prior year. So relative to plan, we expect this to be a headwind in the neighborhood of $25 million to $30 million that\u2019s relative to prior year. That's more in that $17 million to $22 million range that you referenced. Brian Maguire : Okay, that's very clear. Makes sense. And just given all that, it's obviously impressive we're able to reiterate the guidance range for the year, but would it -- I know you don't give quarterly guidance per se, but just, would it be right to think about, we're now probably moving into the lower end of that range? James Fish : I think we're comfortable saying we're just going to be within the range. And we've looked at this 15 different ways and feel like it has -- we have the opportunity to finish in the middle of the range, we could finish in the low end and if things really went right, particularly with special waste, we could actually finish at the higher end of the range. So that's why we didn't change, where we were going to finish, we just felt like we were comfortable with the range that we had given originally. Brian Maguire : Okay, great. And just last one for me before I hand it off. Just comment on the industrial and special waste volumes selling down a little bit, I guess that makes sense given the macro news. Could you just kind of remind us your exposure there as a percentage of kind of overall volumes? And is there a potential for that to drive overall volume to a negative number next year at this point? Or are you still kind of thinking preliminarily that volume will be up a little bit next year? John Morris : So, Brian, this is John Morris. What I would tell you was as we've looked at quarter-over-quarter over the last handful years going backwards and we've had quarters that were negative and there were some that have been positive double-digit. And we think a 4% special waste volume in Q4 on tough comps, we still feel good about that performance. There are certainly some puts and takes there. We don't need to go in on a detail, but what I would tell you is our pipelines are still healthy, and as Jim and I both commented, there is a little bit of a lack of visibility with some of our industrial customers. But again, we feel confident about what our pipeline is and where our volumes are through nine months of the year. James Fish : Yes, I mean historically that 4% kind of -- It's a number that moves all over the page. I mean -- when you look back 12 quarters or 16 quarters, when we've had some, a couple of quarters that were as low as negative 3% and we've had a couple of quarters that were as high as 18%. So it's a number that bounces around a lot. But with 4%, as John said, pretty -- still pretty healthy, all things considered. Devina Rankin : And then one thing that I would point to on your point of relative contribution, as you look at collection revenue, our collection revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, industrial specifically was $766 million on the collection side and the part that we see variability in is a fraction of that closer to more than 10% to 20% of industrial on the collection line of business. Brian Maguire : Okay, that really helps, I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman, KeyBanc Capital. Q - Sean Eastman : Thanks team. I guess the first one, I just wanted to understand kind of this dynamic where with the CapEx come in higher than expected in 3Q, it does make sense that the strong volume growth needs to be matched with some capital investment, but given just kind of a lighter special waste visibility commentary alongside that, I'm wondering if -- I'm just wondering how things are shaping up relative to the kind of 2% volume trajectory that's built into the longer term target. Whether we're looking higher than that or below that at this point? Devina Rankin : Sure. So I think the best indicator of volume expectations versus where we actually ended up, we started the year expecting volume to be around 2% for the enterprise and instead we've through nine months produced 3.8% volume growth in collection and disposal, and in the current quarter, that was 2.7%. And so that really is the primary driver of the capital expenditure acceleration that you've seen in 2019, particularly in the landfill line of business. Landfill volumes are up in the current quarter 3.1% and 5.6% -- I'm sorry, 7.4% for the year-to-date period. So when we look at capital expenditures and what has driven our very proactive and intentional investments, it's been driven by the landfill line of business, where that volume growth has exceeded our expectations. Q - Sean Eastman : Okay, thanks. And I might have missed this, but I'm not sure I totally understand why recycling was worse than expected in 3Q just given that the underlying commodity basket seemed to have been fairly stable during the quarter. Just trying to understand the moving parts there. John Morris : I think, Sean, this is John Morris. I mean, the prices were down sequentially quarter-over-quarter by 40%, I think was $86 million of price-related revenue decline, and EBITDA, and that was only down $7 million. So we feel like that was a victory. We've done a lot to improve quality. Our residual percentage, as Jim mentioned in his comments, is down over 300 basis points is the combination of educating our customers and doing a better job in the plan of controlling -- control and quality. So we see that as a victory it was $86 million, and as I said in my comments, in the old model, that could have been $0.08 to $0.10 of a headwind, and instead, it was $0.01. So we view that as a positive. James Fish : When we started the year, Sean, I mean we were at kind of $65 on a weighted average commodity price basis and we thought we could expected to stay flat there because that was half of what it'd been the previous year. It obviously was not to stay flat. So in Q3, as John said, it was down again not only year-over-year, but sequentially was down to $38 which is, that's our weighted average number. So it's not a number you'd find anywhere, but still gone from $65 to $38 and showing really only $7 million of decline was we thought, as John said, a win for us in terms of our mitigation efforts. Q - Sean Eastman : Okay, thanks. I appreciate the responses, I'll turn it over. James Fish : Thanks. Operator : Another question from the line of Noah Kaye, Oppenheimer. Q - Noah Kaye : Thanks very much. Just to pick it up there, to manage the recycling headwind there, it does appear pretty impressive, especially considering, I think you lapped the implementation of the contamination fees this quarter. So I guess what I want to understand is, first, does the contamination fees cover all of your third-party contracted volumes or can you do more there? And then as you alluded to in your prepared remarks, how large of a lever do you see some of these technology investments and improving processing costs to improve EBITDA in the recycling line? James Fish : So I'll start with the last part first, Noah. I think when you look at some of the investments we're making in Chicago and we're making around the rest of the assets around robotics, I mean, we could see in Chicago, in particular we commented the operating cost, in particular, labor could come down as much as 40% and I think in terms of the first part of your question, I mean, yes, we have lapped the implementation of our battle against contamination and some of the other fees that we're assessing. But again, as evidenced by our results here in the third quarter, even though, commodity prices continue to decline, we've been really successful in our view at closing the gap to what otherwise would have been like I said earlier, $0.08 to $0.10 headwinds on an EPS level. Q - Noah Kaye : And so part of that improvement is that now that your contamination is lower, you're getting a higher quality bail, and so you're just getting more value on a relative basis, on what you're seeing coming into the MRFs. Is that a fair way to put it? John Morris : As I mentioned, we've done a nice job of holding kind of our gross operating cost per ton flat and we're improving residual, which means we have more -- have more efficiency going through the plant and it also speaks to the education process and that we're improving the quality coming in the front of the facility as well. Devina Rankin : I would add that while we have anniversaried the more significant steps to roll out the program, we are not at 100% run rate and so some of what you saw in the third quarter was continued execution on that plan and then applying it to more of our customer base. So there was some benefit, a step change in the benefit for the battle against contamination and fee-based program. Q - Noah Kaye : Okay. Maybe just to add one more question, you had a very tough comp this quarter on volume and you still got this volume growth, the comps get tougher next quarter, as you mentioned, you're lapping the California wildfire, a couple other special items, can you maybe just talk directionally, I know it's short term, but how we should think about the fourth quarter volume cadence? James Fish : Yes, I mean, when we look at our volume and we occasionally talk about what we're seeing in the current months, it looks -- it's very early in the current fourth quarter, but still looks reasonably good, looks similar to what we've seen in Q3, which is, as we said in our scripts, strong on those consumer-driven volumes which are commercial and MSW and then not as strong on the industrial side. I think the big story here is honestly in this report is less about volume because volume is reasonably consistent for us. It's less about volume, it's more about price and it's more about disposal pricing, I mean, you look at MSW and transfer station and that's an area that we've talked a lot about, and you guys have asked like questions which is okay, yes, so you guys talk about it, but when is it -- when are we going to see the results? I think three consecutive quarters now of MSW yield above 3% and growing right? I mean, MSW yield this quarter 3.7%, it was 3.6%, last quarter 3.4%, and then honestly, when I looked back trying to find a number that was above 3.7%, I could not find one for 10 years. I don't know how far back it goes before since we last had a 3.7% MSW yield, but I can tell you it wasn't after 2009. All the other books in my cabinet have been shredded, I think so. The 3.7% MSW yield is the big number really. The volume number there approaching -- it's kind of 1.9%, approaching 2%, there was a little bit of volume that we moved out to a third party. Some of that will come back to us. If you back to that in, we would have been around 2% in MSW volume, but again, the big news in this report is really about disposal pricing -- transfer station pricing was 3.3%, that's on top of 3.4% last quarter. And then if you, again, similar to MSW, you look back before that, there is not a number on the page in terms of transfer station yield that's approaching those numbers. So, I feel good about the volume. But what really gives me real cause for optimism going into 2020 is the fact that we seem to be getting our sea legs in terms of disposal pricing and that is a big, big change from where we've been over the last decade. Q - Noah Kaye : Yes. Much appreciated and I will leave my colleagues to follow up on the pricing front, but well done there. James Fish : All right, thanks. Operator : Another question from Michael Hoffman, Stifel. Michael Hoffman : So, you almost stole my thunder because I was going to say why are we focusing so much time on volume and let's talk about price. So can we talk about core price by line of business. You talk about that occasionally, industrial, commercial, residential, landfill. James Fish : Yes, I mean, look, I think core price and John can tack on here, core price was very strong. I think the core price number for commercial is 6.6% -- Devina Rankin : 5.7%. James Fish : 5.7%, okay. Devina Rankin : So commercial core price was 5.7%, industrial was approaching 10%, and residential, which we talked a lot about internally is 4.5% for the quarter, which is a really good indication of our efforts to continue to price that part of our business effectively, which has certainly been a challenge in the past because of the indexing to CPI that we often talk about, but so you see real traction in each of the collection lines of business to price above and beyond cost inflation. John Morris : And Michael, this is John. I would add one thing obviously we commented in the prepared remarks about what's happened with margin expansion in the collection and disposal business, but I would point you to the residential line when you see core price for the quarter at 4.5%, 4.6% year-to-date, and yield numbers in residential at 3.2% and 3.4% for the quarter and year-to-date. Those are numbers that we've been focused on. We've clearly had challenges moving that in the past, but when you talk about. I know we're going to get into prior question around CPI and the mix of how we're -- what rate mechanism we're using. To me, that's a real good bellwether of the progress we're making in residential in terms of changing that model. James Fish : Yes, I think -- I think, Michael, I mean I know you've still on time with John. John has a lot of things on his plate as Chief Operating Officer. But one thing that he has really focused on is residential and so he is -- should be credited for a lot of work well done on that residential line of business, which has been a tough line of business for us over the last five years or six years. And we're, again, when you look at price, I think you're right, yes, we can talk about volume all day long, but -- and volume is okay, it's fine, it's -- as we said, but prices is the news here and I didn't say anything about residential price. The boy -- he's right about that. That is a really good story for us on the residential pricing in addition to what we talked about on the disposal side. Michael Hoffman : Well, in your internal costs, some inflation is still running somewhere between 2.5 and 3 net of productivity. So there is -- there is proof of the operating leverage, and the one number you didn't give me is the landfill core price, but that's proofs of the operating leverage. Devina Rankin : Landfill core price was 4% in the quarter, transfer station, it was 3.1%, going to Jim's comments earlier about disposal pricing really being a bright spot for us in the quarter. Michael Hoffman : Right. And so, Jim you've talked about in the past 16 of the 20 largest MSAs big landfills, they're full every day, when you -- and you see volume going by and when you think about that book alone, what's the visibility on how many more years you could be doing this pretty well on the pricing at the disposal because there's volumes going by you that it allows you to keep pricing until you finally produce your own volume? James Fish : I think it will be well outside of my career, and I'm not prepared to say what my career is going to be here, but it will be -- look I -- we're excited about core price for landfill and that's 5.7% range and yields for MSW at 3.7% in the numbers we talked about. But I would tell you this, as you just said, we have great assets here and there is no reason to expect that  is not something where I look at it go, okay, yes good core price for three quarters, but this thing ends in Q2 of next year. No, I think this thing can go on for a long time driving, and by the way, it's not like we're, I'm not expecting to get calling from a Senate subcommittee anytime and be asked why are you drawing 15% on your landfills, it's 3.7% MSW. So it's not -- it's not obscene at all, it's just really going to recovering cost and hopefully adding a little bit of margin expansion. John Morris : If I would add one thing, Micheal, one thing that we all pay particular attention to, Jim mentioned it, I mentioned it, it's not just the landfills, it's the network and the performance of our transfer stations improving is also another indicator of how well that network is performing. Michael Hoffman : Well, it's an extension to the gate. So by definition, it ought to be in line. If it's not, then you're giving it away at one end and trying to make it up the other? John Morris : Exactly right, which is what we're not trying to do. Michael Hoffman : Yes, don't subsidize the competitor. So let's try and put volume to bed once. You all have a asset mix and geographic concentration that would lend itself to consistently producing a good volume number relative to a comparison, because of the nature of that mix. Do you want to sort of refresh us on that and why we got to remember that and then put it in the context of volume your asset mix is positioned to naturally capture what you should get and you're well positioned to do a little bit better than the average? Devina Rankin : Yes, I would say that what we can talk about and you've hit on it with the 16 of 20 largest MSAs having the best-placed assets in those markets. What that's about is being well placed in markets that we see growth. And so at Waste Management, we focus extensively on not just leveraging the best asset network in the business today, but thinking about how we will be positioned to leverage that asset network over the long term. And where, when you look at the North American economy, we see urbanization as a trend and one that is benefiting those well-placed assets. John Morris : Yes. One thing I would add to that Michael is that we talked a lot about the investment we're making in digital and the digital team has done a great job. And the reason we're doing this is to differentiate ourselves. So we obviously feel differentiated with our asset network, we wanted to add a second form of differentiation which is bringing a different digital approach to our customers, both internal and external customers. There would be couple of examples here. We rolled out on open market residential tool probably a year or so ago and now 40% of all of our new open market residential customers are going through that tool. It's been very well received. The feedback from our customer base has been excellent. We think that 40% number will eventually go to a much higher number in fact, it will -- in short order, I think it will be the majority, meaning over 50% of those customers that come in, will go directly through that new customer-facing digital application. The commercial tool, which rolled out only a couple of months ago, has certainly a much lower number than that 40%, but it is growing at a fast pace. In fact, the last number that I heard was that we -- that that number is tripling. So we think that in addition to having a really good, in fact, best-in-class network of assets, we are rightly spending dollars in the digital space to differentiate ourselves. So differentiation will not just be in terms of asset location, but it will be in terms of customer-facing technology. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Devina, on the capital spending, cash flow and all of that, can I wrap a ribbon around -- you said we would be higher than $1.75 billion, but you didn't say what that number should be for us to model for the remainder of the year. So what should we be thinking about full-year capital spending and can you do 24% of revenues, as cash flow from ops in the fourth quarter? Devina Rankin : Sure. So I'll take the capital spending piece first. And if you look at capital spending through nine months, we are at $1.532 billion. So rounding out the back part of the year, we think that will be around $1.8 billion. We've provided a range in our press release tables that shows $1.775 billion to $1.825 billion as kind of an indication of where we think we will end up. From a cash flow from operations perspective, that really is one of the best indicators of how we're performing and conversion of revenue to cash from ops is certainly a strength and we are up 60 basis points through nine months. I expect you'll see us finish strong, and right now, every indication is 24.6% would effectively, if we rounded out there, that's a 70-basis point improvement for the full year. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And to do that, you just have to do 24% in the fourth quarter, to just to be clear, I mean it doesn't have to improve from here. It just has to hold at the 24%? Devina Rankin : That's right. Michael Hoffman : Right. Okay. And then churn in the quarter. How was it compared to year-over-year and sequentially? Devina Rankin : Churn it was 9.8% in the quarter, that's a little higher than we've been both year-over-year and sequentially. That is driven by national accounts and losses that we were very intentional and disciplined about ensuring that we were pricing business that was renewing appropriately and we're satisfied that non-renewals on those contracts was the right decision for us because it didn't reflect pricing that was representative of our costs. John Morris : I would say -- year-to-date, that number is better by about 20 basis points, Michael. Michael Hoffman : Okay, perfect. All right, thank you so much. James Fish : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Neville, Scotiabank. Mark Neville : Maybe if I can just ask pricing sort of another way, you're obviously seeing very good pricing sort of across the network, but perhaps maybe Industrials, maybe you're not seeing it, but maybe it's slowing a bit, maybe something that the macro could be slowing, but you're doing -- making investments in the business. So I'm just curious when you look at 2020, I mean you've got good visibility, but I'm just curious if the bias you think is higher or lower from 2018 or 2019 -- sorry? James Fish : And you're talking about specifically around industrial -- the industrial side of business with respect to pricing, is that right Mark? Mark Neville : Yes, industrial -- the other parts of the business as well. industrial and consolidated. James Fish : So let's tackle industrial first. I mean, core price of industrial was really strong, I mean, almost 10%, 9.9%, and that translated into strong yield as well of 3.8%. So that's for that line of business specifically and then volume in industrial was maybe a little bit weaker than we might have expected. It was 1.2%. That's not -- it's not anything to be here's a concern about, but it certainly is not off the charts, I mean if you look back historically at industrial volume, and by the way, that industrial we think of as roll off, I mean it's called industrial, it's a little bit misleading, because that's not necessarily all industrial type customers. It's the roll-off line of business, with 1.2% volume, there was nothing to write home about but not anything super concerning, it was on top of sequentially 1.2% last quarter, 3.1%, 0.09%. So it's not on track with where we've been for the last three quarters or four quarters in terms of volume, but again, the price side has been what's the big news for us and it's almost every line of business, whether it's commercial, and if I walk you down the core price numbers, they are impressive, 5.7%, for commercial, 9.9%, for industrial, 4.5%, and we've talked about all these numbers today. So, all of them show that we still have a really good pricing power. A lot of it is in the differentiation that we talked about whether it is in our asset network or whether it's in the digital or whether it's on the focus on the customer. I mean, it's the third thing that we -- that we really are doing differently from two years or three years ago where we're really, really over-focused on the customers. So I would tell you that -- that's the health of the business is, as we said, still very good. And what we hear every day in the news is that the consumer economy is 70% of the overall, it's probably a like percentage for us. So 70% of our overall business feels really good from both a price and volume standpoint, the other 30% feels still very good. But just a bit of a wait and see mode in some cases with respect to this event type work. Hopefully that answers your question. Mark Neville : Yes. That's helpful. Maybe on the recycling, just want to understand the guide. I believe it's sort of consistent with what you said Q2. So it's not incrementally the $0.01, $0.02, so that would suggest, I guess Q4 the headwind is about $0.03 year-over-year, if I'm interpreting that correctly? Devina Rankin : So yes, the benefit in the first half of the year was $17 million, and in Q3, It was a negative $7 million, so that implies that we think we've got about $0.02 worth of exposure in the back half, $0.02 to $0.03 effectively to get you to the full-year guide of #0.01 to $0.02. Mark Neville : All right. And I guess, similar to the RIN discussions, first half of next year is tough comps. So, a bit of an impact first half next year as well? Devina Rankin : That's exactly right. James Fish : Yes. It's hard -- it's too hard to predict that. I mean, I mean -- it literally is -- it's gone from $0.50 to $0.82 in period of two months. So that kind of is the mirror effect from the first six months where we were -- we took a big slide. So to the extent that this continues to get knocked around politically, then we don't expect much, but we do expect that there probably will be some resolution on this either as we approach or after the election. So yes, I would say it's probably safe to say on RIN pricing that the first two quarters are going to be a difficult comparison, and then it gets much easier as we get into the back half of 2020. Mark Neville : All right. Maybe just one last one then, so on the Advanced acquisition, is there any sort of milestones or anything we can be looking at for the next few months sort of ahead of the Q1? John Morris : Yes, Mark, this is John Morris. I mean honestly similar to comments in the last quarter, I mean we continue to work down the path with the regulators and we remain on track and feel good about our timing for Q1 of 2020. There is nothing that we've seen to-date that would cause us to amend that timeline, but I know we still feel good about the track line for Q1. I think in terms of your asking about a milestone, really the next significant milestone is to get -- is to clear HSR and that's what we're working toward right now. Mark Neville : Got it. All right, thank you very much. John Morris : Thank you. Operator : Another question from the line of Derek Spronck, RBC. Derek Spronck : Thank you for taking my questions. Just quickly on the coal ash, any updates on the coal ash opportunity and any changes in the EPA regulation there? James Fish : Look. I would tell you that this is something we've talked about in the past. It looks like a great opportunity for us. We've got several -- John talked about our special waste pipeline and that is included in our special waste pipeline. I mean there is -- we've managed I think 33 [Ph] million tons of CCRs for our electric utility customers. And so I think -- but we see this as a big opportunity for us. We talked a couple of years ago that Duke Energy is being one of our customers, and I think that ramped up earlier this year, but we still -- I think we have, John, a couple of RPs [Ph] out there that, but I think we're still in a wait and see mode on and whether those are kind of get -- kind of fall in the same bucket as our other special waste type customers where they are in a wait and see mode, I don't know because some of those particularly by states are almost a requirements in terms of getting those ponds cleaned out. So I don't know that those are going to be as discretionary as some of our other special waste volume, but suffice it to say we feel like we're well positioned, whether it's beneficial reuse, whether it's management and disposal or just straight disposal at our landfills to take advantage of CCRs. John Morris : I think that's right. We offer a full suite of services for those customers. And that's certainly why we've been able to gain some of the traction we have to-date. Derek Spronck : Okay, that's great. Just moving on to the cost side, I mean we've seen tight labor markets. We've also seen some unionized disruptions at some of the peer firms there. What is the labor inflation looking like? And are you comfortable with the overall ability to attract employees into the firm? John Morris : Sure, Derek, this is John. A couple of answers here. One, we've talked a lot about turnover and the impact that that's had on the operation and our efforts around furthering our people first efforts. The good news is we are starting to see some turnover moderate. Wage inflation is still higher than the average for overall inflation. But the good news is, we're starting to see a little bit of moderation there. I wouldn't say it's not gone down significantly, but it's flattening out and starting to regress in certain markets, which we're encouraged by. The fact that we're not turning over as many people obviously helps as well. I think on the collective bargaining front, thankfully, I mean we don't want to see any disruption in the industry, thankfully for us, we're not in the middle of any of those issues right now. James Fish : I would say one other thing, because this is such an important topic to now, when we think about people, I mean I've talked a lot about it and it is the -- really the core tenet of my kind of CEO-ship, if you will. So we set out three years ago to really change the culture here, we hired Tamla Oates-Forney about a year ago, maybe a little less, as a true world-class leader in HR. She is -- has been running hard in the last 10 months or 11 months really changing, helping me change the culture and helping us transform this, and we -- and she's doing some really innovative things along with her team. So we're super excited about the people side of our business, and while that doesn't necessarily show results on a kind of a quarter basis, it will absolutely show results as we get out into 2020 and 2021 and beyond. Derek Spronck : Okay. And just as quickly quantitatively, could we -- did this 10% SG&A costs as a percent of revenue, does that sound about right? Devina Rankin : Certainly for 2019. It's too early for us to look too far out because we're making those intentional investments both in people, as Jim just commented on, but also in technology, and so not specifically speaking to 2020 at this point, because it's too early for us to give that kind of guidance. So for 2019, we're confirming we expect to hit 10% of -- about 10% of revenue for the year and with commodity price pressure in the current year, that's certainly a little more challenging than we thought it would be when we started the year, but we're certainly happy with the cost control side of the equation. Derek Spronck : Okay, thanks for the time. I'll turn it over. James Fish : Thanks Derek. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Recycling, but I just had a follow-up there. You had mentioned in your remarks about the fact that you've been going back to customers and trying to restructure your contracts with them. Can you give us some sort of order of magnitude what percentage of those contracts you might be restructuring and where you are along on that base? Thanks. James Fish : Yes, I think the -- a big chunk of the volume that we're addressing through those contracts is franchise and municipal contracts, Jeff, where I think by the end of the year, we should be 55% to 60% through those contracts. I will tell you though what's important to note though more broadly when you talk about Q3's recycling results of $86 million decline and $7 million of EBITDA, as commodity prices have continued to move, we continue to address the relationship between us and the customers, but specifically to your question, we're about -- we're probably about halfway through most of those franchise and municipal contracts, and as we spoke about in quarters before, those contracts generally run three years to five years, some a little bit longer, some a little bit less. So it does take some time to work our way through those. Jeff Silber : Okay. I appreciate the color. And I know you're not giving 2020 guidance. But just for our modeling purposes, what should we be using for tax rate next year and also for capital expenditures? Are you going to be within that 9.5% to 10.5% of revenues that you gave your long-term guidance or high end, low end of that, any color would be great. Thanks. Devina Rankin : Sure. On the tax rate side, this year, we expected to be at 24% and we're finishing the year at about 22%, 1 percentage points of that has to do with the incremental low-income housing tax credit investment that we made. We do have some like amounts that are rolling off in the year ahead. So I would tell you that we expect next year to be in that 23.5% to 24.5% range. I can't put a fine point on it at this point. But with regards to capital spending, for us, as I mentioned, landfill volume has been the driver of the current year. And while we aren't specifically pointing to expectations for landfill volume in the year ahead, when we look at MSW volumes as a really good indicator of that kind of long-term growth expectation, MSW volumes for the year are at 4.6%. And so while 9.5% to 10.5% would typically reflect our expectations for more like a 2% growth in volume, if we continue to see elevated landfill volumes above that long-term range of 2%, 2.5%, we'll have to consider whether or not 9.5% to 10.5% is representative of what's needed to support the business. James Fish : I think the good news Devina is in the collection and disposal business, even though the CapEx is no little more intense [indiscernible] we made everybody commented that earlier on. Jeff Silber : Okay, thanks so much for the additional color. Appreciate it. James Fish : Thank you. Operator : Another question from the line of Tyler Brown, Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Good morning. James Fish : Good morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey Devina. I just want to talk cash taxes real quick, you noted cash taxes are going to be better this year. Wondering if you could give us what the cash tax as a percentage of the books will roughly be this year and how do we think about that next year? Will it creep up? Devina Rankin : So through nine months, we're at about 73%. I think that we'll finish the year close to the 70%. It will be in that range, 70% to 75%, which is about where we expected when we started the year. So in spite of having a $75 million headwind at the beginning of the year on a year-over-year basis in cash taxes, given some of those benefits I mentioned, we think we'll be able to moderate toward the low end of that range. In the year ahead, we do expect cash taxes as a percentage of book to increase. I don't specifically note to what level at this point. Tyler Brown : Okay. So a modest headwind. Okay, that's helpful. And then, Jim, just obviously the 3.7% on MSW yield is really positive. But I'm curious, is it being driven by a specific geography or maybe even a few specific landfills or are we talking just really broad-based pricing? James Fish : I don't think -- pricing, -- I don't think it's driven necessarily by geography, volume, maybe, I mean the volume has been a bit stronger in the South there as you might expect like Florida, Texas, California, but the pricing. I think it's -- it's pretty universal. I think we've done a good job across all of our disposal assets in terms of getting strong price. Tyler Brown : Okay, that's great. And then just my last one. And John, I hope you can follow me here, but if I was to break your recycling business maybe into two buckets, so basically where you own a MRF and you've got a third-party tipping and then maybe where you're hauling and tipping either at your own or another person's MRF, so maybe think about it those two ways. So basically, is it the situation that when you're taking in third-party volume into your own MRF, are you guys fully earning an adequate return on that line, and really the pain is in recycling, where you sit in an old contract where you're picking up and hauling and taking it either internally or elsewhere. Is that the right way to think about it? John Morris : Here's the way I would answer that Tyler is, is there are certain aspects of this recycling issue that have been easier to address. Certainly, the open market commercial customers would be ones that we kind of refer to that as Phase II, Phase I is more about recycling material coming into our MRF where it does get more challenging is where we're taking recycling material to a third party, or where we're to use your phrase stuck in a contract that -- that's what we kind of refer to as Phase III in our plan and to an earlier question, we're about halfway through that process, but that is more of a pain point than the first two areas that I referenced. Tyler Brown : Okay. So when you -- John Morris : Are you talking about the -- are you talking about basically the processing of our own material at our plants versus third party, is that what you're kind of asking? Tyler Brown : Yes, I mean, basically, it seems with the processing fees, it's easier if it's coming in from a third party, that's more addressable quickly and believe me, I know all about you're open market because you guys hauled for me and I'm in a resi subscription model and you've changed my bill. So it's -- I see it getting addressed there, but it's right -- [Speech Overlap] Thank you. No but my question is, is it in those where you're in a muni contract, then maybe you can't readdress at the moment and you're bringing it into a third party, or you're bringing it even into your own where you're really feeling the pain and so John when you talk about 50% to 60% or is it that -- is that the entire book or is it just that third phase that you're talking about? John Morris : It's just third phase Tyler but in your point you've bifurcated that one other time, I mean between we have those contracts we're processing or picking up and processing ourselves. And then we have contracts we're picking up and for whatever the reason we're having somebody else process that. But that is the third phase and that is the one that's obviously got a longer tail on it in terms of working our way through all the contract terms. Devina Rankin : And to your point about returns. I think what's really important there is it's not just the MRF itself that we're looking for the return on. We're looking at the investment that we make in the truck and the driver in order to provide that. And so it's ensuring that we address that part of the business for the long-term returns and viability of recycling overall to get return is not just on the MRF but on the collection assets as well. Tyler Brown : Okay, thank you. Thank you for indulging me. I appreciate it. James Fish : Thanks Tyler. Operator : And the last -- next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger, Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. I know we're coming up on the hour or past it, just I know you mentioned Jim, I think, California, you said it's wrapped up in August, can you just help us on the wildfires and the cleanup in the first nine months, is that -- is that close to like a $0.10 EPS benefit. I'm just trying to gauge how much that helped the last nine months? James Fish : I don't have the year number that -- the quarter number was a $9 million impact on EBIT and $10.7 million impact on revenues. Devina Rankin : So from an EBITDA perspective, it was ballpark $40 million for the year. John Morris : I think what's important there. Michael, this is John, it's -- we've called out the wildfires for sure really unfortunate circumstances that we are obviously helping those folks cleanup, but we kind of look at that, we've commented before, we have kind of those puts and takes in the business, it seems like every year in different geographies. So, it's easy to strip out California, but in fairness, we could go back and look at year-to-date '18 and Q3 in '18, there are some puts and takes there as well. So it is a little bit, it's hard to just say hey, we're going to strip out California from the math but not look at the past year, but as we commented, we really haven't adjusted a lot of that because we look at that is kind of the way the business runs year in and year out. And that's been a historical experience we've had. Devina Rankin : Well, and to John's point on year in, year out. I do think it's worth commenting that the wildfire impacts did start in 2018 and our fourth quarter of 2018 had about $12 million of wildfire impacts in it. So when you think about the comps that we have in Q4, that's one of the items that we have our eye on. Michael Feniger : That's helpful. And then can you just, if, can you remind us how much is, do you, how much is CPI, and obviously this year CPI has trended lower. So I know this is more of a mechanical question, I guess, how does that impact the pricing, how do we think about that in the second half of '20? James Fish : I think CPI was I think was 1.9% for the year and we, our, the economies that we use was projecting kind of about that maybe 2% or 2.1% for next year. So if you look at it very tightly, it could be 10 basis points of help next year, but we're not really, I think we'll probably bake in flat with CPI when we finalize our plan. Michael Feniger : Fair enough. And then just, just on my last one, just on recycling. I mean obviously that's been asked a lot. I'm just curious if we just take the price of your basket right now as of today and I know there's a lot of moving parts. Just -- just run rate it so we can just clear the deck here like what would the EBITDA and EPS impact be for 2020 given where the basket is right now, if we just run rate it? Devina Rankin : So I think that the easiest way to think about that Michael is if you look at, as I mentioned earlier, Q1 and Q2 of this year was a $17 million year-over-year benefit and Q3 was a $7 million hit and so if you think about where prices were at the beginning of the year, as Jim mentioned, that kind of that $70, $65 range versus where they are today, I think that's the biggest driver to that variability that I mentioned. So I think you can think of it in terms of aggregating the $17 million as risk and effectively then levelizing the back half of the year. So I would say it's about $20 million of downside running that into the first half of 2020. Michael Feniger : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Okay. It seems there are no further questions over the phone. You may proceed. Thank you. James Fish : Okay, thanks. Just wanted to do a quick recap here, because we're really proud of the numbers that in an economy that don't know what it is but I've heard it could be as low as 1.5% GDP for the quarter, maybe 2%. Just to kind of recap some numbers, we talked about 9% cash from operations growth, almost 8% collection and disposal EBITDA growth, revenue growth, top line of 3.8%, that includes an $86 million headwind from recycling on the revenue side, and then overall EBITDA growth of 3.1% and then all the price stuff that we talked about and here's where I want to give the credit for this. We got 45,000 employees out there that work really, really hard every day, since said that if you're an investor, you should own a trash company and [indiscernible], I could not agree more with that and I think the big reason for that is that no one in this industry works harder than the employees at Waste Management and I would tell you that, look, as an industry, not just at Waste Management, as an industry, this is such a hard working industry, it makes me proud to be here. So with that, I would tell you that [indiscernible] need to work harder than I, but thank you very much for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Mr. Ed Egl, Director of Investor Relations. Sir please go ahead. Ed Egl : Thank you Jay. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You'll hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover high-level financials and provide a strategic update; John will cover an operating overview; and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release as and available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K the press release and the schedules of the press release include important information. During the call you will hear forward-looking statements which are based on current expectations projections or opinions about future periods. We'll also be providing our outlook for 2020. This outlook does not include the impact of our planned acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services Inc. which we may also refer to as ADS. Once we complete this acquisition we plan to provide an updated outlook. All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC including our most recent Form 10-K. Jim and John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume which unless otherwise stated are more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume. In addition beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we updated our calculation of core price. With advancements in technology we collect additional transactional customer-level data which provides us improved clarity of the impact of our pricing activities. While this does not change the year-over-year core price performance results the new measure reflects a more precise calculation in evaluation of our revenue change. Please refer to the press release tables where we have provided two years of quarterly core price data using the new methodology. During the call Jim and Devina will discuss our earnings per diluted share which they may refer to as EPS or earnings per share and it'll also address operating EBITDA which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons unless otherwise stated will be with the fourth quarter of 2018. Net income EPS operating EBITDA margin operating expense and SG&A expense results have been adjusted and projected 2020 measures are anticipated to be adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations including costs incurred in connection with the pending acquisition of ADS. In prior quarters the adjustment for ADS included the reduction of common stock repurchases from planned levels. We are no longer adjusting for this. These adjusted measures in addition to free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release and tables which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections. This call is being recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning approximately one p.m. Eastern Time today until five p.m. Eastern Time on February 27. To hear a replay of the call over the Internet access the Waste Management website at www.wm.com. To hear a telephone replay of the call dial (855) 859-256 and at a reservation code 9977058. Time-sensitive information provided during today's call which is occurring on February 13 2020 may no longer be accurate at the time of a replay. Any redistribution retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO Jim Fish. James Fish : Thanks Ed and thank you all for joining us this morning. We're proud of how Waste Management performed in 2019. We continued our focus on optimizing our traditional solid waste business developing our people and investing in technology to better serve our customers and we're confident these are the right focus points to deliver long-term growth for the company. The results are evident in our full year top line growth which was 3.6% despite a negative $318 million drag from commodity prices in our recycling line of business and a negative $23 million swing from the sale of renewable energy credits. Landfill pricing was one of the bright spots in 2019 and is also a great example of what the Waste Management organization can achieve when we have a shared focus. Together the team achieved our best ever full year landfill MSW pricing in 2019 as we exceeded 3% MSW yield in every quarter with each quarter surpassing the previous one culminating in fourth quarter MSW yield of 4.5%. We expect to continue to drive improved MSW pricing for the foreseeable future as our price increases keep pace with the increasing costs at our landfills, but we won't just focus on MSW pricing. We're pricing all our lines of business to ensure that we generate appropriate returns on invested capital including our recycling and residential lines of business. John will share more about our 2020 plans for those two areas. The strong revenue growth that we generated in 2019 translated into robust operating EBITDA. Our collection and disposal business saw operating EBITDA grow by 8.5% and operating EBITDA margin expanded by 70 basis points both of which were better than we expected when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year. In 2019 our overall operating EBITDA grew by 4% despite lower-than-expected market prices for recycled commodities and renewable energy credits. We also produced $4.40 of EPS in 2019. We're forecasting another record year in operating EBITDA in 2020 with growth of 5.2% at the midpoint of our guidance range. We expect to achieve this growth from continued strong performance in our collection and disposal business through a combination of price volume and cost controls. Last quarter I spoke of the lack of visibility in our special waste pipeline as we were seeing hesitation from some industrial customers in committing to event work. I'm pleased to report that we're seeing more companies commit to event work so far in the first quarter and concerns of a recession around the industrial economy have mostly abated. We've been awarded a large coal combustion residual remediation projects starting this spring. With our well-positioned asset network and expertise we have developed a strong reputation in managing all aspects of these clean closure projects. We expect that our differentiated service offerings will result in additional jobs throughout this year. Turning to free cash flow. We've said operating EBITDA is the best reflection of the health of our business and provides the foundation for generating free cash flow. 2019 was no exception as our robust operating EBITDA once again translated into exceptional free cash flow. We allocated more than $1.1 billion of that free cash flow to shareholder returns growing our dividend for the 16th consecutive year. We also spent $527 million on acquisitions an indicator of the active M&A environment we're in and our ability to complete transactions at targeted returns. Devina will discuss capital allocation in the year ahead but suffice it to say that we expect to continue to reward our shareholders in 2020 by allocating a substantial portion of our free cash flow back to shareholders. On the M&A front obviously closing the Advanced Disposal acquisition is expected to be the highlight for the year. We are expected we are excited as we near the close of this transaction and we have great confidence in the potential of the combined organization. We anticipate that we will obtain antitrust regulatory approval by the end of March and close soon thereafter. We've received a high level of interest from other companies in acquiring any potential businesses we might be required to divest and we expect to complete the sale of any required divestitures shortly after the closure of our purchase of ADS. Our integration team has been working hard preparing for this close and the team is positioned to move quickly to integrate ADS operations and to achieve our targeted synergies. Overall the lead story at Waste Management and within the industry as a whole is one of consistency and predictability of earnings and cash flows resulting in excellent returns to shareholders. Devina will go through our guidance in detail but we expect that consistency to continue into 2020 where we see a highly efficient customer and employee-centric core engine driving a continuation of what we've seen for the past three to four years. When you look at our annual financial results from 2017 to 2019 and now through our guidance for 2020 you'll see revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range EBITDA growth in the 4% to 5.25% range and cash from operations less CapEx in the 5% to 12% range all within the bands that we've communicated over the past three years. The amazing part about our results is that we have had some challenges in parts of our business like recycling and renewable energy sales yet the core business continues to churn out earnings and cash at a strong pace. This industry and this company in particular have been a model of strong predictable results. With a very strong consumer segment of the economy and what appears to be a recovering industrial segment so far in the new year we are confident that this rock-solid trend will continue. Lastly I want to thank all of our hard-working team members who continue to make Waste Management both a great place to work and a fantastic long-term investment for our shareholders. With that I'll turn the call over to John and Devina to discuss our results and our 2020 guidance in more detail. John Morris : Thanks Jim and good morning everyone. We had a strong finish to 2019 and are pleased with our full year performance. Our disciplined pricing programs are delivering great results which is best demonstrated by our 2019 MSW yield of 3.8% which is 160 basis point improvement over 2018. We will continue to price our well-positioned landfills to generate an appropriate return on invested capital in a rising cost environment. More broadly in the collection and disposal business we achieved 2019 yield of 2.8% the highest yield that we've seen in a decade. As we look ahead to 2020 you will see our continued focus on pricing to overcome cost headwinds and to keep generating appropriate returns on invested capital. What's impressive about these pricing results is that we were able to achieve this without compromising our volume results. We achieved 2.3% volume growth in 2019 which outpaced growth in the broader economy. However as we expected some but not all volume growth moderated in the fourth quarter both as a result of difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2018 and the timing of special waste jobs. The good news in 2020 is shaping up to be another solid year for volume. As Jim mentioned coal combustion residuals should be a benefit for us in 2020 as we've already been awarded a job to start in April and there are additional jobs in the pipeline. The strong consumer economy and special waste pipeline combined with the positive trend in service increases exceeding service decreases gives us confidence that we'll have another good [indiscernible] in 2020. We plan to build upon our success in 2019 continuing to execute on our focused differentiation and continuous improvement strategies in the year ahead. The team is focused on opportunities to continue to improve and optimize our collection and disposal businesses. We plan to improve ROIC in our residential line of business and improve our overall operating costs with M 100 focused on labor technology helping to improve routing and maintenance service delivery optimization focused on repair and maintenance costs. In our residential line of business we have several initiatives underway aimed at improving profitability. This begins with the way we bid on municipal contracts. Waste Management has led the industry on return on invested capital and we're bringing in even greater attention to this metric in 2020. We're taking a hard look at each residential contract as it comes up for renewal and making sure that our bid prices and terms of service are keeping pace with cost inflation over time and changing recycling dynamics. We're also leveraging the data we continue to aggregate via our onboard technology to improve routing and the efficiency of our drivers with results in improved service and reduce costs. We expect to see similar results in the residential business that we achieved in the commercial line of business with these tools. More broadly in the collection business we're improving efficiency and capturing savings through several efforts. First M100 or managing 100% of our drivers' day allows us visibility into our drivers' routes in real-time to coach for improved efficiency and an enhanced view of customer profitability. At our Investor Day last year we said that a 1% increase in collection labor efficiency yields $25 million in savings and that we expect $75 million of total savings from M 100 by 2021. We expect to capture the next $25 million of savings from M 100 in 2020. The other effort that will benefit our collection line of business is our maintenance service delivery optimization or MSDO. We expect to continue to lower maintenance cost as we did in the second half of 2019. This leads to improved operational performance by bringing increased standardization to our fleet as well as improved maintenance processes. These are just a few examples of the great work underway to further optimize our collection operations with the help of technology. Turning to recycling. Our recycling business performed well in light of further fourth quarter erosion in recycled commodity prices. Despite a 43% year-over-year decline in our blended average commodity price to about $37 our fourth quarter EPS contribution from recycling was only lower by $0.02. For the full year recycling commodity revenue declined $318 million yet the business generated operating EBITDA comparable to 2018 as we were able to offset virtually all of the impact of commodity decline with an increase in fees. Our recycling performance demonstrates the success we are having in restructuring and recycling contracts to a fee-for-service model. We will also continue to make strides on improving our business through the use of technology. At our Chicago more for the future we expect to be fully operational by the second quarter. This plan is designed to be capable of generating high-quality material with technology through positive and intelligent sorting to generate the end product our customers require. Looking towards 2020 given the expected lower commodity price levels in the current environment we expect a minimal impact on overall results from recycling with headwinds in the first half of the year. And finally I want to give an update on all the work we're doing to prepare for the integration of Advanced Disposal. As Jim mentioned we are approaching the close of the transaction and the start of the integration. We have developed detailed plans and are prepared to start integration as soon as we close. With the additional work that we have done since the third quarter we are confident that we will be able to achieve synergies in excess of the $100 million we laid out when we announced the acquisition. We look forward to officially welcome the ADS team into the WM family. And with that I'll turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our financial results and 2020 outlook. Devina Rankin : Thanks John and good morning. Our 2019 performance showcased the strong conversion of operating EBITDA from our collection and disposal businesses to cash and also our disciplined execution on managing working capital. In the fourth quarter our cash flow from operations exceeded $1 billion and grew more than 12% and full year cash flow from operations was almost $3.9 billion representing growth of almost 9%. As I mentioned earlier in 2019 with our robust collection and disposal volume growth we plan to increase capital expenditures for the year above our initial guidance of $1.75 billion. With cash flow from operations growth that also exceeded our plan we knew we were well positioned to proactively increase our capital expenditures and still deliver on our free cash flow objective. During the fourth quarter we spent $286 million on capital expenditures; and for the full year we spent $1818000000. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $756 million and full year free cash flow was $2105000000. In 2019 the most significant contributor to our free cash flow growth was strong operating EBITDA. So we also realized benefits from working capital that we expect to reverse in 2020 and lower-than-expected cash taxes. In the fourth quarter we used our free cash flow to pay $218 million in dividends. For the full year we returned $1.12 billion to shareholders comprised of $876 million in dividends and $248 million in share repurchases. In 2019 our acquisitions totaled $527 million. Our SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue were 10.3% for the full year which was about 25 basis points higher than what we planned. This difference is largely due to litigation and incentive compensation costs that were higher than expected. We remain committed to a long-term target of SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 10%. In 2019 we were effective in managing our baseline costs while very intentionally investing in technology and our people. The investments we made in 2019 and will continue to make in 2020 support our customer and growth objectives as well as a number of the operational improvements that John discussed. Late in 2019 we determined it was prudent to make an investment in our foundational finance and human resources systems. These systems serve as a platform for almost everything we do and we have not upgraded this platform in almost 20 years. In the fourth quarter our team started this multiyear effort. You will notice that we adjusted for these costs in our press release and we will continue to adjust for the costs associated with this investment in the year ahead. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 16.3% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 20.2% for the full year. Our effective tax rate was lower in 2019 than we expected because we realized value from the fuel tax credits we made an incremental investment in low income housing and we recognize some favorable adjustments when we finalized our tax returns for the prior year. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was about 3.1x at the end of the year. While this measure is trending higher as we approach the ADS closing it is within our targeted levels and positions us well to continue to execute upon our long-term capital allocation priorities of growing the business and returning cash to our shareholders. Moving to our 2020 outlook. As a reminder our revenue earnings and cash flow guidance does not include the anticipated impact of acquiring ADS. However it is important to note that our free cash flow guidance does include an initial estimate of the incremental interest costs we will incur for the debt raised to fund the transaction. We plan to update the remaining components of our outlook including taxes and EPS following the close of the acquisition. On a standalone basis we expect 2020 operating EBITDA to increase to $4.56 billion to $4.66 billion growing by 5.2% at the midpoint fueled by continued strong organic revenue growth. To that end we expect core price of 4% or greater yield of about 2.5% in collection and disposal and total company volume growth of approximately 1.5%. We expect our strong earnings growth to drive free cash flow of between $2.15 billion and $2.25 billion. We project capital expenditures to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion in the year ahead which is a decrease in total spending from 2019 so at or above our long-term capital spend as a percentage of revenue target. We have seen our capital investments pay off and so we plan to continue to invest above our long-term average in 2020 with our focuses in the year ahead on landfills where volume growth is expected to remain strong and facility upgrades. We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that maximizes long-term value and total shareholder return by prioritizing organic and acquisition-related growth dividends and share repurchases. Given our focus on the integration of ADS we expect tuck-in acquisition spending in 2020 to be lower than what we have seen in the last few years and more in line with our historical target of $100 million to $200 million annually. We are pleased to be increasing our planned quarterly dividend rate for the 17th consecutive year as announced in December and expect our dividend payments to be about $920 million in 2020. Given this we currently project that excess free cash flow will be at least $1 billion in 2020. We have prudently slowed our share repurchase activity in anticipation of the Advanced Disposal acquisition. With those steps in our robust growth our balance sheet is strong and we are well positioned to restart our share buyback program. We plan to begin repurchasing shares in the first quarter and expect to allocate at least $1 billion to repurchasing our stock over the course of the year. In summary 2019 was a successful year for Waste Management and we can't thank the Waste Management team enough for all their hard work. 2020 is set up to be an outstanding year as we focus on execution both on the fundamental strength and growth of our business and on the ADS integration. With that Jay let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : First question just on the just some updated color on the ADS transaction. And initially there was some enthusiasm that might be done a little bit sooner since like it's maybe taking just a little bit longer. Just wondering if you could comment on how the conversations are going and the remedy package or divestment package what kind of reception you're getting in the market for that and whether you think that might go to one person or maybe now we're in a situation where we're going to be talking about multiple buyers for that? John Morris : So Brian what I would tell you is that we announced the deal on April 14. So we're just we're not even at a year market. And as Jim mentioned in his prepared comments we're on a trajectory we think to get clearance from DOJ right towards the end of the quarter. And obviously we're going to move to close quickly after that. In terms of the divestiture package what I can tell you is that we've had a really robust lineup of suitors kind of I said it's kind of like a line around the block of folks who are interested in these assets. So as we progressed with our conversations with the Justice Department we've obviously continued to move that process along at the same pace. Brian Maguire : Okay. And I just wanted to ask about your comments on the residential line of business. Jim and John I think you guys both talked about how that's a focus area for 2020. As some of these larger longer-term contracts come up for renewal I guess the volumes have been a little bit light in that part of the business. I'm wondering if you could just kind of comment on where you see margins in that business today versus where they've been historically and what actions you're thinking about taking in 2020 to try and improve those margins. James Fish : Sure Brian. I think first and foremost obviously the recycling business has had a kind of knock-on effect on residential. And in my comments here and we talk about that making sure that our pricing models keep up with what the cost inflation we're seeing in the residential line of business that we're getting the appropriate returns for the capital that we're deploying there. And I would tell you that it's obviously the lowest of the three collection lines. So when we look at where we're going to direct our investments we're going to look to move those margins up here over the next handful of years. Brian Maguire : Okay. And just last one for me. I apologize if I missed it but you just quantify the impact to EBITDA from the CNG or the fuel tax credit in 4Q and kind of what's embedded in the 2020 guidance for EBITDA? Devina Rankin : Sure. I'll cover both the EBITDA impact and the cash flow impact. So the fuel tax credit which was recognized as a reduction to operating expenses was about $70 million in the year and we project that it'll be a little below $40 million in the year ahead. From a cash flow perspective there were no cash flow benefits associated with that. That's one of the working capital headwinds that we that I mentioned for 2020 are actually it created a headwind in working capital for us this year because we recognize the earnings and we'll recognize the free cash flow benefits in the year ahead those free cash flow benefits for both what we recognized in the P&L this year and expect to recognize in the P&L next year are a total of about $90 million. Brian Maguire : Just the $70 million that was all in 4Q right because it just occurred late in the year right? Devina Rankin : That's right. Brian Maguire : Yes. James Fish : So Brian Jim here. Just to level set on EBITDA a little bit here. For Q4 and for 2019 we had quite a few puts and takes in Q4 that rolled into the final number. And by the way that's not that uncommon for the fourth quarter. But some of those puts and takes would have been in your estimates and several would not have been. So obviously the fuel tax credits that you just talked about on the positive side the RINs pricing recycling all of that would have been in your numbers we've talked about a lot of that. But we also had a material true-up of our 2021 LTI plan from stronger-than-expected total shareholder return on free cash flow and we had somewhat of a clearing of the decks of legal settlements. And the total of those two was almost $40 million for the quarter and that would not have been in your estimates. You wouldn't have known about that. It was included in our adjusted EBITDA. So we included those. So just wanted to level set that there are some things in Q4 moving parts that we tend to have in many Q4s but some of them were not in would not have been in your estimates you wouldn't have known about those and that amount was approaching $40 million. So the good news though is that really the underlying business which I talked about in my remarks the underlying business is super solid. It didn't waiver. It was strong last year and it's going to be strong in 2020. Operator : Next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Just focusing in on volumes down 40 basis points this quarter. It was a little bit lighter than I expected considering you guys are trending well above 2% for the year. Just curious what kind of causes inflection this quarter and if there's anything notable and then how it performed relative to your expectations going into the quarter? James Fish : Sure. Let me give you a little bit of color on Q4 and then some insight into volumes for early Q1 and for 2020 as a whole. First of all in Q4 our volume figure was indicative of a couple of things. First we knew we had the tough comps year-over-year due to the fire in Northern California and that will continue through the first half of 2020. Secondly there we had a onetime settlement with the City of Los Angeles contract in our numbers in Q4 of 2018 and that impacted volume or at least it impacted the comparability on a year-over-year basis. Without that in 2018 commercial would have been 2.1% positive instead of 1.5%. And then the third thing for Q4 that's worth mentioning is that we saw a $22 million decline in our renewable energy and Energy Services businesses and that hits the volume line. So that gives you some insight into Q4. Here's the positive on January 1. January has come out of the gates nicely. So even with tough comps largely from the anniversary of the New York City contract commercial volume was a healthy 3.6% roll off was positive 2.8% resi was down 1.3%. John's talked about that. I mean he and the ops teams are looking to fix the margins in that business. So it's not surprising that it's down a little bit. And then landfill and transfers tons were up 1% and 4.7% respectively. So that's January. And then looking past January as we will we talked about it but we've got that large coal combustion residual remediation project and we have a big national account both of those will start in early Q2. So even with the tough comps from the Northern California fires and New York City contract in the first half of the year we're very comfortable with the 1.5% volume growth for 2020 with some organic growth and by the way with the backdrop of what appears to be a pretty darn resilient overall economy. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Got it. That's very helpful. Next question just really on the guidance in terms of what assumptions are you making in terms of pricing and values for recycled commodity values and then also the RINs for the full year? John Morris : Yes. Kyle for recycling listen there's we finished the fourth quarter right around $37 per ton number on average and I think it was about $44 for the full year. There's been some talk of a little bit of uptick in the early part of the year on OCC. And frankly we don't have anything baked in terms of commodity uplift. What I will tell you though is in my prepared remarks what's more important is that even though the total revenue impact was over $300 million for the organization for the full year we're essentially flat. I think we're down about $2 million in EBITDA. So what we're really focused on is the commodity price is going to do what it's going to do but we're still working to make sure we continue to evolve the model to a fee-for-service model where we can generate the right returns on margins and we're moving in that direction. Devina Rankin : And on the RINs side we were effectively kind of flat to where we finished the back half of 2019 in terms of setting our guidance for 2020. We did not take into account the significant upswing that we saw in January but we do have our eye on that and think that there's some potential value that can be created there. On the recycling front I do think it's important to talk about the fee-for-service model. And while commodity prices as John mentioned we projected to be flat. We do expect to continue to move forward with executing on that fee-for-service model and see some incremental revenue from that plan in the year ahead. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Just a quickly follow-up. If we assume RINs pricing at the January levels sort of the increase what kind of benefit do you think that would have to EBITDA on an annualized basis? James Fish : So Kyle we've looked at I mean in the fourth quarter we saw about an $0.86 per unit number. And right now in 2020 we think it could be in the one 10 to one 20 range. But as you folks know that number has been all over the board and it's been a bit of a political football. But if it stays where it in that one 10 to one 20 range we are going to open our fourth RNG plant this year. There could be probably $10 million to $15 million of upside if those RINs hang in that range for the full year. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman of KeyBanc. Sean Eastman : I guess just from a high level I just wanted to kind of go back to the 5% to 7% EBITDA growth target you guys outlined at the Analyst Day last year. Obviously 2020 guidance came out toward the low end of that and I assume maybe part of that is maybe the tough comp on the California wildfire high-margin revenues but just hoping to get some comments on how you're thinking about that longer-term target and just kind of why we're at the lower end in 2020. James Fish : Yes. I think you've nailed it. I mean I think it is we do have tougher comps there with those wildfires. Those pretty much turned off last year at the very end of July. So we've got seven months of tough comps there. Obviously you can't predict whether there's something else that comes up throughout the year. If something else did happen whether it's a natural disaster or a big project that we don't anticipate then that would help to offset that. But for now we felt like 5.2% was a reasonable number within the previously communicated range of 5% to 7% as you say at the lower end of that but we still feel confident that we'll get there. And I think that's we do feel like we've got an economy that provides a pretty good support for hitting within that 5% to 7% range. I think when you see us get up towards 7% is when you'll start to see a couple of these headwinds that we've talked about for probably two years now really starting to kind of recover fully and that means recycling. That means some consistency in RIN pricing then you'll see us in the 7% possibly even exceeding 7%. But with just solid waste you're talking about a 5-plus percent number that's probably double the overall economy. It shows you how strong solid waste is. Sean Eastman : Yes. That's helpful. I guess the other interesting thing for me is that that 5% to 7% target kind of built a two by two price volume backdrop. And as we look at the 2020 outlook now it's a 2.5% price 1.5% volume which seems inherently more valuable to me. And I just wondered if that 2.5% 1.5% is more accurate in terms of what we should be seeing for WM over that targeted time frame that three-year time frame. James Fish : I think the 2.5% is probably a bit more reflective of what you might expect going forward. The 1.5% as we said earlier in your question here reflects the tough comps. So all things being equal in other words the economy not being a big headwind of any kind then I would expect that normally we'd be closer to that 2% number that we've historically given. But this year we have as we said the tough comp with the fires. Devina Rankin : There's also a tough comp with the New York City contract. And so the fires in the New York City contract together are about that 50 basis point differential. And so it's important to know that we've not backed off of the 2% long-term volume outlook. It's the 1.5% is reflective of that tough comparison. James Fish : Yes. It shouldn't be surprising to you that we're that we want to be a little bit conservative when we issue our guidance. I mean it's probably better to under-promise and over-deliver than the opposite. So I think we've got what we believe is very achievable guidance set for 2020. Sean Eastman : And I guess just a key takeaway here is that we're running at 2.5% whereas you guys had a longer-term outlook of 2% on the price which I think is probably pretty notable. Last question for me just trying to understand the SG&A line. I think you have this 10% SG&A margin target. I just wondered if that's a number we hit in 2020 and whether there's more opportunity to continue to move that down just around these technology investments starting to be more than offset by the savings and benefits from those investments. Devina Rankin : I think when you look at 2019 Jim's mentioned earlier about those two items that we're not planning for and certainly are not items that we expect to recur. Those two items if we adjust for those we would have delivered SG&A as a percentage of revenue up 10% in the year. And so we remain committed to that target over the long term. And what you see in addition to those two items are the impact of the ADS integration planning work that we're doing we did adjust for those and we'll continue to adjust for those in the year ahead and then my mention of our enterprise resource planning efforts that we started in the fourth quarter. So those two items will elevate the level of reported SG&A above 10%. But when we call those out and really focus on the fundamental investment in the organization from a technology perspective you're absolutely right things like investments in our call center technology where we should be able to serve our customer online rather than having them call into our call center to get information about their accounts or their service will drive a reduction in SG&A over the long term. But right now what we see is the incremental investment of that dollar into technology and our people is going to position us to want to continue to maintain SG&A as a percent of revenue at 10% rather than allow it to tick down because we think that those investments are worthwhile and great incremental value for the long term. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Brown : Jim or John big picture question but I want to come back to that 4.5% MSW yield print this quarter the 3.8% for the year which I felt like was if not the biggest one of the biggest stories of 2019. But it feels that there is real post collection pricing momentum. And if we believe that pricing at the curve emanates from the landfill why wouldn't we expect this new call it paradigm of landfill pricing really to set a stage for a prolonged positive pricing outlook on the collection side I would presume that over the long run core collection and core post collection pricing really should equal out? James Fish : Well look Tyler I think one does kind of get the other. But as we've talked about landfill pricing for probably a decade we've never really been able to establish any consistency there. And that's I think you're absolutely right. I think you pinpointed it and that is that it's one of the big stories for 2019 for us that we were able to as I said in my remarks get a strong MSW price number that is starting to approximate that cost structure that we've also talked about every quarter for the last two years. I mean we keep talking about how our cost structure is going up by 5% and MSW is going up by 1% and we're finally getting to a point where we're starting to close the gap there. And so that's a big deal for us. And we're starting to do it on a consistent basis. I think our customers understand that things like leachate costs which have been a topic of discussion for two years here that leachate costs are going up and they're going up really on a permanent basis that labor costs continue to go up. So this is a it's a very big story. It's a story that we've ultimately talked about for a long time but never really been able to nail down. And now we're finally able to say we feel like landfill pricing is really here to stay. John Morris : Tyler I would add to that. We are equally as focused on the transfer station pricing as well as part of the post collection network. You've heard us talk about pressure on subcontracting costs and whatnot. So when you look at it I in particular the team are working hard at what we're doing on the transfer side. We talked about residential. I mean if you look at our residential core price and yield it's going up. It's progressing. And we talked about volume there could be some volume pressure there. But I think it would deliver better margins and better returns when you walk all the way through the network. I think we're comfortable with that. James Fish : Well I think one last thing here Tyler. When we talk about it's a little bit of an add-on to what John said there. But when you talk about margin improvement you might say \"Well gosh I mean you're not even covering your cost increase there with your landfill. What are you so excited about?\" Look I mean I would tell you that 4.5% is better than 1%. So while we may not be covering that cost increase which is kind of pushing 5% of the landfills it still is going to add to our margins similarly on the resi line of business which is really the one collection line of business that's seen margin degradation over a period of five to 10 years falling I don't know John almost in half over a period of 10 years that that line of business will also start to affect overall margins even though we will not get back to where we were 10 years ago for quite some time. So while we're while a lot of this is really just cost recovery cost recovery it's cost recovery that we weren't doing in the past. So and we've got to get there now. And I think consistently we're starting to show that. Patrick Brown : So I hate to maybe nitpick just a touch. But in 2019 you posted collection and disposal yield of 2 8. Again we talked about accelerating post collection. So why are you guys looking for a deceleration of collection and disposal yield in 2020? Is that just conservatism? James Fish : Yes. I mean I think a little bit of that is conservatism. I mean it's we've said all along that we would be 2% price 2% volume. 2% was kind of the baseline. So I would tell you that 2.5% is if you want to think about it the way I just said it on the previous question it's kind of almost a new baseline for yield which is and instead of 2% maybe we call it 2.5%. We're not ready to call it two eight yet. Patrick Brown : And then Devina just a little bit I think implied in your guidance you're looking for maybe a 40 basis point improvement in EBITDA margins in 2020 if my math is correct. But I was hoping that you could maybe parse out some of the drivers there. So I mean wouldn't recycling and RINs the CNG tax credit be margin dilutive? So are you maybe implying that kind of the core margin expansion is actually maybe more say 60 to 80 basis points? Or is my math all messed up? Devina Rankin : No I think your math is good. On those items that you mentioned certainly we do think that there's some dilution to margin. Although at some point that kind of flattens out from a margin perspective because we're not projecting any meaningful growth in recycling or RINs in the year ahead. So the impact to margin should be relatively flat. But your point on fuel tax credit that definitely will be dilutive to margin in the year ahead. The outlook for collection and disposal continues to be that 50 to 100 basis points. So your 60 to 80 that you mentioned is right in that range. Jim John's mentioned of M100 the focus on MSDO for repair and maintenance and then one of the items that we've not mentioned yet today but I think really is driving some productivity from a margin perspective is our turnover. Our turnover improved about 150 basis points during the year and we think that we can continue to march forward on those goals and objectives with the focus on people for Waste Management. Patrick Brown : Okay. And then super quick modeling questions. Was the LTI true-up in legal and SG&A? Devina Rankin : That was in SG&A yes and it was about $40 million. Patrick Brown : Okay. Right. Okay. And then I think there's some movement going on in cash taxes. What would you expect that cash tax as a percentage of book this 2020? Devina Rankin : Yes. So our cash tax payment this year was lower. We made that decision because of the fuel tax credit. While it doesn't show up on the same line we knew from a cash perspective it was something that we would see a benefit of in 2020. So we normalized that by reducing our Q4 cash tax payment on our federal return. And so our cash taxes were about 67.5% of book in 2019. We're projecting that goes up to about 70% in the year ahead. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael Hoffman : A couple of housekeeping. Can we follow just a directional trend on the volumes so we are thinking about this correctly. Negative in 1Q flat or slightly positive in 2 incrementally positive in 3 incrementally positive in 4 and that's how you get to the 1.5? John Morris : Yes. I'm not sure I've been based on January I'm not sure I'd say negative in Q1. I mean I went through the numbers for January that we've seen to date and they were pretty encouraging. So I think you could end up with slightly positive in Q1. We'll see based on what happens in February and March obviously. But the volume particularly as we look at the commercial line of business has been strong for probably three years and it continues to be strong. I think that is probably the best representation of the strength of the consumer economy. We talked about that at the end of Q3. So I would tell you I think commercial is certainly carrying today and landfill has been reasonably strong as well. Landfill has those tough comps. Devina Rankin : Q2 and Q3 are your CapEx comps on that fire volume. So Q1 necessarily doesn't necessarily have as a heavy burden from that regard. And so I think that's why didn't comment earlier about the strength that we've seen in January. We don't expect Q1 to have as significant a hill to climb with regard to that year-over-year comparison as Q2 will. James Fish : I think Michael there was a little bit of a kind of a gap between fires last year because you had Southern California that really impacted Q4 of 2018 so we had tough comps in Q4 of 2019. Then there was a little bit of a lull there and then you had the big Northern California fires and that really started coming to us more I think in February. So January really wasn't impacted much at all by fire volume. But the fires the volume coming into our sites in Northern California pretty much turned off completely at the very end of July. Michael Hoffman : All right. So what I'm hearing is maybe a zig-zag of a 0 positive 1Q slightly negative flattish in 2Q a little bit better in 3 and then better in 4 and that's how you get to the one 5. James Fish : I think that's probably right. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right. It just helps the modeling so there's no noise when things are reported. Jim I listened carefully to your opening remarks and you make a point of saying I think an important metric is operating EBITDA. So operating EBITDA is different than adjusted EBITDA. I'm presuming that's I'm hearing that correctly? James Fish : No. I mean I'm I just it's just the way we I call it out but it's it is adjusted EBITDA. That's what I'm talking about. Michael Hoffman : It's the adjusted number. Okay. So can you help us with then Devina what's the approximate dollar amount of adjustments you're assuming in the 2020 number versus what you actually produced in 2019? Devina Rankin : We don't specifically predict what we think our adjustments will be in the year ahead. The one item that we do know about that I mentioned during my prepared remarks is the ERP system upgrade and we think that that adjustment could be up to $40 million in the year. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So that was a question. ERP typically tend to be long planning things. So this feels abrupt. Is it? Devina Rankin : It's certainly not abrupt. It's something that we've been talking about for some time. There was a bit of a fork in the road decision for us to make whether or not we wanted to do a technical more kind of maintenance-oriented upgrade to the systems that we had or we wanted to make a more transformational change. And with Tamla's partnerships she and I viewed it as the right time for us to make a transformational investments in our finance and HR systems. And so that's the path that we're starting to work down. As you can appreciate this is a process that takes a lot of time and energy and support from all levels of the organization including our Board of Directors. And we worked through those processes and made a final determination about midyear and started to launch our process in the fourth quarter. James Fish : Yes Michael I just want to add to that. It might appear abrupt from a reporting standpoint. It's certainly not abrupt from a planning standpoint. I mean we've spent at least a year probably more like 1.5 years planning for this as she said going through an RFP process. We've dedicated people within the organization to really oversee this and run it. And then when it comes to the reporting aspects this is really the first time we've kind of called that out but we went through a diligence process where we looked at what other companies have done to see what the treatment has been and a little bit of both but probably more on the exclusion side which is why we opted for that approach. Michael Hoffman : And that makes me feel better that it's not about the planning is good. Free cash just so I'm clear do I take $90 million for CNG credit out of the midpoint of the guidance? Is that what I'm supposed to do? Is that what you're saying? [indiscernible] heard you say. I'm not sure I understood what you're saying about the 2020. Devina Rankin : So our 2020 guide of 21 50 to 22 50 includes $90 million from the fuel tax credits. At the midpoint we expect EBITDA growth to be about $225 million. Interest as I mentioned is going to be a headwind from a free cash flow perspective in the year ahead because we've taken out $4.5 billion of incremental debt. And so that's a headwind of about $100 million in the year ahead. Cash taxes we think will be another $115 million on a year-over-year basis. And then we have a working capital headwind that is about $75 million that will round out the guidance. But still really drawing you back to the operating EBITDA strength and honing in on an expectation for $225 million of growth from operating EBITDA. Michael Hoffman : So I appreciate that. Help us understand what's structural and what can change over time between a core a 4% and reported of 2.5% how that gap closes? And I'm hopeful that 2.5 isn't permanent that you get to improve that. But can we talk about that? Devina Rankin : Yes. The fundamental difference between core price of 4% and yield of 2.5% is really related to churn. And our churn was essentially flat in 2019 but we do see continued opportunity with regard to reducing churn as we drive a differentiated service offering with technology and improve our customer service. Both things we think we're advancing in really positive ways. So as we can reduce our churn and we think there's probably 150 basis points of room in that figure we can close the gap between the 4% and the 2.5%. John Morris : I would also say that we spoke either in Q2 or three about some a little bit of friction with some national accounts that we shared last year. The good news is that we are actually adding a couple of large national accounts here in the first half of the year. And the reason I bring that up is churn aside what we're really trying to focus on and making sure that the first day is in our best day with that business. We've got the right margins going in and we've got the right rate setting mechanism built into those revenue books. And so we're pleased with that. I will tell you we looked at churn and also our net C&I customer base and that the net C&I number was up a pretty good bit at the end of the year. James Fish : Yes Michael. And last thing in reference to your kind of pricing baseline question about 2.5%. As I said to Tyler I mean we our baseline was 2% and I think it's starting to give us some confidence that we can move that baseline up doesn't mean we can't exceed it. I mean we obviously exceeded 2% in 2019 but we feel like we're able to particularly as we think about the pricing at landfills and in residential where we've been lagging for so many years the ability to hit to move that baseline up by 50 basis points is we think certainly achievable. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's what I thought but I just wanted to draw it out. And then back to Advanced Disposal quickly. You close it. You've had this 12 months to plan. I'm assuming you've and I'm calling them green and yellow teams. But can you talk about some of what that planning looks like and what we can expect to see some what are tangible milestones that would come out that are a result of your planning? John Morris : So I would tell you Michael that our group on our side of the fence has been hard at work really since probably June building out the plans for integration. Keep in mind Advanced is still a separate company until we close. So our planning activities have really been on our side of the fence. And I will tell you that I think the first year I mean as I've said publicly privately that our goal day one and really through probably day 30 or 60 is really just making sure we take care of the employees and we hang on to our customers and provide them the right service. So this is a long game for us. We're going to move as quickly as we can to achieve synergies but we're going to do it with people and customers in as a priority. James Fish : But it is why and Devina talked about it in her script it is why we've we're going to be pretty strict about M&A this year within that 100 to 200 range because it's that is not lowering down to that range is not indicative of the lack of a robust market or whatever. I think that's still there. But what I don't want to do is distract folks who are going to be working hard on as ADS integration to John's point and get them somehow even if just mildly distracted by another acquisition. So we're going to we really are going to be in that 100 to 200 for the year. Now the only caveat to that would be let's say we get we really have accelerated the integration work and the synergy work and we get to Q4 and we feel like wow most of that done and something pops up on our radar that just we can't pass up. Okay. We'll talk about it at that point. But for now we're setting an expectation that we're going to be it's just going to be small tuck-ins throughout the year and we will focus our attention on the integration work with ADS. Michael Hoffman : Well you're doing five years of tuck-ins in one year with ADS anyway. James Fish : Exactly. Michael Hoffman : So I mean by so I none of that freaks me out other than is there an accelerated level of deals just because everybody wakes up and decides there might be a social selected the presence and taxes are going up and they pull it all into 2020 you don't want to miss some of that. But I get why you ought to focus on... James Fish : I won't say anything I won't comment on the politics now. But hopefully nothing freaks you out. Michael Hoffman : Well just I mean sellers have to figure out what their after-tax proceeds are going to be and if they think they've got a changing tax environment coming into '21 they move they're selling into '20. James Fish : Yes. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : My first question is just on ADSW. Any thoughts as to the time line to achieve the $100 million plus in synergy and sort of costs to achieve those synergies? Any framework to think about for us? John Morris : Well Hamzah I would tell you that I think we've been pretty clear that we think for the balance of 2020 between integration and costs to achieve not a ton of benefit in 2020. We expect that through the course of 2021 we're going to make up a good bit of ground and you'll start to see a lot of the net benefit for the organization. Devina Rankin : And from a cost to achieve perspective we're planning for cost to achieve to equal one year's worth of full synergy realization. That is exclusive of some of the transaction costs that are customary like payments to bank and things like that. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Very helpful. And then aside from solid waste and recycling could you frame for us how big other businesses are for you today [indiscernible] waste med waste? And is that a focus of growth post ADSW integration? James Fish : Yes. We could probably I'll take a shot at it quickly. And then quite small for us really. I think we have a couple of locations maybe in Nevada and maybe in on the West Coast. So small for us. The Energy Services business has been was a focal point for us in 2019 with the acquisition of [indiscernible]. So that business essentially doubled. That has been at its very very peak back in 2014 had been $250 million-ish in revenue and it has fallen back to somewhere in the neighborhood of maybe $100 million in revenue. And then of course when we bought [indiscernible] that's kind of doubled the size of it basically. But it still is relatively small in comparison to the overall solid waste big business that we have. And then what was the other? [indiscernible]. John Morris : I would tell you Hamzah we've seen good growth really along the M&I corridor in our hazardous waste business. We continue to make strategic investments in our facilities both around the Gulf Coast Pacific Northwest et cetera. So it's an important part of our business I would say if you were trying to look at it in terms of scale to $16 plus billion revenue line I wouldn't call that necessarily material but it is an important part of our business. It's part of our differentiated services for our M&I customer base and we've got a great team of folks who continue to run that business very well for us. James Fish : Yes I think that I think if you look at the growth engines there I mean they all have growth potential certainly but I would probably highlight Energy Services it's down. I mean and but I think that ends up being a growth business for us. Whether it is kind of traditional drill cuttings or whether it's waters or what have you that has the potential to be a growth business for us. And then I think as John said the M&I business for sure with coal combustion residuals I mentioned the big contracts that the remediation contract that we won. We think we have a couple of others that we could win in 2020. So the pipeline looks strong there and we feel like we've got there's really a small group if not one company that can really do what we do on handling the full solution for coal combustion residuals. So that's certainly a growth opportunity for us. Hamzah Mazari : Great. And just a last question. On landfill pricing you talked about sort of cost inflation. We've obviously seen landfill pricing step up the last few quarters but it's been pretty low for a long time aside from the last few quarters. Why can't you raise it a lot more? Does it take a long time to roll through your system? You had referenced sort of cost inflation of 5%. So just give us a sense of is this sort of a gradual uplift for a reason or can you just push through higher price to cover the cost structure? James Fish : I don't know. I mean when I looked at historical MSW pricing at 1% and in Q4 at 4.5% somewhat of a quadrupling there felt pretty good to me. So could it go higher? Look if our cost structure is 5% at a minimum I sure would like to get to 5%. But I'm happy with the progress we're making on it. It's not to say that we can't get up to obviously fully cover that cost structure. But I wanted to first and foremost I wanted to make sure that we could consistently do this. We've never had any consistency in it. And now with 2019 and a bit of 2018 starting to really show consistency in landfill pricing I'm happy with that so far and then we'll address the number going forward. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mark Neville of Scotiabank. Mark Neville : Maybe just first on the Advanced transaction. Just so I'm clear just on the divestiture package of the program. So the deal closes and then you'll have just so I'm clear a finite sort of period of time to divest of whatever you need to sell? Or does it need to be sold before closes? John Morris : Well I mean some of those details are still being worked out Mark with the regulators. But historically the industry has been allowed to a period of time post closing to be able to narrow down the divestiture package and obviously the suitors for those assets. Mark Neville : Okay. And it sounds like there's enough interest there that you're sort of not a disadvantage seller? John Morris : I mean listen I mean I think everybody knows the history of Advanced and how they grew to where they are. And the assets that are on the list right now are obviously though in very high demand that we think from as evidenced by the number of folks who've lined up the chat lines about it. James Fish : Well I think there are assets John that had it not been for this acquisition we've never have seen the light of day. John Morris : Yes. Agree. Mark Neville : Fair. Okay. Maybe just a follow up I guess on the landfill pricing. Again I presume that there is again the incremental the margin on the volume is the incremental margin is pretty high. So there is I guess some sort of upper limit to how much you can raise pricing if there is again an alternative sort of place to dispose. And again if you're doing 4.5% you're not quite at the 5% but it feels like it could be a lot higher. But again I assume there is sort of risk to losing some volume right? John Morris : Certainly there's always risk to losing volume. I will tell you Mark what I've been particularly happy with is that what our revenue management team is doing to align with the operating side and using some of the data and analytical tools we have I think we're making much much better decisions and our field folks have a higher degree of confidence in terms of how our assets are positioned what do all their alternatives look like how do we make sure we're recovering costs covering transportation pressure et cetera. And I think that's part of what you're seeing is a higher degree of confidence our team has and the analytics and the tools that we're using to make those decisions. Devina Rankin : Yes. Well placed asset network I think ease the conversation because understanding the next best alternative for the customer is one of the fundamental inputs to this insight and our ability to execute. James Fish : That's right. I mean your question is really about price elasticity and Devina is exactly right. It's something we talked about at Investor Day when you talk about having that really, really well positioned landfill network that's close to the city center that really provides some protection against price elasticity. Mark Neville : Right. So again maybe there is no reason why you can't be doing I guess based on that. Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just one last one then. Just on the ERP upgrade again I kind of these typically again can be pretty big undertakings. So I'm just curious is sort of a time line around that and the $40 million I think that you quoted is that a 2020 number? Or is that sort of life of project number? Devina Rankin : Sure. So you're exactly right there are significant undertakings and that's why we haven't taken this slightly. We've planned for it well and ensure that the HR and finance teams are very well coordinated in our execution of the path forward. In terms of the $40 million specifically that's our 2020 estimate and we do expect this project to go into 2022 based on our current projections of the time to standardize business processes and definitions in a way that positions us to implement the new software. Mark Neville : Okay. And then maybe if I can ask the last one then. Just on the ran in the commodity price. I guess there's tough comps. You think you mentioned the upside from the fee-for-service model. The RIN pricing has done a little better year-to-date. I'm just again in the guide is the assumption that there's still sort of a headwind for 2020? Or is it sort of a net neutral sort of 0 to EBITDA year-over-year? John Morris : Yes. Mark I would tell you net neutral. I think you heard in my prepared remarks there's been a little fluctuation in commodity pricing. Q4 was obviously the softest quarter. We feel confident we can make that up and that'll be kind of net neutral. It could be a bit of a tailwind but we're kind of staying neutral there. And on the RIN pricing same thing. I mean those rates today are a little bit elevated from where they closed the year out but we're not banking on that because that obviously has demonstrated its ability to change overnight. Operator : Thank you for your questions. I'll be turning the call back to our speakers for closing remarks. James Fish : All right. Thank you. So really just in closing I want to repeat something that I've said many times and that is that at this company and honestly in the industry as a whole we truly are blessed to have the hard-working people that we have doing their jobs day in and day out to make this all possible. We're really here just reporting the great numbers that they produce every day. And so I just want to say thank you again to them. We're extremely grateful. Thank you all for joining us and enjoy the rest of your week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ed Egl, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Edward Egl : Thank you, Blue. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You will hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover our COVID-19 response strategy, along with an overview of our results. John will cover an operating overview, and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs. John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which, unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the first quarter of 2019. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA margin and SG&A expenses have been adjusted to enhance the comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations, including costs incurred in connection with the pending acquisition of ADS. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release and tables, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information of our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Given the significant and widespread disruptions caused by COVID-19, we will use our time on the call to discuss our response strategy rather than focus on first quarter results. Our immediate priorities going into the shutdown were protecting our employees and providing safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. Having established a framework to achieve those early priorities, we're now focused on optimizing our business for the new environment, preserving our financial strength and flexibility and progressing towards closing the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. We're taking steps to use the crisis to create a new normal. We're focused on opportunities to enhance our business, attracting top-quality talent and developing customer-centric solutions. I'm extremely proud of how our team has worked together proactively to address the challenges we faced during the last 2 months and how our frontline teammates continue to diligently provide essential services to our customers. As I've said many times, at Waste Management, we put our people first, so they can take care of our customers, communities and the environment, which will, in turn, benefit our shareholders. It should be no surprise that our top priority as a leadership team has been the health, safety and financial well-being of our 45,000 team members. We wanted to ensure that our employees could focus on continuing to provide exceptional customer service and not worry about whether they'd be able to pay their bills. So the first and probably easiest decision we made was to indefinitely guarantee 40 hours of pay for full-time employees through the duration of the pandemic, so that they know their jobs and pay will be secured even if COVID-19 reduces the number of routes or hours needed to service our customers. Of course, it's important to point out that we took immediate steps to protect the jobs of - while we took immediate steps to protect the jobs of 45,000 employees, we're managing the labor components of operating costs through significant reductions in overtime hours. Regarding health and safety, we're also working with vendors to make sure that we had appropriate personal protective equipment for frontline employees, including masks, gloves and a hand sanitizer. We quickly made strict changes to our daily processes to follow social distancing guidelines for our frontline employees, and we transitioned about 20,000 of our office employees to a work-from-home environment in one week's time. This has been a massive change to how our team performs their jobs, and overall, it's been a very successful transition. We're also providing paid sick leave for our COVID-19-related absences for employees and have extended benefits for backup childcare in light of school closures. The team has responded commendably by continuing to provide essential services to customers and communities across North America. Our team has also been focused on supporting customers, especially small and medium commercial businesses that are the lifeblood of our economies. Even with the substantial support packages, small businesses will certainly need a helping hand coming out of the shutdowns. Given that, we've helped our customers rightsize their service levels, reducing service where necessary, temporarily pausing price increases and extending payment terms. In addition, as I've said publicly, in an effort to support those small businesses, Waste Management is giving a free month of service to qualifying open-market small business customers as they resume their normal waste service and restart their businesses in a post-COVID-19 economy. Our customer teams are proactively contacting these small business customers in an effort to show our support and will continue to do so as states and provinces reopen across North America. We see this as the right thing to do and believe it will result in greater customer loyalty over the long term. We're optimistic that this enhanced customer loyalty, combined with the fact that we've seen less than 1% service cancellations in our commercial line of business since the start of the pandemic, are good signs for how our business will recover as businesses reopen and need our services. We're also working with our municipal customers to address increased residential waste per unit and helping them manage recycling challenges in areas where there have been processing disruptions. Turning to our financial results. For the first quarter, our business generated operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion. For the first 2.5 months of the quarter, our operations were performing extremely well, putting us on track to exceed our first quarter goals. Of course, the whole world changed during the second half of March, and we swiftly began to adapt our business and identify cost-saving opportunities. John and Devina will give more color on cost reductions, but I can assure you that we are maximizing our asset utilization and looking at all discretionary costs and capital spending. Maybe even more importantly, we're looking at this unprecedented event as an opportunity to permanently change our business processes, our customer service offering, our work, our office work model and application of digital business solutions, to name a few. WM has always been a very resilient business model, and we will make sure we come out of this pandemic stronger, more differentiated and even more resilient than we were going in. Finally, it's been about 1 year since we announced our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Despite the general business disruption caused by COVID-19, we continue to make progress and currently anticipate being in a position to receive final antitrust regulatory approval and proceed towards closing by the end of second quarter of 2020. We're looking forward to completing this transaction, integrating the ADS team and operations and creating long-term value for our shareholders. In closing, despite the fact that solid waste is an essential service and many parts of the business remain recession-resilient, we are suspending financial guidance we provided in February given the uncertainty around the unprecedented impact of COVID-19. At this time, we cannot forecast with reasonable accuracy the duration of the COVID-19 disruptions or the pace of recovery, particularly for small businesses. There are just too many unknowns, and any guidance at this time would be an educated guess at best. Poor short-term visibility does not, however, alternate the very strong cash-generating ability of our business model. In past downturns, we've demonstrated the ability to flex spending, manage capital and maintain solid pricing discipline, all in order to generate strong free cash flow and strong return to our shareholders. We expect to continue to do that in today's economic environment. And most notably, now more than ever has been the right time to stand firmly behind our 45,000 team members and our small business partners to do our part to protect their futures. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter as well as additional color on the impacts to our business from the pandemic. John Morris : Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. First, I can't emphasize enough how proud I am of the WM team. Our team members have stayed focused on safely serving our customers and communities during a time of extreme uncertainty and distraction. Despite the volatile backdrop, our frontline employees have reported to work, taking great pride in their role of providing an essential service to our cities and towns across the U.S. and Canada. While many companies are facing challenges to their supply chains in this environment, I want to take - I want to recognize the fantastic work that our supply chain team has done to keep our operations running smoothly. They've been able to continue to meet the needs of our business and the safety of our employees, including being able to secure personal protective equipment to protect our frontline employees for the next several months. There's no doubt that we have a dedicated team of men and women who are committed to providing the waste and recycling services our communities depend on. Turning to our results. Operating EBITDA grew 2.6% for the quarter with COVID-19 impacting our business in the second half of March where we saw revenue negatively impacted by $40 million. We've positioned ourselves to be responsive to the volume changes in our business and properly adjust our costs. I'll first spend some time talking about some of the specific ways that we are flexing our costs to respond to this decreasing volume environment. In our collection line of business, technology and analytical tools such as M100 provide data and visibility into our drivers' routes that enable us to swiftly remove overtime hours and optimize or eliminate routes when customers reduce or suspend service. These insights have allowed us to flex our labor costs in this rapidly evolving environment. For example, we've been able to reduce overtime hours by half compared to prepandemic. In addition, we've reduced commercial routes by almost 6% and industrial routes by almost 13%. And overall, we've parked almost 6% of our routed vehicles, allowing us to reduce fuel and maintenance costs. In our post-collection operations, we're flexing costs commensurate with this volume environment. These results are evident in our reduction of heavy equipment operating hours, overtime and other variable expenses. With most communities we serve under stay-at-home orders, we've seen a significant increase in residential container weights, and our disposal costs are increasing, putting pressure on margins. But as we discussed last quarter, improving the profitability of our residential business is one of our key focus areas in 2020, so that put us ahead of the game in initiating conversations with our municipal customers on price increases that keep pace with rising costs. We're having these conversations as contracts come up for renewal as well as proactively discussing the changing dynamics with our customers. Given the fluid environment we are in, I also want to provide some color on the volume declines that we've seen during the month of April. At the peak, we saw more than 20% declines in third-party landfill tons and industrial hauls and close to 16% declines in the commercial line of business, while our residential line of business has seen about a 25% increase in the amount of waste disposed. A large portion of our landfill business over the last several years has been driven by big businesses, C&D contractors and special waste volumes, and they account for much of the decline that we've seen. We expect that these volumes should rebound fairly quickly as the economy reopens and as our pipelines remain strong. On a positive note, as we progress through the month, the rate of volume decline improved, and we had 2 areas actually show positive net service changes at the end of April. However, we still saw low double-digit volume declines in our overall business. In order to help our customers recover post-COVID, we have internal task force teams to focus on proactive restoration efforts to facilitate volume increases for restaurants, retail and offices, which make up 60% of the commercial revenue impact. The extreme volatility that we've seen in our volumes and the uncertainty in knowing how quickly those volumes return are the primary reasons we decided to suspend our guidance. Turning to price. In the first quarter of 2020, core price was 5.5% versus 4.5% in the first quarter of 2019 with all lines of business greater than 4%. Landfill core price remained strong at 4.3% with collection and disposal yield of 2.2% in the first quarter. As a reminder, yield is calculated using current period volume, and as a result, in a declining volume environment, there will be downward pressure on yield, but that does not indicate we are lowering prices. As Jim mentioned, we have taken thoughtful, proactive customer-focused steps to help our small business customers in this tough economic climate and to generate long-term customer loyalty. These actions do not indicate we're abandoning our pricing discipline. We remain committed to recovering the increased cost of our business through pricing actions. While we aggressively address cost reductions related to our volume trends, we also remain focused on meeting our customers' needs. Our operations and customer experience teams are partnered to ensure we can swiftly respond to service increase requests and ramp our operations back up to meet their demands. We've developed a proactive approach to service restorations for customers adversely affected by the COVID crisis. Our goal is to ensure that reinstating their environmental services is seamless, so they can focus on getting their business back up and running. We're in a great position to do this as our 40-hour guarantee was the right thing to do for our team members, allowing us to remove overtime while retaining our frontline employees for the next phase, ramping our operations back up as efficiently and swiftly as possible to meet our customers' needs. In addition, our emerging self-service capabilities as well as the technology on our vehicles will help us support their needs as their businesses come back online. And finally, our recycling business performed well, considering further erosion in recycled commodity prices in the first quarter. Our average commodity price fell nearly 30% to $40 per ton. Despite a decline in revenue of about $60 million in the first quarter, the operating EBITDA contribution from the business increased modestly. These results demonstrate the success we continue to have in restructuring our recycling business to a fee-for-service model. Throughout the COVID crisis, we've been able to continually to safely process most recyclables as we encourage everyone to continue to recycle right. As a result of the demand created for materials we collect, we have seen an increase in OCC prices in April. While we are encouraged by the increase in demand and recovered prices, there are some challenges with other commodities like steel, aluminum and plastics as we've seen the prices for these commodities decline. Despite all these movements and restrictions in the marketplace, our team continues to be able to consistently move all the tons we process. I am proud of how we navigated the COVID crisis, in particular, how we've taken care of our people. This will no doubt help us with employee retention and ultimately help differentiate Waste Management as a great place to work. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our first quarter financial results and capital allocation priorities. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, we have temporarily suspended our 2020 guidance, a step we view as prudent due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19. With that said, one of the strengths of our business model is that in the face of unprecedented uncertainty, we provide our constituents, employees, customers, communities and shareholders with a great deal of certainty. Waste Management provides essential services to a diverse customer base across the U.S. and Canada. Our business is recession-resilient with more than 75% of revenues having annuity-like characteristics. We have experienced and dedicated team members who are focused on safely serving our customers, and we are finding them more dedicated than ever. We've implemented tools and practices that drive disciplined pricing, cost control and capital spending across our network, and so we are well positioned to flex our business with changing volumes. All of this comes together to position Waste Management to generate strong and consistent free cash flow and return value to our shareholders. We are certainly seeing declines in revenue related to COVID-19. And to partially offset the impact of the anticipated revenue decline, we're taking steps to manage costs and capital spending without compromising our long-term strategic priorities or growth opportunities. Some of these steps include limiting hiring, reducing or eliminating discretionary spending in travel and entertainment and consulting costs and reducing incentive compensation costs. We have proven in the past that we are very good at flexing our spending when facing challenging economic conditions, and we want to assure you that we will continue to manage our business to maximize cash generation and returns over the long term. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow in 2020, positioning us to pay our dividend, make opportunistic investments and bolster our liquidity. We're extremely well positioned financially to manage our business through COVID-19 impacts. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position with our current and forecasted leverage ratio well within our revolving credit facility financial covenant. Our liquidity is the strongest it has been in the company's history, bolstered by the recent upsize in our revolving credit facility to $3.5 billion. We took proactive steps to fund the ADS acquisition. So when you consider our cash on hand with our expectations for access to both short-term and long-term financing options, we are confident that our liquidity and financial position will remain strong through the acquisition close and the most significant challenges presented by the pandemic. Turning briefly to our first quarter 2020 results. I want to highlight how we see SG&A, capital spending and cash flows. Results that we saw in the first quarter is important indicators for what we expect for the remainder of the year. First quarter SG&A was $390 million, a decrease of 4.6% compared to the same period last year. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 10.5%, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year. These results include benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals as well as steps we have taken to quickly reduce discretionary spending in response to business impacts related to COVID-19. The continuous improvement mindset we have fostered over the last several years is serving us well as we rationalize and optimize costs across the organization. As a result, we expect to reduce SG&A spending by about 10% of COVID-related revenue declines. Net cash provided by operating activities was $765 million in the first quarter. The strong start to the year was driven by operating EBITDA growth, but that growth was more than offset by higher cash interest and adviser costs associated with the pending ADS acquisition as well as a sharp decline in customer receipts in late March, which we attribute to customers taking steps to protect their own financial position. We are seeing this trend continue into April and are paying close attention to how this impacts our revenue, bad debt reserves and working capital outlook. Capital spending in the first quarter was $459 million, which is down modestly when compared to the same quarter in 2019. While we continue to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business, we are now flexing our capital spending to align with current volumes and expect to see a significant decline in capital spending beginning in the second quarter of 2020. For the full year, we are targeting capital spending reductions of about 10% from planned levels. Landfill capital makes up about 1/3 of our overall capital spending, and we expect most of the reductions in this category as we adjust cell construction schedules with declines in volumes. We also see opportunities to flex spending for containers and heavy equipment. Free cash flow was $318 million in the first quarter of 2020. It's important to highlight that our first quarter 2020 cash flow included over $55 million related to our pending acquisition of ADS and the ERP implementation. When we consider these items and the uncharacteristic customer receipt slowdown we saw at the end of March, combined with our intentional focus on flexing SG&A and capital spending, we're satisfied that we remain on track to deliver another year of strong free cash flow. The cash that we generate positions us to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we paid $236 million in dividends and repurchased $402 million in shares. We remain fully committed to our dividend program. However, as a prudent step to preserve cash in this uncertain environment, we decided at the end of March to temporarily suspend our share repurchases. In closing, I want to echo what both Jim and John have said. I could not be prouder of how our employees have responded to this unprecedented pandemic. I want to thank every one of our 45,000 employees. The work they have done and continue to do will make Waste Management a stronger and more resilient company as the economy emerges from the pandemic impact. With that, Blue, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital. Walter Spracklin : First, starting here on pricing. I guess I recognize that you will be taking some actions here, perhaps deferring any price increases given the environment. But overall, can you speak to the pricing behavior among your competitors especially smaller players and whether you are losing business due to some of that price action, particularly since the April period? That'd be great. James Fish : Yes. I think - Walter, I think the business that we've lost, which John can go into in more detail, it's a very small amount of commercial business that we've lost so far has strictly been due to the pressure of this COVID shutdown, not due to pricing in any way. We have not seen anybody out there slashing pricing. I think most companies are out there really focused on the cost side of their income statement. And I think for us, specifically for all the right reasons, we put our price increase program to our small businesses on hold until they can restart those. I mean as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, small business is truly the group that is at greatest risk here and, hence, our program to try and help them reemerge. But as John said and I'll say, we're not - we've gone for a long time building this kind of price discipline muscle here. And just because it's got a 2-month or 3-month break does not mean it's going to atrophy. We're going to continue to make sure that we increase price to offset cost increases that we've seen and - but we are going to take a break with those small businesses until they get back on their feet. Walter Spracklin : Okay, that makes sense. My follow-up here is on just the understanding that your - you have less visibility into the full year. But just looking into - you mentioned April and as we model for Q2 here, I heard you mentioned low double-digit volumes and pressure on pricing or pressure on yields, I guess. If that kind of - if we were to kind of take the low double-digit volume and negative pricing as our Q2 and then decide where we go from there, would there be anything that we'd be missing or you would highlight that would either cause us to reexamine that assumption here for the second quarter? James Fish : Yes. I mean the - there is a bit of - there is some good news here and - when we look at our numbers. And it's primarily on the roll-off and landfill side of our business. Those, as John mentioned - and good news on the - a bit of reason for optimism on the commercial line of business, although that one is the one that is less clear. We just don't have as good of an idea about what happens with commercial business, what happens with retail, restaurants, all the sporting-related businesses, office space. That is really virtually impossible to predict. There's no historical evidence for us to kind of look back into. But as we just look at our own numbers, I'll give you a couple here with roll-off. And roll-off, as John mentioned, was down, at its low point, in the 20% range. So I'll read off a couple of those numbers, starting with the week of the 15th of March. We were down 4.6%. That's compared to a pre-COVID week just a couple of weeks before but down 4.6%. So all of a sudden, the week of the 22nd of March down 11.6%, down 14.6% the week of the 29th; first week of May, down 17.7%; down 19.6% the week of the 12th. All of that is not surprising, not unexpected and not great. But then all of a sudden, the week of the 19th, so the next week, we went from down 19.6% to down 15.1%. The week of the 26th, we went from down 15.1% to down 11.8%. So a fairly sharp rebound in the roll-off line of business. And when we look at the waste streams within our landfill line of business that are most driven by big business, we're seeing a similar rebound. Where we're not seeing necessarily a big rebound we are seeing some signs that we've bottomed and starting to climb out gradually, and let me stress, gradually, is the commercial line of business because so much of that is driven by small business. And I just think small business themselves don't know what the rebound is going to look like. This is driven by geography. It's driven by mix of business. There - I mean, the small businesses that are tied to health care probably didn't even see a downturn. But a fairly significant percentage of our business is schools, for example. Schools obviously have been shut down. And there's conversation in Houston that they might do every other day in the fall. So we just don't have a good - we don't have good visibility with respect to small business. But the good news is that big business that's not in any kind of liquidity - doesn't have any liquidity concerns or going concern issues, that is starting to rebound. And when we look at those numbers, I just read you for roll-off, it looks encouraging. John Morris : Maybe, Walter, just a little more color on the landfill side. When we look and we strip it out by waste stream, what we've seen is looks like our landfill volumes on the MSW side bottomed out between like the first and second week of April, and we're starting to see not big improvements, but it's improving week over week. So we are seeing volume come back on the MSW line. Special waste, a little bit later. It looks like it bottomed out in the last week or 2, and that is starting to turn positive. And then lastly, C&D was obviously down pretty significantly, but we've also in the back half of April seen signs that that's flattened and started to turn positive. So there are some signs of optimism in our landfill volumes. And most importantly, the one we pay, obviously, particular attention to is MSW, and we've seen that turn positive here in the last few weeks. James Fish : Well, and John and Walter, the - when John talked about 25% down at its low point for all landfill tons, heavily weighted there with the C&D and special waste, and those are really big customers. Those are big contractors. Special waste is almost exclusively big customers, and they're not going out of business. They just kind of went into a wait-and-see mode. Our pipeline, as John mentioned in his remarks, is strong. And so I think what you're starting to see with that roll-off and some of those waste streams at the landfill returning is big business starting to kind of turn things back on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : Hope everyone is doing well. Just focusing on residential. Obviously, with the uptake in volumes on the collections side given the shelter-in-place orders, can you just talk about your ability to potentially increase pricing in order for it to be more appropriate for the increased volume levels? Have you had any success doing this to date? John Morris : Well, yes. I mean, first and foremost, I think our strategy on residential before this pandemic was obviously a focal area for us. We've talked about our plans to improve margins there. And I think if you look at our core price results in Q1, they're strong and stronger quarter-over-quarter from '19 to '20. On the volume side, certainly, we've seen plus-20% increases in the volume on a per-unit basis, and we've kind of broken that down. About 25% of it is open market, and the balance of it really is municipal and franchise business. So we are really focused on going back to all those municipal and franchise customers and having some conversations about what's going on in the volume. I mean look, nobody signed up for 25-plus-or-minus percent increases in residential volumes. And I'm sure, as you folks know and can assume, some of that is going to remain because I think what Jim mentioned in his opening remarks is there's going to be a change in the work environment. And I think we're going to see more people stay and work from home. So we're - that is a key focal area for us. Kyle White : Got you. And then just follow-on. Can you provide similar level of details on the commercial line of business similar to what you just did for the roll-off and how the month of April looked? How is the beginning relative to exit rate of April in terms of servicing clients? John Morris : Yes. I mean Jim mentioned it. I think what we saw is it started moderated through the month of April. We had 2 of our areas or regions, depending on how you refer to them, actually show positive coming into the end of the month. And just in the - we're obviously like everybody watching us on a day-over-day basis, week over week. And I would tell you that each day, it's improving over the previous week. As Jim mentioned, it's not huge increases yet. But really, what's important for us is trying to figure out where the bottom of this thing is, and that's what we're focused on, and we feel like we've got a pretty good feel for it right now. James Fish : I think the good news, John, on commercial, and Kyle, the good news on commercial, while we've said there's not a ton of visibility with small business, the good news is that we really have been diligent in trying to determine which customers are not going to make it out of this. And so John talked about that 1%. Well, we've scrubbed that number. That's not just customers calling us and saying, \"Hey, cancel our service. We're not going to continue.\" That is us proactively, through an enhanced process made possible, by the way, through our onboard systems, going back to them and saying, this is a driver, for example, identifying - through an enhanced call process, identifying a customer that looks like the doors are closed. And so - but it's still on their route sheet. And so that would all be included in that 1%. So 1% is a very encouraging number. That tells us that of all these small businesses, the large, large majority are going to try and make a go of this coming out of COVID-19. Now what we don't know is how many of them actually make it. We don't know. I mean you can read 100 articles on what the risk is to small business if this thing lasts 6 months or 12 months. It differs from New Jersey and New York to Texas and Arizona. So the other thing, I think, John, that you were going to touch on was the number of service reductions that we see. John Morris : Yes. No, fair, Jim. Thanks. I mean we went back and looked, and just under about 10% of our 1.3 million commercial customers have said have had some change in their service. The vast majority, as Jim mentioned, only about less than 1% have actually canceled service. The rest are either reduced or suspended service. And I think what's important to note there is about 80% of those customers came to us as their business has started to decline. But to Jim's point, we've been very proactive with our ops team, our customer experience team to use the tools we have, both on the truck and back in the office to be able to identify and work proactively with these customers. And granted, we might be reducing some yards, if you will, in this example, a little quicker than otherwise may have happened. But listen, this is the - we're playing the long game here. This is certainly about working with our customers, especially the small business customers, through a really tough time. I think the upside for us is that 20% I referred to that our folks identified as service reductions also provide a little risk mitigation because one of the things, we're talking about is what the financial position are these small businesses going to be in the past, et cetera. So what's gotten out in front of this and reducing those yards in a proactive fashion also protects us, we think, a little bit from bad debt and allowances for doubtful accounts in the future. James Fish : Yes. It may - Kyle, it may end up giving - it gives us the best information right now, which actually maybe - may mean the number is a little bit lower for commercial yards because we're proactively addressing it with customers where they haven't reached out to us but where it appears there's a problem. But it also then, once we emerge from COVID-19, will give us a much more accurate number there. We won't be billing somebody with the expectation that we're going to collect and find out after the fact that, \"Uh-oh, they're out of business.\" We believe it gives us a much more accurate number during COVID-19, and then maybe, as importantly, a much more accurate number when we emerge from COVID-19. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Hope everybody is safe and healthy. My first question is, maybe you could touch on what you're seeing in container weights in commercial in April. And any thoughts as to - historically, the sector has lagged going into a downturn and coming out of a downturn. Maybe if you could talk about how the dynamics maybe different this time given this pandemic. John Morris : Maybe Hamzah, I'll take the first part of that. I think what we've seen in terms of container weights has been generally commensurate with the volume decline. We've paid a lot of attention not only to the volume and the container, but obviously, the weight per unit because, obviously, as businesses slow down, we're seeing less waste in the containers. So I think overall, what we've seen is volume declines or weight declines commensurate with volume in our front-load containers. James Fish : Yes. Hamzah, with respect to kind of historical downturns, I mean, as you know, I mean, this is not - there's no precedence for this because typically, whether it's '08, '09 or whether it's 2000 or any downturn that you look at, there - the economy starts to - there are signs that this is happening, and the economy starts to ramp down into a recession. There was no ramp-down here. There was no ramp to this. This - literally, in a matter of days, the entire North American economies and the world economies, for that matter, shut down. And so there wasn't a ramp for this, which is - hopefully, we'll never see this ever again, but no ramp. And then the ramp coming out is less about kind of macroeconomics and more about geographies and cities and more about the virus itself and the phases that the White House put out. So it is so hard to know. I mean I would tell you with respect to commercial that we don't - I can't tell you when football stadiums or broadway shows or office complexes, I mean, we're in a Phase 1 status in the State of Texas, but I would tell you, it is a ghost town downtown. So there are no office buildings. They're open, but there's - but our office building here might have, I don't know, 3,000 or 4,000 people in it, and I bet you, there aren't more than 75 people in this office. So - and I just don't know. I couldn't tell you when the Houston Astros or all the little ancillary businesses around the Astros or any other sports team, for that matter, are going to play ball again. Don't know. So it is very, very different and trying to compare it to a previous recession just kind of feels like it's not applicable. Hamzah Mazari : Got you. And Jim, you talked about potentially using this pandemic to make some permanent changes in the business. What do you see as sort of the big structural changes coming out of COVID-19? Clearly, work-from-home population could double, if not triple. You have to manage your residential business and your mix change there. You referenced that a little bit. But maybe if you could talk about what you see as sort of the 1, 2 or 3 big dynamics that will change your business coming out of this would be helpful. James Fish : Yes. Absolutely, Hamzah. Look, I mean, one of the things that this taught us was that if we really narrow our focus and put our full efforts behind something, we can get it done quickly and we can get it done well. I mean you mentioned work from home. I would tell you, if I'd asked Nikolaj Sjoqvist, our Chief Digital Officer, if I'd asked him back in November, \"Hey, what's it going to take to do a full work-from-home solution?\" I promise you, he would have said 12 months. And we did it in 7 days. So - and we've done it well. We've really - may have been a few hiccups early on, but at this point, we're running smoothly. So to give you a - we did sit down as an SLT and talked about, all right, so let's say we put everything on the table, and then we pick 3 projects that we're going to get done or at least put a huge amount of focus into, and everything else is going to get - put on the back burner. And so what we came out of that meeting with a few weeks ago was a work-from-home solution. The good news about that is we've already invested in the technology. We - there's no pilot involved. We piloted all 20,000 people. So this is really just Tamla and her team making sure that we set up the right performance management metrics and that we look at all of the supervisory considerations and that we consider internal controls and those types of things. That, we expect to be up and running by June 1. We did talk about ERP, and that's something we've talked to you about and talked on this call about. And that was one we felt, look, we have 2 systems that have been - that aren't supported at this point, that are almost 20 years old. We have to move forward with that. That, by the way, is not going to be completed by the end of 2020, but it will stay on the schedule that we laid out, which is kind of a 2022, 2023 completion there for that. So that was number two. And then number three is really a - when we looked at who the winners are coming out of this, and there aren't a whole lot, but if I were to ask you, Hamzah, who's the big winner, not necessarily in our industry but just overall, my guess is that you'd say probably Amazon is a big winner. Well, you're right. Amazon has been a big winner, and then it's because they're the king of self-service. And so how do we digitize our self-service offering? It's something we talked about at Investor Day last May. And how do we expedite that? How do we expedite the digitization, the self-service customer experience and get that done in a very quick but very well-done manner? And that's - and those are really the 3 projects that we identified and said we're going to move forward with all 3 of those, and we're going to expedite it, at least two of them, while staying on schedule with ERP. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey Silber : I've had a number of investors asked me this question, so I'll just ask it to you. One of your larger competitors reported last night, seemed to be a little bit less impacted by COVID last quarter. And I think the near-term outlook, while dollar was a little bit, I guess, less worse than what you might be looking at. I don't know if you've looked at their numbers. I'm assuming you have. Any reason for those differences? Devina Rankin : What I would say, we certainly listened to that call and have done what we can, the same that all of you and your investors have done, to digest what we heard. And we would tell you that we think that we're going to focus on Waste Management and our outlook. And what we see is that the $40 million impact that we gave you in terms of revenue in the two weeks of March is not anything that we can use to say that that's representative of what you should extrapolate for the full year, which is why we've suspended guidance. We would tell you that what the company has been focused on and as we've talked about is responding well and taking care of our customers and our employees. We are controlling our costs and ratcheting back capital spending where appropriate. And all in all, we remain very confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow for the year. And all those things together give us great confidence that we will respond as well as we should in this environment and certainly as well as we expect the industry as a whole will. John Morris : Hey, Jeff, I think that one important point that we've all made through this conversation is trying to dictate where the bottom is. And we spent a good bit of time talking around whether it's landfill or collection volumes on some of the positive signs that we're seeing there as we came into the last couple of weeks of April. James Fish : Yes. I think that - look, I mean, I didn't listen to their call. I mean Republic always does a nice job managing their business, so credit to them for that. I mean I do think we all are facing very similar challenges. I know they're trying to take overtime out, just like we are. We may be handling it slightly differently in some respects. But for the most part, the industry is, I think, doing a really good job of handling this. I do think and I don't know what they said about their commercial business, but I - as I've said several times on this call, look, commercial is - that's the big unknown. That's the question. How are they going to - how are these small businesses going to recover from this? Are they going to recover? How many of them will choose to just throw in the towel? When do all these schools open back up? Do they open back up the same way they went in? I mean we're hearing that - I read an article that said that as many as 40% of outgoing seniors from high school are going to take a gap year. That's going to affect colleges, and that affects our business. So I can't really answer your question specifically about how Republic is doing, managing theirs versus managing ours. I would say that for us, there are certainly some reasons for optimism, which we've gone into, specifically landfill and roll-off, which are really related to big business. But the piece that I think all waste companies are going to really have to kind of get our heads around is what happens to small business because it is unprecedented that you take the entire $23 trillion U.S. economy and shut it down. And so these small businesses are going to be impacted by that. And that's - honestly, that's why we didn't give guidance because we just don't - it's a big piece of our collection. It's a big piece of our disposal. And we just don't have good visibility. We hope that by the end of Q2, enough of these states will be kind of back up and running and into Phases 2 and 3 and on, that we'll be able to give you a better insight into what happened with small business. But I can't really say why their picture was rosier than ours. I can just tell you that I'm feeling pretty good about some parts of our business, and I'm not feeling pessimistic about others. I just don't know. I just don't know about small business right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Hope you're all doing well, and thanks for all the detail this morning. I guess first, just to touch on the question of decremental margins here. Devina, you walked through some of the cost levers that you have and expectations for SG&A. I guess is there a good sort of high-level way that we should be thinking about your decrementals here? Your margins, as you manage through some mix shift and an overall volume decline, is 35% to 40% kind of the right level for how we should be thinking? Devina Rankin : So we've historically talked about incremental margins being around that 40% that you identified. What I would say in this environment that makes giving you a decremental margin number to model or project that's particularly difficult is mix of business. And we've talked about the fact that our volume declines are coming in our highest-margin businesses. And we also identified that we think in the first quarter, we saw about 40 basis points of degradation in margin as a result of that high-margin business volume decline. We currently - based on our outlook, we think that 40 basis points - that 40 basis points will continue into the remainder of the year. And then when you combine that with the fact that we had expected 50 basis points of margin expansion in 2020, we think the full year impact to margin could be around 100 basis points as a result of COVID-19. That said, it's really difficult for us to know the answer to that question because I think what you've heard consistently today is just the level of uncertainty makes some of that difficult to predict. And what we're seeing is a great level of ability to flex the business in the industrial line of business as an example. But in the landfill line of business, if we see volume declines there continue, that's a line of business that has very good flow through traditionally, and the variable cost, the ability to reduce variable cost there is just negligible in relation to the rest of our business. So we would say that the best way to think about that is about 100 basis points of margin decline from our previous estimates. Noah Kaye : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on receivables buildup that you mentioned, can you give some color on where in the business that occurred, if you can talk by sector or line of business? Or was that really concentrated? Devina Rankin : It really was across the board. We look at our cash receipts for our customer base really in totality. And what we saw at the end of March was an estimate of $60 million to $80 million of pullback in cash receipts from our customers, and we've seen that continue into April. We can only attribute that to our customers taking steps to slow things down. But also, we take into account the fact that we were all moving ourselves to a work-from-home environment, and we expect that they were doing the same. So we would expect that as businesses find their way back to finding a way to work in this new normal environment that we'll see a healthy bounce-back there and want to view that more as timing. We've got our eyes on it, and we will be watching it through the year. We did - just for additional color, we took about a $5 million charge to SG&A during the quarter for bad debt reserves because that's our best estimate of what we think that, that might mean to - that slowdown in customer receipts might mean. James Fish : Yes, I might just add one thing to that, I mean, look to Devina's point about slowdown of cash payments from customers. I mean that is not in any way surprising to us. I mean, I can't imagine that these small businesses or big business in the month of April are rushing to pay their bill, if they even got their bill, if it went to their office and they're not at the office. So I mean, it's not surprising in any way that you would see that effect from this. And by the way, we think that the Olive branch, I guess, that we're extending to small business will actually have a positive effect on that. We think it's a sign of our commitment to them. And we think that, in return, it's a much easier call for an accounts receivable clerk to call after we've given a free month of service to a small business and say, \"Hey, just want to remind you that you're in your second month coming back. Hope all is well. By the way, you're a little late on your payment. We need to make sure that gets paid.\" That's an easier conversation than if we never changed anything. And certainly, I don't want to be that receivables clerk calling them right now and saying, \"Hey, haven't seen your payment yet.\" They're going to hang up the phone on me. So I think every company will see some type of impact on DSO. I can't imagine a day where you don't see an impact on DSO coming out of 100% economic shutdown. But the goal for Devina and her team is to be in a position to recover that as quickly as we can. And just like pricing discipline, we have working capital discipline here that we will not lose focus on. Noah Kaye : I appreciate that. Can I sneak one more in? Just, I wanted to clarify from the prepared remarks on the ADSW timing, you said you're expecting receipt of regulatory approvals by the end of the second quarter and then moving to closing. Did you say you expect closing to occur in - by the end of the second quarter or subsequent to that? I just wanted to understand. James Fish : Well, no, I just said we anticipate being in a position to close by the end of the second quarter. I think it's important to point out that, look, when we first announced this deal, I don't remember the exact day but it was like the middle of April, at 19 or something of - what was it, John? John Morris : 14. James Fish : 14. 14th of April, that we said it feels like the 14th of April 1990, honestly, because of this pandemic. But we said that it would take, we thought, between 12 and 15 months to close. We're at 13.5% or we will be, next week, so - or 12.5%. So we're within that window in terms of this being in anticipation or anticipating being in a position to close, so we're not worried about that. By the way, certainly, and I'm not going to blame anything on this pandemic, but look, we were moving 20,000 people to work from home. That included Chuck's attorneys who were working on this. That included DOJ attorneys. Credit to both sides for doing a nice job continuing to work even though we weren't traveling anymore. But no question, there was some impact from COVID-19 on this. We did not contemplate, when we closed this deal, any type of major economic disruption when we went about this in April of '19. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Michael Hoffman : John, could I get a clarification? What was the percent change in your total yards and service in the commercial business in April? John Morris : I think - I think we said 16%, Michael, was the high point. Michael Hoffman : So 16% actually is the actual yard change or is it the volume change? Devina Rankin : No, that was the yard change. John Morris : That was the yard exchange. Michael Hoffman : Yard exchange, okay. And that's the low point, and it's improved from there. Is that - that's the point you've made? John Morris : I would say it's improving, although as Jim said, it hasn't been as significant. It's kind of more flat in that. James Fish : Yes, I looked at the number this morning, Michael. I think it was 15.2% this morning so it is improving. I think we've actually had a couple of areas. And I think maybe, John, you mentioned that, but it had gone positive, but it's creeping back. John Morris : Michael, I also mentioned, though, specific to we're looking at this day by day, week over week, so my comments are really - are that granular as we're looking for the bottom and looking for signs of improvement. But it's only been in the last week or two that we've really seen it bottom out start to show signs of some positive movement. Michael Hoffman : And I know somebody wanted to put you in a comparison test, but that's consistent with what we're hearing is that there's this gradual rolling reopening and so you should start to see some leveling off? John Morris : Yes. No, I agree. And as Jim said, I think the big question is what's going to happen in those handful of buckets we spoke to, retail, public sector, et cetera, and how they're - what rate they're going to reopen. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then there was a number given and I'm not sure I heard it correctly so I want to ask the question. If I use 2019's commercial revenue of $3.47 billion, what percent - there was a 60% number you said somewhere in the call today. But what percent of that is deemed small business versus larger business? Devina Rankin : Commercial, we actually look at more by customer type rather than size, so that's a difficult number to provide. But John can you give a little more color there. John Morris : Yes, Michael, we looked at it from a revenue and unit perspective. And what we said was is that if you look at office retail, the restaurants and the education bucket, that was about 65% to 70% of where we've seen the degradation in revenue and volume. Michael Hoffman : Okay, all right. That helps. And then, Devina, I apologize. I'm not sure I totally understood your SG&A comment about how you're adjusting. Would you mind explaining to me? This dumb country boy didn't quite get it. Devina Rankin : No. So our objective with SG&A, as with most of our discretionary cost categories and places that we know that we should be flexing, is to flex in response to the change in revenue that we see. And with SG&A, we think that given the mix between what we view as controllable versus what we view as required in order to run the business, we think that for every $1 decline in revenue that we see versus our planned levels, we can take out $0.10 of that $1. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's what I thought I heard. I just wasn't sure. Okay. And then is the headquarter move still planned for the fourth quarter? Or does this throw a monkey wrench into that? John Morris : No. It's still planned. I mean, we have a signed agreement with them and so we're still planning on moving. And I think the interesting part will be, as we look at kind of a new normal with work-from-home, is do we use all the floors that we're committed to? You can imagine that Houston is not a great commercial property market right now, but we would - maybe we sublease out. We're not going to be able to sublease it out for top dollar but maybe we sublease out a floor. It really is going to be dependent on how many of our corporate office employees decide to or we decide that those jobs are better fit in a work-from-home environment. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then, Devina, of the total dollars of direct labor spent in 2019, what percent of that was overtime? Devina Rankin : It's about 15%. And based on what we got out, which John mentioned earlier, was 50%. We've actually seen it trend even higher with about a 60% reduction. We think if you held on to that level of cost reduction, you could see $150 million to $185 million of flex if for some reason you see this continue. I think what's most important there is that we've learned some things about how to optimize our driver hours in this pandemic, and we've learned things about what our drivers want as well. And whether it be trying to manage ourselves to more like a 45-hour work week so that overtime becomes less a part of our normal cost of doing business, there are steps that we can be taking to optimize the long-term cost structure. James Fish : I think, Michael, the - yes, the interesting thing about - particularly about hourly labor and overtime is that we went through a fairly quick but thoughtful approach to the 40-hour backstop that we provided. And I think initially, there was some concern that, \"Oh, my gosh, what are you doing there?\" But interestingly, that has - there's been a pretty minimal cost of that backstop. Recognize what that is, it really is protecting their job, not protecting their paycheck where it was pre-COVID. So all this overtime that John and Devina have talked about, they recognize that, that would come out. As Devina just said, in some cases, drivers are saying, \"You know what, I actually would rather work 44 hours a week as opposed to 53 hours a week.\" So it has been interesting. And I think what we're seeing is that as opposed to just taking a - giving an hourly increase for all hourly employees, which, by the way, is going to be tough to get back once this thing ends, we decided that we would provide a backstop so it protects their jobs. It doesn't protect their pay. And it has been incredibly well received. I mentioned on an interview that - I mean, we've had some people that have sent notes to me that honestly, if they were - it felt like they were crying through their email. They were so happy that they at least knew that I have my job protected. John Morris : Michael, the last point I'd put on that with regard to 40 hours, the other thing it's going to do is as we start to recover, we've got capacity in this system with those employees where we flex down the overtime. And the thing that's been really interesting, attendance and morale have never been better. And frankly, our safety results have improved and we had a really good first quarter. And we've rolled in April and had even better results in April. You could argue, it's less traffic, all those other things. But I think we're seeing the best out of our employees and they're performing exceptionally well. Devina Rankin : Absolutely. James Fish : So why don't we move on? We've got - it looks like we still have 6 or 7 folks left. Michael Hoffman : Can I just ask 1 last question, Jim, if I may? James Fish : Sure. Michael Hoffman : Why pay terms for Advanced Disposal under the circumstance? James Fish : Why - I'm sorry, say that again. Michael Hoffman : Why pay the current terms for Advanced Disposal, given what this pandemic has met? Why do that? James Fish : Well, look, I mean, honestly, Michael, we really don't talk about those details on any acquisition, whether it's ADS or a $10 million acquisition. So I mean, I'd love to be able to answer that for you but we just don't talk about those, and we'll talk about that after the fact. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc. Sean Eastman : I'll just ask one so we can - you guys can get back to work. I guess just going back to the Analyst Day last year, there was talk about the rise of cities, the rise of urban environments. Clearly, some of those population growth patterns could change coming out of this. And I'm just curious whether that's something you're thinking about. And just kind of how nimble you can be around how you strategize around that type of shift. John Morris : Yes, Sean. There's been a lot of talk about this urban versus rural kind of math, and we've certainly gone back and looked at it. And the interesting part of it is, is that we can certainly find correlations. You look at places like New York, New Jersey, Seattle that have been hit pretty hard by this pandemic. You can certainly see the impact it's had on volumes there and also maybe a little bit - they're going to be slower to recover, right, because they're still under these pretty strict stay-at-home orders or shelter-in-place. That really has been the learning for us. The learning has been not urban versus rural, but it's been about where have cities where municipalities gone into shelter-in-place orders earlier. And if you look at some of those, they've gone in earlier and that's where we've seen the volume. And I will tell you, we've looked to market by market. And where you would think there'd be a correlation, we've looked on the East Coast, the West Coast, Middle America, and what we have been able to correlate is it's really been about who went out early and how long they're going to stay out. And that's where we really see the shift in volume. It's been less about just strictly urban versus rural. James Fish : Yes. I mean, I think there's been - I mean, we - as John said, we looked at it really market by market. I mean, there are some places where big cities are down less than rural areas. Philadelphia is an example of that, where when I looked at Philadelphia, it was down less than Gilbertsville or Scranton or Harrisburg. So it's - it really is more about the business itself. It's more about the shutdown and it's not just that the urban areas are down more than the rural areas. There are some urban areas that are down more than rural areas such as Seattle. But there are also - I just couldn't find a strong correlation either way, because as I went through probably 7 of our areas, I found big cities that were down more than rural areas, and I found rural areas that were down more than big cities, and there was no rhyme or reason to it other than just business mix. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Jim, I know you've talked in the past, I think, as recently as a quarter or two ago about one of the best barometers for the outlook for the industry being the health of the U.S. consumer. And we've gone from record maybe 40-, 50-year low unemployment rates to 60-, 70-year high unemployment rates. And hopefully, it's all temporary. But just wondering if you think that's still the case, if you still think that we could kind of draw some parallels and tangents to what's going on in the labor market and the consumer sentiment and outlook and use that as sort of predictive indicators for where you think the industry is going. And taking that a step further, as you look out to next year, if unemployment rates remain elevated like a lot of people are forecasting, do you think that it's just going to be a little bit more of a prolonged recovery than just reopening some of the businesses in these phase 1, 2 and 3 sort of rollouts getting completed? James Fish : Yes. Boy, that's kind of a big crystal ball question, and I just don't know that I have a good answer for you. Here's what I would tell you as it relates to WM. I mean, I think that clearly, the consumers is going to be heavily impacted by this. My big worry, and this is just my own opinion, my big worry is that if we stay in this for too long, we are going to create some real long-term damage. And look, I'm not being insensitive to - I know you're in New York, and I'm not being insensitive to the people that have been affected by this virus, those families that have lost loved ones, I'm not. I'm just saying there is also a consideration on the other side, which is the long-term impact of this. Not just the long-term economic impact, but the long-term health impact, the long-term impact on things like clinical depression and things like that. So what it - how it relates to our business is that I do think those - this has been a pretty common theme this morning, but those that will be most impacted, the longer we go with this will be those small businesses because they - there was a report out yesterday that said, if this goes 6 months, that 40% of small business could be at risk of closure. Look, that's going to affect us. That's going to affect the Republic. That's going to affect everybody in every industry. I think as we think about our own business, the good news is that we do have a big landfill business that is largely driven by 2 groups, not exclusively, but largely driven by the residential business with third-party MSW and largely driven by special waste and C&D. And as I said earlier, those are big businesses. So I think the landfill business will emerge from this. How fast? I don't know, but it will emerge from this more quickly than other lines of business for us and other industries, honestly. And I think - I would say the same about the roll-off business for us for all the reasons that I just gave. As I've said several times this morning, the one that is going to be the most difficult one to predict is that commercial line of business. And I just don't know what happens with schools, what happens with airlines. And of course, that whole hospitality space is a massive question at this point. Does it ever return to where it was with rental cars and airlines and hotels? So I do think though that as cities and states start to reopen like Texas is reopening. We went to a restaurant on Saturday, pretty full. I mean, not inside. It was outside seating only but pretty full. And so I think you'll - those states that are able, from a health standpoint, to come out and emerge with kind of 2 months of damage, look, I think we can deal with a two month snowstorm. But if this thing is a 9-month snowstorm, boy, that's going to be hard to recover from. So I think the long answer to your very short question, it's really going to depend on these reemergence plans and how quickly we're able to reemerge, and that is going to most impact the commercial line of business. Hopefully, that's helpful. Brian Maguire : Yes, it's very helpful. I know we're running long. I just had one quick one just procedurally on how you're going to count some of the small business volume that's being suspended and some of the - I don't know if you call it a rent holiday for the month of April for folks. Is that coming in as a volume number or as a metric on yields? And any sense kind of how many - how much of the small container business might be able to apply for that sort of rent holiday? James Fish : Are you talking about the month of service there, the free month of service? Brian Maguire : That's right. James Fish : Yes, that's going to show up as price really. And that's why I said I want to caution about what it says with respect to price discipline. I mean, I don't want somebody to freak out in Q2 when we show a price number and it doesn't look very good because we've given a free month of service. By the way, just to give a little bit of context around that. It is not necessarily the month of April. It would be the first month that they come back and reestablish service. So - and it's not all small customers. It is - it's those customers that were forced into some type of impact by this. If your business had no impact, if you're a small health care facility and your business is up or if you're a small grocery store, then you're not - you don't participate in this because you weren't impacted by it. But if you come back and start your business back up as a restaurant, and you previously were 5-days-a-week service or - and now you're going to be 2 days a week, then we give you the 2-day-a-week service for that month in your first month. We're not going to give you a free month and a credit for whatever your bill was back in November. John Morris : Brian, I would just say we met - we said in the beginning, right now, a little bit less than 10% of our commercial customers, total commercial customers have been affected by this. So it would obviously be a subset, a small subset of that number. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Sorry, I was having a hard time getting on the call so if you addressed this, I'm sorry. But John, I do want to come back to the pricing commentary. I appreciate your philosophy hasn't changed. Are you seeing anything irrational from small haulers or other landfill operators? And are you hearing about service failures for small haulers are then simply exiting the market? John Morris : So Jim did comment on that specifically, Tyler, in the beginning. And again, we're 7 weeks into this and I don't think there's been anything out of the ordinary that we've observed. I'm not going to comment on what other folks are doing. I can just tell you that whether it's our collection pricing discipline. I spoke to our post-collection pricing discipline. By the way, the cost structure in those spaces has obviously has not subsided so we're going to continue. I think the way to look at this is you just heard the commentary from Jim about the small business. We're going to pause on a subsection of our customers to help them through this tough time. But our strategy around recovering costs to protect, in particular, our landfills and our collection lines of business is not changing. James Fish : And Tyler, to your second question, I have not - I haven't heard of any small horse throwing in the towel. I mean I think because we're all considered an essential service, my guess is that it's not as if you're going from full revenue to 0 revenue like some of these businesses are. Tyler Brown : Yes. Okay. So this is my big picture question. I hate to come back to residential, but is residential basically having a national sword moment? And what I mean by that is resi has already been struggling. The last call in Q4, you said it's your worst-performing collection line. Margins are down 50% from the past 5 to 10 years. Now you've got surge in container weights and it feels like that paradigm shifted. I know it's early, but why don't we need to go through a fundamental stair-step in resi pricing to relevel that field? John Morris : Tyler, I will tell you, you've heard me on the last 4 or 5 calls or since I've assumed this position, that is a focal area for me pre-pandemic. And obviously, we've got additional work to do now that we've referenced some of these container weights. And listen, we also - we're 7 weeks into this so a lot of what we're seeing is we're trying to see, as I mentioned earlier, where the bottom is or where the peak is on disposal volumes. And we're starting to see some signs that's going to mitigate. The real question is, how much is it going to be up permanently and how do we amend our strategy? What I can tell you is before this pandemic hit, we have dedicated resources around the organization that are focused on residential. What we've done is we've obviously had another chapter to their book here, that they've got to go have some difficult conversations with some municipalities. James Fish : John told me he left his car running in the parking garage and as soon as we're done here, he's heading over to meet with some of our municipalities. That's how urgent this is. I mean, we - half kidding there but half not. I mean, we have to - we - you're right, Tyler. We really do have to look at how - I mean, there's no reason to believe that all of a sudden, we're going to go back to pre-COVID on this. I mean, there are going to be a lot of people that are working from home permanently and waits for the... Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Kevin Chiang : Just one for me. Thanks for all the trend data. I just wondered if you could delineate that between urban, I guess, your rural markets. Are you seeing that broad-based in terms of a bottoming? Or urban markets may be showing a bottoming first? Because as you mentioned, they went down at the lockdown first, and rural markets are still trying to find the bottom. Just trying to get a sense of how you would maybe look at those two markets separately. John Morris : No. I would tell you that where the - the urban markets, obviously, we referenced a few of them where they've gone out earlier and so they got to their bottom quicker. And as I said, we're starting to see a flattening and some slight signs of improvement. In the rural markets, we've also seen some declines. And as Jim mentioned, he referenced a bunch of specific markets we've looked at. And there's no clear correlation that just because one is rural or one is urban, that the volume decline has been faster or longer in between those two. I think what we are confident in is I think we are - have found most of the bottoms and where we haven't, it looks like we're at least at the flat part of the curve. And we're optimistic we're going to start seeing volume increases there in the near term. James Fish : Yes. I think kind of the same answer there that we gave before in terms of not seeing real trends that were discernible. I mean, I did look again at some data yesterday. I had a look at San Antonio and Austin. Those happen to be two big cities that are not down as much as some of their rural counterparts, at least for us. And so in terms of the bounce-back, because Texas is now in phase 1, I wanted to see whether these cities are coming back more quickly. Houston, which is down more than San Antonio, and Austin, does appear to be, at least for us, appear to have more bounce back to it. And when I looked at Houston versus some of its smaller rural counterparts, yes, I mean, I guess, in some cases, it's bouncing back quicker but it's just really hard to tell because Houston was - is a big city. San Antonio is a big city yet San Antonio was down barely double digits in some of these metrics, whereas Houston was down closer to the numbers that John gave. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Mark Neville from Scotiabank. Mark Neville : I'll keep it to one. I guess my question, just around - I appreciate sort of the lack of visibility and the suspension of the outlook. Again, to your point, it sounds like some of the data is getting a little bit better. Devina, I think you referenced, just on the CapEx, was a 10% drop this year. So I guess my question, just curious how you got to that number. I guess what I'm thinking is if you were thinking earnings cash flow would be down something significantly more than that, maybe there's more room to flex that line or that spend. So yes, I guess I'm just curious around the CapEx, sort of how you got to the 10%, and that's sort of a fair way to think about your early thoughts on what the year might look like? Devina Rankin : Yes, sure. So what I want to start with is that the 10% isn't inclusive of intentional investments that we may make in advancing those initiatives that Jim spoke to earlier. That's more in our volume-oriented business. And so when we thought about how we targeted a capital expenditure reduction that we thought was appropriate based on what we were seeing for the year, we looked at those volume numbers that we've talked so much about over the course of the call. And so whether it be industrial volumes or landfill volumes, which we've talked about being down double digits, that was the barometer that we used to then pull back to the capital category and say what level of flex do we think is appropriate. If we see a rebound in industrial flex, we can turn it back up. What we want our shareholders to understand is that the company is going to be responsive and diligent in managing its cash flows, and that includes investing capital for the long term because these are long-term investments that need to be prudent, not just for today but for the foreseeable future. When we think about capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue, we think maintenance capital is in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%. We've trended higher in recent years because we've seen healthy volume growth. And so in this environment, what we thought was prudent is to look at a 10% target as kind of our baseline, and we'll adjust that as appropriate if we see volumes rebound quicker than we might project today. Mark Neville : Okay, that's fair. And again, sort of the - I just want to clarify the point, the 10% down but there would be some special investments, sort of that would bring that - it would be down less than 10%, I guess? Is that correct? Devina Rankin : It could be, yes. We're in the early phases of evaluating those investments so I can't specifically quantify what we think that will be, but that 10% is exclusive of those investments. Operator : I'm seeing no more questions in queue. Please continue. James Fish : Yes. Thank you very much, Blue. So lastly, I just want to say, as I always do, thanks to our 45,000 employees who really have continued to represent the best that this company is. And you've heard me speak about this many times. You've heard me speak about it today, but our commitment to putting our people first during this truly, truly unprecedented time has never wavered. And I think it's shown through during this - our leaders certainly have shown up in ways that I honestly had never seen and have really, I think, unified our efforts to just not compromise on our commitments to our people, to our customers and to our shareholders. And with that, I mean, I couldn't be prouder of our management team and of all of our 45,000 people. We're still working through what the new normal looks like, but I can assure you that Waste Management will come out of this stronger on the other side. Thank you very much for your time this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for participating.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ed Egl, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Edward Egl : Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You will hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover high level financials and provide strategic update. John will cover an operating overview, and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. We will also be discussing our updated financial outlook for 2020. This outlook excludes transaction and advisory thoughts and post closing financial contribution resulting from our pending acquisitions of Advance Disposal Services Incorporated which maybe also referred to ADS. Once we complete this acquisition we expect to provide updated outlook. All forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs. John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which, unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the first quarter of 2019. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA margin and SG&A expenses have been adjusted to enhance the comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations, including costs incurred in connection with the pending acquisition of ADS. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release and tables, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information of our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections.

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James Fish : Thanks, Ed and thank you for joining us. The strength and resilience of our business was clearly demonstrated in the second quarter as our results exceeded our expectations. At the outset of the quarter governments and businesses across the continent were responding to the pandemic with stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of broad sections of the economy resulting in sharp volume declines in our collection and disposal business. Our immediate priorities were protecting our employees and providing safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. With a framework in place to achieve those early priorities we then focus on optimizing our business for the new environment and we saw measurable improvements as we progressed through the quarter. Year-over-year declines in operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business improved each month of the quarter as we were able to successfully flex down our operating costs, eliminate discretionary spending and improved productivity. I am extremely proud of our team. Clearly the shutdown of the entire economy had a dramatic impact on the top line of our business. Yet even with a 10% decline in our second quarter revenues our team was able to improve operating expenses as a percent of revenue by 30 basis points, hold SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue relatively flat and most importantly deliver 10 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. As we progress through the third quarter we are firmly confident in our operating model and are well-positioned to deliver on the revised expectations we have for the remainder of the year. Our second quarter results prove that putting our people first so they can take care of our customers communities and the environment is the right approach to ultimately rewarding our shareholders. Putting people first is fundamental not just to our ESG philosophy but to our business strategy. On our first quarter call, we discussed the actions we took to protect our employees\u2019 health, safety and financial well-being. We also took steps to support our customers particularly the small and medium-sized businesses that have been impacted most adversely during the COVID-19 pandemic. We helped our customers right-size their service levels, temporarily paused price increases, extended payment terms and gave a free month of service to qualifying open market small and medium business customers. While these actions had a short-term impact on our price metrics, we've strengthened our customer relationships and increased customer loyalty. Our customer churn for the second quarter was our lowest on record at 6.9%. We've also seen significant increases in our net promoter scores; a measure of customer loyalty. Overall, second quarter net promoter scores increased 82% and our commercial line of business score tripled. We are now turning our focus to the longer term to ensure that we come out of this pandemic a stronger more differentiated company. At our investor day last year we laid out our plan to continue to invest in technology to enhance our customers experience with us and increase the lifetime value of a WM customer. At that time we felt we had a strong plan to achieve some big technology wins over the next several years. However, during this pandemic several things have become abundantly clear to us. First, our customer service digitalization investment otherwise referred to as CSD is unquestionably the right approach. This end-to-end digitalization of our entire customer experience from the first customer contact to the service confirmation will be unmatched and as we've seen during COVID-19, the companies with a superior end-to-end online model will truly be differentiated in the post-COVID world. Second, it became very clear to us early in this pandemic that when we all move in unison as one organization towards the accomplishment of a goal. There is nothing we can't accomplish and accomplish quickly. No one within waste management thought we could move thousands of employees to a work from home environment in one week's time but we did it. This gave us confidence that we can be more ambitious and agile when it comes to technology advances. That's why we are now accelerating our efforts around CSD. Using the onboard units, the smart truck platform and our data analytics capabilities all of which we've discussed for several years, we will seamlessly connect all the WM functions required to service our customers, so we can give them a completely digitalized customer experience. This will put us on par with other great companies and other industries who have separated themselves through their own digitalization efforts. We'll have more details as we roll this out but we expect to see some early wins this year. And finally we're excited about the milestone we reached on the advanced disposal acquisition last month. At the end of June we announced a revised agreement with ADS. Additionally, earlier this week we and ADS entered into an agreement to an amendment to the previously announced agreement with GFL environmental and GFL is now contracted to purchase all anticipated regulatory divestitures for $863.5 million. We expect both transactions to close by the end of the third quarter of 2020 once we receive regulatory approval and the approval of the ADS shareholders. With all the additional work we've done since the deal was announced in April of 2019 we're confident in our projection to achieve more than $100 million in synergies even though divestitures are greater than we originally expected. We are looking forward to completing this transaction, integrating the ADS team and operations and creating long-term value for our shareholders as we add 3 million additional customers to our platform and service capabilities. Turning to our full year outlook, our second quarter results combined with the early stages of economic recovery provided greater clarity for our 2020 financial results. This has allowed us to again provide full year guidance based on current economic conditions and before the contribution from ADS. We now expect a revenue decline of between 4% and 5% when compared to 2019, adjusted operating EBITDA margin in the range of 28% and 28.5% and free cash flow approaching $2 billion; again completely exclusive of the impact from ADS. Our impressive cost flexing in the second quarter combined with the recovery from the reopening of North America both of which we anticipate will carry into the back half of the year mitigates what certainly would have been a more significant impact from the pandemic. In closing, despite the challenging backdrop we're confident in our ability to continue to meet our commitments to our customers and deliver solid 2020 results. During these unprecedented times our business model has once again proven its resilience and we remain focused on using this opportunity and our technology investments to create a differentiated customer experience that puts our customers at the center of everything we do to increase workplace flexibility for our people. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim and good morning everybody. Our team has remained focused on the fundamentals of providing safe, reliable and efficient service to our customers despite the challenging backdrop. Our focus on execution paid off in the second quarter as we improved efficiency across the commercial, industrial and residential lines of business. By calibrating our cost to the current volume environment we achieved total company operating EBITDA of 28.8%, a 10 basis point improvement over 2019. The volume recovery trend we are seeing is encouraging. Volume declines in the collection and disposal business improved throughout the second quarter. Through the first few weeks of July we've seen further volume improvements despite certain areas of the country slowing their plans to reopen. We've adopted a proactive approach to service restoration and to-date we have resumed service for more than half of the commercial and industrial volumes that were suspended with the March shutdowns. While we are seeing some markets recover faster than others we are encouraged that commercial businesses, the backbone of the U.S., economy are showing strong signs of recovery. While residential container weights have declined from their peak increases they are still elevated by mid single digits when compared to last year. This strengthens our case with municipalities as we work to improve the profitability of our residential business and change the structure of residential contracts. It'll take some time to reshape this business but we are making headway. Turning landfill volume, external volumes for the quarter were down a little more than [18%] or around 13% if you adjust for natural disaster volumes in 2019 similar to what we experienced with our collection volumes our landfill volumes improved throughout the quarter with June being the best month down 11% compared to June of 2019 adjusted for work days and natural disasters. Looking specifically at MSW volume which tends to be the most resilient and a good indicator of trends particularly during a recovery the quarter was downright at 9 % while June improved to a 3.5% decline. Moving to pricing, we have taken intentional customer focus steps to help our small business customers in this tough economic climate which we believe will generate long-term customer loyalty and we're already seeing signs of it in our numbers. As Jim mentioned our net promoter score has increased. We took these steps knowing that there would be downward pressure on pricing metrics in the second quarter but we see these consequences as short term as we stay disciplined in executing our pricing programs. Second quarter core price was 1.3%. This includes almost 3% core price in the landfill business and 3.1% in the transfer business as we continue the positive momentum with post-collection pricing initiatives. We remain committed to the pricing discipline we have worked hard to instill to cover our rising costs and protect our margins. In July court prices started to trend back toward pre-pandemic levels. Our impressive cost pricing drove the solid results for the quarter. We improved operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. The team increased efficiency across all collection lines of business along with significantly decreasing overtime hours, reducing routes and optimizing the fleet. Overtime costs decreased 30% in the collection line of business in the second quarter driven by reductions in the commercial and industrial businesses. With regard to maintenance, our focus on asset utilization for our fleet is yielding results. We reduced downtime by 23% the second quarter achieving 99% fleet availability. Year-to-date the improvement in downtime hours has resulted in $5 million of savings. We're also flexing down our post-collection operating costs by reducing variable expenses such as overtime and heavy equipment operating hours. Second quarter overtime costs decreased by 39% across the landfill, transfer and recycling businesses. The team has done a good job of managing costs through this pandemic and we expect that to continue through the second half of 2020. And lastly, let me briefly touch on recycling. The good news that in the second quarter we continue the trend of approving operating EBITDA for the business. For the quarter we improve the bottom line by nearly $8 million driven by a stronger blended commodity rate of $57 ton; our focus on operating expenses and continued progress toward a fee for service model. We remain confident that our strategy for recycling including our recent investment in MRF technology in Chicago is pushing our recycling business toward operational, environmental and economic sustainability. So overall our second quarter results exceeded our expectations as we demonstrated our ability to proactively manage our operations in uncertain times. I am extremely proud of the hard work of the men and women on the front lines who were instrumental in flexing costs down while continuing to provide high quality service to our customers. And with that I will now turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our second quarter financial results and full year outlook. Devina Rankin : Thanks John and good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter financial results which reflect the resilience of our business model, the strong execution of our front line team members who safely and efficiently serve our customers and communities each day and the solid proactive steps our team has taken to manage costs and capital expenditures in this dynamic environment. Our strong performance in the second quarter positioned us to deliver on our top financial priorities of strong adjusted EBITDA margins and robust net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. As we started to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on our business several months ago we quickly focused on the EBITDA margin impacts that revenue declines in our highest margin industrial, commercial and landfill lines of business might have on our near-term results. We initially estimated that 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins could be impacted by as much as 100 basis points. In the second quarter of 2020 which we expect to have the toughest revenue comparisons of the year we managed costs to deliver an adjusted EBITDA margin that meaningfully exceeded those initial expectations. With the benefit of this strong performance in our economic outlook we now expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 28% to 28.5% or flat to down 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Our strong adjusted EBITDA result is the largest single contributor to our cash flow results in the second quarter. Our net cash flow from operations was $856 million or about 24% of revenue in the quarter. As we saw at the end of March there is pressure on working capital from slowdown in customer receipts which we attribute to customers taking steps to protect their own financial positions. We are taking proactive steps to work with our customers to ensure that these pressures on working capital are managed and balances are collected for services provided. In spite of these efforts, we expect that a delay in the timing of cash receipts from customers could create an $80 million to $100 million headwind in the working capital contributions to free cash flow in 2020. Our operating cash flow for the quarter also reflects the impact of the deferral of payroll tax payments as provided for by the CARES Act. This deferral benefited our current quarter cash flow by about $40 million and we expect the full year benefit to be $125 million. Second quarter capital spending was $436 million, $142 million lower than the second quarter of 2019. While we continue to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business, we have decreased our capital spending to align with the current economic outlook. The majority of the targeted reductions were the result of adjustments in landfill cell construction schedules and a decrease in the purchase of steel containers. We will not reduce the amount of capital allocated to our fleet in 2020 but are considering the current volume environment as we finalize our planning for truck builds and deliveries in 2021. At the beginning of the second quarter we targeted a 10% decrease in capital spending from the initial range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion for 2020. The team has worked hard to execute on this plan for focused and disciplined reductions in capital expenditures and in spite of the volume recovery that's tracking above our prior expectations and our plan to accelerate the pace of CSD we expect to deliver on this goal and have revised our 2020 outlook for full-year capital expenditures to between $1.55 billion and $1.65 billion. In the second quarter of 2020 our business generated $423 million of free cash flow. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 our cash conversion was in the low 40% range an increase compared to the second quarter of 2019. For the full year, we expect our solid operating performance and disciplined capital spending to yield free cash flow approaching $2 billion excluding the impacts of ADS. As a reminder when we originally established our 2020 free cash flow outlook we excluded impacts of ADS including advisory and integration planning costs from the target. We plan to provide a more complete view of the free cash flow impacts of the acquisition post close. Through June 30th our operating cash flow and free cash flow included $45 million paid for integration planning efforts. Our strong free cash flow positions us to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we pay $230 million in dividends. We remain fully committed to our dividend program, a strong balance sheet that provides certainty through any economic cycle and balanced allocation of remaining available cash to strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. In the near term, as we further develop our outlook for volume recoveries and position ourselves for a successful close of the ADS acquisition, we will continue to conserve cash and focus on a modest deleveraging towards our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times total debt to EBITDA. Turning to SG&A costs. Second quarter SG&A was $353 million, a decrease of $32 million compared to the same period last year. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 9.9% despite the significant revenue decline in the quarter. These results include lower incentive compensation accruals as well as the steps we have taken to reduce discretionary spending in response to business impacts related to COVID-19. Even as the business environment begins to improve we're maintaining extreme discipline and evaluating our ongoing level of spending for non-essential costs such as consulting, travel and entertainment. Our cost management actions were partially offset by an increase in our bad debt expense of $12 million in the quarter. In light of the trend we have seen in our receivables and the acceleration of CSD which will increase SG&A spending in the back half of the year, we expect full year adjusted SG&A to be slightly higher than 10% of revenue. We're confident we're on the right path with CSD to continue to differentiate our service and provide long-term value to our customers and shareholders. Finally, our strong balance sheet and liquidity position us well for the current economic environment as well as funding the acquisition of ADS. Current and forecasted post-acquisition leverage ratios are well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facilities and we have more than $3 billion of available capacity under our primary revolving credit facility. Additionally, this week we closed on a $3 billion, 364 day revolving credit facility that positions us to immediately fund the transaction it closed and then look for the right window to access the capital markets for long-term financing alternatives. Our solid financial results this quarter demonstrate both the resiliency of our business and the success we are having in dynamically managing our costs. I want to thank the entire Waste management team for their hard work which allows us to deliver on our commitments to our customers, communities and shareholders. With that Marianne let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs. James Fish : Good morning Brian. John Morris : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is [indiscernible] for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate the color and the details you provided so far on the exit rate volumes for 2Q and how things were looking in June and it sounds like things maybe are still sequentially improving through the first two weeks of July but just something maybe if you could quantify any of those numbers and amongst the different lines of business if you could. James Fish : Sure I mean we are to your point seeing July continue to accelerate albeit at a slightly slower pace. I mean look at this kind of went from zero to not 70 miles an hour but probably zero to 60 miles an hour pretty fast and now we're moving back towards 70 miles an hour. The one area that John focused on was really MSW that has really been impressive. The second area that's and we're down 3.5% in MSW. The other one that was surprising to us because we expressed some concern about it in the first quarter was commercial and at its low point the commercial line of business was down as much as 15% even more in some areas and that has returned to down kind of 5% or 6%. So it's really rebounded and it continues now through July to show improvement. The one that kind of is starting to jump a bit right now that's good for us is special waste. It had been down even through June it had been down pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis and when I looked at the rolling week numbers which compared to prior year just yesterday those numbers are starting to really show improvement in special ways. So we're now actually up double digits there in special waste where we have been down deep in the double digits previously. So we are pleased with the progress we're showing on virtually all of our waste streams and our collection lines of business. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate those details. Certainly it's encouraging. And then maybe if I could just get just the updated guidance for the year for 2020 with the revenues expected to be down 4% to 5%, just hoping maybe if you could help us better understand kind of the moving parts there. Does that basically assume that pricing yields or holds flat from 2Q levels for the rest of the year and maybe just the moving parts between pricing yield and volume and what your expectations are there? Thank you. Devina Rankin : Yes. It's a great question. We're not specifically giving outlook for the back half of the year on the price and volume components but what I would say Jim just gave tremendous color with regard to the improving volume outlook and I think that coupled with the fact that the Q2 execution on pricing was intentional and focused on being customer-centric and so we certainly expect an improving result in the back half of the year on price. So you can expect that the yield component gets back to closer to normal levels or outlook for 2020 and an improving volume trend. When we look at the back half specifically we're projecting that you have a decline in revenue of in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% and that's more significant in Q3 and then tapers in Q4 to about half the Q3 levels what we're projecting. I do want to point out particularly given what we're seeing in the market today that fuel prices did have a 2% impact on the revenue line in Q2; difficult to predict that specifically. We weren't predicting any added pressure on the top line from fuel in the back half of the year but that's certainly out of our control and not necessarily representative of the strong execution of the business which we're really encouraged to see the momentum that we saw at the end of Q2 and beginning into Q3. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. I appreciate all the details. Thanks. Good looking quarter. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin, RBC Capital Markets. James Fish : Hi Walter. John Morris : Good morning. Walter Spracklin : Yes. So I'd like to start with margins obviously you've guided two impressive cost control doing much better than what you had thought you would be able to do which is great. Just curious on the structural nature of this when volumes start to come back can we see operating leverage such that you can maintain and you alluded to a better organization or a strong organization post-COVID. Does that mean you can run and you expect to run at margins above historical trends once advanced disposal is integrated or would you see that when volumes come back resources would have to come back as well and get you back to more normalized kind of historical levels? Devina Rankin : Yes, Walter I will start this one. I think it's a really interesting question rather than specific on post ADS margin, I am going to focus really on WM based business because we're going to wait to give any financial outlook for the integration of ADS until post-closed but when we think about the strong margin execution in the second quarter, I mean hats off to our operators and the front line for doing a tremendous job and I think what you saw in those results is that we got the most expensive hour out of the route and we got the most expensive truck off of the street and so through efficiency, through improved maintenance, improved downtime there were really fundamental tremendous improvements in the operating nature of the business and those are things that the team is working hard to see how we hold on to in a post-COVID environment with improvement in volume outlook in commercial and industrial collection. I do think the residential collection margin impacts that we've talked about we're focused more on the price side of that equation to be sure that we recover the increase in our cost to serve but looking for efficiency in that part of the business as well. In terms of the strong execution in Q2 and how we think about that for the remainder of the year, I think the improving volume trends and price, price is really an important piece of that because we delivered this margin result in spite of having lower contributions from core price which we see really flow all the way through on margin. So particularly impressive when you consider that aspect. There are certain elements of the cost structure that increase in the back half of the year as an example fuel tax credits were something that we got a benefit for in the fourth quarter of 2019 instead of that being a second half of the year phenomenon this year those are spread, those benefits are spread over the course of the year. So that has some margin pressure in the back half as does the increased acceleration of spend on CSD which Jim spoke about. So really strong execution in operations and we expect that to continue particularly with the improving volume backdrop. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That's great and encouraging as well. So moving on to price I know you just alluded to it. Can you speak to what happened with core price as you mentioned you did not get the benefit of core price and what is the risk and how does it work that, you implied here that it is going to come back. Does that just come back because of the overall macro environment and easier to drive forward or is there something more detailed to that in addition to what you had mentioned with regards to residential and recapturing some of those higher volume through higher pricing. James Fish : Yes. I mean I think there's a couple of points to make here with respect to price and maybe the first one would be to your last point there I mean there is this price discipline that we've talked about this morning that remains. We certainly haven't lost any price discipline but we felt like that it was absolutely the right approach to take during the quarter to pause on these price increases and some fees and also to really help small business emerge out of this by giving them a free month of service. I mean I can't imagine if I were a small business owner sitting in my living room opening my mail and getting my big price increase from waste management. I mean that would not have gone over well with me as a small business owner. So it was unquestionably the right approach to take in Q2 and honestly into Q3 that will persist to a to a lesser degree because some of these small businesses have not reopened and what we told them with respect to the free month of service was that we would give you a free month of service once you reopen. So I'm sitting in downtown Houston and there are a lot of small businesses that have not opened in the central business district here. I suspect it's the same in other big cities. So we will still see some of that weakness in pricing but point that I think Devina was really touching on was that when you think about price discipline and once we get past this short-term [COVID] effect, the price discipline is still there. John talked about it too in terms of landfills and transfer. That is something that is truly ingrained in our culture and so we don't kind of kick that to the curb when COVID goes away that becomes immediately reestablished but there was of course in Q2 a big impact from this more kind of sympathetic approach to these customers and we'll see some of that in Q3 as well. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the time as always. Thanks. James Fish : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman, KeyBanc Capital. James Fish : Hi Sean. Sean Eastman : Thanks for taking my questions. So compliments on a good second quarter performance here. I just wanted to drill in on the second half. I mean, I am just trying to understand where you see the big swing factors in the second half \u201820. So visibility clearly improved around the volumes but I am just curious where you think some conservatism is still warranted in that second half outlook and just maybe where you guys don't want to get over your skis just yet as we think about trajectory here from a revenue margin perspective in the second half. Devina Rankin : Yes, Sean I will start that and then I think the others can add some color. I think the place that we start that discussion is on the top line and as I mentioned the outlook for the back half of the year is currently revenues being down 3.5% to 5.5%. When you look at how we finish June and see July coming together we do think that there is some potential for optimism in the top line results for the back half of the year but it's appropriate for us to be reserved and going too far in terms of how quickly we start to see the recovery certainly with the number of case increases that have been seen across the southern part of the United States and so that's really where that back half question mark starts but we feel really good that 4% to 5% is representative of how we'll finish the year. In terms of the cost part of the equation it really does come down to the operating cost leverage as the biggest driver. There are certain elements of cost over time being one of them which John spoke a lot about in terms of our ability to flex the number of overtime hours. That translated into $45 million dollars of operating cost savings in the second quarter and that's a tremendous result but ensuring that as we see volumes grow back and whether it be the efficiency part of the business, increased traffic on the roads, thinking about how we manage the work day that $45 million of savings is something that we have our eye on. Other elements of the labor line which is the biggest single component of our cost structure is really where we're focused. The pieces that are in SG&A we have at hand. I would tell you that the results that you saw in the second quarter we're confident that we can continue to deliver. As I mentioned, the increased investment in CSD in the back half of the year means that those costs will increase but that's an intentional investment for the long-term growth and customer-centric nature of our business. James Fish : Yes and one quick thing and I think John wants to touch on OpEx too but Sean, when you think about the conversation we just had about price, obviously it was uniquely soft. I mean -- but that softness dissipates over the next quarter or two back to much more of a normalized level of price increases and where we've been prior to COVID. So that certainly is upside for us but we knew the downside was going to be there and it was the right thing to do and then of course volume which we talked about earlier early on in this call and we think that volume while it has started to slow from the really steep increase that we saw in June it still is increasing and I talked about special waste showing some really nice improvement and then MSW and commercial industrial has lagged a little bit It showed a nice pick up but we are seeing some differences by geography and it's interesting when you look at the kind of the southern part of our network versus the northern part of our network, the northern part of our network whether it was the U.S. or Canada tended to shut down a bit more quickly and reopen a little later and so we think there is some real opportunity. I was in Boston a couple of weeks ago and honestly Boston for the first time since COVID really started -- is starting to feel open. I mean we were in restaurants eating inside and so those businesses are starting to reopen and so while  Boston and our New England area is still down relative to some of the areas in the south that will provide more of a kind of a spike upturn in volume for markets like New England, New Jersey, New York, those Pennsylvania. John Morris : Sean, the only thing I would add to your point about getting over our skis, I think when you look at and as Jim mentioned we're looking at this literally on a daily basis by region by line of business is making sure that we continue to hold tight on the reins in terms of adding costs back and I think when you look at some of the numbers we all referenced in our prepared remarks and even as late as yesterday looking at the ratio volume coming back and what we're still able to do on the cost side specifically over time as Devina mentioned that's the area where we are absolutely focused and I will tell you the ratios of volumes coming back versus overtime is still favorable. I think that's why when you think about us having the margins we had in Q2 compared to where we lost the volume which was really landfill, commercial and industrial for the team to hold those margins and there is puts and takes Devina mentioned some of them is really impressive but I think getting out over our skis that we are absolutely focused on making sure we keep the reins very tight on OpEx as we watch this volume shift. Sean Eastman : Got it. Super helpful. Next one for me hopefully a little quicker, could you help bridge us from the down 100 basis points year-over-year margin outlook you provided on the 1Q call to the revised flat to down 50 basis points? Just any granularity between the volume recovery, cost control in that bridge would be appreciated. Devina Rankin : Yes. I don't know that I can get super granular for you but what I would tell you is you've hit on two of the primary factors. So volume recovery outpaced our expectations and so that certainly had some upside impact on the margin decremental impact that we had originally predicted and then cost control particularly on the operating line was even better than expected based on what we know the margins of these lines of business to be. I mentioned over time specifically health and welfare costs are another example where we saw some value to the results from a granularity perspective I guess what I would tell you is that health and welfare by itself as an example is just one of those cost categories that's difficult to predict but it had a marked contribution and around 25 to 50 basis points is what we see as a benefit for the year in health and welfare costs alone. Sean Eastman : Appreciate it. Very helpful. Thanks for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari, Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just around the election. If U.S. tax reform goes away, is that a $300 million headwind to you. I guess, pre-tax reform, the free cash flow base I think was close to 1.7 billion then it went to 2 billion. There was a big step change and then you also have bonus depreciation potentially going away too. So maybe if you could frame for us how to think about that potential tax headwind clearly we don't know what will happen with the election. Devina Rankin : Yes. I think Hamzah that last point is really the most important one for us and rather than get too granular in terms of specifically measuring what we think tax reform could do. I think we all know that we went from a 35% rate to 22% and so that dramatic change in the tax rate to ongoing business that's going to have consequences the bonus depreciation that you mentioned could have consequences but just none of us are going to be able to predict the outcome of the election or then any follow-on impacts to tax policy should there be a change in a significant shift in and who's in office. So I think you've framed it well. I think all of the pieces that you mentioned are the ones that we are paying attention to and the level of impact to cash is something that is significant and therefore we'll have a close eye on that but not trying to predict it at this point. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Understood and then just on customer churn was pretty good. Traditionally, half of customer churn for the sector has been bankruptcies and so with stimulus running out, I appreciate your guided revenue growth down 4% to 5% but do you think that we're out of the words on commercial? Specifically do you think that small business bankruptcies are going to be a potential risk as you think about your revenue growth over the next 12, 13 months? Anything you're hearing from your customers or I realize you don't have a crystal ball but so any comments you can make high level would be appreciated. John Morris : Yes, Hamzah, this is John. So we've mentioned in early on when we were in the Q1 and the early innings of this that we were seeing cancellations just under 1%. We're seeing that numbers crept up to about 2.5, a little bit north of that but it's leveled out there. So we're not seeing big numbers in terms of cancellations. What we have seen what we talked about is obviously folks turning off their service or pausing their service and then gradually turning it back on. I think the one number we can center around is whether it's commercial or industrial we are over 50% recovered in terms of units and honestly if you look at commercial we all know education is a fairly good size chunk of our of the portfolio there and with the uncertainty there are actually our commercial recovery is over 60% if you net out the education facilities which we all know is kind of a moving target at this point. Hamzah Mazari : Good. Got it. Lastly I'll turn it over just on the ADSW transaction, synergy is over $100 million on a smaller revenue base maybe you could just frame for us where you're seeing the upside come from and the $100 million does not include revenue synergies correct? Thank you. James Fish : That's correct. What I would tell you Hamzah is obviously this process particularly around COVID is taking a little bit longer and I guess the silver lining is it's afforded us the opportunity to do that much more work and we have that much more confidence in our integration plans and it's given us the opportunity to look more closely at a granular level not just about kind of the normal SG&A corporate overhead synergies but really get in a little bit further into the details and have that much more confidence in what we're going to be able to execute against in the field and that's really what's driving that number. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thanks, Hamzah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kyle White, Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to some of the regional differences that you briefly touched on. Is it possible to describe how the recovery has progressed and some of the states that were first reopened and now are seeing a bit of rising COVID cases states such as Florida, Georgia or Texas. Have you seen any stalling in the recovery in these states? Any service declines in recent weeks? James Fish : So it's an interesting question that we expected to be asked today. When I look at our commercial line of business and I look at those states that you just mentioned so the big four kind of in terms of spike, case spike have been Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Florida and so when I look at three of those are our best three in terms of year-over-year comparisons. Our best three in terms of year-over-year comparisons right now are Texas, Georgia and Arizona. Those are the best three out of 17 areas. Those are the top three in terms of commercial yards year-over-year comparison. So I would tell you that the spike and when you walk around Houston what's happening is that everybody's wearing a mask but businesses have not all of a sudden gone back to April or May. They're staying open but people are just more diligent about wearing masks and we're starting to see those cases level off. I heard Scott Godley last week on a business council called Talk About the fact that you're starting to see it particularly in Arizona, Texas those cases level off. So our business is actually quite strong there and as I said just a few minutes ago where we've seen a little bit of a lag are in those areas that that closed pretty quickly and then have stayed closed the longest such as New England, such as kind of the greater mid-Atlantic area, Pennsylvania but those are also starting to show some rebounds as well particularly as they start to move where some of these other states already are which is a reopening of businesses just with kind of a mask rule in place. So we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing with respect to commercial reopenings. It's the one thing that probably stood out to us the most because we were least certain about it when we discussed it at the end of Q1. Kyle White : That's very helpful. I wanted to also go back to the pricing discussion a bit and just I'm curious if you could talk about the competitive environment and pricing behavior especially among some of the smaller players. Anything notably different recently as a result of the kind of volume impact that some of these players may be experiencing? James Fish : I mean look, we haven't seen anything over the last couple of months but I really can only speak to our own price discipline and I would tell you as I said earlier that we haven't lost an ounce of price discipline. What you've seen in terms of price erosion if you want to call it that was intentional and that we will recover. It's just we're getting ourselves to get through this hopefully this short-term impact from COVID. Kyle White : Sounds good. I'll leave there. Thanks. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown, Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey good morning everyone. Devina Rankin : Good morning Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey Devina, I hate to beat on the pricing optics here but can you isolate the revenue dollar impact that the price increase in fee suspensions had in the quarter? Devina Rankin : We hadn't specifically quantified that. I mean, I think the best way to think about it is the delta between the yields that we reported and the 2.5% guide that we would have given for the year and I think that delta is pretty representative of what you could say that the price impact was for the quarter. Tyler Brown : Okay. So not only, yes. Sorry go ahead. John Morris : I was just going to say the only thing, this is John, I would add is if you look at landfill and transfer station I would point you to that in terms of the where we've remained disciplined, I mean so the impact has really been commercial and industrial but the other lines of business we continue to show [white] performance. Tyler Brown : Right. So not only was there a dollar contribution that was unusually low but and correct me if I'm wrong here but you also had a bit of a denominator problem. I mean your volumes were down 10%. So I'm guessing that was also a driver in the pricing optics. So I mean just to be I mean I know there's been a lot of talk about this but to be just crystal clear there has not been a change in your fundamental pricing strategy? John Morris : Not at all. John Morris : Absolutely not. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then John, so I appreciate the resi container weight comments and I know we talked about this last quarter but what is the level of urgency around resi pricing specifically? I know you talked that it will take time but if I take a walk back in history, didn't you guys meaningfully move resi pricing? I think it was around the financial crisis if I recall. So can this be a material driver in \u201821? John Morris : Listen Tyler. I mean, we've talked about the added weights and the pressure that's put on the line of business. Here's what I can tell you is that, the additional weights that have come via this pandemic are certainly another discussion point we need to have with some of those residential customers but we started this program before that. Now I can't speak to what happened back the financial crisis. I'll trust you on that one I'm sure we probably had some efforts at the time. What I can tell you is that and Jim has mentioned this a few times we've seen obviously a lot of pressure on the residential line of business. We've seen margin erosion. My plan with the team and we have this down to the contract by region, by area to execute against long before this pandemic started. I will tell you what this pandemic has certainly helped us with is when you talk about further moving that line of business to automation containerizing being able to capture the waste, being able to price and get paid for the services including disposal that you provide for this is certainly an opportunity to highlight that. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. Yes. No, that's fantastic and then just my last one here Devina. So I know 2021 seems like it's a long way away but will the CARES Act represent call it an idiosyncratic headwind to cash flow next year? Is that something that we need to start contemplating? Devina Rankin : Yes, that's definitely something that we've got our eye on. The $125 million that I talked about for the CARES Act deferral, payroll taxes that's something that hits us in 2021 because you effectively have a doubling of that obligation in the year ahead but I think that, yes it's half of next year, half in 2021 and then another half in 2022. What I think is really important though is that the flow through impacts, the really strong revenue acceleration that you should start to see in 2021 as some of the COVID-19 volume impacts and those pricing policy decisions that we made in the second quarter, we anniversary those. I think the flow through of that to cash flow should help us to offset that year-over-year headwind but you're exactly right Tyler. James Fish : There is also somewhat of a corollary there on to the CARES Act with working capital on DSO. I mean we're obviously seeing an impact this year and that's not unexpected at all or not surprising at all. So you'd like to think that as we get into 2021 that DSO starts to normalize. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. No, that's very helpful. Thanks guys. Devina Rankin : Yes, thank you Tyler. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey, Baird. David Manthey : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Building on a previous comment last quarter you detailed the weekly upward trajectory of your roll off business as sort of evidence of the improvement you were starting to see and based on your comments I assumed that trend continued but in the geographies like there in Texas or here in Florida where the COVID cases have worsened, are you seeing actual declines in any lines of business or were you indicating you're just seeing a leveling off in the pace of recovery? A - James Fish : Yes. It's really the latter. We're not seeing declines in any line of business. We're seeing as I mentioned a nice increase in special waste some of that's through our couple of combustion residual projects but not seeing declines anywhere. It's just by geography, it's a leveling a little bit where we saw big big spikes up in June and it's starting to accelerate a little bit in some of those places that were slower to reopen. David Manthey : Okay. Thank you and last quarter you said that 10% of your commercial customers had a change in service and less than 1% canceled. Could you give us an update on those data points for the second quarter or in the same ballpark? James Fish : Yes. I mentioned earlier that the 1% number crept up to about 2.5% and is leveled off. There is a little higher than that to be exact but what we've seen is that is and those are the customers that have been impacted and identified as having a COVID impact. So 2.5%, 2.6%, I think is about right where we leveled off at in terms of cancellations. David Manthey : Thank you very much. James Fish : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye, Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. To start with Jim, you mentioned I think expecting to see I think you said some early wins from the CSD effort as you engage in an investment development but what types of customers do you expect are likely to value those offerings more any way to dimension out as well what you think this could contribute to organic growth? James Fish : Yes. I think there's going to be in the near term more of a cost impacts, bottom line impact and then more of a topline impacts longer term as we truly kind of differentiate ourselves and by the way it's why we kind of chose to accelerate is we have talked about, we talked about it in investor day last year. So this isn't a strategy that's unfamiliar to you. It's just one that we've chosen to accelerate for a couple of reasons. One is that we really felt like we learned that when we do accelerate something we can make it happen quickly for all as I said my script all in unison behind it. So I do think there will be some changes in how our customer does business with us and that will impact us a bit on the cost side and then over time we think that really starts to separate us from the pack. Noah Kaye : Yes. Thanks Jim and then just go back to the residential line of business, John I appreciate your commentary round levers for both pricing and technology investment but since you have got it's very granular plant, can you just maybe share with us the target or [indiscernible] profitability improvement in the residential line of business? Devina Rankin : I think what Jim has mentioned and Devina in another calls is that we have been sub 10% from an EBIT line and clearly getting well above that is the direction we are going to go. I certainly see opportunities to get into the high teens or 20% over time and we're making some headway and to be real specific I probably when Tyler asked the question. When I looked at even for Q2 with the elevated weights we still on the same store sales comparison made margin improvement quarter-over-quarter in Q2. So we feel really confident about that plan and I think the granularity is going to helpful for us as we look at the investment opportunities at residential line of business going forward to make sure we're deploying the dollars the right way and I've said on other calls we don't want to do it for practice. We're going to make sure you get the right returns, the right margins and the right protections in those agreements and in some cases we are going to have to make some tough decisions. We are fully going to do that. Noah Kaye : Perfect. Thanks. I will turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Silber, BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey Silber : Thanks so much. [indiscernible] I will ask just a couple of quick ones. You talk a little bit about pricing from a competitor's perspective. I'm just wondering are you seeing any smaller haulers close or under pressure that might provide some M&A tuck-in opportunity? John Morris : I don't know that I have seen or I haven't heard of any that of closed. I have heard of some places where they're running short on drivers. So that's not necessarily a great indication for them and that and I can't tell you whether that is a longer term trend which we've talked a lot about previously that Gen Z and millennials don't want to drive trucks and so therefore there's this pressure on the pool. I don't know whether that's it or whether it is or what the pressures are coming from but I have heard that. I have not heard though of any closures. Jeffrey Silber : Okay. That's very interesting on the drivers. One number you'll talk about much is internalization. I know it picks up the last couple quarters. Is that because we're seeing less third-party disposal coming in or are you truly disposing more of your own collected waste? Thanks. John Morris : It's probably a bit of both Jeff, this is John. I think at the table was up about 200 basis points given 180 basis points for the quarter, 190 year-to-date might have the inverted but almost 200 basis points. So clearly when we're seeing some volume pressure at the landfill we're always reevaluating what's the best use of our network and those landfill assets. So without having a number in front of me it's probably a combination of both some third-party volumes that went out in Q2 and our decision to backfill some of those volumes where it made sense for us. Jeffrey Silber : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman, Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Thank you Jim, Devina and John for the questions. Hope all of you and your families are well. James Fish : Thanks Michael. Devina Rankin : Thank you, Michael. Michael Hoffman : So I am going to ask the question different way Devina. Your original guidance was 2.5 for the year yield. You did two in the first quarter. If you hadn't have the pandemic what was the budget for a second quarter yield? And is that \u2013 Devina Rankin : Yes. We don't necessarily budget. We don't necessarily budget Michael our yield quarter-to-quarter. We certainly have that 2.5%. You saw some of the early impacts on the Q1 results that you just mentioned from COVID-19 because there were some early steps on fees as an example to proactively engage with the customers in the right way given what we were seeing. I would tell you we've tried to estimate where we think the yield number ends up coming in for 2020 and it's just a really difficult number because of the impact of units on the measure. So what we focus more on is that core price execution and we expect healthy recovery in core price execution in the back half of the year. Michael Hoffman : Okay. John, on recycling if the trend holds there's $80 million year-over-year gain in revenue in that business. But what I'm thinking about the 4% to 5% down revenue, I got to account for that and then there is a follow-on question about fuel. I got to account for to sort of think about the down revenue? John Morris : Well, I think Michael certainly there was a bit of a tailwind in Q2 with fiber prices specifically OCC going up but as you probably know we've already seen that retract back and while we had a good quarter in Q2 I would tell you just a little bit under half of that was driven by price the rest of it was really Brent and team doing a great job on managing operating expenses in SG&A and other ancillary costs. So that's what drove the other half of that improvement. So we're not, we still think recycling is going to be a tailwind in the back half of the year, not as big though because that revenue number is not going to hold through the balance of the year. We don't think. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then could you share with us what your fuel, average fuel cost was in 2Q, \u201820 versus \u201819 and then what it was in 3Q, \u201819 so we can try and accurately model that we can move that much. Devina Rankin : I can get you those specifics after the call Michael but what I would tell you is the fuel impact to the quarter was $60 million to the revenue line. Michael Hoffman : In 2Q? Devina Rankin : Yes. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then just the point of clarification on the synergies just to be clear it's a free cash flow number and it's a mixture of OpEx saving, interest expense savings, capital spending. We presume the interest expense number is up because rates are down versus the expectation and then there's some incremental gains we gathered in the OpEx or CapEx that's the way to think about the pieces. That's what I understand by it. James Fish : I would tell you Michael that obviously when we recut the deal which was really a month ago obviously there's a reduced purchase price. There is higher synergies that we commented on despite over $100 more million of divestitures and certainly there's going to be a lower cost to the CapEx but I will let Devina speak to the financing piece. Devina Rankin : Yes. I think what's really important Michael is that the $100 million in the confidence in the more than $100 million of synergies is not reflecting our savings in the interest line. The savings in the interest line is what we were thinking about in terms of the returns on disinvestment getting over our hurdle rate and cost of capital. It's early for us to be able to speak to specifically how much of an interest savings there might be but certainly when we look at the requirement to redeem the bonds and on a weighted average basis those were above 3.6% and if you compare that to current interest rates there certainly is some value to be had there. It's just too early for us to say. We are really excited to be in a position to be able to fund the transaction at close but this will be a phased process for us and we can't yet tell you what the long-term financing might look like. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. And then a mechanical question on the [vtoes] on the 25th assume DOJ gets that, so there's a consent order not far behind that or about the same time. What happens after that? Do you close it right away or is there, is this like dry and clean clothes at the end of September but just mechanically what are we looking at? John Morris : I mean, I am not sure I know the answer to that. I mean because there is a number of pieces here involved but well what we did say was that this would be the end of Q3 which basically means sometime between the August 25 and September 30 which is a pretty narrow window and it's hard though to say well we want to do it on a certain date because we just don't have enough certainty to say what we're going to do it at the end of a month or at the end of a quarter. That's not our objective. Our objective is to work through with the DOJ and of course with ADS and get this final. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Devina Rankin : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Devina Rankin : Good morning, Michael. Michael Feniger : Good morning. I will try to keep it short. Jim, I know you guys have moved away from CPI over the years. Can you just remind us on the CPI exposure? I understand you're driving at the residential level and different contracts but I'm just curious with the CPI? How much of that in your control really in the next 6 to 12 months? John Morris : Well, Michael it's John. I would tell you that if you look at our pricing performance regardless of what CPI has done over the last quarters, handful of years, we've moved further and further away from that I think the example he gave is probably the best one which is historically the residential or franchise pieces of the business have been tied to CPI or some fraction of that and I think our ability to drive 3% core price in residential especially in this quarter is evidence that we're moving further and further away from that. Michael Feniger : Got it and just like help me understand like when we talked about the top line, you guys provided a lot of color on Q3 versus Q4. How should we think of the business as we kind of like exit 2020 with the first half ? What we think is your mix of your businesses is when residential right now being your highest yield? How does that kind of impact the overall profitability going forward? James Fish : Well, it's a bit of a hard question because there is a lot in the mix here. I mean it is interesting though because in terms of a true kind of year-over-year comparative basis whether you're looking at EBITDA or whether you're looking at revenue or whatever you're looking at, I honestly don't think we get to a fair apples-to-apples year-over-year comparison until the first quarter \u201822 because I think \u201920. Obviously, \u201820 is disadvantaged and then \u201821 will be greatly advantaged versus prior year. So what we're kind of looking at is when do we get to a true positive comparison versus 2019 and I think that probably happens sometime maybe as early as Q2 of next year, probably won't be Q1 but certainly Q2 looks like it could happen or Q2 or Q3 is when I think we truly get to a positive comparison versus the same quarter in 2019 and then to your question about what pieces are going to be moving in the right direction we've talked about a whole lot of along the call this morning definitely residential John talked about kind of sub-10% EBITDA margins and a lot of work being applied to that. CPI is not representative really of our cost structure anymore and so starting to move municipalities away from that price metric for us, some of which John's talked a lot about I would tell you this is kind of all in John's court but start starting to institutionalize some of the changes that we've seen on the operations side and maybe the same is true for SG&A. There is some expense that we just don't need. We don't need to have as much travel expenses as we thought we did. The Teams product that we use a lot the Microsoft product is a very-very good product and so I think that'll be a replacement for that and then as we think about some of these wins that we've discussed with customer service digitalization that will start to really have positive impact on us. So there's a whole lot of pieces here that go into this but we think by the time we get to 2021 kind of mid-2021 we're going to start seeing some positive comparisons to that 2019 period. Michael Feniger : Understood. I will leave it there. Thanks Jim. James Fish : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang, CIBC. Please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one for me. I noticed that you changed your methodology for core price and that did result in a revision to your Q1 numbers. I was wondering it was this purely a methodology change or did this brings to light any untapped opportunities that you might not have been harvesting before in terms of pricing opportunities as you look ahead here and as volumes continue to recover? Devina Rankin : This was purely a measurement change and we had actually made the decision in the fourth quarter and then just made an error in reporting our Q1 with everyone in the work from home mode and forgot that we had made the change in the fourth quarter and reverted to our old measure but the only difference in this is we've got more precise data as we've been able to use technology more effectively across the network to measure units and as we got more precise we were able to give you a more accurate and representative measure of core price and that's what we're using today. Kevin Chiang : Perfect. Thanks for the clarification. Operator : At this time there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Fish for any closing remarks. James Fish : Thank you. So in closing today, I really want to reiterate what both John and Devina have said. I want to recognize the men and women in our operations around North America they have not missed a single day since the start of this pandemic and they are of course absolutely essential to keeping all of our streets clean, ensuring that we are good stewards of our environment through recycling, providing a safe reliable service that is absolutely critical to all citizens. So thank you to all of our men and women on our operations. And thank you all for joining us.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ed Egl, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Ed Egl : Thank you, Lindsay. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You will hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover high-level financials and provide a strategic update. John will cover an operating overview, and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules of the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs. John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which, unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume. During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2019. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA margin and SG&A expense results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations, including costs incurred in connection with the recently closed acquisition of ADS. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release and tables, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to open the call by welcoming the employees and customers of Advanced Disposal to the Waste Management family. We closed the acquisition last week, and we're excited about the opportunity ahead to create value from this deal. We're also pleased with a concurrent close with GFL Environmental on the divestiture package. I'd like to give credit to Richard Burke and the Advanced Disposal team for the great job they did, staying focused on operating their business safely and efficiently during the extended closed period. The next phase of our journey, the hard work of combining these two great companies has now begun. John will speak a bit more on this topic, but suffice it to say, we're very confident in the long-term value of the acquisition. And the integration is off to a great start. We're extremely pleased with our third quarter results, which were a testament, both to our team's ability to optimize our business in a new environment, as well as the progress of the economic recovery in North America. We've consistently pointed to operating EBITDA as the best measure of the health of our business. And despite the challenging backdrop, we delivered third quarter operating EBITDA results in line with last year's record performance and expanded operating EBITDA margin by 70 basis points. It's been said many times that great companies are able to emerge from tough times stronger than they were going in. In that vein, WM has learned this year that we can permanently operate our business with a lower cost structure. Despite a 2.7% decline in our third quarter revenues, the team was able to improve operating expense as a percent of revenue by 110 basis points and hold SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue relatively flat. This is the second consecutive quarter where we've demonstrated this flexibility in a difficult operating environment. And we're committed to holding on to operating efficiencies and cost savings as our volumes turn positive again. In addition to proactively changing the cost structure of our business, we're taking steps that propel us forward as a stronger, more differentiated company in the eyes of our customers. As I discussed last quarter, our investments in customer service digitalization or CSD are unquestionably the right approach. And we've accelerated these investments to reap the benefits sooner. So far this year, we've made considerable progress on this effort that will fundamentally transform our business model by offering our customers greater choice in how to interact with us and by seamlessly connecting the front-end customer experience to our back-end processes. And we've started to see the benefits. Our online sales channel is our fastest growing sales channel. And we've seen an increase in our conversion rates for customers that signing up for new service when visiting our e-commerce site. We've also made progress in automating a variety of operational back office and customer communication processes, which are paving the way for efficiency gains, improved customer experience and further cost reduction. To support our CSD journey, we modified our field sales structure to expand online and inside sales functions, while reducing and optimizing outside sales coverage. These adjustments are part of our long-term vision to position our team to engage with customers on the customer's terms, improving customer satisfaction and engagement. It also enables us to reduce our costs of new customer acquisition and improve sales performance at a more efficient cost. We're confident that these strategic sales coverage adjustments coupled with our visual growth strategy, better support our customers as well as the long-term growth of the business. Recycling continues to show the improved results that we expected when we started to change the business model, providing stronger financial results in the third quarter. In addition to our new highly automated MRF in Chicago, we've opened a similar facility in Salt Lake City, with another to open soon in Raleigh. Using advanced technology in our recycling facilities is the blueprint for improving our cost structure, producing a higher quality material and being flexible to changing recycling end-market demands. Recycling is only the beginning of our commitment to sustainability. Last month, we published our 2020 sustainability report, building value together. The report describes how we are addressing challenges and opportunities related to ESG and doing so in close partnership with our customers, suppliers, and communities. Through the crisis of 2020, we've remained steadfast in our commitments to protecting the environment and contributing to a circular economy. WM is a leading voice in the call to create domestic end-market demand for recycled content. One of the ways we're walking the talk is our collaboration with Cascade Cart Solutions to develop and purchase residential carts made with post-consumer resin. Another way is our investment in continuous materials, a company which develops building materials from hard to recycle paper and plastics. Increasing the value of the material that we process, increases the economic benefits from recycling which drives volumes and benefits the environment. The shift in our operating model, along with benefits from the acquisition of ADS and our progress in transforming the recycling business positions for a strong finish to the year with positive momentum heading into 2021. We've performed exceptionally well despite the difficulties presented with COVID-19. Our results in the first nine months of the year, give us confidence. We can generate free cash flow in excess of $2 billion exclusive of ADS transaction costs. As we also achieved the highest operating EBITDA margin in the company's history in the third quarter, we're confident we can exceed the high end of our guidance for full year operating EBITDA margin of 28% to 28.5%. After all we've been through this year, what's most impressive is we expect to finish 2020 within a stone's throw of our all-time high 2019 operating EBITDA. For that I'm eternally grateful to our teammates who have made it happen this year in the face of difficult circumstances. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim and good morning. Our third quarter results showcase the strong execution of our front-line team members who are safely and efficiently servicing our customers each day, as well as the resilience of our business model as we manage costs and capital expenditures in this dynamic environment. The team's hard work paid off with tremendous results as we improved operating expenses as a percentage of revenue a 110 basis points and expanded operating EBITDA margins of 70 basis points. We saw a steady volume recovery across the collection and disposal business during the third quarter, improving volumes, coupled with collection and disposal yield returning to a healthy 2.6%, generated revenue above our expectations. We were anticipating a revenue decline of 3.5% to 5.5% in the second half of the year with the majority of that decline weighted toward the third quarter, yes, the third quarter revenue only declined 2.7%. Of the commercial volume suspended due to the pandemic, almost 70% have resumed service and there is further cause for optimism in the C&I business as net new business and service increases versus service decreases were both positive and showed significant sequential improvement in the third quarter. Residential container waste continued to be elevated mid-to-high single-digits compared to last year. Recovering the cost of increased waste as part of our conversation with municipalities as we work to improve the profitability of our residential business and change the structure of residential contracts. In the residential line of business, our yield improved to 3.5% as we make progress on this effort. External volumes for the third quarter were down \u2013 external landfill volumes for the third quarter were down just over 8% with special waste volumes down about 12% and C&D volumes down about 19%, on a tough comparison in part due to wildfire cleanup last year. Without the cleanup from last year, C&D volumes declined about 7%. Landfill volumes improved sequentially each month in the quarter with total landfill volumes in September down less than 4% and C&D and special waste each down about 8%. Notably MSW volume was flat for the quarter and September volumes increased nearly 2% year-over-year, a powerful indicator of the progress of economic recovery. Moving to pricing. Third quarter core price was 3.2%, adjusted for the impact of lower volume core price would be 4.1%. As expected, pricing metrics are trending back toward pre-pandemic levels following the intentional customer focused steps we took to support our small business customers during spring shutdowns. We're confident in helping our customers during a difficult economic climate was the right step and we continue to see increased loyalty from our customers. Third quarter churn improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 8.8% and we saw another boost in our net promoter scores for all business lines we measure. In particular, our commercial business scored more than doubled, driven by higher scores for reliability, flexibility and improved online resources. Our pricing results reflect 3.3% core price in both landfill and transfer businesses as we continue the positive momentum with post collection pricing initiatives. We've been disciplined with our post collection pricing and we remain committed to staying the course. Turning to ADS. No one has been more eager than me to welcome the ADS team to Waste Management. And with the closing behind us, we're extremely confident in the value this deal will deliver. We've gotten significant clarity on the ADS business and are pleased with the recovery the business has shown as the economy has reopened. We work closely with the ADS team for many months and are hard at work on integration, giving us confidence that we will exceed $100 million synergy target, despite higher than originally expected divestitures. As Jim mentioned, 2020 has taught us we can operate our business with a much lower cost structure than we have historically. And we're holding on to operating efficiencies and cost savings as volumes return. The 110 basis point improvement in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in a third quarter is evidence of our success. When volumes began to decline in March, we aggressively flexed our routes and trucks parking more than 800 vehicles at peak declines. This lowered maintenance costs and allowed us to optimize volumes across the younger and lower cost portion of the fleet. Throughout the pandemic route reductions have outpaced volume declines in the commercial and industrial lines of business. As volumes have returned, we have been extremely disciplined in bringing back trucks into service, driving improved asset utilization and helping to keep maintenance costs low. In the third quarter, lower maintenance spending resulted in a 70 basis point improvement in operating expense as a percentage of revenue. We've also been successful in improving efficiency as each week since February, we service more yards, homes and halls per hour than in the same period in 2019. Increased efficiency was a key driver of less overtime in the quarter, while volume decreases across the collection and disposal business were in the mid single-digits, over time was down 21% in the commercial and industrial lines of business and over time was down 27% in the disposal business. The team is doing an exceptional job of managing expenses and I'm confident we are carrying forward the lessons we've learned on safely operating our business at a lower cost structure. In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team, including our new advanced disposal team members for their hard work and dedication during trying times. Third quarter results exceeded our expectations on virtually all measures as we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage our operations in an uncertain environment. I will now turn the call over to Devina to discuss her financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. As Jim and John have discussed, our third quarter 2020 results have demonstrated both the strong foundation provided by our essential services and resilient business model and the value created from the hard work of our team who are delivering each day in an increasingly cost-effective way. When we look at our third quarter operating and financial results, as John just said, virtually every metric exceeded the expectations we set just three months ago. Volumes have come back stronger than expected. We have flexed operating costs to drive improved margins, and that's far better than our targeted efforts to keep them flat. And we've seen improved customer account collection trends take hold. All of this positions us to finish the year strong with organic revenue down in the range of 3.25% to 3.75% versus the 4% to 5% we projected in July, targeted operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5% and free cash flow in excess of $2 billion. With revenues down about 2.7% from the prior year quarter, our operating EBITDA was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. This strong result, underpinned net cash flow from operations, which was $1.29 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the same quarter last year. Over the course of the third quarter, we saw strong recovery in our customer collections and day sales outstanding, lessening the expected headwind from working capital. Additionally, our operating cash flow for the quarter includes the deferral of payroll tax payments under the CARES act, which provided a benefit of about $40 million. We continue to expect the full year benefit of payroll tax deferral to be $120 million. Third quarter capital spending was $343 million, a $140 million decrease from the same quarter in 2019. While we continue to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business, we took prudent steps to reduce and defer certain aspects of our capital spending until we had better visibility into the pace of volume recovery. The majority of the targeted reductions were the results of adjustments and landfill cell construction schedules and a decrease in the purchase of steel containers. We expect full year capital expenditures to be between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. Our business generated free cash flow of $691 million in the third quarter, through the first nine months of the year free cash flow was 1.432 billion, a conversion of cash from operating EBITDA of [Technical Difficulty]. And as I just mentioned for the full year, we expect our strong operating performance, effective management of working capital and disciplined capital spending to yield free cash flow an excess of $2 billion, excluding the impacts of ADS. Our strong free cash flow positions as to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. In the third quarter, we paid $230 million in dividends. We remain fully committed to our dividend program, solid balance sheet and balanced allocation of remaining available cash to strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. With the recent closing and funding of the ADS acquisition, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong and we are well positioned to continue our practices of sound investment and strong shareholder returns. We financed the $4.6 billion acquisition of ADS net of the $856 million in proceeds from the divestiture to GFL Environmental with a combination of our credit facilities and commercial paper. We continue to look for the right window to access the capital markets for long-term financing alternatives. Current and forecasted leverage ratios are well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facilities, and we expect to quickly return to our targeted total debt to EBITDA of 2.5 to 3 times. Turning to SG&A costs. There is no doubt that the lessons we\u2019re taking to heart from the pandemic have extended to SG&A as well. While third quarter SG&A was slightly above prior year at $389 million, that increases due to an accrual for long-term incentive compensation, as well as an intentional acceleration in technology and investments that Jim mentioned earlier. Absent these two items, our SG&A would have been down nearly $30 million from the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating our collective commitment to reduce discretionary spending. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 10.1% despite the revenue decline in the quarter. And we continue to target SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 10%. Before turning the call over for questions, I want to provide an overview of our planned approach to updating financial guidance post ADS. With the close of the acquisition just behind us, the entire team is focused on welcoming ADS employees and serving our new customers. Each company produced outstanding third quarter results and we are confident that we will finish 2020 strong, as a collective team. Our integration plans are robust and as John just mentioned, we're confident that we can achieve planned synergies. This is an integrated business model and for that reason developing estimates for the cost associated with routes from a partially divested hauling district can be difficult. We are well underway in analyzing and evaluating our financial plans for the year ahead and we will clearly delineate a plan with our fourth quarter 2020 results, that speaks to the top strategic priorities of Waste Management and the integrated value of ADS. Suffice it to say, we closed 2020 excited about the road ahead and prepared to make the value of the whole greater than the sum of its parts. In closing, I want to thank our team for all they have accomplished. Our strong results are a testament to the resilience of both our people and our business model. With that, Lindsay, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Tyler Brown : Hey good morning, everyone. Jim Fish : Good morning, Tyler. Devina Rankin : Good morning. Tyler Brown : Hey Devina. So I appreciate that, you'll give some more details in January, but just at a high level, when we think about the moving pieces for 2021 cash flow, is it basically that we take your kind of jumping off point maybe layer in some EBITDA growth, add in ADS. But then should we also take away for some CARES repayments and maybe a step up in legacy CapEx? Are those kind of the big buckets? Not necessarily numbers, but just the puts and takes. Devina Rankin : Yes. You absolutely have those buckets right. Tyler Brown : So on CARES, is it half of it will come back next year and then another half in 2022? Devina Rankin : Yes, that's correct. So the $120 million that we have reduced our 2020 cash outlay will repay all \u2013 we'll have a full year in the year ahead for normal course of business and then 50% of this year's outlay. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay, good. That's very helpful. And then John, so at the Investor Day, I think you talked about $100 million in savings over the next few years from productivity. But you guys have noted that COVID has driven you guys to structurally rethink a lot of things, and it seems like this productivity is not necessarily going to go away. So I guess my question is have those savings that you talked about at Investor Day basically been captured or are those in 100 savings still on the come? John Morris : No, I think Tyler, I mean, listen, we\u2019re very pleased with what the teams have been able to do to control cost and a lot of that's been done through efficiency over time, better maintenance and repair results, et cetera. So we've taken full advantage of it, but that's not to suggest that we don't have some more opportunity within the operating expense categories. Tyler Brown : Okay, great. And so maybe just my last question again, a kind of a bigger question here. But I mean, I think if you guys crest 28.5% margins, I think it's maybe the best margins you've ever posted. I'd have to go back and maybe look at one of Bill's old models, But, over the next few years, do you feel that 30% margins are achievable? And if so, maybe what might be some of the drivers to get you there? Devina Rankin : Sure. Well, I think what John just mentioned should give everyone confidence that the 28.5% year-to-date EBITDA margin that we have produced through really tough circumstances, this isn't kind of indication of what we can achieve, it's an indication of what's yet to come in terms of additional incremental value that can be created from here, while we look at EBITDA margin for the year, there are always puts and takes. I think what's important to know is that in the current year, we look at those puts and takes and say sure, it\u2019s something like health and welfare expenses that were lower and the second quarter may work against us in the year ahead. But what's more important is that the operating performance and the ability to lever down on discretionary spending. Those things are indicative of long-term value creation on the margin front, and those will far outpace that health and welfare headwinds that we have in 2021. Tyler Brown : Okay. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Devina Rankin : Thank you, Tyler. Jim Fish : Thanks, Tyler. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Jeff Goldstein : Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask on the core price going up \u2013 good morning. I just want to ask on the core price going up to 3.2% from 1.3% last quarter. At this point, are you fairly confident that you can get back to the pre-COVID core price levels of about 4% sooner or rather than later, as you're now just waiting to remove the last set of price concessions? Or do you think that last amount of the recovery will be harder to come by as maybe a certain amount of customers will continue to be under pressure? Just how should we be thinking about that? Jim Fish : It's a good question because, there was \u2013 there were a lot of moving parts in the second quarter and we talked about the fact that we were supporting our small business customers in the second quarter, and that would all be reflected in price, whether it was the free month of service or whether it was deferred price increases, all that would show up on the price line. So we knew that Q2 was going to be artificially low, and Q3 had a piece of that in there as well. So we're confident that the pricing will remain a core strength for us in Q4 and beyond, whether it is commercial or roll off or more recently John's focus and our focus as a team on residential pricing and landfill pricing. Those are all going to be strengths of ours. It's a little bit of the last question about margin in addition to cost controls that we're confident in, we're also equally confident in our price capabilities. Jeff Goldstein : Okay. That's helpful. And then I think I'd ask with the election tomorrow, just curious how you're thinking about the range of outcomes here and while tax I'm sure is probably the most obvious variable. Is there anything else we should related to regulation that you're keeping an eye on that we should be aware of as well? Devina Rankin : I'll speak quickly to the tax impacts. When we look at Biden win the thing that is most apparent there is federal tax rates could increase from 21% currently to 28%. That's about a 6.5% increase in our effective tax rate based on our current modeling. And that would be about $150 million increase in the provision and about $125 million in cash taxes. Really hard to predict further than that, we know that bonus appreciation is something that seems to have bipartisan support. And so therefore, we expect a 100% expensing to continue through 2022 and then the phase out to continue thereafter. Aside from that, I'll let Jim speak to the impacts to the rest of the business. Jim Fish : Yes. I would just change one word in Devina\u2019s sentence, if we look at Biden win, we will \u2013 regarding environmental regulation, it is interesting for us that \u2013 first off, all of our focus is not necessarily on the federal elections, we tend to focus on state elections too, because the state has such an important place, such an important role for us, and that carries over to environmental regulation. But as it relates to the federal elections tomorrow, we've said that regulation is actually in a strange way, a good thing for WM, because we hold ourselves to a very high regulatory standard, environmental standard. And so any additional regulation actually tends to work in our favor. So to the extent that, that comes out of tomorrow's election, that could be a good thing for us. Jeff Goldstein : That's all really helpful color. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hamzah Mazari : Hey, good morning. Maybe for Jim, you've talked about technology for a few years now and we see in your prepared comments some of the accelerated tax spend that you flagged. Could you maybe at a high level just talk about where you are in your tech journey sort of what's behind you and what's yet to come, both from a spend perspective and sort of the benefits? Did the benefits come right away or is that a little bit of a lag? Jim Fish : I think there is a bit of a lag here, Hamzah. We have accelerated the spend as we mentioned \u2013 Devina mentioned and it's impacting SG&A costs. And we felt like this was the right year to do it. This \u2013 I think I read somewhere that 77% of companies have done the same thing, have accelerated their digital spend. If \u2013 just to kind of put it in \u2013 to be specific about what it's impacting though and what it's impacted so far. Things like customer setup is being impacted, routing and dispatch, service confirmation, billing, inquiries, all of those make up the pie of calls, that come into our call centers. And the idea is that we'll give that option at least to our customers to be able to self service. And then behind the scenes there will be a real significant streamlining of really all of those processes. Today there is a lot of steps involved, there is a lot of data entry involved, ideally we get to a point where you greatly reduce the amount of data entry, which reduces the amount of potential for error. And then in turn reduces the confusion, sometimes that results from those errors when a customer calls in. I would tell you that we're \u2013 if I use kind of a baseball analogy here, that we're probably in inning three here, as it relates to this full customer service digitalization, and that will take us all the way through 2021 to fully develop. But we are moving quickly on it and we're encouraged by what we're seeing, not just on those process changes, but also on the front-end of that, which is where the customer sees it. As I mentioned in my script, we're seeing \u2013 our increases are coming in that e-commerce channel. So we're excited about this, and we think this has the real potential to separate us from the pack even more significantly going forward, Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Very helpful. And then just on the volume side, anything you're seeing sort of regionally relative to your expectations, that was a bit different. And then maybe just frame for us, what does October looks like? I know you gave some detail on September. Just curious if the \u2013 sort of the recovery that we've seen during the quarter is similar to October, or if there is differences we should be aware of when looking at the commercial business. Jim Fish : It's interesting Hamzah, we've \u2013 I've read a couple of reports that have talked about volume being different in the urban settings versus rural. I would tell you, this is not an urban versus a rural, the impact of COVID is not been urban versus rural. What it's really been is almost state-by-state and province by province. So the States that seem to be doing the best and are closest to full recovery happened to be those States that opened up most quickly. So those are States like Texas, like Florida, like Arizona, Georgia, those States are doing best when we look at our own data on the States that are lagging are States like Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, and then provinces like Ontario and Quebec. Those have been most stringent on reopening and are the farthest behind. I would tell you here in Texas, it's full steam ahead, we've been going out to restaurants for a number of months now, at least in our family and we're outs both nights this weekend, and it is full steam ahead here. The businesses that tend to be lagging, the sectors are still hospitality, still sports, entertainment, schools to some degree and then the related small businesses there that touch those sectors. But overall, I would tell you that I think we are seeing a full reopening, I think what we're seeing is that people are just saying they can't be shut down forever, they have to \u2013 their businesses, particularly small businesses that is there. That's the way they put food on the table. And so I don't expect those small businesses to continue to be shut down forever. And when will these States fully reopened? I don't know. Some of that depends on the extent of COVID and the pursuit of a vaccine, but if I had to guess, if you pressed me on it, I would say mid-to-late 2021, you'll see most of these States and provinces be reopened. Hamzah Mazari : Got you. And just last question, I'll turn it over. Is the ADSW, I know we'll get more detail and I know that you have to look at the divestitures and et cetera. But it's that free cash flow accretive next year to you guys? Or we just wait for more details at Q4? Just any high level thoughts. Devina Rankin : Yes, Hamzah. I would say we absolutely expect the acquisition to be free cash flow accretive in the year ahead. The free cash flow impacts to the fourth quarter, we're expecting that to be more like a push even potentially a little bit on the downside, because of some of the cost to achieve and starting to make investments on the capital investment side as we integrate some of our sites. So I would say fourth quarter impacts is either flat to down on the free cash flow front. And then we really start to see the benefits of full run rate of the ADS EBITDA combined with early indications of our synergy capture and a lower capital cost as well, as we refinance the required indebtedness. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you so much. Jim Fish : Thanks, Hamzah. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Your line is now open. Kevin Chiang : Hi, thanks for taking my question here. Maybe just following up on Hamzah\u2019s question there. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks about 70% of commercial had seen some sort of resumption. To the extent you start seeing some sort of softness, especially in provinces and States that that may be more likely to lock things down again. Just wondering if the lessons you've learned from the lockdowns you saw in March and April. Would you approach things differently with your commercial customers? Or as the game plan you saw six months ago, the same game plan you would implement in another re-lockdown down in some of these markets? Jim Fish : Yes. I don't think we would approach things differently. That doesn't mean we're going to come back out with another free month of service for small customers. And to the extent that States lockdown, I mean, there has been a bit of an ebb and flow there with some States. But again the States that have at least from an economic standpoint have done the best in this recovery are those States that have been pretty consistent about staying open and then trying to put protocols in place to protect against spikes in COVID. And those are States like Texas and like Arizona and Florida and Georgia. So I think we would handle it the same way. And \u2013 but going forward, I don't anticipate offering another deferral of price increases or another free month of service to small businesses. Devina Rankin : I think it's equally important to think about how we responded with our employees. And it goes without saying that when you look at turnover, as well as employee morale and safety results, that our response on the employee front we think was exactly what it needed to be and we would repeat those steps. Some of the costs though that we incurred, particularly for the back office, as we moved folks into work from home mode, those were one-time and we wouldn't look to see those repeat. Kevin Chiang : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a second one for me. Just went through your sustainability report, you highlighted the progress you've made and some of the targets you have over the next few years here. At a high level to get to some of those targets, do you see the need to maybe in the near-term here, see some level of capital intensity creep as you invest in some of these technologies? Or with the integration of ADS, is there any catch-up CapEx there to bring ADS up to the targets that you want to achieve as a company, as a whole? Jim Fish : Well, two questions there, and I'm going to let John take the second one about ADS. The first one related to sustainability. It's a fair question. We don't necessarily see any capital creep related to our focus on sustainability. Look, we've been focused on sustainability, it's not something we've been focused on for two quarters, it's something we've been focused on for probably 10 years, but more specifically for the last five years. And we managed through that and to the extent there is any capital needs, it just gets built into our budget. John Morris : I think the second part of the question with regard to ADS, we've obviously had a good bit of time to study their capital structure in the business. And the short answer is we don't see that as a capital drag. They've been very deliberate and intentional on how they've capitalized the business and we feel comfortable that they're in a good spot as we start the integration. Kevin Chiang : Thank you very much. Thanks for taking my question. Jim Fish : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Kyle White : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on closing the ADS deal. Jim Fish : Thanks, Kyle. Kyle White : Let me focus a little bit \u2013 focus on some contracts and as you renegotiate contracts, especially on the residential side. Are there any key differences that you've been able to implement into the contract structure as a result of the pandemic? Any kind of real examples of change here? John Morris : Yes. I mean, listen, Kyle, we've been talking about residential loan before COVID and I think if you look at the results that Jim commented on what we've done on the core price and yield side with regard to residential. I think and I said this on the last call that the additional pressure, if you will that the volumes because of people working from home, it does present another challenge and we're having those conversations with municipalities and with the franchises. What I'm really happy about is if you look at even the margins in residential now, even with what's gone on recycling and to some extent what's going on with this pandemic in the additional ways, we're still showing margin progress there. I think the conversation around the pandemic and the weights and whatnot. It seems to have leveled out and as we said kind of the mid-to-high single-digits depending on where you are in the country and that's a conversation we're going to continue to have. And it's a challenging conversation, a lot of these municipalities are facing budget constraints or whatnot, but I would tell you where we're having success is getting the price up, being paid adequately for the service we're providing. But our public sector team has really done a nice job of really partnering with these municipalities and working with them on ways where they can streamline maybe some of the service offerings, still achieve what they need for their residents and still allow us to be compensated at an inappropriate level. Kyle White : That's helpful. And then going back to sustainability, you have been one of the more aggressive companies to shift to CNG fleets, with I believe around 60% of your collection fleet using CNG with a target of around 70% by 2025. How should we think about this target in regards to some of the innovation that's been happening on the battery electric side? Are you considering potentially slowing down your CNG purchases to kind of wait and see how electric performs? John Morris : No. Kyle, I would tell you we're very happy with where we are on our CNG conversion. We're running right now because we've taken some trucks off the street, we're actually running close to 70% right now of our routed vehicles. And I think part of what you're seeing in our improved maintenance and repair numbers and whatnot is due to us running a younger more efficient fleet, that's the majority of which CNG. I will tell you on the other alternatives, electric vehicles in particular, we've got a number of pilots going on with different vendors. I mean, that's still a developing technology, I think for the heavy duty vehicle class that was really a focus for us, there is still a little bit of wood to chop there. And I think, when we get to the point where it's advanced, we're going to have to be very careful with who we picked in terms of the technology leader. Kyle White : All right, I'll turn it over. Good luck with the integration. John Morris : Thank you. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Jim Fish : Good morning, Walter. John Morris : Good morning. Walter Spracklin : And I look to come back to volume and the discussion around the potential risks that we do see some jurisdictions go back into a tighter COVID-19 lockdown while others are opening quicker. And just really kind of put it all together and your jurisdictions adding it all together, Jim, just a simple question. I mean, do you see the volume that you saw in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter going to be better or worse than what you saw in the third quarter? I know one of your peers has kind of I think conservatively guided to a flat to technically, I guess, slightly worse volume performance in the fourth quarter. But given the cadence and seeing where your jurisdictions are, what would be your best guess in terms of fourth quarter, better or worse? Jim Fish : We think it will be relatively flat. I think it's such a difficult question, because of how States manage their reaction to somebody spikes in COVID. We're sitting here in Texas and I think Texas, whether you talk about the Mayor here in Houston or the Governor. I think Texas actually \u2013 we went through our own spike back in July and part of August, and the State managed its way, the city of Houston managed its way through that quite well. So we didn't re-shut down as we were in April and May, we just put stronger protocols in place and we\u2019re more \u2013 we were tougher on those who were offending, but we did not go back and shut down businesses. Now that's not my decision, that's the decision of the Governor of Texas and the Mayors of these cities. But I think Texas is a pretty good indicator of how to handle it without crushing businesses, but also making sure that we're keenly aware of the danger of spike in COVID. I don't know whether some of these other States will handle it the same way. So as a consequence, we're projecting relatively flat volume in Q4. I think Hamzah asked earlier, and I didn't really answer the question, how we're looking in October. And just as I said with the quarter, October is looking pretty similar to what September look like. So relatively flat, a few things are lower, a few things are higher. But overall, we expect that the volume will be flat from Q3 to Q4. Walter Spracklin : I appreciate that. Following-up on the margin question. I know operating margin has been a key focus for a lot of investors across a lot of different industries as volumes come back here. And in some sectors it's pretty obvious where operating leverage exists and how it's going to come together. When I look at waste, I do hear you on items such as lower SG&A, lower corporate travel and so on. But I just think about the what a higher volume would mean in terms of increased congestion that would come with \u2013 traffic congestion, that would hamper fluidity in your pickup operations. I think about over time that you had before and whether in a normal volume environment to what extent you can manage that down manage that better than pre-COVID, and then some of the health and welfare costs that are coming in. When I put all that together, the line of sight toward clear operating leverage in the waste sector isn\u2019t as obvious and perhaps Jim, you can correct me there or give me a little bit of insight as to where operating leverage might come in for your business. Jim Fish : Well, okay. We've said \u2013 John said in his scripts and he can add color here. But what \u2013 really are the big takeaway for us in \u2013 particularly in Q3, but also to a lesser extent in Q2 was that we now believe, we can truly operate this business at a lower operating cost structure. Devina also talked about SG&A. And so in all the obvious areas, things like travel and some of the discretionary spend, we know that we can run at SG&A that's lower than previously thought. But most importantly, when we look at what John discussed in his prepared remarks, we absolutely believe that as we climb back to volume break even and then start to accelerate again, that we've learned that we can operate at a operating cost structure. There are \u2013 as you mentioned, there are some things that will impact our operation such as traffic. But when I look at \u2013 I use Houston a lot because I sit here, but I look at charts for Houston traffic every week, put out by a group here in \u2013 of the greater Houston partnership. And Houston traffic is almost back to pre-COVID levels. When you look at the city of Houston for us, we are still looking similar to the rest of our business in terms of overtime. So it gives me confidence that while traffic will certainly create some snarls in our operations, that we'll be able to hang on to these efficiency gains that we're picking up. And then to add to that what we're doing with digitalization. And I believe that's why we firmly believe that this is a long-term sustainable approach to it, a new approach to our operations. John, anything to add on. John Morris : The only thing our used coverage. And the only thing I'd add Walter is, we do have a lot of granular data on the density of volumes we're picking up and how that's been eroded and now come back. And to Jim's point, we're talking about 70% give or take of our C&I business coming back that was eroding yet you still see a very wide gap in the efficiency and the overtime ratio. So we're almost back to kind of a normal traffic pattern in a lot of places, and then some of that friction's return yet the operating folks are doing a great job of hanging on to the savings. Walter Spracklin : Some great examples, really appreciate the time guys. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Sean Eastman : Good morning team. Jim Fish : Hi, Sean. Sean Eastman : With the advanced disposal deal having closed, I wanted to ask about this for a while, we haven't been able to talk to the advanced for some time. It's just interesting, the timing of the acquisition around this pretty nice inflection they saw in average yields in 2018 that it seems like they have held on to really well through the first half of 2020. So I'm just hoping you guys could sort of refresh us on that dynamic over there, sort of what's driven that inflection? And then is it fair to say that, once that gets folded into the WM footprint, there is potential for some additional momentum on that line as a combined company. John Morris : Yes, Sean. That\u2019s a good question, a couple of questions in there. One is, if you \u2013 obviously, in our prepared remarks, we reiterated again, how confident we feel about exceeding to $100 million synergy target. And that's obviously in a sort of post-COVID environment. I think Richard and the team have done a really nice job in the first half of the year as evidenced by their results and their recovery especially in the geographies that they were in the 16 States that advanced was in. And as Jim mentioned in his comments, we've been comparing those recovery rates and those geographies and the advanced portfolio came back nicely. And as Devina mentioned in her comments the third quarter both companies perform really well. So if you think about \u2013 even though we're in a COVID environment, even though the divestitures were higher, we're still very confident in our synergy number as we roll into Q4 and into 2021. Sean Eastman : Got you. That's helpful. And one for Devina, just a refresh on the financing of the transaction, just trying to understand what happened with \u2013 what happened with ADSW\u2019s debt. I guess, basically what is WM\u2019s combined company cost of debt at close? And are there any interest savings there built into the synergy target or is that separate? Devina Rankin : Sure. So I'll start with just where we were from a leverage perspective immediately following the close. And that's about 3.15 times, including pro forma EBITDA. So it really does speak to the solid financial position of Waste Management. And so when we look at that number, we think that both when you combine synergy capture, as well as growth in both businesses will be quickly to our targeted leverage ratios over the course of 2021. As it relates to ADS\u2019 debt that was immediately repaid upon close and simply by taking that indebtedness and replacing it with WM\u2019s debt. We see an immediate synergy value from that in the ballpark of $40 million on a gross basis, so after tax, clearly a lower number than that. That is not something that was specifically contemplated in the $100 million of synergies. That relates to operating performance and SG&A rationalization. And we'll be executing upon those strategies over the course of the next year. Sean Eastman : Okay. Helpful. Very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is now open. David Manthey : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm sure it's hard to see through the seasonal factors of the business, but are you seeing any [Audio Dip] and C&D waste is seeing a surge, maybe from projects that were delayed from the second quarter as those are wrapped up. And what I'm asking is, is there any chance in your mind that we could see a double dip in that part of the business? Jim Fish : So I think your question was largely around special waste and projects there. And so what we're seeing with special waste and to some degree C&D. C&D is a bit cloudy, the picture is cloudy because of last year and the fire volume from last year. And as John mentioned, if you normalize for that, it's maybe 7% down year-over-year, as opposed to 19% down. But primarily with special waste, what we're seeing is that these large companies that own these special waste projects, that there's some discretion in the timing of the initiation of those projects. So our pipeline looks quite good at this point. And the big question is when will they initiate those projects? Many of them as you might expect, have been delayed in 2020. And we expect that they will build those projects into their budgets for 2021, after this unpredictability goes away from 2020. David Manthey : Thank you. And second, have you discussed thoughts on when you might reinstate share repurchase just yet? Devina Rankin : As I just mentioned, when we look at 2021 and see a clear path to leverage in our targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times, we're really optimistic that we'll be able to resume share repurchases at some point in 2021. We always revisit our capital allocation plans in the fourth quarter. And we'll do that again this year with expectations for clarity on the dividend in the extent of 2021 share buyback at that time. But we will remain focused on balanced allocation to a combination of the M&A and share buyback with excess free cash flow. David Manthey : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye : Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a follow-up question on pricing. And would note by the way the 2.6% collection disposal yield is a very strong result, even pre-pandemic. But you said, I think, John, earlier that core price would have been 4.1%, if not core volume. Can you just disambiguate that a little bit for folks explain that? And then really the correlated question is as we move into the fourth quarter here and will be on some of the concessions, do we see price continuing to improve sequentially? John Morris : So the short answer to the second part is yes. I think what we've talked about as we went through Q2 and into Q3 is that those delivered concessions were going to have an impact, but we thought making a one quarter concession to those customers was the right thing to do. And honestly, from everything we've seen from the feedback from our customers around Net Promoter Score, I commented on. That it's absolutely been the right move. I think what you're seeing from Q2 to Q3, in particular in commercial and industrial where most of those concessions were made, as you saw a nice recovery. We're not all the way back up to where we were, but what we've all said throughout this pandemic when we've been chatting with you folks is that this is not a change in our strategy or our philosophy, but it was a short-term decision made to ease some of the \u2013 what was going on with our customer. So I think when you look at the bridge between Q2 and Q3, we'll see continued momentum as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year. Noah Kaye : That's very helpful. And in respect to my fellow analysts, I'll jump out and let others ask questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. You talked a little bit about this in the earlier remarks, but we've been seeing a lot of headlines of state and local governments under pressure. And the thought is, is that the pressure might get worse because tax revenues lag. Can you just remind us what your exposure is to municipalities and what you think \u2013 do you think the environment will get worse over the next year or two? Thanks. Devina Rankin : I'll just quickly speak to and the impact of CPI, which is usually one of those pieces that can have some pressure. And that's about 35% to 40% of the revenue line. And so that is a place where we have our eye on, what we're going to do in pricing execution over the course of 2021 to overcome what may be mild pressure on that side. Jim Fish : I would add to that. Thanks Devina. I would add to that too, if you go back the last handful of years, which I've done over and over again, and look at CPI and our core price performance, you can see that they're not \u2013 there's a disaggregation there, and that's been strategic. We've talked about moving away from a traditional CPI to other rate setting mechanisms. And I think that's what you see. And as evidenced by what we're doing in residential and with some of the municipal customers in our landfills, that core price performance shows that we're moving further and further away from CPI because it's frankly not a rate setting mechanism that aligns as well as some others when it comes to the cost of our business. Jeff Silber : Okay. That's helpful. And just one quick follow-up, you mentioned the synergy targets with ADS in excess of $100 million. Can you just remind us the timing on that? Is that something you think you'll have fully done by the end of next year? Or is it going to take a little bit of time? John Morris : Well, clearly originally we talked about it going through 2021 and into 2022, and that was before maybe the delay. So the short answer is we won't get it all in 2021, we feel like we've got great integration plans. The teams hit the ground running on Friday. Things are going exceptionally smooth. I looked at our \u2013 talk to our team this morning and customers are getting serviced. So we feel very pleased about where we sit. And I think we're going to make a lot of ground up in 2021. We won't get it all though. Jeff Silber : Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is now open. Michael Hoffman : Hey guys, thanks. Playing a little bit of clean up here near the end, so I got a few questions just to clarify some things we've been hearing. Devina, I get that we can't get a profit guidance yet because of the integration challenges. Can you tell us what the two months of revenue would be in the fourth quarter for ADS and then what the rollover is in the 2021? Jim Fish : We figured that most of your questions have been asked. So yes, we win. Michael Hoffman : Well, I'm playing a cleanup, so I've got to come back to some of the stuff that's been discussed and get some clarity. Devina, on advance I get, we don't have EBITDA. As you need to get through some budgeting and what have you, but can you tell us what two months of revenues would be in 4Q and what the rollover would be in the 2021? Devina Rankin : So the rollover is an interesting question, two months, we're looking at about $275 million of revenue on a gross basis; on a divested basis, we're in the ballpark of $225 million, but it's really hard for us to know for sure. On a rollover basis, you would just extend that off of the 10 months, but we're not yet speaking to expectations for yield and volume for their business because we're still in the planning processes. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So if I just took that's 225 divided by two and then multiply it by 10, that's what I should rollover? Devina Rankin : Yes. But we have yet to assess the intercompany impacts. So if you think about the integration of the sites that are in markets, where we will now take ADS volume into a Waste Management landfill, we don't know those impacts to the net revenue of the business. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. Fair enough. Do you still planning on spending $40 million on the ERP this year? Devina Rankin : So we have \u2013 today that number is in the ballpark of $25 million, I believe. And we are on pace, the reason the number is lower than we had initially expected. It's not because we slowed anything down, it's actually, because we saw some ability to reduce our costs with T&E on the third-party support that we had. And so we have a lower cost in the current year. We do, at this point, expect to spend more in the coming year on acceleration of our work efforts both on the HR side and the finance side. Michael Hoffman : Perfect. And then cash flow from ops is going to be about $100 million better than your 2Q revision of the numbers. How much of that's working capital versus you're running the business better, it's profit. Devina Rankin : When we looked at it, the cash flow from ops pieces, I would say, you kind of split it down the middle. You've got lift in operating EBITDA above expected levels, and that's both on the revenue side and the margin side. And then the remainder of it has to do with the cash collections taking hold that I mentioned earlier, we had projected an $80 million to $100 million headwind from DSO in the year. And we now have worked pretty hard to offset almost all of that. Though, at this point, we're projecting that we get that to a moderated level of say a headwind of $20 million to $40 million. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's great. And then just to be clear, your incremental margins before we entered, we\u2019re kind of like 40% around collection and in the 60s in disposal. And what your message is, as you've proved that you can permanently lift the incremental margin? Devina Rankin : That's right. I think that when we look at the incremental margin of the business, while the traditional returns from a margin perspective on LOB perspective are important, but what's equally important is our ability to get leverage on the cost side. And what you've seen strong execution on in 2020 is that getting the most expensive work hour out of the day and getting the most expensive mile off the road. And so both on the labor and maintenance front, we've seen really strong leverage. And that really does benefit us both on collection and disposal. John mentioned in his prepared remarks, disposal overtime hours being down, approaching 30%, so really strong results on the cost side, give us really a lot of confidence that we're going to have better incremental margins on the volume returns. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then Jim, you shared that you thought if the states get to full reopening by the middle of the year, a trend, is this an appropriate way to think about cadence without getting into numbers? First quarter\u2019s negative volume, 2Q is positive, they even each other out. Second half is positive, the year is positive. Jim Fish : I'm not sure I said, they even each other out. I mean, look, do you remember that a little bit of first quarter of 2020 was impacted not a lot but certainly two or three weeks of the first quarter was impacted. And then obviously, second quarter was a huge impact. So I wouldn't say they would even each other out, we haven't fully determined what our volume is going to look like for 2021 yet, but just based on what you were saying there, I think first quarter is going to be \u2013 certainly going to be less impacted than second quarter. So the year-over-year comp might be difficult in Q1. But we do have that second half of March that is an easy comp. And then obviously, you have a very easy comp when you get to Q2 and then Q3. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then if you added back in your environmental fee number, the $42 million, is the right way \u2013 and that's because you gave back these and did things like that. I think if I understand correctly, and your yield would have been like 3.4% in the quarter. Am I interpreted that correctly? Jim Fish : I'm not sure we've done the math there, but look, there was \u2013 there were a lot of gifts to our customers for all the right reasons in Q2 and Q3. And that's why we've said we are confident in our ability to capture price going forward. Michael Hoffman : Right, last one for me, you talk about people first. Talk about the COVID fatigue and how that sort of is managed through as a business, given the essential service aspect of this and the day-to-day sort of presence of this. John Morris : So, Michael, I would tell you, listen, the vast majority, you mentioned essential workers. The vast majority of our folks have never gone home. And we have \u2013 are certainly following all of the safety protocols as they ebbed and flowed. And I think the proof is, is that when you look at where some of our employees have been affected by and large, it's not been from inside the workplace, it\u2019s been from outside the workplace. So the protocols we've put in place have clearly been helped to prevent any spread within our districts. I would say in terms of fatigue, I certainly think in the beginning, there was a lot more unknown than there is today. I think with all the assistance we've provided to the field, I think the field would tell you now that we're operating a little bit of a new normal, but as evidenced by turnover, Devina mentioned morale operating \u2013 I mean, when you look at all of this, it would suggest that our teams continues to perform really well and not really be fatigued if you will. I know it is certainly a stress on everybody, but I think our teams done an excellent job of managing through it. The leadership has done a great job at the field level and here in Houston have managing through it. So I would tell you, it's the new normal for now until we get a solution for this. Jim Fish : Well, we provide, Michael, a lot, in addition to financial support for all of our teammates, we provide a lot through our HR group, we provide emotional support for employees. And then certainly we've seen an increased demand for that year-over-year. I think it's though \u2013 it's been amazing how our teams performed under these circumstances. And I do believe that by taking that financial, that big financial worry off the table for them, that has helped them emotionally as well. So but yes, you're right. I mean, we talked about the term people first all the time, and it is at the top of our list. Michael Hoffman : Very good. Thank you very much. Jim Fish : Thanks, Michael. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Michael Feniger : Hey everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Devina, you mentioned how CPI, if 30%, 35% of your business could be mild pressure in 2021. The good news is you guys are talking about the momentum really in commercial and industrial. Do you usually implement like 50%, 60%, 70% of that book of PIs for 2021. Does it usually happen in Q4 and early 2021? And as Jim mentioned, some pockets of weakness, like education, entertainment, hospitality, how do we think about the ability to implement some PIs with some of your fragile customers? Is it more of \u2013 I'm sure it's not a one size fits all. So is there a percentage of your book that you guys are looking at and that's more of a wait and see as the recovery broadens out? Devina Rankin : I'll speak to the first part. So our annual PIs for that part of our business are typically in July and October. And so really wasn't much of an impact in 2020, in terms of our deferred price increases because we defer those beginning in April and continued that through June. So our PI activity was normal course of business, beginning in July with the exception of the items that Jim mentioned. So when we think about the year ahead, that's when you can start to see those pressures take hold, and then with that, I'll turn the rest over to John. John Morris : Yes, Michael, I would say, I think you said it well as we've got some pockets that Jim referenced, lodging, some parts of education, travel, et cetera, restaurants that are still in some form of business slow down, if you will. And I think that's right. I mean, Jim said, what we did in Q2 is not necessarily what we're going to repeat, but I think going forward that is a case-by-case basis on understanding what's going on with each of those customers, no segments and making the appropriate long-term decision. Michael Feniger : That's really helpful. Have you guys \u2013 is there a rough estimate of how we should think about that page? You guys have such a diverse customer base, but like you just said, lodging, travel, education, maybe restaurants, is there kind of percentage that we can say this is kind of the pocket of risk while the other businesses are obviously moving in the right direction? Jim Fish : I think Michael, part of why this industry is such a great investment for shareholders is because we are so diversified that one sector going down doesn't really have a dramatic impact on us. So now obviously in April and May, when you had multiple, the entire economy going down, it was going to have an impact on us. But even then, you're still talking about a certain percentage of the economy being essential services and we provide service to them. So I think when we look at that piece that has lagged, it's probably, I mean, we talked about schools being 8% to 10% of our commercial business. And those have come back in many cases and in most cases, maybe not fully, some have come back fully. Some are coming back on a hybrid basis. The sports teams are trying, as we saw last night on the football game, the Pennsylvania teams have been at zero fans, look like last night, they had 7,500 fans. It was probably good for that game, but it's coming back slowly, but the beauty of this industry is that we represent all sectors of the economy, and many of those sectors are deemed essential and have been there since March. And those that are not essential are recovering reasonably quickly, some less than others. But we feel confident that as we showed in our volume numbers, that 2021 will be the eventual emergence of all of these businesses. Michael Feniger : That makes sense. And I might have missed this. You guys clearly performed very well in the third quarter. And I think you said ADS did too. Are there going to be financials on ADSW since they were standalone entity for the months of Q3? And how should we think about, you guys wants this very lengthy long DOJ process, some commercial customers are a little fragile right now. Can you go out and reprice the ADSW book right away, or is it kind of have to be a wait and see and take it quarter-by-quarter? Devina Rankin : So with respect to whether or not you'll see a full set of ADS financials for the third quarter, the quick answer to that is no. What I would say is that when we give guidance in 2021 related to the combined business, we'll give a lot of transparency and color about the pieces of the puzzle that get to the combined outlook. Michael Feniger : Got it. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Neville with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Mark Neville : Hi, good morning. First, great quarter and congrats on getting ADS done. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Jim Fish : Thank you. Mark Neville : This perhaps my first question just around the costs conversation and the structural improvement, I'm just curious, as long as you come back and again, presumably some costs come back, but the steps that you\u2019ve taken through the pandemic and sort of what you've done. Has all that been sort of fully optimized or is there still sort of cost improvement to come in the coming quarters from the actions that you've taken to maybe partially offset some of that costs come back? Jim Fish : Yes, I mean, certainly when \u2013 as volumes continue to return, there's some incremental costs, but I think is what you've seen from us through Q2. And then in Q3, we've been able to certainly overcome that. And we've expanded margins the way we have and that's in light of us losing volume in our highest margin business. So the natural thought would be as that business starts to come back, we continue to keep a close eye on cost control, both in the operating side and on the SG&A side that we've got some more runway there. Devina Rankin : I think the additional leverage that you see is the continued execution on optimal work week, continued execution on maintenance, service delivery optimization, and then the cost reductions that we should get in the overall structure, whether it be back office or front-line, as a result of the technology investments that we're making taking hold. Now, Jim spoke fully to the fact that those will take some time, but we do expect to see those begin to take hold in 2021. And there's additional leverage from all of those initiatives combined. Mark Neville : Okay. Maybe just a question on price. Again, I appreciate there's parts of the business that are still feeling some pressure, but again, there's other parts of your business where you're taking some sort of structural actions around this full length of price. I guess, my question just would be, maybe not the quantum but more in terms of the length of time or in the visibility that you have around price or the strength in price just from some of the structural actions that you're taking? Jim Fish : I think your question might be related to and in some ways related to what we're doing with our differentiation efforts. And so we believe that there's \u2013 not only is there this price strength that we've shown, which is in large part intended to recover cost increases, and at the same time expand margin. But there's also a piece of that now going forward, which we really haven't tapped into yet, that's really related to a differentiated service offering. And when you're differentiated, you can charge more for your services and your customers are willing to accept that because they truly view you as being differentiated. That's really what we hope to get out of customer service digitalization, and we are very much in the early innings there. Mark Neville : Okay. And then maybe just one last one then on the synergy, $100 million target, Devina, you mentioned that the $40 million of savings is from refinancing the debt. When you talked about confident in exceeding $100, is that sort of driven by that? Or is it again, I guess, the $100 million on the operations? Devina Rankin : Yes. No, just to clarify, if I misspoke, the $40 million is incremental to the $100 million. The $100 million is from operating and SG&A as well as CapEx execution. Mark Neville : Right. So when you talk about exceeding the $100 million that's again, aside from the $40 million? Devina Rankin : That's correct. Mark Neville : All right. Okay. I'll probably leave it there, but again thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters. Jim Fish : Well, thank you. In closing today, I'd like to recognize three of our areas that have had to contend with natural disaster after natural disaster. And in doing so, they've done it with amazing patience and professionalism. First off, our Gulf Coast area took a direct hit from three separate hurricanes this year. And many of our teammates were displaced from their homes and several of our facilities incurred pretty significant damage. But through all of that, they've persevered and they've gotten the job done, which was amazing in and of itself. And similarly, our Northern and Southern California areas have really almost had to come to accept that wildfires are just a devastating normal these days. We've had wildfires the last several years and certainly including last year, and then again this year, but the team hasn't wavered, they've provided outstanding service and really demonstrated that a love for their customers and their communities. In fact, you may have heard about the story of one of our drivers who literally saved the life of an elderly woman in Paradise, California, last year. So to those three areas, Northern California, Southern California, and Gulf Coast, they should be committed for the jobs that they've done through this really unfortunate series of natural disasters. Thank you to all of you. God bless you. And thank you to all of you for joining us this morning. And we will talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host Mr. Ed Egl. Sir, the floor is yours. Ed Egl : Thank you, Lara. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You'll hear prepared comments from each of them today; Jim will cover high level financials and provide a strategic update; John will cover an operating overview; and Devina will cover the details of the financials, including our 2021 outlook. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules of the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs. John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless otherwise noted, are more specifically references to Internal Revenue Growth or IRG from yield or volume. During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA and margin and SG&A expenses have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations, including costs incurred in connection with our fourth quarter acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services or ADS. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release and tables, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections. Additionally, reconciliations for our prior six quarters of adjusted operating EBITDA are included in the table to the earnings press releases for those respective quarters and can also be found on our website at www.wm.com. This call is being recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning approximately 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today until 5 :00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 4.

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed and thank you all for joining us, and I hope everyone is staying safe and well. We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and our full year 2020 results. In many ways our fourth quarter was a continuation of our strong third quarter performance. Once again, despite the impacts from the pandemic, our team delivered strong and consistent operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter that exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019. If you set aside the $38 million of operating EBITDA contribution from ADS and the $60 million fuel tax credit benefit in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus 2020, our legacy WM operating EBITDA grew 4% versus Q4 of 2019. This was our seventh consecutive quarter to generate operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion, showcasing the strength and consistency of our business. In the fourth quarter, we kept our eye on the ball working together to provide reliable high-quality service to our customers even as we welcomed a substantial number of new customers and team members following the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. As with the third quarter, our fourth quarter operating EBITDA margin was impressively strong at 28.1% when you consider that it included 50 basis points of dilution from ADS. For the full year, 2020 matched our highest annual operating EBITDA margin of 28.4%. And excluding ADS, we set a new record with 2020 operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5%. So in a year where many companies have suffered significant financial impacts from the pandemic and resulting economic crisis, at Waste Management the resilience of our people and our business model delivered full year 2020 results within 1.5% of our record-high 2019 operating EBITDA. As we look to 2021, in addition to the strong continuous improvement measures we're taking in our collection and disposal business, WM is in a perfect position to leverage our focus on ESG and our accelerated investments in technology to benefit all of our constituents, employees, customers, shareholders, communities and the environment. WM made the decision in March to accelerate technology spending and we're more confident than ever that our investments in Customer Service Digitalization or CSD are the right approach to propel us forward in the post-COVID world. We've made considerable progress towards transforming our business model by seamlessly connecting the front-end customer experience to our back-end processes. Our online sales channel is growing at a triple-digit rate. Most importantly, we're receiving positive feedback from our customers. In 2021, the value creation of CSD will step up as we further differentiate our service to our customers, automated -- automate manual processes and drive further efficiencies and reliability in our operations. On the ESG front, WM has emerged as a true leader in sustainability and we're doing so in a manner that will benefit both shareholders and the environment. Possibly like no other year, this year's WM Phoenix Open pointed to our ability to demonstrate our expertise and leverage our brand recognition for sustainability. This was highlighted during our Sustainability Forum panel discussion with two other ESG-focused CEOs, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Doug McMillon of Walmart. Following our discussion, I received a note from Doug saying, thanks for your leadership Jim. His note was flattering personally to me, but it was also an important statement about where WM stands reputationally with large companies like Walmart with regard to sustainability and where we can help them and our other customers to achieve their sustainability goals. As corporations build road maps to address their own climate impacts, WM is well-positioned to assist through an array of service offerings, including recycling and other beneficial uses such as composting and renewable energy generation. Looking at the potential impact on our financials. So far in 2021, commodities are on a strong upward trajectory and many experts believe this to be the start of a long-term trend. And as North America's largest recycler and one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas for landfill gas, WM should benefit disproportionately from that long-term trend. We're able to close the loop by using that renewable gas to power our natural gas fleet, redefine the processing business with our next-gen recycling technology enhancements and our fee-based pricing strategy, make new investments in innovative solutions for low-value commodities and expand our portfolio of renewable natural gas plants, all of which position us perfectly to benefit our shareholders over the next three to five years. In addition to the E in ESG, we're taking the S, our social responsibility very seriously too. Whether it's our long-established focus on inclusion and diversity, our commitment to our employees to enhance benefits and guaranteed hours during COVID or our efforts to help the underserved and unemployed through our work with organizations like UpSpire and Concordance Academy, we believe in these causes and we're very confident in the long-term value add for our shareholders. It's rewarding to see that our focus on ESG as a strategic value creator for our shareholders, as well as being the right thing to do is getting recognition. At the beginning of February we were named to Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies List for the third year in a row, claiming the top spot in our industry category. During the fourth quarter we were named to CDP's prestigious A List for tackling climate change. The global environmental non-profit recognized Waste Management for the fifth consecutive year, for our actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and help develop the low-carbon economy. We were also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for North America and the World. For the third year in a row we are in the title of Sector Leader for Commercial Services & Supplies. Our view is that our strategic approach to ESG will complement our investments in technology and our core business process improvements, as the key ingredients of our future success. Last year, we laid the foundation for lowering our operating cost model and for offering greater choice to how our customers interact with us and we completed the sizable acquisition of ADS. All of this positions us well for growth in 2021. In the year ahead, we expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%, as we continue to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and expect volume growth to improve in 2021 as the impact from the pandemic lessens. From an operating cost perspective, we've learned how to operate our business with a lower cost structure and we remain -- we expect to retain that lower cost structure in 2021 and beyond. As a result, we anticipate overall operating EBITDA growth between 10% and 13.5% in 2021. We expect this substantial growth as we realize the value of synergies from continuing to integrate ADS and improve the profitability of its business, all while we increase our investment in CSD. The benefits from these technology investments and the full integration of ADS will provide runway for further margin expansion in the future. In closing, we performed exceptionally well in 2020, despite the difficulties presented with COVID-19 and we're poised for another strong year in 2021. For that, I'm eternally grateful to our teammates who have made it happen this year in the face of difficult circumstances. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our strong finish to 2020, both the performance of the legacy Waste Management business and our progress in integrating the ADS operations. As Jim said, our quarterly and full year results really underscore the strength and resiliency of our business model. Improving volumes, healthy pricing and better recycling performance produced organic revenue growth for the first time since the pandemic began. As expected, legacy Waste Management collection and disposal volumes improved sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of 5.5% in the third quarter to a decline of 2.7% in the fourth. Fourth quarter MSW volume grew 1.2% and C&D volume, excluding hurricane cleanup, grew 1.8%, both strong indicators of continued economic recovery. While the rate of volume recovery did moderate during the quarter, we did not see a backslide when COVID cases increased in the fall. In fact, as we look at volumes in January, we're encouraged to see improvement from the lull in late November and December. Collection and disposal yield was 2.3% in the fourth quarter and core price was 3.2%. Adjusted for the impact of lower volume, core price would have been 3.8%. In the collection business, we continue to make progress improving the residential line of business. Our residential yield improved 60 basis points to 3.7% in the fourth quarter, compared to the same period in 2019 and was up again sequentially from 3.5% in the third quarter. Residential volumes declined 1.4%, as we shed business that does not meet our return requirements. Overall, our actions to improve the residential line of business in 2020 resulted in $40 million of operating EBITDA benefit and we expect this to carry forward into 2021. In the post-collection business, fourth quarter landfill core price was 3.3% and transfer station core price was 3.1% demonstrating our continued pricing discipline in these key lines of business. Moving to costs. Operating costs were 61.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter, compared to 60.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. There were some noise in the fourth quarter results. Let me walk you through the difference. In the quarter, as expected, the ADS acquisition increased operating expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points. Additionally, the timing of government approvals for fuel tax credits, which benefited the fourth quarter of 2019 with two years' worth of credits, resulted in a 150-basis-point headwind to operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. Aside from these impacts, operating costs as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points, demonstrating that we are laser-focused on cost control and continue to benefit from a lower cost structure. As an example, commercial yards and industrial halls declined between 5% and 6% during the fourth quarter, yet overtime decreased in the range of 15% to 18% and we see additional opportunities. We also have plenty of opportunity to improve operating costs as a percentage of revenue in the ADS business, as we further integrate operations and work to exceed our planned synergies. Devina will cover our 2021 financial guidance in more detail, but I want to spend a minute on some key components of growth as we look at the year ahead. We are extremely confident in the aspects of our outlook that we can control and we based our guidance on a stabilizing economy, moderate volume growth and disciplined pricing. We expect organic revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5% and overall revenue growth between 10.75% and 11.25% during 2021. We hit the ground running on the ADS integration on October 30 and it's progressing very well. We expect to achieve between $50 million and $60 million in synergies during 2021. Combined with the $10 million to $15 million of annualized synergies already achieved in the fourth quarter, our run rate synergies exiting 2021 is expected to be between $60 million and $75 million. We are extremely confident in achieving these synergies and that we'll be able to capture the remaining synergies in the first half of 2022. About one-third of the 2021 synergies will come from route optimization which will begin early in the second quarter. We estimate that our onetime cost to achieve these synergies will be $50 million in 2021. And as we've mentioned, we plan to adjust the majority of these costs from our results.  As Jim discussed, our recycling and renewal energy businesses are central to our strategy and we're anticipating strong growth from these businesses in the year ahead. We expect continued improvement in recycling from our fee-for-service model, improved operating cost structure at new MRFs and stable demand for recycled materials which together provide a tailwind of between $40 million and $50 million to 2021 operating EBITDA.  We also expect an incremental $10 million of year-over-year contribution from our renewable energy business from the sale of RINs as pricing for those credits has increased over the last several months. Devina will talk more about our plans to invest in these key businesses in 2021.  In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team including our new team members from ADS for their focus in what continues to be difficult and distracting times. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations and I know this will continue in the year ahead.  I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2020 financial results and 2021 financial outlook and further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John and good morning. Our 2020 results demonstrate strong execution from our frontline teams across North America serving our customers throughout the pandemic and doing so in an increasingly cost-effective way.  The same focused execution and cost discipline extended to our team members in sales and back-office functions, which delivered strong SG&A results for the year. Excluding $25 million of SG&A for the ADS business, SG&A improved by $56 million in 2020 to 10.2% of revenue, a 10-basis-point improvement over 2019. We achieved these results while accelerating our technology investments and despite the revenue decline from the pandemic.  I'm proud of our team for this cost discipline in a difficult economic environment. Fourth quarter capital spending was $394 million and that included $29 million of capital to support the integration of ADS and about $30 million of capital that we intentionally pulled forward given the strong recovery in our operations during the third and fourth quarters. 2020 capital spending was $1.632 billion. Our team showed tremendous discipline throughout 2020 as we focused on reducing capital spending in a targeted manner given the volume declines from the pandemic.  Waste Management generated free cash flow of $2.656 billion in 2020. Given the significant impact of the ADS transaction on this result, let me provide detail on some of the moving pieces. After-tax proceeds from the divestitures of ADS and Waste Management businesses to GFL were $691 million. These proceeds were partially offset by after-tax transaction and advisory costs to support the acquisition of $117 million.  Normalizing for these two items, 2020 free cash flow was $2.082 billion. This result demonstrates the resilient nature of our business and the strength of capital discipline as we nearly achieved our original 2020 free cash flow guidance of $2.15 billion despite the impact of COVID-19.  Given the strong result at the end of 2020, we were positioned to forgo relief provided by the CARES Act and we elected to pay approximately $120 million of payroll taxes that we had planned to defer. As we repay that amount in 2021 and 2022 as anticipated, 2020 free cash flow excluding the ADS impact I mentioned would have been about $2.2 billion for the year, which is better than we expected at the end of the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $231 million in dividend. For the full year, we returned $1.33 billion to shareholders comprised of $927 million in dividends and $402 million in share repurchases.  In November, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes at an extremely attractive pre-tax weighted average cost of less than 1.5%. This allowed us to repay short-term borrowings used to fund the ADS acquisition at close. 2021 cash interest savings are expected to be more than $90 million.  Fourth quarter total debt-to-EBITDA of 3.19 times and forecasted leverage ratios are both well within the financial covenants of our revolving credit facilities. We are committed to returning to our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times total debt-to-EBITDA during 2021. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong and we are well positioned to continue our practices of sound investment and strong shareholder returns.  Moving to our 2021 outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate 10.75% to 11.25% revenue growth in the year ahead with solid organic growth in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5%. This underpins our 2021 operating EBITDA guidance of $4.75 million and $4.9 million. We expect this strong earnings growth to drive free cash flow of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion.  Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.78 billion and $1.88 billion in 2021. Excluding about $90 million of capital planned to support the ADS integration this expectation is in line with our long-term capital spend as a percentage of revenue target of 9.5% to 10.5% even while we step up our investments in CSD. As Jim mentioned, we also see potential incremental investment opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, both of which aid in our sustainability efforts and generate strong returns. As we've now seen improved returns in our state-of-the-art MRFs, we are taking plans to deploy the latest technology and additional MRFs in our network and moving those forward.  We're also planning to invest in more renewable energy plants at our landfills. This investment extends our ability to close the loop between our renewable energy plant and our CNG fleet and does so with very strong economic returns for the company. We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that maximizes long-term value and total shareholder returns. As announced in December, we are pleased to be increasing our planned quarterly dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We expect our dividend payments to be about $975 million in 2021.  Given our focus on the ADS integration, we expect tuck-in acquisitions to be on the lower end of our typical range of $100 million to $200 million. With more than $1 billion remaining from our free cash flow guidance we plan to allocate that to a combination of debt repayment, share repurchases and the high-return sustainability-focused capital investment opportunities I described earlier.  In closing, I want to thank the Waste Management team for their dedication and adaptability to overcome the unique challenges of 2020. We are stronger than we were a year ago and we're looking forward to a better 2021. With that Lara, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Hamzah Mazari : Hey good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on the volume side. What are you guys seeing on commercial service increases today. how that's trending? And then in the 4% to 4.5% organic growth do you -- are you baking in any vaccine impact on volume? And how should we think about that? Jim Fish : Yes. Good morning, Hamzah. First as far as service increases go, we looked at the fourth quarter as being really good news because it's the first quarter in a while that we've seen net service increases. We were negative of course in Q2 and negative in Q3. And so we turned positive in Q4 and that's very good news as it relates to -- particularly as it relates to small business. And then as we think about volume overall I think what we -- most macroeconomists are saying that the economy recovers as the vaccine rolls out. And so volume is the one that is hardest for us to predict. Normally, it's fairly predictable for us but it's hardest to predict this go-round because we don't know how quickly the vaccine rolls out. But we are starting to see some encouraging signs from states that we talked about previously that were lagging. States like Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania are starting to show some signs of recovery. There are some states like California, New York and then also provinces like I would say Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec that are still way behind. But -- and then of course the states that have been -- that opened first like Texas, like Arizona, Tennessee, Florida those states have been doing actually reasonably well. So our expectation is that those states that are starting to reopen and even the states that haven't started will start to perk up here. And we think that we'll be back to some sense of normalcy on the volume front in the back half of 2021. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. That's very helpful. And just any comments or thoughts around the new EPA head? And any changes you see regulation-wise that could impact your business from sort of the Biden administration. whether it's PFAS around leachate whether it's renewable tax credits increasing? Historically I think you've been able to pass through environmental regulation costs as a fee, but just any thoughts around that? And is the increased investment in MRFs and landfill to gas is that linked to what you see coming out of the EPA at all, or you would have done this anyway? Jim Fish : So I'll take the last one first. Not really related to what we're seeing coming out of the EPA. First of all it's very early in this new administration. So those investments are really related to the fact that we believe from an ESG standpoint that they are the right thing to do but we also believe that they provide great shareholder return. So -- and we've -- this is not something that came to us in the last three months. I mean we've been investing in these renewable plants on a -- and doing it diligently over the last probably four -- three to four years. And then of course the recycling business is also related. But we do think that there is a nice uptrend starting and it will continue. And we believe that it's not your normal ebb and flow in terms of commodity prices. It's why I said in my script I think we're disproportionately affected by this in a good way. So your first question really relates to what our expectations are coming out of the new administration. And in an odd sort of way Hamzah we feel like more, I guess greater regulation is actually a good thing for us because we hold ourselves to a higher standard than the baseline regulations. Whether it's from EPA or whether it's from state DEPs we hold ourselves to a higher standard. And so, therefore greater regulation actually ends up being a differentiator for us. And while we don't know exactly what will come out of EPA in the form of regulation around things like PFAS or coal combustion residuals things like that we do look at this as being an opportunity. So we're not displeased with what the future holds for us from that standpoint. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Just a clarification question I'll turn it over. Are you guys guiding EPS, or is that sort of not part of guidance anymore? I'm just curious if there's a change in guidance or maybe we missed it. Jim Fish : We didn't guide EPS and I don't think we did last year either Devina. Devina Rankin : No. And the real thing there Hamzah that we're focused on is purchase price allocation impacts to depreciation are difficult to predict. And while we have a really strong view of the purchase price allocation with our 12/31 close, that's something that can get adjusted throughout the next several months. And so the depreciation impacts are something that we'll get better clarity on over the course of the year. But that's one of the things that created noise in EPS and one of the reasons we elected not to guide on that front. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Make sense, thank you so much. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. So your next question will come from the line of Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Kyle White : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hope everyone is doing well. And I think that everyone's family is just safe during this pure weather that's occurring. I wanted to talk about ADS and just kind of see how the integration is going. Anything in particular better or worse than you expected about the assets now that you own them? John Morris : Kyle no, I think I would tell you 90-plus days in I think we're right on track. I think there's been no real surprises. The things that we've encountered have all been things frankly that we've contemplated. We did have the benefit of a longer timeframe getting ready for it. But I would tell you that, I think we're exactly where we should be in fact probably a little bit ahead. As you heard in my script the one area that will take total Q2 to get going in terms of synergies is on the routing side and that has as much to do with data and system migration as it is anything else. And in addition there's some technology improvements that we're making right now in the ADS fleet to be able to take advantage of all the processes that we have in place to drive efficiency. But I would tell you I'm very, very pleased with where we're at so far. Kyle White : Got it. And I know it's still ongoing in a very sporadic situation, but do you have a sense of the impact that this extreme weather is causing to your volumes or maybe increased cost of the business? John Morris : I would tell you certainly in the Houston area right now it's been a rough couple of days and this is not nearly a part of the country that deals with this kind of stuff very well as evidenced by what's happening here. But I think outside of Houston, we don't have a real feel for what is going to -- how significant it's going to be going forward outside of really Texas. Jim Fish : I wish I had a sense Kyle of what -- of the damage to my house, because I have a little bit of damage at the house so. Devina Rankin : It'd be great to know when power and water are coming back. Kyle White : Well, I hope everyone is safe and I hope it over quickly. Thank you. I'll turn it over. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning, everyone. Jim Fish : Good morning, Tyler. Devina Rankin : Good morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, Devina so thank you for all the guidance. It's very helpful. So as I look at the guidance and I think on my math you're looking for something like 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion in 2021, if my math is right. My feeling is there's quite a bit moving around in there. Can you just talk about the puts and takes on margins from a year-over-year basis maybe thinking about core expansion maybe how much recycling is going to help and then maybe how dilutive M&A might be? Devina Rankin : Certainly. So \u2013 and you are absolutely right, there are puts and takes but we still see good strong margin expansion on that path toward 30% that I know that we consistently talk about. The organic revenue and EBITDA growth of our core solid waste business we see improving 30 to 50 basis points in the year ahead. That is going to be partially offset by some known cost headwinds and then also a very intentional increased technology spend level. The increase in technology spending specifically has about a 30-basis-point impact on the margin measure and about a $50 million impact on EBITDA dollars. In terms of the other puts and takes, I would say recycling from a margin perspective, isn't actually one of the things that's contributing to the margin either expansion or detraction. And that's because for us we have the recycling brokerage business, which tends to offset the margin expansion that we see in the traditional MRF business. So as we see the operations improve on the MRF side, we tend to see a little bit of dilution from growth in our brokerage business which is a very good return on invested capital business for us it dilutes margin. On the renewable energy side, there will be some margin expansion and that was strong in the fourth quarter and something that we are basically including in our 2021 guidance based on how we finished the fourth quarter of 2020. So potentially some upside there, if we see RINs prices continue to escalate from where we ended the fourth quarter. And then with regard to the ADS acquisition, I want to pause on that one for a moment. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 18.5% for the ADS business. That's below their run rate of 24.5% on a WM measurement basis. As a reminder ADS's EBITDA margin included some adjustments for both share-based compensation and accretion that Waste Management doesn't take in its own EBITDA measure. So, on an apples-to-apples basis ADS's margin was 24.5%. And we have strong confidence that, we'll get them up to about 28% in 2021, and then continue the march to WM levels from that point on. Tyler Brown : Okay. Extremely helpful. Thank you. Real quickly as well from a modeling perspective so I think you mentioned you paid the $120 million in CARES back. I'm just unclear, is that just the half that was due for 2021, or does that repay the burden for both 2021 and 2022? Devina Rankin : That repays the burden for 2021 and 2022. So the entire $120 million that we had been deferring over the second and third quarters was repaid in Q4. Tyler Brown : Okay. Awesome. Thank you. And then John, I know we've talked about resi margins quite a bit in the past. In 2020 did resi margins improve as you refocused there? It sounds like they did. And then secondly, how long do you think it takes to get that business back to either call it a more historical margin level, or maybe a level that you would be more happy with? John Morris : Well, what I would tell you is, how in my prepared remarks we talked about $40 million of benefit being generated in that line of business in 2020. I would tell you, we still obviously have work to do in 2021. I don't \u2013 we're not going to get there in 2021. And frankly some of the other hills, we're having to climb around COVID and the weights hopefully that's going to moderate in the back half of the year as things, as Jim mentioned, if vaccines get out there and things start to moderate to whatever to normal. In the back half of the year, we're also going to have a better view of what the residential weights are going to look like long term. What I would tell you is not lost in that mix is the fact that our price and yield in residential continues to be strong despite what's going on with CPI, and we've talked about that for the last handful of years. And the other part that's part of that equation is while we talk about the recycling business improving a big piece of the recycling business affects residential. So when you look at those margin improvements, we're overcoming some of those other headwinds that weren't there when we started this initiative so to speak. Tyler Brown : Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys. Devina Rankin : Thank you, Tyler. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Kevin Chiang : Great. Thanks for taking my question. And hope everyone is safe as well. Maybe just turning to one of your prepared comments around I guess you're seeing an acceleration in some of the technology initiatives you had. I think you called it a triple-digit rate increase in your online sales channel, for example. If I recall, at your Investor Day, you kind of laid out a bunch of technology initiatives. And I think in aggregate that was going to generate $150 million of savings or kind of earnings opportunities. Just as you stick here today through the pandemic, do you see the ability to achieve that coming sooner? Is the upside potential potentially bigger just given maybe the change in some of your customers behavior through the pandemic? Jim Fish : Yeah. So to answer that question, at least it's hard to say whether it is a bigger opportunity for us. But because we've chosen to accelerate it, then you would expect that the impact would happen sooner for us. And we're touching really \u2013 I mean, this is a huge transformation for us. I mean, we are literally digitalizing the entire relationship from the very front end which is where we set a customer up all the way through the routing and dispatch, and then collection functions, and all the way through billing and the back end of the process. So it's a massive effort for us, but it don't like it was the right thing to do to accelerate it. And so when we talked about that on an Investor Day, I would tell you that that's \u2013 that it would makes sense that by accelerating the spend we would also accelerate the benefit. I don't know, whether the benefit is necessarily bigger because some of that is dependent on how much differentiation we create. And that is maybe less dependent on us and more dependent on whether competitors choose to do the same thing. But we do believe that having an end-to-end customer experience that's digitalized is something that's almost becoming just the ante to get into the game anymore. It seems as if every company that did well in Q2, when this thing hits, where digitalized in some way shape or form. And so we felt like this was absolutely the right thing to do for our customers. And we do believe that, it gives us an opportunity to grab a bigger slice of the overall pie, particularly those away from competitors that don't choose to make those investments. We know that some competitors already are making those investments or will be. But that piece is maybe a little harder to quantify. Kevin Chiang : That's helpful. And maybe just turning to your long-term debt or your leverage ratio you're looking to get that back to 2.5 to three times. But I guess if you take a look back, I mean, a lot of your comments around the resilience of the business the -- you outperformed the expectations as you go through a challenging year. Just wondering how you think about your capital structure and if there's an argument that maybe 2.5 to three times might be suboptimal for a company given the resiliency you have in your underlying earnings stream. Just like how do you think about that in the context of what you've gone through in 2020? Devina Rankin : I think it's a great question and there is no doubt that producing the free cash flow and EBITDA that Waste Management did in 2020 in the face of a global pandemic is a strong affirmation of the strength and resiliency of this business. And so arguably it certainly could position Waste Management to consider a higher leverage ratio than we had historically. That being said our focus on that long-term range of 2.5 to three times is both considering through-cycle financial position that we look to achieve and also establishing financial flexibility for strategic opportunities. And so we want to be sure that we aren't just positioned to weather a storm so to speak but that we're also positioned to be opportunistic to grow the business over the long term. And that's why we think that 2.5 to three times is the right level for strategic value for value creation for shareholders. Kevin Chiang : That's great color. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Goldstein from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Jeff Goldstein : Hey, good morning. In your prepared remarks you mentioned commercial yards and industrial hauls declined 5% to 6%, but overtime declined between 15% and 18%. I was just curious what are you doing to drive that delta? And how we should think about the sustainability of that delta in the future? John Morris : Well, I think Jeff in terms of sustainability when you really look at where we bottomed out in Q2 and then you look at Q3 and Q4, while the volume declines have essentially been cut by more than half we've still been able to keep a proportionate amount of overtime. And it's really just us being really focused on making sure as volumes fluctuate we optimize each day and each week when it comes to the people and the assets. The operating team is doing a really good job of holding on to that as we bottomed out. And then as we've come back we've just been able to maintain that same level of discipline about making sure that we're maximizing each day and each week on an asset basis. Jeff Goldstein : Okay, got it. And then thinking to the 2021 core price growth guidance of 4%, can you parse out your expectations across commercial, resi, industrial and landfill? Will the price increases being relative lockstep, or are there some areas you expect to see more strength relative to others? Thanks. John Morris : Well, I think if you look at the trend -- we didn't break it out by line of business. But I think overall if you look at the trend from again where we bottomed out to where we finished the year, the second half of the year Q3 trends into Q4, I think you follow those forward proportionately with each of the lines of business. So one area Jim commented on in his script was really around post-collection pricing both at the landfill and transfer station. We've talked about that quarter-in and quarter-out. We continued even through the pandemic to show strength and resiliency in those two buckets. And I commented on residential and that has been even pre-pandemic a real focal area for us. And while it did moderate a bit in the bottom of the pandemic we've shown progress out of that. So I think we feel comfortable with at least that 4% going into 2021. Jim Fish : Jeff, the one thing that has been the most challenging for us has been that commercial line of business because it's so impacted by small businesses. And it's also impacted by hospitality. It's impacted by schools in addition to small businesses. It's why we like the industry honestly. As you think about an investment thesis, it's why we like -- we're more of a reopen play this industry is than we might have been in the past. Because we haven't gone through something like this where everything is shut down and in many cases are still shut down. So whether it's WM or whether it's any other waste provider this is a -- this industry is a reopen play and that shows up on the pricing line as well as the volume line. We have some of the price that might be perceived as being somewhat soft in the commercial line of business is really because it's volume-related price. I mean it doesn't feel morally right to use our fee-based approach, which is a new approach for us but it's -- and it's a sophisticated approach. But you can't go and hit small businesses that are sitting across the street from Wrigley Field and who are typically customers that have a burging business during the baseball season and now they have nothing because there's no fans. You can't hit those customers with fees or with price increases. And they understand that and we understand that. They also understand that when their business reopens that we will increase prices as we normally do normal course of business. So there are some volume related price increases that we simply haven't taken and that specifically impacts that commercial line of business. Other lines as John talked about that are doing quite well are landfill and transfer. Residential, obviously, has gotten a lot of focus. So we feel very good about pricing. And there's been absolutely no loss of discipline. That's hard-coded here. It's just that there's -- that we're waiting for some of this volume to return before we feel like it's the proper time to really reapply. Jeff Goldstein : That was very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Jeff Silber : Thank you so much. In prior quarters you had given us some color on your commercial and industrial clients in terms of service status, what percentage of those customers have come back, what percentage are not coming back. I'm just wondering if we can get an update and what you think we should expect for the rest of the year. John Morris : Yeah. Jeff, we said we were probably in the high 60s approaching 70% the last time we chat. And I would still tell you we're hovering a little bit better than that right in the 70% range. And as Jim mentioned, the real gap there is just around those businesses have to return. It's really hospitality the reference to Wrigley Field, travel, lodging those kind of things. So I think the good news is that if you look at how well the business performed even without a lot of those small businesses being back online we feel very confident. As those businesses come back, we'll emerge from this even stronger. I would tell you we're -- when you look at our margin performance relative to that as well I think that's also a testament to how well we performed. And as Jim said, -- to Jim's comment, this is a reopening story I think for the industry and specifically for us. We feel very confident about how the business performs as things start to reopen really in the back half of the year. Jeff Silber : All right. That's great to hear. My follow-up question. You talked earlier about some of the potential regulatory issues from the Biden administration. I want to focus on something a little bit different. There's a proposed federal minimum wage at $15 an hour. I realize you can probably pay more than that. But when we've seen minimum wage increases in some of your territories, some of the states, some of the cities, has that put upward pressure on wages for you? And if so, are you able to pass that through to your customers? Thanks. Devina Rankin : Yeah. I think it's a great question, and it's one that we've been evaluating. I think the most important element of this for us is that we've been a competitive wage payer as a company for many years. And so, while a minimum wage could certainly effectively raise the tide with regard to where wages are we see that as something that wouldn't disproportionately impact our business and instead is something that we are ahead of in many respects because of where our wages have been historically. It's certainly something that we see the ability to consider if we see that raising -- that rising tide impacts our cost structure, it's something that we would respond to on the price side of the business. Jeff Silber : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Go ahead. Noah Kaye : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Jim, I just want to pick up on what you were saying previously around some of the pricing considerations related to volume coming back. And it's really about sort of how pricing and yield cadence might trend over the course of the year. One might think that just because first half of 2020 yield comps are a little bit easier relative to the second half, and you have the CPI headwind in the back half of the year that you would see better pricing in the front half and ease off in the back half. But it sounds from your comments like there may be just more open-market pricing power you envision later in the year, and so perhaps, pricing will be more ratable. Is that a fair way to think about it, or can you steer me properly? Thanks. Jim Fish : Yeah. I think that's a fair way to think about it. I mean we have different approaches to different lines of business. So, landfill and transfer honestly, had not gotten the focus that commercial has gotten until probably two years ago. So we've been very focused on landfill and transfer pricing. And so, similarly, we've been very focused recently on residential. And John has talked about that probably for the last four quarters. I think commercial is, as I said, it's -- we've really established a more sophisticated-based approach to commercial pricing, but we do have a significant percentage of those commercial customers that are small businesses. And one that we didn't mention necessarily this morning, but it is schools. I mean schools are I think make up 12% of our commercial business. And in some states -- and I hate to even think about this, but in some states schools haven't returned. So -- and that's grade schools that's high schools and that's universities. That's a big part of our commercial business. It's a part of our industrial business as well. But when it's 12% of your commercial business, it makes a difference. And you're simply not able to price increase customers, who either haven't returned or have returned sparingly. So we think schools are a huge focus at the state level and the federal level and that they -- so the kids need to get back into school and so, I think you'll see the schools reopen fully as we get through the vaccine and we see that at the back half of the year. Noah Kaye : Yeah. And I want to talk -- that really sets up a more medium-term to longer-term question around the cycle here. I mean one would look at the typical indicators, very robust housing starts activity, God-willing a full year of reopening in 2022. And then it certainly looks like CPI is going to be higher for 2021 versus 2020. Does it seem right to you that we may have some acceleration of growth in 2022? And how are you aligning the business for that if so? Jim Fish : Yes that sure seems like a logical conclusion to me. I mean it feels like this economy is ready to really take off like a space shuttle. And so we're seeing some indications of that. Probably our C&D line of business from a volume perspective is the best indicator. That had been down -- way down in Q2, I mean double-digits down. And for the fourth quarter, our C&D volume in Orlando was up 5.5%. So that's starting to tell me -- and that's probably one of the best leading indicators that we have in terms of volume that tells me that things are -- or the pump is primed and it's ready to go. Noah Kaye : Yeah. Thanks very much. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of David Manthey from Baird. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. David Manthey : Thank you. Good morning. Was hoping you could update us on the current levels and your year-end 2021 targets for the percentage of municipal contracts that are linked to a more representative water sewer trash CPI index as well as fee-for-service recycling contracts. John Morris : So what we've traditionally said is about 40% of our revenue is somehow indexed. I think the better metric to look at is really what we've done on core price and yield within residential over really the last six or seven quarters. I'm looking at Devina to make sure. We've shown progress in each and every quarter including three to four and throughout 2020 and we expect that absolutely to continue in 2021. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we did shed a little bit of business here in 2020. But as I've mentioned in a number of these calls, if it doesn't meet our margin and return criteria we're comfortable doing that. It's not our intent, but we're going to make sure that we deploy our capital to where we get reasonable returns and margins. Jim Fish : I'm not sure John, of what percentage -- we can get to the percentage for water sewer trash. Suffice to say, it has gone up. In fact we've seen -- I've seen a couple of contracts come across my desk where we are -- where we won the bid and we've increased them off of some of these indices that really weren't representative of our cost structure to water sewer trash. But I don't know John, the exact percentage. We can get you that percentage for you. John Morris : Yes. And we'll circle back with that number. David Manthey : Okay. And then, as you work to get the highest cost mile off the road for modeling purposes, is it more relevant to compare overtime trends in 2021 with maybe 2019? And if so, what would -- is like a 5% more or less kind of decrease something that would be reasonable just given the wild swings we saw in overtime in 2020? John Morris : I don't know if I'd go back to 2019. What I would look at is where we bottomed out in Q2 and what our overtime percentages we're going into that and how we've come out of it. To me that's really been the barometer as this volume declines have really come back more than half in commercial and industrial. As for obvious reasons residential is a little different. But we've been able to outpace the volume increases if you will from an overtime perspective, for us to be down mid-teens and overtime with still 5%, 6%, 7% volume declines is pretty impressive. So I don't know about 2019. David I think the better barometer for us is how we've done in 2020 and how we progressed from the peak of volume decline to where we are now. And I think as I mentioned that's what gives us confidence going into 2021 and then add in the benefit of us getting into the integration of the ADS customers after we migrate the data here in Q2. All those things I think add up to a really positive outlook for us on the OpEx side. David Manthey : That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Sean Eastman : Hi, Jim. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to dig in on the kind of the free cash flow bridge from 2020 to 2021. I mean again quite a few moving parts. It seems like we should be building off of a $2.2 billion number in 2020 in essence. But Devina maybe if you could just kind of give us a simple kind of rundown of that bridge and those moving parts from a free cash flow perspective that would be great. Devina Rankin : Yes. So the $2.2 billion that you remark on is a good place for us to start. I think when we think about EBITDA growth always being the biggest contributor there certainly have strong outlook for EBITDA in the year ahead with a 10% to 13.5% increase on a year-over-year basis. In addition to that, we expect the about $90 million benefit from lower cash interest that I mentioned. Cash taxes will increase with those two items going in the opposite direction and we estimate that to be about $125 million to $150 million. There will be a benefit from the fact that the company, paid the transaction cost that is in your $2.2 billion base. So I want to be sure to point that out because the ADS transaction costs are something that we adjusted for and coming to that $2.2 billion. We will have a slight increase in the money spent on the enterprise resource planning that we've discussed. We expect that to go up $15 million on a year-over-year basis. So all in all that's what gets you to your cash from operations increase in the ballpark of $500 million to $600 million. We've got a capital expenditure increase of around $150 million to $250 million. And then proceeds from divestitures we're not forecasting anything significant there have given our traditional range of $50 million to $100 million. Sean Eastman : Okay. Super helpful. And next one for me is just on RIN. It sounds like this is going to be a growing piece of the business. And it'd be helpful maybe just to get some context for how significant of an earnings driver you foresee this being in maybe five to 10 years. And maybe as of today, is there a rough idea on what the sensitivity in EBITDA is to RIN prices today? Jim Fish : Yes. Probably all three of us could take a shot at this one. I'll go first and then I'll just pick up the pieces after I pull this up. But I think \u2013 look, I think it depends a little bit on \u2013 to your first question, it depends on how we choose to grow this business. I mean you could make a case that you grow this business outside of our own balance sheet. And so we are \u2013 we have not gone down that path but if you wanted to really kind of blow out this business in a good way and take advantage of what we think is going to be a long-term trend for RINs pricing you could do that or we can grow it within our own business within our own balance sheet. And so we haven't made a decision there. Obviously to date everything has been grown out of our own capital expenditures. So and anything that we're contemplating probably at least for the first half of 2021 would \u2013 and maybe for the entire year would be grown through capital expenditures, as Devina mentioned in her prepared remarks. But we do think that this is a \u2013 as I said there's a long-term uptrend here for commodities. And so that's why I believe it benefits us, disproportionately, regardless of where you look in our earnings stream, whether you look at renewable energy with $2.50 RIN pricing or whether you look at our recycling business, where we're the biggest recycler out there. We feel like this is a more of a three to five year trend. There's a number of reasons for why we see that. I mean here's \u2013 commodities, obviously have been a pretty heavy ebb if you will. And so \u2013 but if we look just at our own business, we see that there is increased demand for cardboard for example, that's driven by what we've discovered in the pandemic that everybody is taking delivery of Amazon boxes at their houses. So we feel like all of these businesses that have commodity price exposure looks to \u2013 they look to have a fairly long uptrend coming. And that's why we are excited about the prospects of whether it's our recycling business or our renewable energy business. And that renewable energy business by the way is made possible by the fact that we have 60% to 70% of our fleet is natural gas. And that also is something that can't be matched in the industry percentage-wise. I hope that helps answer some of that. John? John Morris : The only thing I would add there with the new administration, I think two things that the new administration will deal with is the RVO, which is a Renewable Volume Obligation and a small refinery exemption, which are two buckets that have really driven RIN pricing in the past, right because there's been a lack of clarity on that. And I think if they stabilize both of those, we're going to see some more stability in RIN pricing, whether it stays at $2.50 or whatever. But I think we'll see more stability and I think that's going to help inform us where we deploy our own capital. Devina Rankin : And EBITDA for the renewable energy business was up about $50 million in 2020. What's important to note is that that wasn't all price-related. Some of that was our intentional investment as Jim mentioned that we've been making over the last three to four years. So there was volume and price acceleration in 2020 that provided about $50 million of EBITDA growth. And we see about a $10 million to $15 million improvement in 2021 based on where RINs prices were at the end of 2020. Sean Eastman : Okay. Got it. Very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Thanks, guys. John Morris : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is now live. Go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much and I appreciate you staying on here this long. I want to just touch on the service interval trend assumption in your model. What I think I heard correctly is you did \u2013 you had a favorable improvement in 4Q but you're not assuming it continues to improve favorably. It's stable and therefore that's upside if the housing cycle converts into new business formations. Devina Rankin : The way that I would look at that Michael is our volume guide at the macro level for 2021 is about 1.5% volume growth. Clearly a lot of that is built into the second quarter just coming off of the very low base of Q2. We do see some upside in the back half of the year. From a service interval perspective, I wouldn't say that we took that volume guidance to the different parts of -- different lines of business specifically such that I can bifurcate what of that is commercial or industrial. But what we looked at based on how our cost structure responded in 2020, we think that the contribution margin of that volume is around 45% in the year ahead. Jim Fish : Michael to one of the earlier questions about, does the economy feel like there's a lot of momentum behind it that's ready to really take off? Once we get past this, I think the answer is, yes. We just -- because we don't have a ton of control over that. That's the one that we don't have really much control over, which is volume because of this -- when the pandemic starts to -- the effects that start to lessen. So if your question is about is there conservatism in this volume forecast of 1.5%? I would tell you that the answer is probably more likely, yes than no, but it's -- it is largely dependent on when this reopening comps. But as I said to the earlier question, I absolutely believe that that's a logical conclusion that this economy will be ready to take off once we get past it. Michael Hoffman : Right. And yes that's where I was getting to is the history is household formation drives new business formation. We're at $1.5 million and change start $300,000 more than it's been for five years. At some point here the empty storefront gets backfilled. Jim Fish : That's right. Michael Hoffman : You needed a dry cleaner. You need another drugstore or what have you. And that's a box and that's service interval growth. That was the way to think about it. Jim Fish : Yes. That's right Michael. Michael Hoffman : Just to be clear, cadence-wise, based on how you ended the year here it looks like you could actually be flat. It's just barely negative on volume in 1Q and then have a nice pop and then settle into a lower but sustained trend in the second half. Am I thinking about the cadence correctly there? Jim Fish : Michael, I certainly can do the math and get there. I think we saw lull in late November and December. But the good news as I mentioned earlier is that through the first six-or-so weeks been encouraged by what we've seen on the volume front. Now six weeks does not make a trend. But to your question and relative to Q1 we feel pretty optimistic through the first six weeks anyway in terms of volume. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And Devina if I could try a different tack on a waterfall on two things the EBITDA and the free cash. In the year at four three, I'm rounding you guided to four eight. It looks like Advanced would be about two 60 incremental. And you get recycling John mentioned 45. You mentioned 10 to 15 in RINs. That leaves me like 190 coming from solid waste. Have I thought about that sort of the pieces in the right zone there correctly on the EBITDA to go from four three to four eight? Devina Rankin : So we have expectations for the ADS business a little north of what you just projected. We have the $50 million increase in technology that I mentioned earlier that is not part of your bridge. And then we have the known cost headwinds that I mentioned. So you can think of those being specifically related to health and welfare costs risk management costs and incentive compensation. Those are about $100 million in the aggregate. So those are the pieces of the bridge in addition to what you outlined. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then I'm just trying to piece together the question that was asked earlier about the free cash flow one. So it seems like you'd started at $2.082 billion because you paid the CARES Act back. So it's -- that's gone. And you're going to two three. That's $220 million roughly year-over-year net. But the absolute is actually closer to $300 million because you've got about $100-and-some million of cash tax and the like ERP. So I'm really -- I'm looking at a sort of a gross $300 million improvement and then offset by some cash tax issues and ERP. Like is that -- did I get -- did I pull those pieces together about right? Devina Rankin : Yes. Yes you did. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So last one and I know you and I do this all the time, you wants to find your baseline free cash is $2 billion. And I just want to ask is am I looking through the lens correctly on what I think your own self-help opportunities are that ADS brings in $150 million to $200 million. Eventually working capital has the potential for $150 million to $200 million. IT is another $75 million. So there's a $375 million to $475 million baseline upside. I get it might take a couple of years to get all of that before I even introduced 5% to 6% annual recurring growth in the cash. Am I thinking through this correctly? And if I am all of that self-help, I don't need anything to happen in the macro. That's something you can do. Devina Rankin : Yes. The only thing -- so I agree with you 100% that working capital and ADS free cash flow directly to free cash flow. The technology additions that we've mentioned you would have the tax effect. That's the only other item that I would clarify on what you just did, but otherwise I think we're in the same place. Jim Fish : And then I'm not sure Michael how much of kind of, I mean, your very first question is factored into your math there, which is an economy that grows at a faster pace than the normal economy because of this reemergence. I don't know how much of that's in there but we do believe that's real. We just haven't put it into 2021 yet. Michael Hoffman : Yes. Well that to me just takes your baseline growth rate of -- if it's five six it turns into a six to eight. That's what I think. Jim Fish : Yes. Right. Yes. Michael Hoffman : And lastly would you talk to us about how inflation influences your business model? I think it's a positive. I'm in the camp that you love inflation and that just helps pricing leverage, but can you talk about that? Jim Fish : I guess, it's -- I'm not sure I would say, I love inflation, but yes, I get your point. I mean, we are good at passing it through our pricing mechanisms. And so while we -- and look maybe the best example of that has been landfills where we've seen inflation on the cost side of our landfills for probably two years. And as a result, we've started to get quite a bit better on pricing at the landfill and at the transfer station. So we do expect that inflation has been extraordinarily low for quite a long time. I don't know that that lasts for a lifetime. So I think we will see inflation tick back up certainly on the commodity side. And -- but we will do a good job of making sure that gets passed through and then add some margin to it through pricing programs. Devina Rankin : And the thing I'd add to that is there's leverage on that as we see better execution with technology to optimize the back-office processes, we've talked about as John and team drive the organization to be more efficient on the road every day. So we've seen tremendous operating and SG&A leverage that helps us to combat inflation. And so those things give us leverage in an inflationary environment as well. Michael Hoffman : Right. That offsets your internal cost inflation and then the incremental leverage on inflation to your price spread just drives incremental, margin expansion and free cash flow growth. Devina Rankin : Absolutely. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right. Thank you very much for taking my questions. And I hope everybody is safe down there [Indiscernible] weather. Devina Rankin : Thanks, Michael. John Morris : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Michael Feniger : Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Jim just following up on, Hamzah's question around the new EPA and the PFAS question, there's obviously a lot of headlines around super fund sites, and designation of the chemical, and liabilities and lawsuits. Is there any direction or regulation you're specifically looking for or that we should keep an eye out for that would sway things a certain way, or is it just kind of status quo in terms of your investments there and what you guys have been doing for the last few years? Jim Fish : Yeah. Michael, I think, it's probably -- it's still a little bit early in that game. There's a lot of discussion around PFAS but -- so I'm not sure that -- it's not that we don't have a strategy from a lobbying standpoint. We do have a team in D.C. that is looking at this closely. But I guess the main thing I would say about PFAS is that, while some people are looking at it as a cost we're looking at it as an opportunity for us. I think it goes back to I think to the original premise of your question, which is, if something changes environmentally through EPA as a result of the new administration and part of it might be PFAS, how does that affect us? And we think, it actually has potentially a positive impact and that's why we're looking at it as an opportunity, as opposed to just a cost. John Morris : And Jim, the one example, I gave is if you think about contaminated soil. That's a place where this PFAS resides, regularly. And we look at our landfills, as being a perfect solution for that, with the right technology on the back end. Jim Fish : Absolutely right. Michael Feniger : Yeah. That was really helpful. That's good color. And Jim, just lastly, just I love to get your big-picture view on M&A. I mean the ADS integration is underway. The approval process was certainly longer than anyone expected. Some of your peers are expecting another sizable year of outsized tuck-ins. Just with so much consolidation underway right now. I'm just wondering if long-term M&A, at Waste Management shifts. Are we shifting to find new markets for you guys to grow into outside of traditional waste with what's kind of played out in the last few years? Thanks. Jim Fish : I guess that's possible. I mean, I guess, what I can tell you with 100% certainty is we're not doing any more big solid waste acquisitions, because I -- part of the reason that this took as long as it did was COVID-related. Part of it was just the complexity of it. I mean, it was a complex transaction in a space where both companies played a major role. We're number one in the space and ADS was number four. So, there was a lot of complexity. There was a lot of work to be done with DOJ. And so I really don't expect that, at least WM would do another large solid waste acquisition in North America. We'll do tuck-ins. And to Devina's point about, $100 million is where we think we'll come in this year. So I think we can continue to do tuck-ins. And then, as far as our strategy for M&A going out, I think what we've all chosen to do is just really focus right now on the integration of ADS. And once we feel comfortable that that's been well integrated then start to think about what acquisitions look like in the years beyond 2021, 2022. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Stephanie Yee from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Stephanie Yee : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a question about, kind of your longer or medium-term growth algorithm. So, I think at your Investor Day you had laid out that average yield could be about 2%, volume growth being about 2%. And that drives five-some percent of EBITDA growth. I was wondering, if maybe ADS or COVID has changed that algorithm, or if it's too early to tell at this point? Devina Rankin : Yeah. I would tell you, it's too early for us to tell at this point. The one thing that we did and we've mentioned, from the time that we laid everything out, at Investor Day was accelerate some of the technology spend. And that acceleration of technology spends is one of the things that has kind of put a little bit of downside pressure on the growth rate, in EBITDA that we had talked about. But we expect that to provide an acceleration of the returns coming as soon as 2022. John Morris : I would only add Devina is that, when you think about, when and how we bought ADS, they were very similar to us in terms of the volume declines. They were suffering through Q2 and Q3. So as Jim talked about, in the traditional business being a reopening story we think there's obviously some leverage of ADS business, now tucked in reopening and us getting the same lift out of that. Devina Rankin : Good point. Stephanie Yee : Okay, okay. Great. Thanks for that color. John Morris : Thanks, Stephanie. Operator : Thank you. And presenters, as I'm not seeing any further questions from the phone line at this time. You can go ahead and continue please. Jim Fish : Okay. Thanks. And just to wrap-up today, look, there have been so many challenges in this year that we've all faced and that of course includes, -- and thank you by the way for all of your comments, about what's going on in Texas this week. I mean, honestly, for those of us here it felt like Hurricane Harvey part two a little bit. A lot of damage to homes, including my own house and a big, big percentage of the state without power, without water et cetera. Not sure that it needed to be that way honestly, but it was. And so, I guess the positive coming out of it is that it tells me that the human spirit is alive and well. We -- and we at WM or in our personal lives, we take care of each other during these difficult times. And so, thank you to all of our 50,000 teammates, that's -- for all you do each and every day. And thanks to all of you on the call, for joining us this morning. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, sir. Thank you so much presenters. And again, thank you everyone for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe. And have a lovely day.",

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. It was said many times last year that 2020 was a year like no other. For many reasons, it was an incredibly difficult and trying year. Yet our positive message internally was the great companies use tough times to better themselves, and that\u2019s precisely what WM did. And first quarter of 2021 showed that with an exclamation point. We had an exceptionally strong start to the year as we kept our focus on those fundamentals that have always been is great. Our people first, then our customers, and then we focus on the details of our business. And that order inevitably produces the best results. In Q1, it sure did as we achieved record operating EBITDA of $1.16 billion and robust cash from operations of $1.12 billion. Typically, during our first quarter earnings call, we reaffirm our full year guidance. However, as we view these strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we\u2019re making to our business model and the fact that we have yet to see a full recovery in our critical landfill commercial and industrial volumes, it became clear that we\u2019re on track to outperform our guidance from only two months ago. Combine this with the broader economic trends and all indicators show that our full year revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow are on track to meet or exceed the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in February. Devina will discuss our updated guidance, but it\u2019s safe to say, we\u2019re very excited about our performance for the first quarter, and we expect to show continued strength throughout the year. We\u2019re seeing tangible benefits from the investments that we\u2019ve made in recycling and renewable energy. In our recycling line of business, we\u2019ve developed a model for all new plants which with the addition of sophisticated technology produces far better returns through a combination of added efficiencies, a higher quality of saleable material, and less residual material for disposal at the end of the process, all while our basket of recycled commodity prices have climbed back nicely to historical average price levels. Additionally, three years ago, we made the decision to close the loop between our natural gas fleet and the gas produced at our landfills by investing in the renewable energy business. We\u2019re now seeing those investments pay healthy dividends with approximately two to three-year paybacks on our four plants, in tandem with greater stability and higher pricing in the renewable energy markets. As we discussed last quarter, WM is also well-positioned to leverage our ESG leadership and particularly our focus on environmental sustainability to help our customers meet their own climate goals through recycling and other beneficial uses such as renewable energy generation. We\u2019re in a unique position to help key stakeholders rise to the challenge. And we can do this while growing our business at the same time, collaborating with our stakeholders to find new ways to create value together. Continuing to integrate environmental sustainability into our strategic business framework for long-term sustainable and profitable growth requires a strong focus, which is why we\u2019ve taken a step to dedicate a member of our senior team to this effort. I\u2019m pleased to announce that Tara Hemmer, Senior Vice President of Operations, will be taking this new role as Senior Vice President, Chief Sustainability Officer reporting directly to me effective July 1. With Tara\u2019s move, our Area Vice President leading the Greater Mid-Atlantic area, Rafa Carrasco, will be promoted to a member of the senior leadership team as Senior Vice President of Operations. We\u2019ve also launched a new exciting education benefit for our team members this month that will provide development and upskilling opportunities for our workforce. These changes underscore how the tenants of ESG are embedded into our broader business strategy. As digital transformation sweeps across nearly every industry in the way of the pandemic, we\u2019re making strides in differentiating our customers\u2019 experience through end-to-end digital transformation. Today, our customers can manage their relationship with us through online -- through our online My WM platform, which is connected operationally through our Smart Truck technology and supported by our customer analytics and data management tools. Our newly automated setup process streamlines customer orders and accelerates the speed at which we can deliver on our commitments while also reducing our cost to serve. These developments, combined with continued growth of our e-commerce channel, give us confidence that our decision to accelerate technology investments was the right one, and we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, more agile company. In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team for their hard work and dedication that has positioned us for a record-setting 2021. WM is well-positioned to benefit from the continued reopening as more states and provinces emerge from the pandemic, and we expect our commercial, industrial and landfill businesses, our three most lines of business, to benefit from further volume recovery and produce robust financial results with high incremental margins over the remainder of the year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Before reviewing the terrific operating results that we achieved in the first quarter, I want to provide an update on the integration of ADS. Over the last six months, we\u2019ve made significant progress on combining the two businesses, and we\u2019ve been able to accelerate some of our integration plans. The teams have worked tirelessly to make sure that this combination goes smoothly. And based on the success of the integration so far, we are increasing our synergy expectations to $150 million of total annual run rate synergies, $130 million coming from operating costs and SG&A savings and $20 million coming from capital savings. For 2021, we now expect synergies of between $75 million and $85 million, all coming from cost savings. With approximately $15 million of annualized synergies captured in 2020, we expect to exit 2021 on an annual run rate synergy level of around $100 million. The remaining $50 million is expected to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of operating costs, SG&A and capital expenditures. Now turning to our first quarter results. Organic revenue grew 2.1% as disciplined pricing and improved recycling results overcame modest volume declines. Pricing performance for the quarter was very solid with both, core price of 3.4%, and collection and disposal yield of 2.8%, outpacing our expectations. Notably, our commercial yield rebounded sequentially from 3.1% -- to 3.1% from 1.9% in the fourth quarter. As economic reopening progressed during the first quarter, collection and disposal volumes improved again sequentially to a decline of 2.3% from 2.7% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, net new business turned positive, churn improved meaningfully to 8.2% and service increases expanded. While volumes have recovered meaningfully from the second quarter of 2020, collection and disposal -- from the second quarter 2020 collection and disposal decline of 10.9%. As Jim pointed out, WM is positioned to benefit from further improvements in North American economies. For example, at the end of the first quarter, we have recovered about 72% of the commercial yards lost due to COVID, providing room for considerable improvement in commercial volumes as we progress through the year. Similarly, our other highest-margin businesses, industrial and landfill have volume upside opportunity as visibility into the economic reopening continues to improve and more event work is scheduled and completed. Looking at the lines of business, we\u2019re making improvements with the help of a very deliberate pricing focus, residential landfill and recycling, I\u2019m happy to report that we have had standout in each of these areas during the quarter. Residential yield doubled year-over-year to 4.2% as we make strides to improve the profitability in this line of business. This is the highest residential yield we have achieved since 2008 and it showcases our success in demonstrating the value of our service and pricing it appropriately. The increased yield drove operating EBITDA margins in the residential line of business to the highest level in the past 12 months despite still elevated residential container rates. Landfill core price was 3.2%, a strong result when you consider the impact of lower volumes related both to the pandemic and severe winter weather. In recycling, operating EBITDA doubled year-over-year to achieve earnings that rank in our top five best quarters ever. These results are truly a reflection of our work to improve the business model while creating a sustainable solution for our customers and not simply the result of an increase in recycled commodity prices. While our other top recycling quarters had an average commodity price of $127 per ton, we achieved our strong first quarter results with a price of $79 per ton. Finally, turning to costs. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are maintaining our cost discipline as volumes recover. In the first quarter, we saw a 40 basis-point improvement in our labor costs as we continue to manage overtime spending. We also saw efficiency improvements in both the commercial and industrial lines of business, which we were able to identify and capture as our investments in technology help make us nimbler. In closing, I want to thank the waste management team for the exceptional job they have done in managing our operations to position us for success in 2021. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve heard from both Jim and John, we had a fantastic start to 2021 and we forecast continued strength our business as local economies emerge from the pandemic. These strong results and our confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year have led us to raise our full year financial guidance. Revenue growth is expected to be 12.5% to 13% with combined internal revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of 4.5% or greater. The increased outlook is underpinned by our disciplined pricing programs and strong outlook for continued volume recovery. For adjusted operating EBITDA, we now expect to generate between $4.875 billion and $4.975 billion, a $100 million increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance. The improved outlook for adjusted operating EBITDA translates directly into incremental free cash flow. And we now expect that we will generate between $2.325 billion and $2.425 billion of free cash flow for the year. Our team members on the front line continue to deliver and the investments we are making in our people, technology and customer experience are generating strong results. Turning to our first quarter results. Net cash provided by operating activities grew $355 million. The contribution from operating EBITDA growth accounted for a little less than half of that increase, with the remainder coming from lower incentive compensation payments and increasing cash collections from customers, and favorable timing of some of our payables. While we expect some of the timing differences experienced in the first quarter to reverse for the year, the remaining contributors to our strong cash flow from operations results position us for a very strong year. In the first quarter, capital spending was $270 million, a $189 million decrease from the first quarter of 2020. Capital expenditures were lower in the quarter, primarily due to timing, plus the timing of fleet purchases, which we had intentionally front-loaded in 2020 and steps we took in late 2020 to accelerate some of our 2021 capital, given our confidence in the pace of volume recovery. We continue to prioritize the investments in the long-term growth of our business, including recycling, renewable energy and technology investments that we have previously discussed. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range as we invest in our business to support growth, reduce our cost to serve and extend our environmental sustainability efforts. Putting it all together, our business generated free cash flow of $865 million in the first quarter. The operating EBITDA growth, lower capital expenditures and favorable working capital changes that I discussed drove the significant year-over-year free cash flow increase. This sets us up very well to achieve our increased free cash flow outlook. In the first quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $247 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. Turning to SG&A costs. SG&A was 10.7% of revenue in the first quarter. That\u2019s a 20 basis-point increase over 2020. We remain focused on managing our discretionary costs, optimizing our structure for the ADS acquisition and using SG&A dollars to enhance our business. Our deliberate increased level of investment in technology as well as higher incentive compensation accruals are the driver of SG&A as a percentage of revenue being above our long-term target of less than 10% of revenue. Though we are committed to ensuring we return to that optimized cost structure in the near term. Our first quarter leverage ratio of 3.04 times has improved from the fourth quarter due to our strong operating EBITDA growth. This leverage ratio remains well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facility and right at the top of our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times. Our strong first quarter results and increased expectations for current year operating EBITDA and free cash flow, position us to purchase at least $1 billion of our shares in 2021, and at the same time, achieve our target leverage of 2.75 times by the end of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business, and strong and consistent shareholder returns. With the strength of our collection and disposal business, expectations for continued recovery and improved market backdrop for recycling, effective cost control and even better-than-expected integration synergies from the ADS acquisition, cash flow converges conversion is strong. And as a result, we expect to increase cash allocated to shareholder returns from our initial plans. In closing, it is imperative that we thank the men and women across the Waste Management team for their tireless efforts to serve our customers and communities each day. Our strong results are a testament to their commitment, and we\u2019re excited about what we will achieve together over the remainder of the year. With that, Holly, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Devina Rankin : Holly? Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Can you hear me? Operator : Yes. We can hear you. Jerry Revich : Okay, great. Good morning, everyone. Really nice performance out of the gate here. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about, as you look at your employee footprint today and look forward to recovery, what level of volume growth can the business absorb before we\u2019re back to adding headcount? [Technical Difficulty] Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about what\u2019s the magnitude of volume growth that your footprint can absorb off of the current run rate levels before we\u2019re back at having to add headcount. You spoke about reducing overtime in the quarter. And as we shift forward to recovery from here, I\u2019m wondering if you could touch on how we should think about absorption from here in capacity. Thanks. Jim Fish : Yes, Jerry. What I would tell you is if you looked at our performance throughout the kind of COVID, the volume slide, if you will, efficiencies improved throughout, obviously, as I mentioned, our management of over time certainly improved. And what that also did is helped us build some capacity in the system. So, as we look at the rest of 2020, what we\u2019ve revised guidance to, we feel like we\u2019re in good shape to absorb that volume. John Morris : Jerry, I would add one thing here, too, which is about adding back labor. I mean, there\u2019s a couple of dynamics here. One is that pretty much all U.S. companies are facing, large or small, is this temporary competition against the government for unemployment benefits, and that is having an impact on us. The good news for us is that we didn\u2019t lay people off from COVID. So, if you did, and you\u2019re trying to rehire right now, you\u2019re having a tough time. And we -- as you may recall, we guaranteed 40 hours last year when we first hit and said, you\u2019re not going to lose your job because of COVID. So, that did help us. Not sure that we expected this unemployment benefit to continue as it has, but it did help us. I think, the other aspect of this is that we recognize that labor inflation is going to be around. It\u2019s been 5%ish for our nonexempt for a couple of years now. But we didn\u2019t anticipate this new competitor being the government. We think that\u2019s temporary. Right now, I think it\u2019s scheduled to -- these unemployment benefits are schedules go at the end of July. They may get extended with the new package through September. But, we\u2019ll use pricing from a kind of a macroeconomic standpoint to make sure that we manage volume. We don\u2019t need to take all new volume coming. We\u2019ll take the best of the new volume, and we\u2019ll manage accordingly, John and his team will through the labor line by using price to maybe tamp down some of that volume if we need to. Jerry Revich : Okay, terrific. I appreciate the color. And then, as we think about where volumes are tracking for the first quarter, they\u2019re about 3% below 2019 level. So, if that same trajectory holds in the second quarter, we should be looking at something like high-single-digit volume growth. Is that consistent with what you\u2019re seeing through April? Can you just comment on whether that two-year stack holds and if that\u2019s what we should be thinking about the cadence in the second quarter? Jim Fish : Yes. Jerry, I think you make great. We\u2019ve looked at 2019, we\u2019ve looked at 2020, and really, what we\u2019ve done is looked at Q4 of 2020 to look at some of the sequential trends on volume. And that\u2019s really where I think we see what we hear a level of confidence is. January, February were certainly challenging months, partly due to weather, partly due to just the comp year-over-year. Really happy with what we saw in March on the volume front and equally pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in April. So, while we\u2019ve looked at 2020, 2019, we\u2019ve really focused on what the sequential improvement has been, and that\u2019s part of why you heard the message from us about how we feel about the balance of the year. Jerry Revich : Terrific. And lastly, on the ESG side, obviously, some clarity for wind pricing now. Can you talk about to what extent you have the capability based on permitting to transition additional landfills to landfill gas producing landfills that tie to the grid to take advantage of where wind prices are and what the cadence of the additions could look like over the next couple of years? Jim Fish : Yes. So, we have -- as I mentioned, we have four plants. Now, we have a fifth that would be coming on line in 2022. That capital is being spent right now. That\u2019s in the plan. So, that Devina mentioned. This is -- we believe it\u2019s a nice opportunity for us, and it\u2019s made possible because of the fact that our fleets now -- we are -- almost at 70% of our routed fleet is CNG. And considering that that includes the ADS trucks, which are at a much lower percentage, we think there\u2019s a couple of benefits there. One is, just the simple shift from diesel to natural gas is definitely a good shift for us. And then, as you mentioned, the fact that we\u2019re able to close that loop between those natural gas trucks and the gas produced at our landfills, we like the investment. We started making this investment two or three years ago. They have -- at current pricing, they have really good returns. And I think you\u2019ll see us continue to do that as we\u2019re doing this year, and I expect we\u2019ll continue to do it next year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Goldstein from Morgan Stanley. Jeff Goldstein : On the new internal revenue growth guidance of 4.5% or greater, can you just help parse out what the breakdown of this figure is between yield and volume? How that compares at all to your prior thinking around the recovery in terms of that mix? Devina Rankin : Yes. So, what we\u2019re looking at is what you saw in the first really strong performance on the yield side, translating into strength for the remainder of the year, and that really being the catalyst for the upside on the total of 4.5% or greater That being said, our initial outlook for volume was around 1.5% to 2%, and we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll also be at the high end of that range. But outperformance to previous expectations at this point really is centered around strength in pricing and the outlook for continued strength over the rest of the year. Jeff Goldstein : Okay, perfect. And just on the EBITDA margin guide for the year, if my math is right, the implied margin for the year is coming up a similar amount as the increase in the expected synergies from ADS. So, is that fair? And should we assume that based on that your other investment assumptions for the year are largely intact, or just any other cadence of expenses we should be contemplating for the year? Jim Fish : Yes. When we look at 2021 on a year-over-year basis, we knew we had some cost headwinds. And in particular, the second quarter had some cost headwinds for health and welfare specifically. We also expected incentive compensation to be a headwind for the full year, though that\u2019s even greater headwind now because of our strong outlook for 2021 than we would have initially expected. Our overall margin guidance for 2021 initially was as much as a 50 basis-point improvement. You can see with the strong performance in the first quarter. We expect there could be some upside to that, though rather than update margins specifically at this point, we\u2019d really like to see the seasonal results on volume because the contribution margin from that incremental volume is one of the important things for us to keep our eye on. That being said, I think it\u2019s really important to step back and recognize that we started with guidance that could have been slightly backward at 20 basis points on a year-over-year comparison, both because of those comp headwinds and the integration of ADS. But then, when we look at where we stand today, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll actually be at the high end of our expectations of 50 basis points. And that\u2019s certainly somewhat because of the ADS synergy capture, but it\u2019s also because of some stronger outlook on pricing that I mentioned earlier. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Mario Cortellacci : Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Maybe you could talk about how much room you have on the disposal pricing side. I think, it\u2019s running in the high-2 range right now as volumes are recovering. Maybe you can speak about it just in context of what you guys were executing on and what the goal was prior to COVID-19 and how pricing on the disposal side had started ramping prior to the pandemic. Jim Fish : Yes. So, landfill pricing, as you know, is always a top priority for us. MSW core price was strong for the quarter as were the other lines of business. I think, an important distinction here is that several of these lines of business, specifically commercial, also as we\u2019ve talked many times about recycling, have become somewhat fee-based. And so, as volume increases, you see fees increase, and those fees go to the price line. So, it\u2019s honestly part of why -- there\u2019s a number of reasons why we took the unusual step to raise guidance in Q1. But, one of those is the strength that we\u2019re seeing in pricing. And of course, a second one is that when you think about volumes, and I mentioned it in my remarks, that volumes really have not recovered fully, especially in those three high-margin lines of business, commercial, landfill and industrial. John mentioned that we\u2019re starting to see really good green shoots in March and continuing into April on the volume front. And then, lastly, on reasons why we felt really comfortable with our guidance changes was that recycling is, as John mentioned in his script, we\u2019re producing these great results recycling at average commodity prices. I mean $79 for that basket of commodities is right in the middle of our historical averages, whereas the other four quarters, we talked about the top five -- being in the top five best quarters of all time in recycling, and yet the other four when we were up at $125, $127 on an average commodity price, we\u2019re now down at 79%, at least that\u2019s where we were for the quarter. So, all of those combined to give us real confidence going forward that we could raise guidance. But pricing and landfill pricing in particular we think are a strength for the quarter and will continue to be in the next couple of quarters. Mario Cortellacci : And then, on ASW synergies, just thinking about what the long-term revenue synergy potential is there. I mean, prior to the deal, they were busy doing deals in building out their route density and that more or less what was put on hold as the deal was going through. And then, again, we got hit by the pandemic. Does that create more pricing opportunity for that particular business on top of what, I guess, was already baked into what their plans were? And any thoughts on that would be great. Jim Fish : Yes. We -- look, I think ADS will go through a similar price model that WM legacy goes through. So, what we\u2019ve really been focused on in terms of synergies is the cost synergies Obviously, with respect to ADS, just as with WM legacy, we\u2019re looking at the cost side of the business to see what do we have to do with pricing to make sure that we keep up with inflation. Mario Cortellacci : Got it. And then, if I could sneak in just one more. You had mentioned weather, and I don\u2019t know if I missed it during the prepared remarks. Are you able to help quantify what the weather impact was on volumes in the quarter? Devina Rankin : It\u2019s really difficult to specifically point to volumes. But, what we looked at is basically a month-by-month view of our volume trends. And what we saw is a significant downward pressure in the month of February, some carryover of that into -- or recovery of that, I should say, in March, but we don\u2019t know how much was true recovery of volume lost in February versus just continued momentum as we see economic recovery from the pandemic. We certainly think that it\u2019s the latter. And we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to see growth based on what we are seeing in the month of April thus far. Jim Fish : I think it\u2019s fair to say though that it was not insignificant. I mean, when we have to shut down the entire state of Texas for a week and shut down our Gulf Coast operations which are very important operations for us from a special waste standpoint, for example. We shut down our -- a lot of our operations in areas like Tennessee, I mean that was shut down for almost an entire week. So, it was not an insignificant impact. It\u2019s part of why the volume story is a little clouded for the first quarter, and then why John gave some details on what January and February look like versus March and April. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Walter Spracklin, RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : So, I\u2019d like to start just on -- obviously, you had a great quarter with -- from a cash flow generation standpoint, an indication that that trend is continuing. Just curious how that impacts, how you look at M&A. Does that more dry powder make you more incented to look a little harder for M&A? Obviously, your experience here with AW is going very well, or is it the case that you\u2019re kind of concentrated on the integration, you\u2019re preoccupied with that and M&A outside of any tuck-ins is -- any larger scale M&A outside of any tuck-ins is probably not in the cards? Jim Fish : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s probably more of the latter. We are still very focused on ADS integration. But look, our -- what we\u2019re hearing internally is that there is quite a bit of interest probably driven as much as anything by the potential for tax law changes coming. And so, I think you\u2019re seeing the pipeline starts to build a little bit. We, at this point, are saying bottom end of the range, the historical range of $100 million to $200 million, and that\u2019s what we said when we gave guidance back in February, and we\u2019re sticking to that right now. It\u2019s possible though, it\u2019s always possible that something comes along and it\u2019s too good to pass up. And I think what you\u2019ll probably see is that you may see that valuations actually -- it\u2019s really just a math equation. You may see valuations come down a little bit because somebody is looking and saying, all right, my capital gain here is going to be pretty significant. And here\u2019s what the cost of that is at the higher capital gains rates. So, I\u2019m willing to come down a little bit in terms of my sales price. Don\u2019t know for a fact that that\u2019s what happens, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if that happens. But for us, right now, Walter, we\u2019re really focused on ADS integration, we\u2019re sticking with the bottom end of that range at $100 million. Walter Spracklin : That makes sense. Okay. And my second question here is on coming back to your contracts and how might the pandemic have given you an opportunity to get better yield without raising your core price. And here, I\u2019m referencing to structurally charging more or charging on a weight basis as opposed to a per household. But, is there anything that you\u2019re looking at now that is allowing you to make a greater return on your contracts with your customers, commercial, residential or otherwise, that goes beyond just simply higher price. Jim Fish : Well, there really are a couple of dynamics taking place with price. If you set aside recycling and just talk about commercial, industrial and resi -- if we talk about really commercial, I mentioned earlier that we\u2019re moving some of that to fee-based. And so, that is a component of price, and it\u2019s an important component of price, and we think that that has -- that\u2019s going to help -- and that has helped and will continue to help commercial and industrial. And then, on residential, John\u2019s talked about residential now for two or three years. And we really look at residential as being one of the real strong points for the quarter. The work that his team -- John and his team have done to get to the highest yield since 2008, a 4% yield has really been a success story for the Company. And that\u2019s coming as much as anything through -- maybe not as much with fee-based as it\u2019s coming through contract renegotiation. It might surprise you to know that that\u2019s not coming from some of the indexes going up. We actually saw a small amount of deterioration in that for the quarter. Now, we do expect that that -- we do expect that inflation will kick up a little bit, and so we\u2019ll get some help. And we\u2019re typically a beneficiary of higher inflation. But, we didn\u2019t benefit in Q1 from that. It was really all a -- almost all of it was just renegotiation of contracts. And factoring in to those contracts, the fact that we now expect weights to be a bit higher permanently because of the pandemic and because of somewhat of a permanent shift of some portion of the economy to a work from home environment. But, this was really all -- and then, by the way, there\u2019s also this ongoing move to a different index that\u2019s more reflective of our cost structure, which is a water, sewer, trash index away from a CPI index. And we\u2019re up to about 40% of our overall business is index driven and about 40% of that is now on a water, sewer, trash, which then equates to about 15% or 16% in total. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey Jim. So, back at our conference, you talked about some pretty stark differences in the small container volumes in reopened versus not reopened markets. And I realize you may not have all the data right there at your fingertips. But, can you just give us some flavor of how, say, like a Texas or Florida small container track versus, call it, Ontario, Canada. Just maybe something like that. I\u2019m just curious to get a little more color there. Jim Fish : Right. So, Tyler, you\u2019re right. We talked about some of those states that were early in reopening like Texas, Florida, Arizona, Tennessee and how they were showing real nice signs of recovery, but have other states maybe not as much. The good news is that we\u2019re starting to see some of those states that were in the latter group reopening. California is a good example. We\u2019re seeing some reopening in California. We\u2019re seeing some reopening in New England. We\u2019re seeing some reopening in the Upper Midwest and Illinois. I would say that right now, Tyler, the area that is still showing the greatest softness that has not come to the party yet, is Canada, and it\u2019s mostly Eastern Canada. That -- I looked at the numbers this morning, in fact, and still showing weakness in Canada, and it really has to do with the fact that they\u2019ve remained shut down. We\u2019re still showing a little bit of softness also in New York and Michigan. But, the number of areas that are in that latter group, the software group is shrinking, and that\u2019s good news. And so, I think I would add a couple then to the list that I gave you at your conference to just the Texas and Florida. We\u2019ve got a few new entrants there that are helping. Tyler Brown : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. But those, Texas and Florida, are they tracking up in small container? Jim Fish : Yes. So, I looked at Florida\u2019s number yesterday, and Florida looks great. I would tell you the only challenge there is on the labor side. It\u2019s that competing against somebody sitting on the couch. And so, while we didn\u2019t have layoffs as a result of COVID, as the business grows, we have a need to add drivers, add technicians. We have a number of open recs there. And I\u2019m not going to tell you it\u2019s been easy to fill those. But, we do think that\u2019s temporary. We don\u2019t think those -- that we\u2019re competing against the government forever. We think it\u2019s probably third quarter when the government starts to realize that that ultimately needs to go away, that there\u2019s enough jobs out there to fill without providing the added unemployment benefit. But yes, Florida is doing real well right now. But a lot of that hospitality is coming back in Florida. And I would say, the same in Arizona, the same really in Texas, too. Tyler Brown : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Devina So, if I took the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance, I think the raise was about $100 million. So, I\u2019m curious how -- so I\u2019m curious how that breaks down. So, it sounds like there\u2019s maybe 20 of additional ADS synergies, but then it sounds like there\u2019s a little bit of actually a drag on incentive comp. But basically, of the remaining, how much of that is simply commodities, and how much of that is improving IRG? Devina Rankin : Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Tyler. I think way that we\u2019re thinking about it, and you highlighted ADS, we\u2019re thinking about ADS as being an important component to the overall collection and disposal business. And the collection and disposal business with ADS synergy capture is over half of the expected $100 million lift in EBITDA, with a lot of that coming from expectations for stronger pricing, expectations for strong cost discipline and then there\u2019s a big offset for the incentive compensation that we discussed. So, when you have about half of that related to strong solid waste, it\u2019s a really strong indication of the strength of those two indicators. Then, on the commodity side, we\u2019ve got a combination of the recycling line of business and RINs. And on the recycling commodity piece, we have about $35 million there and about $20 million from RIN value. Tyler Brown : Okay. So, collection and disposal up, it gets completely offset by incentive comp, and then commodities is kind of the other piece, if I\u2019m... Devina Rankin : Yes. Not completely offset by incentive comp. It just takes away from the headline number for solid waste. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then, just I know there\u2019s been a lot of change with the fee for service change in resi. So, what is a $10 sensitivity to a $10 move in the commodity basket, either in terms of EPS or EBITDA these days? John Morris : Yes. Tyler, on the recycling, I\u2019m assuming -- I presume that\u2019s what you meant. So yes, I mean you saw some of that in my prepared comments about an average rate in Q1 of 79 versus historical high averages in the mid to high-120s. And as I also mentioned, we\u2019ve doubled the EBITDA quarter-over-quarter for the year. So, we\u2019re very happy there. To answer your question specifically, I would say it\u2019s about 23% to 25% of that move or $23 million on $10, if you want to look at it that way. What I would caution you by saying that, and I\u2019ve made this comment on a number of these calls, again, that math is correct. It doesn\u2019t slide up and down the same way as it used to because again, we\u2019ve put floors in place from an inbound customer standpoint. We\u2019ve got better and secured outlets on the outbound side. I mean, we\u2019re seeing strong domestic and export markets right now, which is really helping us, on the outbound pricing side, and we\u2019ve got more security around some of those rates. So, the math I gave you is right at a point in time if commodity price went way far south, which we don\u2019t expect, we expect them to stay hanging there for the next handful of years. That math would change. But about $23 million for that $10 move is where we\u2019re at for Q1. Jim Fish : And cents per share then, Tyler, it\u2019s about -- and within this band that John just described, this price band, it is about $0.04 for a $10 move. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Hey, Jim. Thank you for everybody, Jim, Devina, John, Ed, for taking questions. So, can I tease out Devina a little bit more off of Tyler\u2019s questions? If we\u2019ve got greater than 50% is benefited by the collection and disposal. So, that\u2019s $55 million. And then, there\u2019s $55 million from recycling and RINs. Is the compensation number then just $10 million? I mean I just -- I want to get this right. Devina Rankin : The compensation impact right now, our estimate and this can change based on our performance, the compensation estimate is a total of about $25 million. And so, when you look at the solid waste piece, my comment was it\u2019s more than 50%. So, we take the $55 million from commodity, the $25 million offset from incentive compensation that gets you to $30 million. So, you\u2019ve got about $70 million at solid waste. And it\u2019s a combination of synergy capture from the ADS business and the strong performance from legacy WM. Michael Hoffman : All right. And that was the important part of it. So, on the WM piece, that\u2019s about asset utilization, incremental price because you lowered your churn, improved your core. That\u2019s the -- it\u2019s a little bit of all those things sum up together, right? So, for that incremental\u2026 Devina Rankin : That\u2019s exactly right. Michael Hoffman : Right. Okay. And then, John, yes, there was a question earlier about labor. I mean, one of the things to caution everybody is, you may make a decision to walk over time up not to add capital, drive more trucks at a higher rate and then add a truck at a high level of utilization instead of adding a truck at a lower level of utilization. We have to be careful when we look at the balancing out of some of those numbers. Is that -- over time, is that correct? John Morris : Yes. That\u2019s fair, Michael. I think, what we\u2019ve also learned through this is that as the volume really kind of the tide went out on volume, I think the team did really a good job from an asset utilization standpoint. And what we\u2019ve learned is, is that we can see some efficiency gains to be made by shortening of the work week, if you will, from 5 or 6 days to 4 or 5 days. And we worked pretty hard through the pandemic to make sure we flex down. And I think that\u2019s what you see in our efficiency numbers, our asset utilization numbers, our labor numbers. And then, as we flex back up to your point, I mean, there\u2019s going to reach a point where we theoretically have to add another truck. But, to my earlier comments because we created that capacity, we feel we\u2019ve got some leverage certainly throughout this year to be able to take on those additional volumes without real big incremental costs. Michael Hoffman : Right. And it\u2019s things like let\u2019s not work half a day on Saturday, which is overtime. You can get the work all done in five days kind of thing. That\u2019s the stuff you\u2019ve kept? John Morris : Yes. Okay. So, at the end of last year or in fourth quarter, you gave us a number of -- the total number of customers that weren\u2019t open yet at the end of the calendar year. Where does that number stand today? Devina Rankin : Is this the recovery of commercial collection that we talked about being at about 70% of the COVID losses? Is that what you\u2019re referring to, Michael? Michael Hoffman : Yes. So I -- and the distinction being a customer because if they could restart but have less volume. So, I want to be careful of there\u2019s a ton issue, but there\u2019s also a customer, once they\u2019re back on, that\u2019s revenue came back on, whether the can was fuller, partially full. I don\u2019t care. The revenue came back on. So, I\u2019m trying to -- so when you say the 72%, is it 72% of the not open physically or the tonnage? Jim Fish : It\u2019s -- Michael, we\u2019ve referenced that 72% number. That\u2019s of yards lost and then yards recovered. So, it\u2019s units. Michael Hoffman : Right. Okay. But you still have a lot of customers that\u2026 Jim Fish : Mike, we do think that there\u2019s a percentage of businesses that -- and we don\u2019t know what that is at this point, but there\u2019s a percentage of businesses that are going to be much longer in reopening. And so, because this was such a unique event that we had never seen before, we don\u2019t know exactly how that -- how that reopening occurs. But, we do know that there are some businesses -- and likely -- and to Tyler\u2019s question, likely in those states that were -- that took longer to reopen. I mean, Texas reopened at least partially on the 17th of May last year and then fully reopened later in the year in the third quarter. But, some of the states, they closed until 2021. And if you were a small business in Texas or in Florida or in Arizona, you probably were able to weather the storm. If you were a small business in Michigan or in Toronto, you may have -- you may still be having a tough time weathering the storm. So, we don\u2019t know exactly what that -- how many of those customers actually just simply don\u2019t come back. There will be some amount there for sure. But we are, by the way, looking a bit at -- I know a lot of industries are comparing to 2019. And because comparisons are going to start to get really quirky, they already are. I mean, comparing to 2020 for any metric is difficult. I\u2019ll give you one number that\u2019s very encouraging for us, and that\u2019s the EBITDA number. It\u2019s part of why we were so excited about the quarter and about actually raising guidance. When you look at 2019 EBITDA for WM legacy and you add it to kind of ADS legacy, you get something in the neighborhood of kind of 4.8 -- about $4.85 billion. And then, you look at what we just adjusted to, and it\u2019s $100 million above that. Keep in mind, that\u2019s not really fair to do that because we divested a bunch of ADS legacies. But, even if you don\u2019t count that, if you just say WM legacy \u201819 and ADS legacy \u201819, you\u2019re talking $4.85 billion, and we\u2019re $100 million above that, and we have not gotten a lot of the volume back, and we still have a lot of room to go in terms of ADS. So, that\u2019s one of the many reasons why we were very encouraged with the quarter and very able to take that unusual step to raise guidance. Michael Hoffman : All right. And that helps a lot. And to follow your thought all the way through, you sold $100 million of EBITDA approximately. So, you\u2019re really up net $200 million on the combination of the two companies and you still have room to go? Jim Fish : Yes. We did have to sell some. That\u2019s for sure. Michael Hoffman : Yes. Okay. John, you mentioned service intervals improved. So, just to be clear, are you seeing -- this is a COVID customer restarting and then the interval improved or existing business on the interval improved or a combination of all that? John Morris : I think it\u2019s a combination, Mike, a couple of numbers. I mean service increases outpacing decreases. That\u2019s been the case for a while, but it\u2019s -- the gap is actually widening. So, you can argue about what that points do. But overall, we\u2019ve seen a good trend there. And the churn number, we always talked about what was structural out at churn number. We were at 8.2% for the quarter, down from 9% and change. So, we view that obviously as a good indicator. And then, to my points earlier, Michael, about buying in particular on commercial, it\u2019s hard to look at the January -- excuse me, the Q1 this year versus last year. But sequentially, when you look at Q4, and then I pan across January, February, certainly not strong months, partly weather, partly all the other stuff we\u2019ve mentioned. But then I look at March and what the trends are into April and small containers, and we\u2019re certainly encouraged there as well. Michael Hoffman : All right. And then, last one for me, and this is a little bit of a on-site quarter. I think, the garbage industry has one of the greatest opportunities to influence scope 3 emissions, which are downstream from you. It\u2019s your vendors, your suppliers. So, on Tara\u2019s remit, what is the opportunity there? Because I think your business model forces those suppliers and vendors to have to sort of change the way they do things to meet your needs. Jim Fish : Let me give you an example of where you\u2019re right on that. And it\u2019s golf tournament. We have made the golf tournament zero waste now for 9 -- I think 9 consecutive years, maybe 10 consecutive years. And so, we take a very -- we play a very influential role there with the vendors or with the fans coming in. And while it\u2019s not going to be identical to that, we certainly, to your point, can play an influential role in sustainability. And that\u2019s why we look at it as such a differentiator for us. It\u2019s why we felt that strongly about putting a senior level person in charge of it. But I think you\u2019re absolutely right about that, Michael. Michael Hoffman : All right. Well, nice job Thanks for doing something very unusual. 33 years and I can\u2019t remember the last time somebody raised guidance on the first quarter. Jim Fish : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Sean Eastman, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : Hi, guys. Strong start to the year. Congrats. Devina, you mentioned in the Q&A sort of not explicitly updating the margin guidance, you\u2019re sort of still keeping your eye on that contribution margin into the second quarter volume recovery. I mean, what are the big puts and takes that you\u2019re really keeping your eye on there? And is it fair to say that you are feeling better about that dynamic now with the first quarter closed out strongly? Devina Rankin : Yes. It\u2019s a great question. And I think we talked a great deal today about the biggest driver, and that\u2019s the labor cost part of the equation. We certainly think that the efforts that have been put forth by the team to manage overtime hours and get those impacts not just on the service side, but extended through on the repair and maintenance side have been a tremendous value. We want that to continue to be a lever that produces the strong operating margin for the business, and we\u2019re optimistic about that. But, we also know that there are flex points or breakpoints in the equation that happened when you add an additional route. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re watching as we move forward from here with the growing volume environment. Aside from labor, I think what\u2019s really important is that we can\u2019t forget that in our transfer and disposal cost and subcontractor costs, there\u2019s a lot of third-party labor costs built into those numbers as well. And so, the theme that Jim has pointed us to a number of times today about the labor pressure that exists across the board, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve seen in those costs and something we expect to continue into 2021. So, 45% contribution margin is what we\u2019ve talked about. We\u2019re encouraged that we think that that holds, but we think that there could be upside from it. But, the labor piece of the equation is really going to be the piece we have to watch. Sean Eastman : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, I guess, a more broad question. The cash flow generation performance measure in the stock incentive plan seems to imply that you guys are going to have over $4 billion of deployable free cash flow in a sense over the next three years. I mean, I think we have a good sense of capital deployment priorities for 2021 as you integrate ADSW but there\u2019s a lot of dollars there. And I thought I would check in to see if we could get a bit of a flavor on what\u2019s looking the most interesting, as you look out over that three-year horizon with all that capital. Devina Rankin : Yes. So, the first priority is investing in the long-term growth of the business, and that\u2019s something that we talk a great deal about. Organic growth through focuses in recycling and renewable energy have been places that we\u2019ve said. You could see some outpaced capital spending from us. So, the current guide for 2021 incorporates our expectations for the full year in those programs. We just have yet to determine how much we could accelerate spend in 2022 and 2023 to cover incremental investment that could be worthwhile in those spaces. I think, the rest of the allocation really comes down to shareholder returns, continuing to grow the dividend over the long term in that 45% to 50% range on a payout ratio basis, and we measure that on free cash flow. So, there\u2019s direct conversion from that free cash flow measure and the long-term incentive plan to award the dividend, which I think is a really strong indicator of how we think about the growth that can happen as we revisit that in the fourth quarter. Beyond that, the statement that we made about at least $1 billion of share buyback in 2021 is an indication that when we don\u2019t see M&A being the place that we will spend that available dollar free cash flow, there is tremendous flexibility to allocate incremental dollars to the shareholders through share buyback. M&A, Jim touched on that. We\u2019ll continue to be sure that we\u2019re mindful of the opportunities that exist there. And if we see opportunities to provide outpaced returns relative to our other opportunities, we\u2019ll be well-positioned to do that with a strong balance sheet that I mentioned. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Kevin Chiang : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. And congrats on a strong start to the year. I\u2019m just wondering, as the economy opens, I think, during the pandemic, just given all the government support for small businesses, I think that did cloud some of the analysis in terms of what bad debt could look like as companies came out of this. And I guess, parts of your business have come almost full circle, I guess, and some of this government support is being removed. Is anything playing out that was unexpected in terms of how you accrued for some of these bad debts, or are things coming better or worse or maybe as expected? Devina Rankin : I would say that things are recovering as expected. From a cash flow perspective, the really strong result that we had in the current year has to do with the headwind that we experienced in the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, we were between $60 million and $80 million behind on cash flow because we saw our customers slow down their payments. We\u2019ve seen really strong resilience from our customers, and I think our proactive steps to protect our customers, particularly small business through the pandemic has paid dividends in that regard. And so, I will say, we had really good results from a days sales outstanding and bad debt perspective in the first quarter, a little ahead of expectations, but all-in-all, I would say, more close to tracking than leading. Kevin Chiang : Okay. That\u2019s great news there. And then, maybe just on the opportunities around the landfill gas capture. I know you spoke to this in your prepared remarks. But, it does feel like there\u2019s more private capital flowing to this opportunity, like, I\u2019ve seen, for example, a number of investment announcements around companies looking to partner with landfills on things like sustainable aviation fuel. Are you seeing the cost of capital come down on these kinds of projects, or maybe conversely, is the ROIC improving? Just as a lot of other end markets look to reduce their own carbon intensity and look to landfill gas captures, maybe helping them achieve their own goals? John Morris : Yes. Kevin, on the third-party front, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of dollars out there that are looking for a place to park in this space. But, I think what\u2019s important is that the ones -- the four or five plants we have either in operation or that we\u2019ve invested in, are showing some really strong results, and we\u2019re going to continue to look at those opportunities. I think, Devina said, how we finance is a different question. We have the balance sheet to be able to do that. We\u2019ve got a fleet of 130 or so plants, so handful of those are the RNG plants. As Jim mentioned, we\u2019re closing the loop and fueling over half our fleet with renewable natural gas, which we think long term, that is a great solution for us. And we\u2019ve clearly got some runway to go before we even consume all of our capabilities to fuel our own fleet. We\u2019re happy with the space and the investments we have for sure. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : John, just looking at the $50 million of upsized ADS synergies targeted here, can you give us maybe the two or three big factors that are really driving that? Where are you getting greater savings than previously targeted? And then, I think this will help investors understand, what substantively you\u2019re actually doing here to improve the returns? John Morris : Well, certainly, you\u2019ve heard us talk in the last few quarters, the integration has kicked off and has gone well. A lot of the elements of the integration risks seem to be going better than expected. We talked about data migration being kind of long pole, last long pole in the tent. That\u2019s coming along nicely as we\u2019re that information over to our system. That\u2019s important now because in order to get the routing synergies around consolidations, we need to have all the information in one database. But specifically to your question, I mean, a public, public deal, we didn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t get the same look under the hoods maybe with a private deal. And once we dig it under the hood, what we found is, is that the areas that are impacted are finding out that they can operate the business more efficiently than we even thought going into it. Secondly, I think on internalization and transportation synergies is another bucket where again, once we got a look at some of that detail, we were able to drive out additional synergies. And then, lastly, really on the supply chain side, even though we\u2019re facing a couple of headwinds on some commodity-related pieces, our supply chain group, once they got to look at the whole portfolio of spend there has also been able to drive some additional benefit. So, it\u2019s really efficiency in the business in the field is the internalization, the transportation and disposal internalization. And then, lastly, it\u2019s really some of the corporate synergies around supply chain. Those are the three big buckets. Noah Kaye : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful, John. And then, I guess, a question for Jim and the team broadly. I\u2019m just curious to know how you\u2019re engaging so far with the new administration on some of the priorities they focused on in terms of climate pledges, they\u2019re clearly taking a whole of government approach that includes EPA. Also, it\u2019s clear that waste reduction is for some parts of the government focus as well. So, just can you talk about some of the engagement that you\u2019ve had so far in some of the focus areas for you as we kind of get in kind of almost what, one quarter, all the way through the year of this first administration. Jim Fish : Well, so you mentioned EPA, and that\u2019s where our engagement has been largely. We were -- we\u2019ve been engaged with them for not just the quarter that the new administration has been in office, but for quite some time before that. But, because of that engagement with them, we do know that there are changes coming through the EPA down the pipe, and we\u2019re prepared for those. And I think the -- we\u2019ve mentioned this before, but in a sort of way, we believe we end up being a beneficiary of some of these changes coming from EPA because we\u2019ve always held ourselves to a much higher standard environmentally. So, to the extent that the bar gets raised by the new administration, it actually ends up being a benefit to us. The other areas, Devina has talked about the potential for tax changes and things like that. And so, we\u2019re keeping up on that. I personally have not had any engagement with the new administration, nor did I have engagement with the last administration. I guess, they don\u2019t value our opinion that much. But, that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re happy to fly under the radar. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late. I\u2019ll just ask one, actually a follow-up from the last one. The President has proposed a pretty aggressive infrastructure program. I know there\u2019s some people thinking that may not all the spending be infrastructure-related. But, I\u2019m just curious from what you\u2019ve seen so far, do you think there\u2019ll be any benefits to your Company from if any things come to fruition? Jim Fish : Look, I think, an infrastructure bill is going to be a positive for us, any way you slice it. But there is a question about what the details of that bill are. I don\u2019t think anybody knows at this point. And there still is a lot of Nash compete [ph] that\u2019s going to need to take place within -- in Congress to figure out those details. So, there could be an infrastructure build that ends up being even better for us, depending on the details of it. But any infrastructure bill is, I think, good for the economy and ultimately good for us. Jeff Silber : Can you give some examples of what those details might be that could benefit you? Jim Fish : Well, so, an infrastructure bill, for example, that focuses on road construction or bridges or big projects like that. That is -- that will -- we would certainly be a beneficiary of that. An infrastructure build that focuses on a reduction in natural disasters, that\u2019s a much, much longer term benefit. So, I don\u2019t know that that -- I don\u2019t know that the infrastructure spending that then in turn turns into fewer hurricanes is going to benefit us -- that\u2019s going to be harder to see. I\u2019ll put it that way. But certainly, infrastructure bill, as we think about airports, as we think about roads and bridges, all of that, we end up being a beneficiary, both on the collection side of our business and the disposal side. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of David Manthey with Baird. David Manthey : One last cut here at the guidance walk, if I could. So, you\u2019re saying the EBITDA guidance is up by about $100 million, and I believe you\u2019re saying the compensation expense will offset pretty much the ADS synergies. So, if we just set those things on the side. If your revenue midpoint is up by 266, EBITDA is up by 100, that looks like a high-30s kind of contribution margin. And what I\u2019m asking here is, it seems like if you\u2019re saying most of the revenue upside is coming from yield and commodities and growth in higher-margin segments. Are you introducing a factor of conservatism here, or is there another element we\u2019re missing? Devina Rankin : What I mentioned earlier about the cost headwinds that we know are coming, they were particularly strong in the second quarter 2021 outlook. And so, our expectations currently are certainly that we could outperform on the margin side relative to where we stand today. But, to build it in before we\u2019ve seen the volume acceleration we thought would be not necessarily prudent based on where we stand. And we knew that $100 million lift in EBITDA from just two months ago was a really strong indication of the strength of the overall business. So, is there upside, potentially that it would have to come from how we see the cost side of the equation flow through as we see volume returns. Jim Fish : But, I think, we\u2019re always -- you\u2019re always going to see this Company, this management team and really even the industry be somewhat conservative. We\u2019re a fairly conservative Company and industry. So, to your question about conservatism, I mean, I would say you\u2019re always going to see us be fairly conservative, which is why, to Devina\u2019s point, it was such a unique event for us to raise guidance after just one quarter. I mean, every time that I can remember, and I\u2019m just about to hit my 20th year with the Company, we\u2019ve had a first quarter, even a really good first quarter where we\u2019ve just reaffirmed guidance. I think, we did have one quarter where we lowered guidance after one quarter. But, this is pretty unique for us to raise guidance. But with that said, we\u2019re always thoughtful about it. And there is a level of conservatism in everything we do. Operator : And our last question today is going to come from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Feniger : Okay, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in today. And I\u2019ll just keep it very short. I mean, obviously, the industry has been more disciplined. You guys are talking about the focus on the price. We saw the improvement in churn. I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m wondering, Jim, as you see things open up and volumes do come up, it seems like maybe just reopening is getting pushed out a little bit based on the commentary in sort of April and May, maybe it\u2019s getting pushed out. But, when you do see the opening, are you going to see some small players that have kind of been struggling? Are they going to try to grab that volume? Do you have to walk away from some areas where you think it might get a little too competitive on that volume focus on the higher-margin areas? I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re seeing that kind of play out when this reopening really does pick up more steam. Thank you. Jim Fish : Yes. Michael, maybe a little bit. I mean, honestly, if you look at -- I talked about the improvement we made in the residential line of business. And we have walked away from some contracts there. And so, I think you\u2019ll see some of that. I think, you will always see us look at volume with -- look at it pretty carefully because not all volume is created equal. And so, as we think about this reopening, as I said earlier, there may be some volume that we just simply elect not to take. And that might help us not only in terms of margin and in terms of operating performance, but it might also help our operations teams as they look at having to hire to accommodate that volume. Michael Feniger : Yes. Are you seeing that, Jim, in some of the places that have reopened, maybe some of those mom-and-pops that have been struggling much more than you guys? Are they starting to get a little competitive there as we\u2019re going to see some of these regions and states open back up? Jim Fish : Look, I don\u2019t -- it\u2019s a competitive industry. So, there are always going to be -- there\u2019s no shortage of competition in our space. And I honestly -- just anecdotally, I didn\u2019t see a whole lot of small businesses go away in our -- at least in our industry. So, I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re going to see a whole lot come back, because those that were there pre-pandemic are still there. And it\u2019s a competitive space no matter who is competing. So, I think we do a nice job of -- the beauty for us is I think we\u2019re doing a really nice job of differentiating ourselves. So, it\u2019s not just based on price. It\u2019s based on a service offering. It\u2019s based on this customer service digitalization that we\u2019ve talked about. And that ultimately is what we look to differentiate ourselves and give us the ability to raise price, so that we\u2019re not just staring at a commodity competition. Michael Feniger : And Devina, just so we\u2019re clear, because I might have missed this. Like obviously, April and May are the comps with the year-over-year with what happened last year. Like, how are we thinking about this volume, the 2% volume number with the second half and Q2? Have you guys -- I might have missed this. Have you framed any ranges of how to think about that easy comp in the second quarter and then really the second half, how that plays out? Devina Rankin : Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Michael. Those estimates are really difficult to predict. But, I would tell you, our math at this point tells us that it\u2019s around 6% volume in Q2 and then closer to the 1.5% to 2% in the back half of the year. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude the Q&A session of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Holly. Just a quick ending comment, I just want to reiterate how much we appreciate. We now have 50,000 -- almost 51,000 folks here that have made a huge contribution to the success of this quarter and continue to do so day in and day out. So, thanks to all of you for your contribution. And thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s Waste Management Conference Call.

Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed and thank you all for joining us. Last quarter, we were feeling very good about the prospects for the year when we announced our Q1 results and raised our full year guidance. Now more than halfway through the year, all parts of our business have performed well above those revised expectations. In the second quarter, we achieved operating EBITDA of $1.31 billion, which we converted into strong cash from operations of more than $1 billion. First and foremost, this superb performance is a result of our outstanding core business model. In addition, this performance was driven by our continued focus on providing our customers with exceptional service, offering our employees a great place to work and driving sustainability through our business model. Our very strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we are making to our business model, led us to increase our full year guidance once again. The size of our revisions in each of these first two quarters clearly demonstrates the earnings producing potential of our strategy. In the back half of the year, we expect continued strong volume, pricing that offsets inflationary pressures and record results from our commodity-based businesses. With all of this powerful momentum, we now expect to generate 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA of at least $5 billion with free cash flow of at least $2.5 billion, all while continuing to make growth investments in our sustainable solutions and technology platforms. At the core of these strong results is our recycling business, which is central to our sustainability and business strategy. Our efforts to improve the recycling business, combined with robust demand for recycled commodities, led to second quarter delivering the recycling business\u2019 best ever financial performance by a considerable margin. We have made substantial progress in de-risking our recycling business by shifting to a fee-for-service contract structure, which has lifted the floor for recycled returns and created an economically sustainable business model. We have also made significant technology investments to improve the cost structure and grow the business. At our automated facilities, labor costs were 35% lower in the second quarter compared to our other single-stream MRFs. These investments not only lower operating costs and improve plant efficiency, but also allow us to adjust our equipment to respond to evolving end-market demands. For example, we are now segregating out specific plastics that in the past were sold as a bundled lower-priced bale, reacting quickly as markets evolve for new recycled commodity types. The capability to efficiently sort these materials allows us to extract more value for these commodities as demand increases for recycled material. Overall, our investment in recycling technology \u2013 our investments in recycling technology are generating solid returns and we are accelerating our plans to roll out this new operating model across our MRF network. Sustainability has been a central part of our strategy for many years. So I want to take some time to highlight how we are advancing our sustainability journey. At the beginning of the month, Tara Hemmer transitioned into her new role as Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, bringing together our sustainable solutions and ESG efforts under one umbrella. We believe this strong focus is critical to continuing to integrate environmental sustainability and social responsibility into a strategic business framework. Our supply chain goals, which include increasing our spending, both with sustainable and diverse suppliers, are examples of how this focus is integrated in our day-to-day operations. Next month, we are hosting a supplier diversity initiative called Share the Green, which will give women-owned businesses the opportunity to become a supplier for one or more of the 45 companies participating in the event. This 3-day nationwide event will provide great opportunities for diverse businesses and help participating companies to secure excellent suppliers. And finally, we continue to make real progress on our digital transformation to differentiate our customers\u2019 experience. In the past, I have mentioned our automated setup process that streamlines customers\u2019 orders and reduces our cost to serve. Through our advanced technology, we are eliminating nearly all manual steps in setting up a customer count, allowing setup to occur almost instantaneously after an order is processed. This will save us several million dollars annually, improve setup accuracy and increase customer satisfaction. This more accurate setup of customers also helps us to auto-route these customers, which increases operational efficiency and will optimize routes without manual processing. We are now connecting our advanced technologies to automatically insert 90% of our new commercial customers into existing routes, reducing our cost to serve and improving our speed to service. Our customer and digital teams continue to enhance the capabilities of our digital tools to provide a unique and engaging experience for our customers, while at the same time, connecting this front-end experience to our operational systems to allow for improved efficiency and lower costs. We expect that these investments in technology will continue to benefit us for many years to come. In conclusion, strong performance across all of our businesses, collection and disposal, recycling and renewable energy generated outstanding results so far this year. Our focus on disciplined pricing and cost management helped to offset the inflationary cost pressures that we have seen. And we expect to continue this focus into the second half of the year to help us deliver on our newly revised outlook. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the excellent second quarter results we achieved across our business. We produced exceptional EBITDA growth of almost 24% in the collection and disposal business as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic\u2019s steepest impacts in the second quarter of 2020. Collection and disposal volume climbed to 9.6% in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations. And our focus on disciplined pricing programs produced a substantive second quarter collection and disposal yield of 3.7%. Turning more specifically to our volume results, robust recovery in our highest margin businesses, commercial, industrial and landfill drove our very strong performance. In the second quarter, commercial and MSW volume reached pre-pandemic levels and industrial volumes recovered to levels just shy of those before the pandemic. While we are very pleased with the pace of volume recovery thus far, there remains opportunity for further volume improvement in the second half of the year from key areas of our business, including industrial, special waste and certain geographies such as Canada. Additionally, pockets of our commercial business, such as education and offices have yet to fully recover. For the full year, we now expect organic volume in the collection and disposal business to grow 2.5% or more. Pivoting to price, our second quarter results further demonstrate the focus the entire team has on overcoming our cost headwinds as well as improvements following the intentional customer-focused steps we took in the second quarter of 2020. This focus is particularly evident in our residential core price of 5.4%, landfill core price of 4.7% and transfer core price of 3.4%. We continue to be committed to pricing programs that are aligned with our cost structure, which is even more important as we see pressure on labor, transportation, supplies and capital costs. Our new full year outlook for collection and disposal yield is 3.0% or greater. Our strong revenue growth was also supported by great results in our customer metrics. Churn was 8.8% in the quarter and service increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold. Additionally, we increased our net customer growth rate driven by optimization of our sales force and investments in technology. Looking at operating costs, second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 10 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are continuing to manage our cost as volumes recover even in the face of inflationary cost pressures. It\u2019s no surprise to anyone who follows economic indicators that most businesses are experiencing inflation in their costs throughout 2021 and our business is no exception, particularly with regard to labor. We expect to overcome these pressures by increasing operating efficiencies and executing on our disciplined pricing programs. There is no silver bullet when it comes to attracting and retaining talent and we are using a multifaceted approach that includes addressing wages, offering flexible schedules and broadening benefits. Our long-term focus is on keeping our people first so that we are the employer of choice. Overall, inflation trends are something we are watching very closely and managing very proactively with our area, supply chain and revenue management teams. We continue to make progress on the integration of the advanced disposal operations. To-date, we have combined around 45% of the ADS operations into our billing and operational systems, which has allowed us to capture synergies and provide additional services to those customers. We are on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we have achieved more than $30 million of annual run-rate synergies and we expect cost synergies of between $80 million and $85 million in 2021. This will bring the annual run-rate synergies to around $100 million at the end of 2021 and we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings. And finally, as Jim mentioned, our recycling team set new highs in the second quarter with record contributions to earnings and margins. We also achieved strong growth in our renewable energy business as we generated and sold more RINs and sold them at higher prices. We have made significant investments in these businesses in recent years and we are pleased with the strong returns they are generating. Before I turn the call over to Devina, I want to thank the entire WM team for the remarkable job they have done in managing our operations and providing safe and reliable service to our customers. Our people really are the foundation of our success. And with that, I will hand off to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John and good morning. Our team once again delivered strong performance in the second quarter. Robust volume growth since last year\u2019s peak pandemic impact, dynamic pricing efforts, record recycling results, disciplined integration of the ADS business, and our continued focus on cost management combined to deliver 28% operating EBITDA growth and 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. As Jim mentioned, these outstanding results and our confidence in the continued strength of our business model have led us to raise our 2021 financial guidance yet again. Full year revenue growth is now expected to be 15.5% to 16%, with organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 5.5% or greater. For adjusted operating EBITDA, we expect to generate between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, an increase of $225 million at the midpoint from the original guidance we provided in February. Our business is exceeding the strong outlook we established at the beginning of the year on a number of fronts. Volume has recovered, particularly in the commercial collection business at a faster rate than we expected. Market values for recycled commodities and RINs have increased. Our integration of the ADS business has generated more synergy value. And certain of our technology investments focused on reducing our cost to serve have delivered more savings than planned. While the bridge from our initial guidance to the current guidance has a number of puts and takes, the most significant drivers are at accelerated price and volume recoveries in the collection and disposal business of about $135 million; improved recycling profitability of another $135 million; renewable energy increases of about $55 million; and additional ADS synergies of around $25 million. These increases are partially offset by elevated cost inflation and incentive compensation costs that we currently estimate to be about $125 million. The increase in adjusted operating EBITDA guidance is expected to translate directly into incremental free cash flow and we now expect that we will generate between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion of free cash flow for the year. Turning to our second quarter results, SG&A was 9.6% of revenue in the second quarter, a 30 basis point improvement over 2020. This result demonstrates our success-making incremental technology investments that will benefit our customer engagement and cost to serve over the long-term. At the same time, we are realizing benefits from the integration of ADS and returns on certain of our new technology solutions. We also continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending to optimize our costs. Second quarter net cash provided by operating activities grew more than 20%. This increase was driven by our extremely strong operating EBITDA growth. There was an unfavorable working capital comparison in the second quarter, but we attribute that to timing differences in tax payments and cash received from CNG credits. We are encouraged to see continued progress on our DSO and DPO measures. In the second quarter, capital spending was $396 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 to just over $665 million. While capital spending in the first half of the year was expected to be less than prior year due to timing differences in truck delivery schedules, our 2021 pace of capital expenditures has been slower than we planned. The slower pace is due to supply chain and labor constraints impacting some of our vendors and we have made deliberate decisions to defer spending in some categories as we observe what we expect to be temporary dislocation in certain markets. To offset these delays, we are proactively pulling forward capital investments in areas we can and also where we know the returns will be strong. As Jim mentioned, we are in the process of accelerating recycling investments as we have strong proof points of technology and equipment upgrades, reducing the cost structure of the business and improving delivered quality of processed materials. We continue to target full year capital spending within our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range. In the first half of 2021, our business generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion, a conversion from operating EBITDA of 61%. This very strong result positions us well to achieve our new higher free cash flow outlook even as we target capital spending increases in the second half of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business, and strong and consistent shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we paid $242 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. Our leverage ratio of 2.84x has improved even more quickly than expected due to our strong operating EBITDA growth and it\u2019s tracking well toward our target leverage of 2.75x by the end of the year. At the same time, our robust cash generation in the first half of the year positions us to increase our full year share repurchase expectation up to our full $1.35 billion authorization. With this increase, we expect our weighted average share count for the full year to be approximately 422 million shares. Thanks to the hard work of every member of the WM team. We delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial results. The successes of the first half of 2021 position WM to deliver on our commitments to our people, our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. With that, Holly, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning all. Jim Fish : Good morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, Jim, obviously a great quarter. I know there has been a lot of talk about labor of late. You touched on it in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk about labor availability, how it\u2019s impacting the business? Is this more of a cost issue or is it actually precluding revenue opportunities and then are there any indications that it\u2019s easing or is it actually getting worse? Jim Fish : We are seeing it easing at this point, because we are hiring. And as Devina went through the numbers and John as well, we have had to hire at a higher rate. I think Devina mentioned $125 million as kind of a combination of incentive compensation and higher costs. And so those higher costs, in large part, are due to some of these inflationary pressures that we are seeing on the labor line. And so if I use June as an example, I think the number is \u2013 we hired 685 mostly drivers and technicians in the month of June. And it wasn\u2019t just churning people, because we had 125 who left. So, the net addition was pretty significant to replace some of these folks that have decided to sit on the sidelines, because of the government programs that are out there. I would tell you those government programs are affecting not just us they are affecting big and small businesses. And right now, at least in the United States, the federal benefits are scheduled to roll off on the 6th of September. It\u2019s not a stretch to say that there isn\u2019t a business out there that isn\u2019t looking forward to the 6th of September. To your first question about whether it is precluding growth or just creating some difficulties on it with existing customers, I think it\u2019s much more of the latter. I don\u2019t see it keeping us from growing and that\u2019s reflected mostly in our volume figures. Tyler Brown : Okay, okay. Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. And then Devina, do you specifically have what the average commodity value was for Q2 and then where is that commodity value today and basically, what is in the back half guide? Devina Rankin : Yes. So in the second quarter, it was just above $100 per ton on a mix basis. Our second half guide is a little over $117 a ton, bringing the full year outlook to an average of $104. July did see some really nice uptick from June levels. And for context purposes, June was at about $114 a ton. So, that gives you an indication that we are on the right track for our outlook for the remainder of the year. Tyler Brown : Okay. Jim Fish : Tyler, real quick one kind of indication as we think about recycled commodity prices is that we do believe we are on a longer term bullish trend here and there is a couple of reasons for that. One is we think there is a permanent shift that\u2019s taking place, particularly as you think about OCC, but also plastics. Just to give you one other data point here, when we think about OCC pricing and how much room it has to go, we are 17% above historical averages at the end of the second quarter, but we are still 40% below all-time highs. So, we think there still is room to go. And as we and other companies are kind of moving forward, this ESG movement is really gaining traction. We think that commodities like plastics will continue to increase in price. So, we are encouraged by the pricing trends and we don\u2019t think they are the same kind of ebbs and flows that were short-lived in the past. We think these are longer term. Tyler Brown : Okay, great. I know it will probably be a long call so I will turn it over. Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi, good morning everyone. Jim Fish : Good morning. Jerry Revich : Jim, Devina, can you talk about how much CapEx opportunities you have over the next couple of years to deploy towards recycling to landfill gas development? What\u2019s the opportunity set, because the payback periods look pretty attractive across those investment sets? And so I am just curious if you could quantify the pipeline for us and maybe provide the context on the opportunity set between the two? Thanks. Devina Rankin : Yes. So, over the last few years, we had invested about $100 million annually in the recycling line of business and we had plans to continue at that pace. But as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are looking to accelerate that pace. And in the back half of the year, we are targeting somewhere upwards of $65 million or more in incremental capital spend in the recycling line of business relative to what our plans were because that is one of the places we see some opportunity to pull things forward both from a return profile and not an area where we\u2019ve seen a significant impact from supply chain constraints. In the renewable energy business, I would say it\u2019s been a little more peaks and valleys with regard to our investment trend historically. But when we look forward, the pipeline for continued investment is very strong. We have one additional project that will complete in 2021, and we are already looking at somewhere around five or more for the years to come. We are still in the process of considering whether or not that\u2019s something that we do ourselves or that we look to do in partnership with others because this is a place where not only is there reason for us to consider preserving our capital for high-growth opportunities in the traditional collection and disposal business, but there is also tremendous interest in this type of investment in the space at sustainability and projects like this that are so unique in terms of opportunity can create incremental value. But your point about the returns on them is spot on, really good payback periods on both recycling and renewable energy. Jerry Revich : And in terms of just to shift gears, the collection yield was obviously impressive this quarter and it sounds like that surprised the upside as well. Can you just talk about what aspects relative to your plan, a surprise to the upside would be geographic or line of business? And do you view the 4%-plus yield in collection as sustainable into the back half of the year when the comps look a little tougher? Devina Rankin : Yes. So, I think what\u2019s important here is that when we look at our pricing performance in the first half of 2021, it really did impress us to the upside on just about every line of business. John talked a great deal about the residential line of business and our intentional efforts there to improve profitability. But most importantly, I think you saw really strong pricing in industrial and commercial collection and then also the steps that we are taking to continue to drive price in the landfill line of business. Our outlook for second half because of the year-over-year comp is that we will have yield in the range of 2.75% to 3% in the back half of the year, and that\u2019s just representative of a more normalized pricing range that we had in the second half of 2020 relative to the second quarter of last year when we took those proactive steps that were really focused on customer retention and taking care of our customers in a desperate time of need, so really strong outlook for the second half. I would tell you that I am optimistic that there could be strength over and above even what our outlook presents currently. Jerry Revich : Terrific. I appreciate the discussion. Thanks. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much. So, if we start with the capital spending, can you get the midpoint spent that\u2019s left, which is about $1.2 billion, given the supply disruptions even if you pull forward? Devina Rankin : Our current outlook says we can get there. I am less optimistic today than I was when we gave our guidance at the end of the first quarter, which is why we came off at the high end of the range that we had previously spoken to. I would tell you, there is no shortage of opportunity for us to invest in the business. And we are going after that opportunity in a very targeted way. And as I mentioned, the recycling line of business, in particular, is a place that we are accelerating. It\u2019s good for us to try and pull some of what we can forward so that we don\u2019t create too much of a headwind in 2022 for capital because there are things that we see pushing into that year that we would have expected to spend currently such as landfill airspace capacity where we have seen liner costs and availability be slower than what we would have expected. Michael Hoffman : And just to tease that out a little bit, most of you on the bigger companies locked in slots in pricing in \u201821. Are they going to honor the price if it gets\u2026? Devina Rankin : So I lost you there, Michael. Michael Hoffman : Sorry, there was just call waiting just beeped into me. The \u2013 you locked in your slots in 2021 for your trucks at a good price. You are not bearing some of that inflation yet. Are they going to honor those prices going into \u201822 if the supply issues delay deliveries? Devina Rankin : Absolutely, and it\u2019s a great point. So, on the truck side in particular, it\u2019s all about making sure that we are positioned well for deliveries on a ready schedule. John will give a little more color on that, but we do have strong commitments both for the remainder of 2021 and early into 2022. John Morris : Yes, Michael, I think where we are seeing some pressure is on the container side with steel prices. So, some \u2013 we are making some decisions on fixed versus buy there, but that would be normal. And to Devina\u2019s earlier point, we are seeing stress on the supply chain with some other commodity-based materials. We are pushing some, when I think about landfill liner and those kind of things, not going to affect the business, but whether we buy now or push off our decisions we are making with the supply chain team day in and day out. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then Devina, you are on \u2013 your guidance puts you at a 50% free cash flow conversion rate on the low end at $5 billion and $2.5 billion. Is that a new baseline, 50%? Is that the way to think about the business going into the next year and beyond? Devina Rankin : So, I think the baseline conversation is one we really want to more fully discuss as we get later into the year. But we are really excited about the baseline that we have established. We are making progress on the working capital front, and we have certainly also made progress in terms of the investments that we are making in capital expenditures paying strong returns. The place I would give a little bit of caution with respect to that being the right number is the recycling and renewable energy business is providing a lift from a flow-through perspective. And you are not having to make an incremental capital investment to get that dollar. We did have a low bonus payment in 2021 as a result of the poor performance in 2020, and that will have an opposite impact in the year ahead. And then there is also some uncertainty in what corporate taxes look like in 2022. But I will tell you that the returns that we are seeing on our technology investments, the reduced interest run rate that we have established, given the recent debt transaction, having ADS fully integrated in the year ahead and just the general strong performance of the collection and disposal business, all of those things do provide upside. And so we are optimistic that we can maintain that 50%, but there is a little bit of caution that\u2019s prudent. Michael Hoffman : Okay, fair enough. And last one for me, Jim. I appreciate the demand side of sustainability, lifting commodity values structurally and this is the hard part of modeling. There is also a supply issue going on and disruption. So at some level, even if the next low is a much higher low, this is a tough question because it\u2019s \u2013 what are we at risk at? And then I am comparing it to your last peak, which is 2017. And yet the business model is different because in 2017, it was commodity-based. Today, it\u2019s 60% fee-based. So, how do we, as modelers, think about managing risk around that recycling revenue line? Jim Fish : I think we have done a good job over the last couple of years since the last peak of really de-risking the recycling business overall, so that when we do have these kind of high highs or low lows, we tend to smooth those out. And then really, it\u2019s more smoothing out the low lows than smoothing out the high highs. We would like to take advantage of these very high prices when they get there, but not taking on the chin when we have the very low prices and so some of that de-risking is moving to a fee-based model. Some of it has \u2013 and that has really proven to be successful for us. Some of it is the new technology that John and I mentioned, putting that into our network so that we operate those at a lower-cost structure. I mentioned 35% difference between the kind of the next-gen plants versus current plants. And Devina mentioned an acceleration of CapEx there pulling that forward. So, that\u2019s a way that I think we mitigate some of this. And then I do believe that it probably was \u2013 while it didn\u2019t feel like that at the time, it was probably a good thing that we ultimately lost our biggest customer in recycling, which was China a couple of years ago because now it\u2019s all moved \u2013 a lot of that\u2019s moved back to state side and is more predictable. And so I think the recycling business has changed a lot from when we had our last peak, which was, as you said, 2017 and it\u2019s changed for the better and I think it\u2019s changed permanently. Michael Hoffman : Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much. Jim Fish : Thanks Michael. Devina Rankin : Thanks Michael. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley. Jeff Goldstein : Hi, good morning. Just on the volumes first, are you able to add some color to the volume growth by geography? And I think you mentioned continued Canada softness in your prepared remarks. But are the best performing volumes at this point now just the places that shutdown the hardest and now have the easiest comps or is it more nuanced than that? And then just in terms of volume trends, are you able to talk to the month-over-month trends and if that continued to get better throughout the quarter and now that July is almost done here? Jim Fish : Sure, Jeff. Really, the only kind of persistent slowness that we are seeing right now is in Canada. And I looked at July\u2019s numbers again this morning and that\u2019s still there. The encouraging part about Canada is it looks like it\u2019s going to reopen fully sometime in the next two weeks to three weeks, so that is encouraging for us. But it hasn\u2019t been great, and it has been kind of three months to six months behind the United States. So, July\u2019s numbers still look soft in Canada. That\u2019s really the biggest geographic difference for us. I think when you \u2013 John mentioned that commercial has fully recovered when you really compare to 2019 \u2013 2020 comparisons, for obvious reasons, are not really meaningful. But when you start comparing to 2019, commercial has fully recovered. But it\u2019s only about 0.5% above 2019. We really haven\u2019t seen kind of the growth aspect of the economy hit that commercial line of business. And then maybe most encouraging of all for us individually and then also on a more macro basis for the overall economy, are our C&D and special waste streams. And when we look sequentially at how they did, I mean, those two waste streams took the biggest hit of anything last year during COVID. And so they have seen the biggest sequential improvement, so they are on a great upward track. And I think those two by themselves, which tend to be kind of the most forward-looking indicators for us, are the best barometer overall of not only our business going forward, but maybe even the North American economies, a good macro sign for the comp. Jeff Goldstein : Great, that was all very helpful color. And then just a question on the 2-year to 3-year pricing outlook as we sit here today, maybe just some broad strokes, because I am just thinking with your index contracts re-pricing on a lag and that figure looking like it should accelerate next year, is it safe to say your pricing in \u201822 should be above whatever you print this year? Just how should we think about the potential for price to continue to improve into next year and beyond that, really? Jim Fish : Yes. So, let me \u2013 I am going to let John chime in on the resi piece real quick. I will just give you a little bit of my kind of overview on pricing. First of all, we were \u2013 when we looked at our pricing numbers, again, another metric that\u2019s not overly meaningful year-over-year, because as you recall, last year, we really put the brakes on with respect to some of our pricing actions. But when you look sequentially at what we did in terms of collection price and in terms of landfill price, that\u2019s what gives us \u2013 that\u2019s what makes us feel most encouraged about the potential going forward. And to Devina\u2019s points, that is an area of confidence for us. The team understands that pricing is critical to cost recovery, but that it\u2019s also critical to margin expansion. So, we are not just looking at this as a cost recovery mechanism. Part of the success for the quarter was that we did use pricing to recover some of those cost pressures that we have discussed. But it also helped us expand margins. And that really is the plan going into 2022, that we will continue to use price to offset what we expect will be some continued inflation, not as aggressive of inflation figures we are seeing now because some of this, we believe, is temporary, as I mentioned earlier, caused by some of the current government\u2019s benefits. But there is some \u2013 feels like some structural inflation in the system. Pricing will help us more than recover that and will be a good thing for us going forward. And John, maybe you can talk about resi pricing a bit. John Morris : Yes, Jeff, and I think on resi, you heard that in some of our prepared comments, strong yield at 4.7 for the quarter, up from year-to-date. Same thing with core price. We did shed a little bit of volume, but I happen to know that, in fact, one big franchise we had in the Southeast which was underperforming and we made a decision to move it up and instead it went out. And I think what you are seeing though is continued and increasing benefit from our focus on moving the residential number and not to be \u2013 and part of that, you heard a lot of conversation about recycling. Part of fixing residential, I have said this on a few calls, is fixing recycling because about two-thirds of what we process comes from a residential stream that either we collect or another vendor collects. So, long story short, we feel good overall about our pricing strategy, the consistency and the upward trend. And specifically on residential, we expect to continue on a trend as well. Jeff Goldstein : Alright. That was all very helpful and congrats again on the quarter. John Morris : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Hi, good morning and thank you. Could you maybe talk about what you are expecting in terms of pace of labor hiring, specifically headcount? I know, Jim, you talked about a June number, could you talk about \u2013 is that the pace we should expect for the second half? I know stimulus comes off, so maybe labor shortages kind of go away, but any thoughts there? John Morris : Good morning Hamzah. What I would tell you is that Jim pointed to June as being a particularly strong month. But really our progress on the hiring front really started four months or five months ago. As we started to get more confidence in what was coming back in terms of post-COVID recovery, we tried to get out in front of us. So, we have been making steady progress really for the last four months or five months. It really flipped in June and we really saw the fruits of our labor take hold. I would expect that going forward for the next handful of months we are going to continue at a similar pace. Keep in mind though, to the extent we talked about volume recovery and what lines of business is coming from, coupled with, as an example, in residential, where we may shed a little bit of volume going forward to get the right margins, we have to balance all those things out. But I think Jim\u2019s commentary around what we did in June is something you can expect from us for the next handful of months. Jim Fish : Well, Hamzah, I have also said a number of times that we are looking at this somewhat opportunistically. If the high of kind of available folks who would work for this company is shrinking. And look, I have heard that from my 18-year-old daughter that people aren\u2019t interested in her high school \u2013 senior high school class in driving trucks. Then that actually is okay for us as long as we get ours. And that\u2019s what I have said is, if we get ours and the pie is shrinking, I don\u2019t care about the rest of the pie. All I care about is ours. And so there is kind of an opportunistic approach to this. But to John\u2019s point, I mean, I think we are getting ours. It hasn\u2019t been a completely smooth road for us, to be honest. But I think we are getting to a point. And certainly, September 6 will be helpful for everyone when these benefits roll off. Hamzah Mazari : Good, very helpful. And then just my second question just is around M&A. And the question really is your leverage will be 2.75x, I think you said, by the end of the year. You are clearly generating a lot of cash flow, free cash. Could you talk about M&A in terms of outside the solid waste business, particularly you mentioned recycling investments and you mentioned plastics. Are there technologies that can scale in plastics or I know you are using maybe venture capital and investing in those funds versus actually buying technology, but just broad thoughts on M&A outside the core solid waste business longer term? Jim Fish : Sure. So by the way, to your point about our balance sheet, I mean, it\u2019s a compliment to Devina and John and the whole team for really getting our balance sheet back down to where we said it would be by the end of the year, and that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s pretty impressive that through this acquisition, we are already down below 3x against down, I think, 2.85x. So regarding M&A, Hamzah, outside of core, the \u2013 and you mentioned specifically plastics, I think you are aware of the ownership position we have in the company called Continuous Materials, and that company does turn plastics and paper \u2013 low-value plastics and mixed papers into a roofing material. And we have a 33% ish investments in them at this point. So, that \u2013 we are excited about the potential for that. And it helps us take some of that material that might otherwise find its way to a landfill, pull it out of the landfill because it doesn\u2019t do anything in terms of creating any gas or anything usable coming out of the landfill and doing something that\u2019s preferable in terms of kind of ESG, but also preferable financially for us. So, we will look for those types of investments. We are cautious about big acquisitions regardless, but particularly cautious about big non-core acquisitions. I just don\u2019t want to step on a landmine here as we are walking down a pretty nice path and that could be a landmine if we were to do something like that. So, we are not opposed to doing non-core acquisitions. We want to make sure that we have a lot of intelligence in those before we do anything. And I would be surprised, very surprised if you would see us do anything large in the non-core space. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Very helpful. Just lastly, I will turn it over, it\u2019s just a clarification or just an update. Could you update us how much of your book of business is CPI indexed? And is it just a straight LTM CPI it adjusts to or are there other indexes? And what is that running today? Thank you. Devina Rankin : Yes. We are at about 40%, Hamzah, and there is a mix there in terms of whether it\u2019s CPI flat or the Waste Sewer Trash index. We continue to prioritize a push towards WST, though I would tell you that we see strength in the CPI numbers and therefore view that as something that provides some incremental value, particularly in the second half of the year but then looking forward into 2022 as well. John Morris : Yes. I think Hamzah, whether CPI has been up or down, we have always \u2013 we have been demonstrating for the last more than a handful of years that regardless of what\u2019s going on with CPI, we are going to make sure we price the business to at least cover our costs and expand margin. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : Thanks for taking my questions. It looks like this recycling commodity rebates is a new disclosure unless I am mistaken. It would be great to just quickly walk through the mechanics of that. I guess those kick in at a certain basket value in recycling. Any help just understanding that number and the mechanics would be helpful, especially maybe in reference to how it\u2019s built in, in the second half would be great. Devina Rankin : Sure, Sean. So, this is a new disclosure that we are making, and as the leading commentary on the table suggests, what we are attempting to do here is just provide clarity where there is a bit of inconsistency across the industry. And one of the things in particular that\u2019s really important in this business is conversation about operating EBITDA margin. And for WM in Q2 of 2021, on an apples-to-apples basis as best we can when we compare across the business, our operating EBITDA results were 31.2% for the quarter when you compare with this approach more similarly aligned with one of our competitors in particular. And all we are doing here, you can look at the operating expense table that\u2019s in the 10-Q and what you see there is the cost of goods sold line, and that includes rebates that we pay in the recycling line of business. That\u2019s the driver of that cost category. And what we are doing here is reflecting that if you were to net that against the associated revenues rather than grossing it up between revenue and operating expenses. The impact to our margin is 130 basis points in the quarter. The increase on a year-over-year basis reflects the strength of commodity prices, which we have talked about. And so naturally, with the continued strength and outlook for even better year-over-year comps in the second half of the year than we had in the first half of the year, you would expect that to expand further from the 130 basis points that we measured in the second quarter. But really, for us, this is about comparability and trying to enhance that across the space. Sean Eastman : Okay, got it. I think I am going to have to spend some time with that on that one. Secondly, we haven\u2019t talked too much about ADS. It seems like the integration is going quite smoothly. Any color on the strength in the ADS book of business from a pricing program perspective and whether, even just anecdotally, you have uncovered some of the cross-sell opportunities that aren\u2019t fully reflected in that synergy target? John Morris : Hi, good morning Sean. Yes, I would say the integration continues to go really well. You heard in my prepared remarks about our confidence around overall cost, SG&A synergies and reiterating that we still think when it\u2019s all said and done, we will have $150 million of total synergies by 2023. And you also heard from me that we are just about 45% of the way through taking that data from ADS\u2019 databases and moving that over to WM. So, that\u2019s allowing us to \u2013 when you think about routing efficiencies and the other logistical benefits from combining the customer base, you heard that as well in my prepared comments. And I think from a revenue standpoint, as we are moving that business in and it becomes WM business and it goes into portfolio and we are going to manage it in a similar fashion, we manage the rest of our business. Sean Eastman : Okay, terrific. Thanks. I will turn it over. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much, operator. Good morning everyone. I guess my first question here is back on M&A, and obviously, we\u2019ve heard an executive order from President Biden that seems to be singling out larger companies in respective industries that are exercising some pricing power. And while Waste doesn\u2019t necessarily get flagged in that, do you see any increased scrutiny by the DOJ, any increased pressure, any change in approach that they might take toward looking at deals that you might do in the future that would put at risk any of your ability to grow by acquisition at a pace that you otherwise would have if this order hadn\u2019t come through? John Morris : Yes. I mean, look, to be honest, we haven\u2019t seen anything. I mean, we all read the news and we read comments and so you can kind of take those for whatever they are worth. But when we really look at some of the tuck-ins that we\u2019ve done post-ADS, I mean, we haven\u2019t seen anything at this point. What we are hearing that\u2019s not related in really any way to your question but is more about M&A is that it\u2019s somewhat related, I guess, to the new administration because if there is a tax change, we are seeing that there are some companies out there that are becoming sellers because of this prospective change in tax law. Similarly, we\u2019re seeing some folks that are saying, what, I don\u2019t like the labor environment right now. And they are looking at selling for that reason. And then the third thing we\u2019re hearing is that in our industry, with some of these small businesses, there just isn\u2019t, in many cases, a robust succession plan for some of these companies. So I think it\u2019s not directly related to your question about DOJ, but it is related to some of the things that are happening within the current administration, whether it\u2019s subsidies for unemployed or whether it is related to tax law changes. But DOJ, we\u2019re not seeing anything at this point. Walter Spracklin : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then turning to residential volumes, obviously coming up against tougher comps here and I\u2019m curious whether we are seeing, and it would make sense to see, just want to confirm residential volumes now coming down as people get back to work. But the key question here is that is there structurally anything \u2013 any changes that you\u2019ve made during COVID-19 that would \u2013 with your contract on the residential side, that would change what otherwise would be what we would expect with a slowdown in \u2013 or a decline in residential volumes so that the impact would be less onerous or perhaps would be complemented here based on the mix as we see residential volumes come off on a year-over-year basis. John Morris : Yes. Well, there are a few things. We are \u2013 we have seen a little bit of moderation as folks have returned back to their place of work. But there is going to be a little bit of a lingering effect because I think the workforce is going to change a little bit. You\u2019re going to see some more folks work remotely or from home. But that doesn\u2019t look meaningful. We have seen a little bit, Jim commented on this earlier, we have seen a little bit of a shift in the residential recycling stream. Obviously, Amazon is doing well. We\u2019re seeing it show up in the percentage of cardboard that\u2019s coming out or fiber is coming out of a lot of our residential contracts, which is honestly a good thing, especially in this environment. We are seeing some improvement, although not as significant by weight, if you will, in terms of the quality and quantity of some of the higher-margin streams. We talked specifically about plastics and the kind of mixed plastic we use to make versus the specific plastic products that we\u2019re producing for customers. So we view that all as positive. I think overall in general volume in terms of units I don\u2019t think our message has changed. We\u2019re going to continue to make sure that we move residential from a margin perspective up to where it competes with every other line of business. And we\u2019re really making good progress there. And if you look at our price versus volume in the last handful of quarters, it has been slightly negative. But if you look at the core price and yields compared to that, that\u2019s certainly a trade-off we are willing to make. As I\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t want to \u2013 we\u2019re not trying to push the volume out but we\u2019re going to make sure that the investments we\u2019re making in that line of business align with our overall long-term strategy from a profit and return standpoint. Devina Rankin : So John really covered the substance and the business drivers very well. Walter, one kind of clarifying facts that I just want to be sure is clear for us is that the volume decline that you\u2019re seeing is different from container weight. And so the shift that we\u2019re seeing as people return to their workplaces and less people are working from home is more about the container weight, the volume measure that you\u2019re seeing in those intentional steps that we\u2019ve taken that John has spoken about to be very prudent in terms of making incremental investments in the residential line of business with our capital and with our workforce where we are seeing constraints. And that\u2019s business that we knew that we would be shedding and shedding with purpose. Walter Spracklin : Great. Appreciate the time as always. Jim Fish : Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you, Walter. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Good morning, Jim, John and Devina. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019d like to pick up on Michael\u2019s earlier observation about sustainability fueling the higher demand for recycling to really try to understand how you see this opportunity for the company. Just given the acceleration in corporate commitments to recycle and use recycled content, I think the U.S. Plastics Pact, which has 100 corporate signatories. They just unveiled their road map to 2025. And at the same time, it really seems like there is still a pretty big infrastructure gap around recycling these materials and getting them back to those producers. You just look at the difference between the commingled bales and the individual grades of plastics. So would just love to understand kind of your road map for how this is a growth opportunity for the company, both in terms of putting in more infrastructure in terms of helping to close the loop and getting some of these materials back to the manufacturers and then being able to potentially capture organic share gains with those types of manufacturers as a result. Jim Fish : Well, no, I think you\u2019ve hit on kind of the key macroeconomic piece here, which is that finally, it looks like demand is catching up with supply. We\u2019ve always had the supply, but we haven\u2019t, until fairly recently, had as much demand as we would like. We\u2019ve had demand but maybe not as much as we would like. And I think what we\u2019re seeing is that companies are now, with this real focus on virtually every company, ESG focus, are inclined to use recycled material, recycled \u2013 improve the recycled content percentages. So that\u2019s been a benefit for us. There is still, to your point, there still is opportunity, I think, to expand infrastructure, particularly here in the U.S., but we are seeing it \u2013 we\u2019re seeing encouraging signs there. And we have outlets through our brokerage group outside of the United States, which has been one of the real benefits there. When China went away literally overnight, our brokerage team was able to move commodities pretty quickly to other spots, other places around the world. And we still have those and we will continue to move commodities there. But I do like the long-term trends not only for our recycling business but as someone who\u2019s is very focused on the environment. I like the fact that we\u2019re moving to becoming more ESG-focused and that we\u2019re \u2013 the companies that are using and producing materials are looking to use recycled content as opposed to just using virgin content. Noah Kaye : Great. And I guess the follow-up to that would be, you mentioned some of the significant savings around automation in the MRFs, labor and otherwise. Have you really seen a lot of innovation in the last few years, I guess, following China National around those pieces of equipment, those technologies that are driving these returns? Is there more innovation coming down the pike? I guess what I\u2019m basically asking is, is the rate of technology innovation in and around recycling improving at a rate that supports some of these demand and commitments from the eventual buyers of the content? John Morris : Yes. No, I think that\u2019s a great question. I think what you see in the numbers that we referenced around how we\u2019re \u2013 how pleased we are with the investments we made in this advanced and advancing technology, I think that supports the model. We are very pleased with the plants that we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve invested in thus far. Jim mentioned the labor arbitrage, that we\u2019re benefiting from that. And by the way, that\u2019s not just labor for labor\u2019s sake, those are positions that are certainly been and continue to be hard to fill so it\u2019s solving a few problems there. I think around the demand of the customer, we all mentioned that, that side of the equation is as strong now as it\u2019s ever been. And for all the comments made around ESG, we feel confident that, that\u2019s going to continue to grow. And I think plastics is one example. I mean, we\u2019ve got the material stream either through our plants or through in other parts of the waste stream. And what you\u2019re seeing is some migration from what was in the waste stream obviously now to higher-value commodities. And Devina said this not today but on other calls, when you look at it from a return \u2013 a return on invested capital standpoint, our recycle plants are at the top of the heap. So to the extent we keep investing more CapEx there, we\u2019re going to be very pleased with that. And we think that the technology is advancing in a form and fashion that\u2019s going to allow us to continue to meet the customers\u2019 demands. Noah Kaye : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Nice job and best of luck. Devina Rankin : Thanks, Noah. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Kevin Chiang : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one for me and maybe on the ESG angle as well. Can you just give us an update on your EV strategy here? I think you\u2019re evaluating a couple of trucks. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of, when do you think you need to make a larger order to kind of hit some of your emission reduction targets? And I guess, how do you balance the technology you\u2019re seeing now versus maybe what\u2019s in the development pipeline, whether it\u2019s solid state or fuel cell, when you think of making this fleet transition? John Morris : Hey, Kevin. Good morning. No, good question. When we get often and what I said on the last call publicly in other venues is we are working with a number of vendors to watch to see how the battery technology is advancing. As I said before, I think naturally, we\u2019re going to \u2013 we were seeing it in the passenger vehicles and we will probably see in light-duty vehicles. In some cases, we\u2019re seeing it already. So we\u2019ve got a number of vendors we\u2019re working with to watch the way the different technologies advance. I would tell you in terms of our strategy on fleet, we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve pivoted from the traditional diesel fleet that we had to CNG. I wouldn\u2019t say it was seamlessly but the way our fleet plan works is we have some flexibility to be able to move from diesel to CNG, and we view it as CNG to battery electric vehicles the same way. I would tell you what I think will happen is and I talked about this at the conference, Devina and I were at a few weeks ago at WasteExpo, I am confident that over time, they are going to solve the weight issue, the range issue, the [indiscernible] of a refuse vehicle, all those things, I think will get solved. I think the bigger question is the infrastructure piece. And we are also watching that to see what kind of infrastructure we would need in our distributed environment to be able to service a fleet of 20,000 vehicles. Kevin Chiang : That\u2019s helpful. Just as a clarification, when you think of that problem being solved, is it within kind of the construct of a lithium-ion battery? Or do you think it\u2019s an evolution from this, either using fuel cell extenders or even moving to a different propulsion system? John Morris : Kevin, I would \u2013 that\u2019s something I think is a little bit still a little murky at this point. That\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re working with a handful of different vendors just to make sure we\u2019ve got our eye on all the different potential solutions to your good question. Kevin Chiang : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I will leave it there. Thank you very much and great quarter guys. Jim Fish : Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Thank you so much. Wanted to move over to the legislative and regulatory side, I believe earlier this week, the House pushed through a potential bill on PFAS to require the EPA to establish national drinking water standards. Can you give us an update on what you think is going on there and how long the time line is going to be for this? Jim Fish : I don\u2019t know that we know exactly what the time line is. We saw that as well. Maybe a bit more of a kind of a macro answer to that is that we do look at PFAS as being a cost impact to us, but we look at it as a much bigger opportunity for us than a cost impact. We know there may be some added costs, albeit something we have had our eye on for quite some time and have been honestly working with EPA on it for quite some time. But we also really are looking at this with a pretty interested eye because once we do know those details that you referenced there, I think it really opens up a big opportunity for us. And so we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not sure it might be overstating to say we\u2019re excited about it, but we do \u2013 we are encouraged that this could be a big stream, revenue stream for us. But at this point, it still is \u2013 I\u2019ll use John\u2019s words, it still is a little bit murky. And we don\u2019t know exactly what the details are going to be on how they \u2013 what they say about PFAS. But for example, we\u2019re \u2013 it feels a little bit like it\u2019s coal combustion residual part two. Jeff Silber : Okay, interesting. And then continuing this theme, we\u2019re also hearing and reading a lot more on the EPR side. I know it\u2019s big in Canada and we\u2019re seeing some things going on in specific states in the U.S. Again, if you can give us an update there from your perspective, what you think the impact might be on your business. John Morris : Yes, Jeff, our entire team is following what\u2019s going on with EPR. And I think our position is still the same, which is we feel like we have the assets, the infrastructure, the network to solve for a lot of the challenges that come out of EPR. So to the extent we can continue to maximize use of our assets, I think we\u2019re \u2013 we understand that. But that, too, is a little bit \u2013 there is still some wood to chop on that front as well. I know there is some things that are unique going up in Canada but I think we\u2019re well positioned there as well with \u2013 in terms of assets to help solve for that challenge. Jeff Silber : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much. John Morris : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of David Manthey with Baird. David Manthey : Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Last quarter, you mentioned that you expected landfill yield in particular to be strong. I\u2019m wondering this quarter, was it up to your expectations? And just could you give us a bit of an outlook on that business, in particular, landfill yield? Devina Rankin : The landfill yield was slightly above our expectations in the second quarter, I would say not as much above expectations as, say, C&I was. And we do expect it to moderate somewhat from the second quarter levels, that we\u2019re still encouraged that with our focus on MSW pricing in particular and then the strong pipeline that we have from a volume perspective in C&D and special waste, that, that will give some natural lift to yields in the back half of the year as those streams tend to have strong pricing that\u2019s more difficult to predict specifically because it can vary by geography and where the streams come in. But all in all, our outlook is very strong at \u2013 from a core price perspective, I really think that, that tells the story. And we\u2019re driving core price above 4% in the landfill line of business, which is the result we want to see. David Manthey : Okay. Thank you. And Devina, you also mentioned something about incentive comp being higher in the future. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was a comment regarding the second quarter \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the second half of 2021 or if that was 2022 or both. Could you clarify? Devina Rankin : Sure. So it really is a difference between whether you\u2019re looking at EBITDA or free cash flow. So I\u2019ll start with EBITDA. It\u2019s something that\u2019s impacted us in the first half of the year, the total impact for the full year, we now expect to be in the ballpark of around $60 million, could be a little north of that from an EBITDA cost perspective. And so you are seeing some margin pressure from that. When we look at the collection and disposal business, in particular, when we disclosed in the press release that, that business was backwards 10 basis points relative to prior year, 50 basis points of that was actually incentive compensation. So when you adjust for that, that shows that the traditional solid waste business actually made really strong progress in margin expansion. Our cash flow impact on a year-over-year basis will show up in 2022. And so that\u2019s where I made the 2022 comment earlier because this year in 2021, when we paid last year\u2019s bonus, we had a little bit of a benefit to cash flow relative to what we would expect in the year ahead just because 2020\u2019s payout was around 70% for the total company, and we expect this year to be meaningfully higher than that. David Manthey : Okay. Very good, thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : And our last question will come from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Michael Feniger : Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Great quarter. Just a question just for Devina, I mean, you guys raised the outlook, which is great. Just to check my math, is the margin range still the same with the April guide? And in the first half, you guys expanded margin of 80 basis points, 50 bps in Q2, which is impressive with the volume recovery. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what you\u2019re implying in the second half. And is that what you were referring to earlier in the call, Devina, when you said you feel like there is some conservatism still in this guide? Devina Rankin : It\u2019s a great question, Michael. And what I would say is the implied guide on margin is that we\u2019re basically flat to positive 50 basis points for the full year. And what that implies about the second half is that we will have a chance for a little bit of margin degradation from the year prior. The what behind that really comes down to the inflationary cost pressures that we\u2019ve talked a great deal about, incentive compensation but also the conversation about the strength in hiring. We\u2019re going to have additional training hours in the back half of the year as we get those new drivers on board. All of those things put slight downward pressure on the margin outlook. But there are a lot of positives and we\u2019re focused on those positives and think that they could outperform what we\u2019re currently projecting, though too early to say. The first is definitely the strength of the traditional solid waste business. And we always have to lead with that. Certainly, recycling commodity price and RIN values provide additional benefit from a margin perspective. Then the ADS integration, the strength of that in the back half of the year and John\u2019s comments earlier about where we are year-to-date on synergies but where we expect to end the year. The ADS business, we estimate, could have provided as much as a 75 basis point headwind to our margins in the second quarter. And we expect that, that moderates in the back half of the year as we do things like moderate the level of incremental investment that\u2019s needed in the fleet to get it to WM standards, and we realize that synergy potential that we\u2019ve outlined for everyone. So as much as there are some things that are working against us, we do think that there are some tailwinds. Just a little difficult for us to predict, particularly given the inflationary cost environment that we\u2019re all talking about. Michael Feniger : Understandable, Devina. That makes sense. And with that slight margin degradation that you\u2019re kind of expecting in the second half, that you laid out some of the positives, I mean, I guess, to Devina or Jim, I mean, this is a weird year obviously with comps from COVID. When all this gets normalized, when we think about 2022, just to set the stage here, are we thinking like 2% plus volumes with this economic recovery, yields shifting higher because of pricing? Is it in the 3% range? And what you\u2019re seeing on the pricing front, and Devina, like what you suggested with some of these moderating investments, I mean, are we thinking about margin expansion above 50% in 2022 with what you guys are seeing right now and the yield you guys are expecting in the second half of this year as some of these costs that kind of fade out next year? Maybe just help set that stage if 50 bps of margin expansion kind of makes sense next year. Jim Fish : So Michael, we\u2019re really just kind of entering into our 2022 budgeting process here, so I would say we don\u2019t have a lot of detail on it yet. But on kind of a bigger scale here, I do think we\u2019re feeling encouraged about the volume and the price forecast as we think about 2022 and even beyond 2022. Pricing, in particular, feels like we\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019re able to not only cover inflationary cost increases but also add to margin. And we\u2019re very encouraged by the sequential signs we\u2019ve seen both in collection and landfill pricing. So that gives us quite a bit of confidence on the price front. Volumes, the volumes have been good. And to your point, 2020 comparisons were not meaningful. But look, volume hasn\u2019t totally returned. I talked about Canada being soft. And we think Canada obviously will come back when we get to 2022, so that would be a tailwind for us on the volume side. Landfill volumes have not fully returned. MSW is the one that may be the exception there, but I mentioned special waste and C&D that have not fully returned. Those appear, though, to be very strong right now, and the pipeline appears very good with special waste. So we will obviously give you more color as we get to our guidance session, but we feel encouraged about what we\u2019re doing on OpEx, what we\u2019re seeing on volume and price, and we feel encouraged about the longer term trends for recycling. All of that would bode well for the \u2013 at the out years. Michael Feniger : Thanks guys. Thanks, Jim. Jim Fish : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Alright, thank you. A bit of a long call today but we\u2019re particularly proud of the results for the quarter, so we want to make sure we took all your questions. Thank you for your questions. Very good questions today and thanks for your time. I look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Now I will turn the call over to Waste managers, President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash-generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations. Our solid results put us on track to meet the higher full-year financial outlook we provided last quarter, even as we face some of the highest inflation that we've seen in years, along with the labor and supply chain constraints. Virtually, no segment of economy, including government and the private sector, has been unaffected by these historically accrued inflationary and supply chain challenges.  Disbursement inflation accelerated through the third quarter and during the quarter, we saw roughly $60 million of labor inflation at about $100 million of inflation in other operating cost categories. Overall, our underlying labor inflation for the third quarter was 8.7%. So that's the tough news. The good news is that the business continues to perform well as demonstrated by the fact that we still expect to finish the year within our previously adjusted operating EBITDA raise, adjusted operating EBITDA, and free cash flow guidance ranges. And we will be above our prior revenue range due to strong price execution and strengthening volumes. John, Devina, and I will discuss what we're doing about these labor and inflationary pressures in the short-term and medium-term.  Not surprisingly, our disciplined price programs are the primary lever to combat cost inflation. Our pricing programs delivered core price of 4.6% and collection and disposal yield of 3.5% in the third quarter. Standout performance continues to be the residential line of business with yield of 5%, while MSW yield improved to 3.5%. But keep in mind the price escalations on about 40% of our revenue are tied to an index, often based on a look back over the prior year. So, there's a timing lag in adjusting index pricing when cost step-up as quickly as they have. And it's important to understand that a portion of the remaining 60% of our business won't get the full 7% to 10% price increases we believe we need to cover rising costs, until their next price increase cycle. A customer who has increased 4% in May, won't get the full cost recovery price increase until next May. That said, we're seeing a favorable price environment across our open-market businesses, evidenced by our low Let's level of rollbacks in more than a decade. We're very focused on directly addressing the labor challenges. John will discuss the quarterly impact and how we're working to address this immediately. Strategically, we're looking at this acute challenge as an opportunity to expedite the automation of certain jobs. We've said previously that we view the automation of certain high turnover positions as both a competitive advantage and a derisking mechanism in today's labor market where certain jobs simply don't attract the interest they previously did. The most recent examples of that are the customer setup role which we just finished fully automating, and the 35-plus percent reduction in labor we've seen, where we've upgraded and rebuild our single-stream recycling plants. Given the success of these rebuilds and the labor inflation challenges of late, we have accelerated the retooling of the remaining singles-stream plans, and expect to address 90% of single-stream volume by the 2023-2024 timeframe. In the quarter, we saw some of the positive impacts of those new single-stream plans in our outstanding performance in our recycling business. Earnings contribution, and margins for recycling were at their highest level ever, driven by strong demand for recycle material and great operating performance from the new state-of-the-art [Indiscernible]. We were equally pleased with results in our renewable energy business in the quarter where robust growth continued, driven by more rents sales at higher prices. With our long-standing expertise, continued growth and sustainability solutions and unrivaled asset network, WM is uniquely situated to support our current and prospective customers in their evolving sustainability needs. Our customers are increasingly seeking circular solutions for their materials, which is causing growing demand for recycled content. Of note, our focus on unlocking more plastic from the waste stream, drove a 25% increase in plastics we recycled since 2019. Recycling and renewable energy are 2 of our key growth areas, highlighted in our annual sustainability report published earlier this month.  The report outlines the progress WM has made against our sustainability goals, and details investments we've made to advance our sustainability journey. In particular, this year's report focuses on the people behind the progress WM has made in the past year, and how they are doing their parts to take care of our customers, neighbors, and the environment and communities across North America. The bottom line for the quarter is this, we generated higher-than-expected volume and revenue growth in the third quarter, which positions us well for 2022. At the same time, we faced an unexpectedly acute and fast-moving challenge from the inflation, supply chain, and labor shortage headwinds.  And we managed our way through it well and still expect to achieve results within our 2021 guidance ranges. And this challenge presents an opportunity for us to move more decisively in those strategic areas of automation, sustainability, and workforce planning to further separate ourselves in this industry. In conclusion, I'd like to thank the nearly 50,000 people [Indiscernible]. They continue to deliver driving another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA, and free cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim. And good morning. Our team continues to execute very well despite a challenging operating environment producing more than 7% percent organic revenue growth in collection and disposal business in the third quarter. This growth combined with continued integration of Advanced Disposal drove operating EBITDA more than 14% higher. As Jim mentioned, we are seeing pressure on labor and other cost categories, and we are addressing these impacts to our pricing programs to controllable cost management, efficiency improvements, and workforce planning.  Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to a 180 basis points to 62.2% in the third quarter, as we experienced pressure from inflationary costs, supply chain constraints, and stronger-than-expected volume growth. In particular, costs-related to the hiring and training of new employees impacted labor costs in the third quarter. We also saw overtime hours increase as the team adjusted to meet the higher-than-expected collection volumes. We anticipated a good portion of this labor pressure that are showing up on our cost, as we made proactive market wage adjustments earlier in the year to get in front of labor shortages and meet growing demand. At the same time, we are working to automate a number of roles where we see longer-term challenges to attract and retain employees.  In the residential line of business, we continue to work through the last 40% of our route, including those from ADS that are not fully automated, while continuing to be very selective in the business we are willing to take on, as evidenced by our yield and volume results in the third quarter end of the last few years. While we are now incurring the cost associated with these investments, we're only in the early stages of seeing the benefits. Our labor market supply chain constraints that they accelerated in Q3, coupled with robust volume growth in the Third Quarter, have also added pressure in [Indiscernible] operations, repair and maintenance costs are increasing as we hire additional technicians and incur some overtime hours to address the strong volume growth, we continue to see in the collection lines of business.  Similarly, we've had to temporarily place some of our higher-cost trucks back in service to address the volume demands. In addition, our third-party sub-contractors, our transfer stations, are facing similar pressures and are passing those increased costs onto us. Overall, efficiency in the collection business in the third quarter, adjusting improved in the collection business in the third quarter adjusting for increased training hours. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and we are committed to recovering our cost increases through pricing and again, taking the most expensive truck off the road and reducing most expensive hour of the day. Now I want to focus on several of the positives in the quarter.  Turning to our strong revenue results, third-quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 3.8%, which outpaced our expectations. We continue to see strong volume driven by economic reopening with commercial volume up 4.6% and special waste volume up by 16.6%. And we see runway for continued solid performance in the fourth quarter. Customer metrics were also strong in the quarter. Service increase is outpaced, service decreases by more than twofold for the second consecutive quarter and churn was 8.7%. Year-to-date net new business for small and medium business customers is up more than 10%. Finally, our integration of advanced disposal continues to go smoothly.  We've combined around 70% of the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems and we remain on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year. We have achieved nearly 26 million in annual run rate synergies during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $60 million combined with the $15 million of annual run rate synergies realized in the Fourth Quarter of 2020, we're on track to reach $100 million by the end of the year. And we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of costs and capital savings. Our teams are working tirelessly to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and communities, and I want to thank them all for their efforts. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices, and an increased collection in disposal core price continued to deliver top-line growth ahead of expectations in the Third Quarter. As a result, we are once again updating our revenue outlook for the year. Total Company revenue growth is now expected to be between 17% and 17.5% with yield and volume in our collection and disposal business of about 6.5%. Its guidance also includes an expectation for continued strength in recycled commodity prices and RIN values. We're confirming our most recent 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance, between $5 billion and $5.1 billion. Which is an increase from the prior year of about 17% at the midpoint, and almost seven -- almost 5% higher than our initial outlook for the year. Third-quarter SG&A was 9.7% of revenue, a 40-basis point improvement over 2020. Included in our results is about $16 million of increased digital investments, as we advanced technology that will benefit customer engagement and lower our cost to serve over the long term. We remain focused on managing our controllable spending making sure that we allocate each dollar to initiatives that will enhance our business. Third Quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion, an increase of 15%. Cash from operations growth continues to be driven by our robust increase in operating EBITDA, including the contributions from the ADS acquisition and lower interest costs. While there was a modest unfavorable working capital comparison in the third quarter, due in large part to the timing of cash from P&G credit and our deferral of payroll taxes in 2020. Overall, improvements in working capital demonstrate the benefit of tools we're putting in place to enhance our systems and processes. In the third quarter, capital spending was $464 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first 9 months of the year to 1.13 billion dollars. Our 2021 pace of capital spending has continued to be slower than we planned due to supply chain constraints and construction project or taking longer than planned.  As we discussed last quarter, we are proactively pulling forward capital investment, particularly in recycling, where we know the returns will be strong. Investments in recycling technology and equipment at our [Indiscernible] are expected to be about $200 million for the year. While we continue to target full-year capital spending at the low end of our $1.78 to $1.88 billion guidance range, we could see 2021 coming in below targeted levels with some of our spending pushed into 2022 primarily due to supply chain constraints. We generated $773 million of free cash flow in the Third Quarter. And through September, our business generated free cash flow of $2.29 billion, putting us well on our way to our full-year targeted free cash flow of $2.5-2.6 billion. We've returned more than $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first nine months, paying $730 million in dividends and repurchasing one billion dollars of our stock. We continue to expect to repurchase up to our full authorization of $1.35 billion in 2021. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.71 times, as the strength of our business performance in the successful integration of the acquired ADS business, drove the achievement of our targeted leverage ratio ahead of plan. As we enter the final stretch of 2021, our teams are focused on accelerating our disciplined pricing programs, managing our controllable costs, positioning WM as an employer of choice, and capturing growing volumes. We know our strategies set this up for a solid finish to 2021. With that Erica, we'd be happy to address the teams\u2019 questions. Operator : As a reminder, to ask a question you will need to [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Good morning, guys. Jim Fish : Good morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey Jim. Thanks for all the color on inflation. I know you guys don't give a ton looking ahead on these Q3 calls, but it just sounds like the setup for pricing looks very favorable next year. I mean, you've got clearly this inflationary environment. You have strong CPI resets and you alluded to an open market that let's just say feels very rational. So just big picture. Why wouldn't pricing in '22 accelerate pretty meaningfully? And do you have confidence that you can price in excess of unit cost inflation next year? Jim Fish : Yes, I think you're right about that, Tyler. I think that's probably the single biggest message of the day, which is this, yes, we saw some cost inflation, which has been talked about at any business show you watch on TV talks about it, and add a little bit of -- it was a quicker than we thought. It was more acute than we thought. And the price that is our biggest lever, as I said in my remarks. To offset that, is not perfectly timed with that. So, there is a lag there. We've talked a lot about the fact that 40% of our business is tied to an index. And I mentioned that there is a, in many cases, a look back on that. About title rep, 40% of our business in that 40%, about 40% of that comes in January.  So, the price adjustment comes in January, about 30% comes in July, so 70% of the price increases on that index business come in the first half of 2022. And then the remaining 30% some of it comes in October and then there's a spattering that comes in the remainder of the year. And then on the open market piece, I gave the example of the customer that -- the job the 4% price increase back in May. And we still have a customer to keep in mind here. We don't want to go back to those customers and, hey, inflation hit us hard than we thought, so we're going to go ahead and increase you buy another 6 here in October. We're going to be smart about it and wait until we get to their annual cycle, in May of next year, and then we'll increase them by the amount that we need to cover costs and improved margins. Tyler Brown : Yes. Okay. That is extremely helpful. Real quickly, Devina. So, it sounds like there's a lot going on in the EBITDA margins this quarter year-to-year. I don't know if you can distill it down, but can you just help us bridge out that 140 basis points down in EBITDA margin, specifically, and some of the key buckets there? Devina Rankin : The two primary buckets to look at are really the inflation impacts that we've discussed and then recycling brokerage. So, we would say that about 60% of the impact was from inflation and about 40% was from recycling brokerage. To put a little more color around the inflationary impacts that Jim mentioned earlier, that total was a $160 million during the quarter, we estimate that our normal inflationary impacts would have been about 60 of that. So that was a $100 million in excess of what we consider normal inflationary impact.  And then, you might recall that we had projected that we were going to have about 60 million over and above our normal run rate in the back half of the year. So, we think that our costs in Q3 were about $60-$70 million above what we would have projected, and that you can see is a pretty meaningful impact to the overall margin of the business. I think it's important to look at our cost structure and see that 35% of our operating costs are labor-driven. And then when you consider subcontractor costs, which is effectively indirect labor, that's another 15%. 50% of our cost structure is labor-driven and we've seen that as a big driver. John Morris : And Tyler, I would only add that, with the additional volume I commented on in my prepared remarks, part of what we've done is we're spending a little bit more overtime in the short term to be able to go out of service and take advantage of the strong volumes. I mentioned in my comments that outpaced our expectations, which we view as a good thing over the long term. And certainly, we have a clear line of sight to what those costs are as Devina spoke to. Tyler Brown : Great. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks. Devina Rankin : Thanks, Tyler. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. Just a follow-up on just operating leverage. I guess listening to your comments, is it fair to say that second half next year is when you'll see greater op leverage? Just given timing of these pricing resets and related to the op leverage, how much of your cost increase is incremental hiring because of labor availability issues impacting that, versus how much is just restarting your existing labor cost base up that you referenced with wage adjustments? I would also put subcontractor cost into that existing labor reset, I guess. John Morris : Yes, Hamzah, good morning. I would tell you that when I look at the labor increase hold hours and this is in aggregate. About a quarter of it is related to some additional training and hiring we're doing, some of that has to do with turnover pressures that I think we're seeing, and just about everybody in a transportation industry is seeing. I think the good news is, over the last four or five months, we've actually started to make good progress in terms of our retention rates on whatnot. And I think the labor resets we talked to last quarter, which are clearly showing up in this quarter as well, are having an impact there.  The other three quarters of it, if you will, were up numbers is related to some of the OT we're incurring. Part of that, as I mentioned, is we don't view that over the long term as a bad thing because we're seeing volume increase as we are outpacing our expectations. I think as Jim mentioned previously to Tyler's question, we have a clear line of sight on what we need to do through pricing and efficiency gains, etc., and automation to be able to overcome that. I do think 70% of that index, business resetting in the first half of the year is clearly something that we're focused on, and as Jim mentioned, our pricing strategy more broadly is not going to change, our expectations will have to change to keep pace with the cost increases we've outlined. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Very helpful. My follow-up question I will turn it over is, just around investment in automation, as well as technology, could you -- and I know Jim, you referenced the automation peace being accelerated and you mentioned the Murphs and you mentioned automation of some customers start up functions. Maybe at a high level, what inning are you in terms of automation, what, is there left to do? And is it just on recycling? And then also as part of that, just from a technology perspective, again, what's behind you? What's yet to come? Thank you. Jim Fish : I think comps that we're probably in the second inning, I like using the baseball analogy since we're in Houston today, but I think we're probably in the second inning here. There's a lot that falls under that automation umbrella. It's not just -- we've talked a lot about customer service digitalization, which is really is kind of the digital side of that. But the automation that I refer to is -- while it's technology, it's not technology as we think about it. It's not your mobile device. It's optical sorters at our plants. And we have 45, I think, single-stream plants. And we've fully automated 4 of those plants at this point.  So, if you think about the fact that we're taking 35 - ish percent of labor out, and to put that into dollars for you, it's about a million dollars per plant per month in labor savings. And think about the fact that we still have 40 of those plants -- 40 - ish of those plants left. Now, some of those plants, we're obviously automating the big ones first, so you won't get a million dollars from the very smallest plant, but that's a piece of the automation. But to your question, it's not just those recycled positions I mean, we have a lot of positions that have very high turnover that feel like they lend themselves to automation and we'll be looking at those going forward.  So, what's the total number that would be impacted by [Indiscernible]? But I think it's certainly more than just customer setup, which we fully automated and recycling. And then also, I want to make one last point to your question to John on OpEx, which we haven't talked about, but if you think about the COVID effect, we had almost 900 employees out at the peak. And the peak week I think, was the third of September. And we pay those employees, we made a conscious decision to pay them. If you think about the impact of that 900, by the way, a lot of those, probably over half of those were drivers. so, we are paying them and at same time, we are picking up their routes with overtime hours.  The cost of that was somewhere between 2 and 3 million bucks over a two-week period. So, it's not insignificant. And that number of both, that 900 by the way is quarantined employees and COVID employees. Employees who have the virus. That number has come back down as we've seen it across the U.S. to a much more manageable number it's in the -- I looked at the essay it's in the 200 range now down from the P. So that was a short-term cost that we were bearing. That was certainly coming back and we won't see that repeat unless we have another variant that kicks off and causes us to be back in the same position. Hamzah Mazari : Still, I just want to clarify one thing, the savings from the recycling plant is a million dollars per plant for quarter, not for both? John Morris : Sorry. Sorry. I knew it. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, press assistance for Devina, looking at merging enhancement in and you've had a great track record in historic years of achieving margin, margin improvement year-to-year, but now, as you re-priced and a lot of your re-pricing is to pass through costs, you are able to protect EBITDA dollars, but it can be somewhat margin dilutive given the pass-through nature. So, when we look to next year, is there any cautionary you're cautioning us to keep that in mind when we look at historic margin expansion versus next year margin expansion, given that a lot of your revenue is cost pass-through revenue though. Devina Rankin : Yes. I would say that, what's really important is to go back to one of Jim's earlier comments about the fact that, the acute nature of the cost increase that we experienced during the third quarter. And the fact that our index revenue is more significantly weighted towards the first half of the year, indicates that we had a mismatch in terms of when a lot of those price increases are pushed through. And when we experienced the more acute cost increases, we are not in any way indicating that this is anything other than that lag and kind of a one time or short term, I should say, impact in terms of margin.  Degradation, our outlook remains strong in terms of the businesses ability to work, both through pricing and operating efficiencies as the automation that we've discussed in order to improve the long-term margin of the business. I think that 2022 can have some noise in it with regard to some of these timing differences continuing, particularly as you think about the year-on-year impact of the volume expansion that we've seen in 2021. But our outlook remains solid with respect to expectations over the long term being one of margin expansion even with a higher cost structure. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That's great color. Appreciate that. And then my follow-up is just with regard to wages and the percentage of your workforce that has been re-priced if you want to call it that, is there a larger part or a meaningful part of your workforce that you perhaps are coming up on wage discussions or renewal that will likely see an outsized price increase that has not yet been built into your numbers, or are you pretty much done it from that overall wage repricing type of framework? John Morris : So, Walter, most of the wage adjustments we spoke to in Q2 and have carried through in Q3 have really been in drivers, technicians, front-line employees, our recycling folks, etc. So, I'm taking the swag here, but it's probably 2/3 to 70% of our folks have -- are in that population in some way, shape, or form. And Greg, that's not to mention -- say that we've raised rates on every one of those employees, but we've addressed that employee group. And then the balance listen, I think everybody's in a competitive labor market right now. We're keeping a close eye on the other 30% to 35% were part of that initial push. But that's something we do on regular basis and we go through that at least annually to make sure that we're compensating all's folks adequately relative to what's going on in the market. Walter Spracklin : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the time as always. Devina Rankin : Thank you, Walter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifle. Michael Hoffman : Good morning. 2018 solved a lot of the inflation for the first time, the market's first-time seeing garbage deal with inflation. How would you compare the pace of that versus the pace of what you're experiencing right now? And then let's remind everybody, you covered all of that inflation with pricing, eventually then too. Jim Fish : I don't think they're that close. I think this is this is far more acute than what we've seen. I'm not sure there's anybody working at our Company today. Maybe a couple of people in their '70s that have seen this type of rapid inflation. At the example I gave of the customer that got the 4% price increase in May was a real example. So, we weren't even seeing this in May, this came on as quickly as almost the end of July but -- and really has accelerated. You weren't hearing people talking about it. I mean, it's being talked about all the way up at the White House, being talked about by the Fed s Chair so I would tell you that this is more acute than we've seen before, but the other thing -- and you're right Michael, we did cover it with price and we think price is the primary labor to cover this and we're doing a good job with it. But it's why I wanted to make sure we stressed that there are some high turnover jobs that really don't have to do with this inflationary period.  There are some high turnover jobs that we need to really serious look at automating, and at the same time using customer service digitalization to really extract maximum efficiency out of our organization. John and I have talked a lot about it, and we think when we fully automate these routes, there's somewhere between 10% and 15% efficiency improvement, because you're not going to automate a truck driver job, certainly in my career, maybe even in my lifetime. But we do think we've got significant opportunity there on the driver side for efficiency growth. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Fair enough. So clear message is, and you've said this in pieces, but I want to say it out loud, you've expected to cover all this inflation. You just need time and time isn't years, it's months. Jim Fish : I think that's right. I mean, the 40% -- I think we should focus on the 40%. That is indexed driven and then I talked about, how half of that or 70% of it happened in the first half of the year. There is a look-back, so the adjustment that comes in January for some of those big contracts, some of those have a 12-month look-back which won't capture the full effects of inflation. We wouldn't get the full effect of this last three months of inflation on those adjustments. We wouldn't get the full effect of that until the adjustment we take in January of 2023. The adjustments that we take in July will pretty much reflect all of the inflationary -- this acute inflationary impact. Michael Hoffman : Okay, fair enough. Devina, on the free cash flow, what are your assumptions to maintain the guidance of 2.5 to 2.6 on cash flow from ops and capital spending? Devina Rankin : From a capital spending perspective, we would love to spend every bit of the full-year guidance that we put forth the $1.78 to $1.88 billion. But as I mentioned, all year we've seen things move just a little more slowly than we would've liked, and we have taken some proactive steps in order to pull some capital forward. That being said, right now, we think we could finish the year somewhere in the range of $1.7 to $1.8 billion. We'd love for it to be a higher number than that, particularly as we've made investments in renewable energy and recycling specifically. In terms of the other puts and takes, I think is important to recall that we expected an increase in our cash taxes on a year-over-year basis.  We've seen that through the 9 months, but you'll have another leg of that in Q4. And then we've seen significant working capital contributions in the first 9 months of the year. We think we'll give some of that back in Q4, just based on some of the timing impacts of some payments that we have. But all-in-all really good performance in cash flow for the year, I would say it is the one that has certainly exceeded the expectation in every single aspect of contribution. All in all, total free cash flow at about the midpoint of 255 is tremendous growth. On a year-over-year basis and meaningfully ahead of the 1965 that we normalized, when you look at 2020 for the impact of the proceeds from divestitures from the ADS transactions. So that shows the level of growth on a year-over-year basis and free cash flow. Michael Hoffman : Okay. But to sum your comments, if you end up spending on the lower end of Capex, there's an upward bias to the midpoint of the range on free cash flow. Devina Rankin : The one thing I would caution there is on the cash flow from ops we do have the taxes and working capital impacts that I mentioned. That's the only caveat that I would have there, but yes. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then John, I saw Tim Hawkins and Jason Kraft and a couple others from other companies recently, they were all in a NWEA meeting and they all suggested that peak open positions -- you had past peak open positions and you were at least no longer struggling against peak open. Is that an accurate statement still? So, this pressure has peaked and started to add a little bit? John Morris : I would tell you within WM, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, probably last 4 or 5 months, Michael, we've really started to show some progress in terms of being able to net add, if you will, month-in and month-out at some of those key positions, specifically, the driver ranks. There's still a lot of competition out there, there's still a lot of pressure, as Jim mentioned, you can't turn on the TV without hearing about some form of pressure and transportation, whether it's marine, whether it's rail or whether it's truck transportation. But as I mentioned, the good news is I think the efforts we made to make some of those wage adjustments coupled with our efforts around retention and hiring are certainly yielding positive results here for the last 4 or 5 months. Michael Hoffman : So, you're off the peak open positions is the clear message? John Morris : Correct. Jim Fish : Michael, think about it, we have 10% - ish of our drivers that are making over 100,000 a year. And I don't know what the figure is for 90,000 above, but it's significantly higher than that. So, at the same time, we have really good benefits, we've announced the education benefits several months back. We chose to pay them during COVID, we've chosen to pay them -- still paying them when they're out on quarantine. We really have focused on taking care of our teammates here and we think that pays dividends for us in terms of reducing the amount of churn.  To John 's point, I think the number I read last week was, there are 82 thousand open trucking positions across the U.S. And then of course the same time we're seeing this volume increase. And so, we're trying to compensate for that as well. It's a good thing, it's a good problem to have, but yes, to John's point, we're getting past that peak but we think we're well-positioned. We like our [Indiscernible] these roles as part of why we're -- we have really good pay benefits and we hope to make sure that we differentiate ourselves there. Michael Hoffman : And then last one for me, for John, I think I picked up in your remarks, [Indiscernible] are seeing net new business growth not just where you opened leverage. Its net new business growth and there's momentum, that momentum should continue. So that's good news, but I guess there's two pieces to that. How does that impact the thoughts about capital spending inflation be able to meet that net new business growth. John Morris : Well, first I would tell you 2 things I mentioned on our prepared remarks, Michael, which are pretty familiar to you, which is the net service increases versus decreases is strong from Q2 to Q3. And then I mentioned also small and medium business, which is a traditional collection business and that I would say temporal off and the big really large accounts. We're seeing good momentum there. That was the 10% number, but I don't see in terms of capital, I mean, the capital spends there would be some incremental capital, containers and to some extent, when you guys -- we've talked about before that step function between filling up a raft and the next raft, but we don't see that as out of the ordinary capital spend. Michael Hoffman : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Kevin Chiang : Good morning, everybody, thanks for taking my question here. If I can ask us on your repricing strategy for next year, just given how acute inflation as you've mentioned, Jim. Just wondering how you look to maybe limit or you've got lag between when you see pricing versus maybe this year that inflation might be more persistent than we all had hoped a few months ago. But like, are you looking at contract terms that might allow you to reprice in the event that inflation continues to persist at elevated level? Or are you pricing for maybe what do you think inflation could go versus maybe, what costs you've seen increase in the back half of this. Just being interested in seeing how you think about that repricing strategy to kind of limit that lag, as you look out into 2022. Jim Fish : Yeah, Kevin, the lag really just hits us in the first part where we're this kind of three-month period, once we catch up with that, and once we catch up with these adjustments on the 40% that's index-based then, unless inflation runs up from here, which we don't anticipate, I'm not sure I've seen anybody that anticipates that, then we feel like we're in a really good position with pricing to cover these cost increases plus add the margin. Now if inflation goes to 15% then I will retract that statement, but I don't think anybody expects that, so right now, if you look at core price, for example, we're pretty happy with the core price numbers that we were showing. Core price was 6.1% for the quarter in commercial. That's a big core price number if you look at the landfill line of business which has gotten a lot of questions over the last couple of years.  Core price in landfill was 4.6% as 2 consecutive quarters over 4% of core price. And really that's probably the best metric for looking at price increases, is core price versus yield. Yield was very good as well, but the core price probably is the best approximator of price increases. So, I feel really comfortable with the existing CPI and core inflation in the system that the pricing mechanisms that we have in place will cover that and also provide us some opportunity to improve margins as we go into 2022. keep in mind that 12-month look back, a big piece of the adjustment that's coming in January won't include all of the inflation that's going to take a year to capture that. Kevin Chiang : That's great color. Yes, let's all hope we're not heading for 15% inflation there. Maybe I can ask a non-inflation question. Recently put out this P-fast strategic roadmap, I guess as it looks to evaluate what the studies and I guess things they look to go over the next few years. Just wondering, as you look at the roadmap that you put out there, is there anything that you would comment on? Does it align with what you thought that EPA would do? Or think the EPA should do as they evaluate the P - fast strategy? Jim Fish : Yeah. Kevin that was just something off the press here in the last week or two with some milestone dates that the EPA published on some things they want to get covered, but I think that our answer is still the same to that. It could present a little bit of short-term cost impact to us, but we still believe over the long term, the post-collection assets we have are going to benefit from that certainly over the long term. Kevin Chiang : All right. I'll leave it there, thank you for taking my questions. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : Hi, Jim. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just curious if you've seen any instances where this labor shortage is causing a down take in service quality. Have you guys track that anything concerning there? I just wonder if that ultimately impacts WM's ability to continue this great pricing trend we've been seeing? John Morris : So, Sean, there's pockets of it. I mean, first and foremost, we track it, we track it everywhere every day. And all of us get to keep a close eye on that. We have seen some pockets of pressure for sure where we've had some acute turnover issues. But as we mentioned in Michael -- to the response to Michael's question, we feel like we're past the peak and we're making headway there.  To your second question, is it profound enough for us to have to concede anything on the pricing front? No, we don't think so. And I think if you look at where a lot of the -- probably with the most acute labor issue was, for us is really around if you look at our residential, and you look at our pricing -- what our pricing strategy has been and what our corporates and yield results were for the quarter and over the last number of quarters, it has not impacted us there or frankly, in any other line of business. Jim Fish : Well, I think it's on the churns. The churn is probably the best metric for us to gauge that. And churn came in at 8.7% for the quarter. We look at the same quarter prior year was 8.8%. We're not seeing an uptake in churn, I think we're doing everything we can at the operating level, there's a lot of pressure on the operation, when you have 500 - ish drivers out due to COVID during the peak or when we've got all of these hiring pressures, you expect that there's going to be some pockets, as John mentioned. And we're doing everything we can to make sure all the way up to my level. I get notes from customers saying, hey, my recycling was missed today, and so I pour that out to the right person to make sure that we pick them. But there have been some pressures, but we think that we're moving in the right direction and it certainly helps when you see that number of 900 employees out for COVID come down to 200. That was a pressure that was hard to compensate for. Sean Eastman : Okay. That's helpful. And what about safety? I mean, do we need to be kind of incrementally concerned about safety and the costs associated with safety issues around this labor dynamic. What's the thought there, Jim? Jim Fish : Well, I should probably let John answer that but the answer would be we never compromise on safety. Safety is at the very top of our list. And so, we are extremely focused on being a safe organization. John, anything to add there? John Morris : Well, I would tell you that's where --that's one spot where technology and to some extent automations are helping. We're in the process of updating all the on-board equipment for our collection vehicles, our supervisory vehicles, with regard to being able to scan what's going on with behavioral issues, so we've got some artificial intelligence has been -- is about 70% through our entire collection fleet. They will help with things like following distance, cell phone usage, that kind of thing.  So no, I think if you look at our safety results, we've seen a little bit of pressure as we have integrated ADS, but the core WM business continues to perform well, and we're well on our way to getting ADS. The ADS business, totally tucked-in there as well. It's part of why we saw a doubling of our training hours because as we're hiring more folks, we absolutely make sure that they get fully trained. And so, we saw that 2x in our training hours, we think that number comes down as we're hiring fewer and fewer drivers and technicians. Sean Eastman : Okay. Very interesting stuff. Thanks for the help guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Thanks for taking the question, and frankly, I know I can do as a reminder not to use my cellphone when I'm off the road, so appreciate that guys. I guess the linkage between potential Capex shortfall in operations is something I'd be interested to learn a bit about. Obviously, the commercial vehicle industry's experiencing production constraints, and that's impacting customer delivery. Just wondering how is this impacting the cost structure? I think you mentioned having utilized some older vehicles, but maybe you can talk through a little bit how that might be translate into elevated [Indiscernible] this year. Devina Rankin : Sure, now. I think the way that we think about that, John mentioned, having to take some of the older vehicles off of the sidelines, so to speak, and pull those into service. We saw that most significantly in the industrial line of business and roll-off, because that's where we were able to flex most significantly in 2020. While we do see it on the operating expense side, our long-term focus continues to be on optimizing our fleet strategies so that we focus on reducing the total cost of ownership of each vehicle. We have seen some pressure in terms of per unit cost on the fleet overall. Some of that general inflationary cost pressures, but some of that is that we're driving towards automation to the points they've made earlier particularly in the residential line of business.  So, while we have a more expensive unit on the street, we definitely see the benefits of that in terms of lower operating expense both from labor and efficiency. So overall in the current quarter, that's a component of the cost pressure that we saw. But I would say that that was certainly secondary to the wage pressures that we experienced overall and we expect that to abate as we get truck deliveries. It's an interesting point that through nine months, we'd only gotten 70% of the trucks that we expected to get in 2021 to date. So, we think that when we get those trucks delivered, you'll start to see some of those impacts reduced as well. Noah Kaye : That's helpful. I guess, on the flip side of that, there is what I presume are industry-wide labor and others shortages to do construction work at landfills for expansion. Presumably that's going to be a source of upward pricing pressure at the landfill. You had 3.5% yield this quarter, but I assume you got a pretty robust pricing outlook at the landfill. And this may be a contributing factor. John Morris : Yes, I think Jim did a good job of categorizing some of that too. I think there's a few places, steel costs, container costs, or [Indiscernible] landfill liner, those are all things that our supply chain team and the respective operating teams are keeping a close eye on. And we may make a decision to a fixed can versus buy-one while steels up 200% or whatever the number is. But that's not the bulk of it. I think Devina spoke to the majority of which is really a fleet spend some of the delays there coupled against strong volume. So that's why you talked about some of this cost pressure being somewhat acute not having confidence whether it's on a collection or the post-collection side, including the transfer of subcontractor side that we're going to be able to recover that. Jim Fish : One thing really quick, Noah, that I would caution against is matching the price increase that we got on third-party volume at the landfill against what might be our cost increase there. That doesn't -- by the way just because we got 3.6% yield, I think was the number. So, 3.5% yield on MSW, that does not imply that that's what our cost increase was at the landfills. Keep in mind a lot of the volume that comes in a landfill is our own volume which gets priced at the curve, which gets priced at the street. So, our overall, we've talked a lot about our overall cost increase. That includes cost increases that we're seeing at the landfills and I wouldn't necessarily assume that just because we got 3.5% on MSW, that that means that's landfill prices are costs are only going up by 3.5%. Noah Kaye : Appreciate that. Thanks, Jim and John. Devina, maybe just one quick one. Any one-time or pull-forward of spending programs that you're currently doing this year that could turn into a margin tailwind next year as you lap, I know that customer service digitalization has been investment focused, but anything you would call out that sort of a margin tailwind next year, that's controllable? Devina Rankin : The only one that we've mentioned over the course this year that's higher and therefore creating some margin compression in 2021, is our incentive compensation. That being said, I think everyone at WM would love to see us knock it out of the park next year such that that's not a giveback in 2022, but it's the one that I would call out. There's not anything else other than inflationary lag that we've already discussed. Noah Kaye : Perfect thanks so much. Jim Fish : Quit texting and driving Noah. Noah Kaye : You got it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Manthey with Baird. David Manthey : Thank you. Good morning. Tagging onto that last question, I believe in the past you've said about 15% of your labor unrelated benefits component of the cost stack is over time. And you noted it was elevated this quarter. Can you give us an idea of how elevated it was relative to that long run average. And then, should we expect that to normalize into next year as COVID settles out and hopefully you get in front of some of these labor issues. John Morris : No David, I think overtime was up about 6% for the quarter. and yes, I do think that as we get some of these folks on board, that we've talked about it from our staffing efforts, you're going to start to see, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, take the most expensive outlaw off the street and right now, because of some of the staffing challenges, but also because we've got volume in the collection lines of business particularly commercial and industrial that really outpaced our expectations. We view that as a good problem to have long-term and the short-term, obviously we're spending a little bit some premium dollars to get that volume collected. Devina Rankin : So, one quick clarification because it's a great point, David, and this 6% increase is actually on a sequential basis when you look at that on a year-over-year basis, it is meaningfully more pronounced. Their year-over-year is about 30% increase in overtime hours that you saw in our costs in the current year. David Manthey : Right. It was down significantly last year, so I guess it would've been up anyway, right? Devina Rankin : That's right. David Manthey : [ inaudible 00 :57:00] up year over year. Devina Rankin : It is up year over year cost and ba -- we were already seeing some of that in the second quarter so the sequential impact is meaningfully lower. David Manthey : Okay. Thank you. And just a dumb mechanical question here. Can you help me understand the mechanism by which higher recycled commodity prices drive your operating expenses higher? Devina Rankin : Sure. In our operating expense table and as you will see what we call a cost of goods sold line. And that cost of goods sold line is where our rebates to our customers show up for the higher commodity prices. We also provide a table in the press release that shows the impact of that on margin and the current quarter that was 140 basis points. So, a very significant impact to the year-over-year comparison David Manthey : Makes sense. Thanks very much for that. Jim Fish : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silver with BMO Capital Market. Jeff Silver : Thanks so much. I know it's late, I will just ask one. Just continuing the conversation about inflationary increases. I'm just wondering from an M&A perspective, are your sellers\u2019 expectations also increasing it, are they're either expecting higher multiple? Or are they talking about adjustments to adjusted EBITDA because it'll be higher cost? Thanks. Jim Fish : I guess anecdotally, what I would say is we have heard that sellers are facing the same [Indiscernible] in the work placing which is -- and we've kind of called it the great resignation and so a lot of them are saying, I've had enough and I'm going to ahead and sell. But I will tell you this in terms of their expectations, I can't control their expectations, what I can control is what I pay. And I would much rather grow organically than pay a multiple of 13 or 14 times. We're going to continue to be disciplined about that. Jeff Silver : Okay. That's great to hear. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jeff Silver : Yes, hi. Good morning. Jim, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned some of the ten percentage points of price increase are needed to cover the higher costs, can you talk about open market price increases that you folks are putting through in October and into year-end? Are you seeing that 10% improvement at the yield line for your open market business based on price increases you're putting through now on what's up Jerry Revich : for renewal? John Morris : Now that 7% to 10% is more of a core price number. I mean, that's the price increase that we're taking. So, in order to get down to yield, you have rollbacks and then there's a mix component in the yield calculation. So, you're not going to see 7% to 10% yield. But we do feel like with -- I mentioned that we've seen 8.7% labor inflation for the quarter. So, in order to cover 8.7% labor inflation and Devina and John talked a lot about the non-labor inflation that we're seeing. We do feel like we've got to take 7% to 10% price increase. So that's what that number is. Devina Rankin : Okay. And I believe it was two quarters ago, maybe you mentioned that you're satisfied with the way the industry has priced rationally so far in this recovery, has that continued, and now that we're seeing this acute period of inflation? Jim Fish : Did I say that? I usually don't comment on the industry because I can't control the industry. But I am satisfied with how it worked, and we do a nice job of looking at not only what our inflation is, and this has been much more accelerated than we anticipated. But also, how do we -- how do we improve margins? And then -- and I think when you look at just about any metric, the one that we've -- we've held out as being a real success story is residential. with residential yield of 5%, it wasn't that long ago that we were talking about residential yield in kind of the 1% range, we feel good about our own lines of business in terms of our own pricing. And that's really the only place that I speak of is what WM is doing. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then in terms of -- on the labor costs topic, obviously labor availability is going to be low for the duration of this economic cycle. So, what gives you comfort that we've reached that point of peak inflation from a training cost standpoint, etc., if labor availability could actually be an escalating issue if we're having this conversation a year from now. John Morris : Well, I think Jerry, we've obviously got in front of the wage adjustments. We started that a couple of quarters ago, really in Q2, and I think that's certainly helped the other benefits we have in place have certainly helped. And I think we're tracking the job openings obviously versus volume. And the good news is the volume is still strong. That does put some pressure on the folks that we need to recruit. But as I mentioned, for the last 4 or 5 months, we're making headway in terms of what we have versus what we need, even relative to that volume. Jim Fish : And I don't think we can overstate it, I've talked about it a number of times, but a lot of conversation of pricing today has been the primary lever. But I don't think we can overstate the importance of using automation to take some of the labor intensity out of this business. It's a very labor-intensive business. We have positions that have very high turnover that does not imply that we're going to come out with a big reduction, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying we can automate some of these roles and then use the attrition to our benefit. Jerry Revich : I appreciate the discussions. Thanks. Jim Fish : Take care. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. I'll keep it short. Just for free cash flow conversion, Devina, when we think about next year, can you just walk through the puts and takes, obviously, CapEx this year is coming a low-end for obvious reasons. There might be some catch-up next year so maybe CapEx of sales higher-than-normal. But maybe you could walk through, we think about next year 2022 the working capital taxes, anything you'd like to highlight, as we're thinking about 2022. Devina Rankin : Yeah. That's great question, Michael, and we're certainly already looking at how then to do it, a 2022 outlook. The strong conversion in 2021, we step back from that and say if we're targeting a conversion of every EBITDA dollar check free cash flow at 50%, we think that that's the outcome that's representative of a long-term trend for our business. We've had success reducing our interest in tax cost, tax as you mentioned, could be a question mark for the year ahead. Too early for us to say one way or the other although we are optimistic based on some of the conversations that are happening currently. The progress that we've made on working capital management has been really strong. That's one where I would tell you it's too early for us to declare victory. We're implementing new systems and processes and those are showing some value. But it's certainly difficult to use that at least above that 50% target. In terms of managing Capex, that really is the one that we're focused on. Because for us, a capital dollar really should be looked at no differently than an M&A dollar.  And if we can get a better return on invested capital from accelerating capital in our recycling business or renewable energy facilities, we're going to do that, and so while we're going to look for opportunities to accelerate capital, we're going to do so in the same prudent way that we always do from a capital allocation perspective. And look at long-term maintenance capital versus what we will consider more of a growth-oriented or investment-oriented capital decision. So that's the one place that there could be an evolution in our discussion in 2022, but no specific outlook that we can provide at this point, we'll give you more color next quarter. Michael Feniger : That makes sense. And since you mentioned 2022, when I look at the midpoint of your 2021 guide, implies a margin of 28.3%, around there. That's kind of the fourth straight year of being in that margin range. Now, granted one of those years was in a pandemic, so that's impressive and now we're contending with inflation. So, I know this has been asked a couple of different ways, but do we think that the margin, the typical margin expansion we see in this business, 50 bps or so. Is that more of like a 2023 story, as we're kind of in the odd period of coming out of COVID and deal with some of these inflationary pressures? Devina Rankin : What's really interesting in that same three-year period that you mentioned is the impact of recycling on our margin. And I think if you stripped out a way and really consider the inflationary cost impact and the COVID impacts that we've already discussed. You are seeing strong execution on the front line of delivering that 50 basis points of margin expansion. That's why we really wanted to add the color on commodity price impact in the press release, so hopefully you can take a look at that table.  But I do think that, when we look at the collection efficiency at all of these training impacts, we've been really satisfied with the continued front-line execution of the team in delivering margin expansion though it is covered up. So, we have positive expectations for 2022 at this point though there is going to be some continued noise from the recycling part of the business. Michael Feniger : Great. Thank you. Jim Fish : Thanks Michael. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Mr. Jim Fish, President and CEO. Jim Fish : Well, just to conclude, thank you to -- again, big shout out to all of our 50,000 folks for the great quarter. This has been a challenging year and a-half challenging two years for everyone, but particularly for them who have been providing essential service on the frontline since day one. So, thank you to them. Thank you to all you for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you through the quarter and early in next year. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James Fish : All right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. 2021 was another very successful year at WM. Our strong operational and financial performance continued throughout 2021, delivering full year results that achieved or exceeded our financial guidance, which we increased from our original expectations twice during the year. We also successfully integrated the Advanced Disposal operations, generating synergies that have already exceeded our initial expectations with further synergies to come. During 2021, we focused on driving disciplined organic revenue growth, advancing technology investments focused on customer retention and growth and cultivating our people-first culture. Execution on these priorities came together to produce record growth in full year adjusted operating EBITDA and cash from operations. It can't be overstated how impressive it is that we generated more than $5 billion of operating EBITDA in a year like 2021. This robust operating EBITDA translated into all-time high cash from operations of over $4 billion, which allowed us to return a record $2.3 billion to our shareholders. Contributing to our operating EBITDA was our pricing where we finished 2021 on a very strong note as we made steady progress on covering the cost inflation in our business with excellent core price results across all lines of business. John will provide more details here, but we had record core price in both our landfill and residential businesses, 2 areas we've been particularly focused on over the last couple of years. Strong core price translated into the best collection and disposal yield that we've seen in more than a decade. Another great story about our pricing efforts is that we're still seeing strong volume growth and improvements in churn. 2021 churn of 8.4% is an all-time low. As 2022 kicks off, we're fully focused on recovering inflationary cost increases through our pricing programs and through the aggressive management of our cost structure. Our revenue management team is hard at work executing on the 2022 pricing plans so that we can recover the inflationary cost pressures in our business and deliver another successful year. In fact, we've recently seen several large customers who have historically been very price-sensitive, renew at significant increases. On the cost front, a big part of that management of our cost structure will be to materially improve our labor efficiency through the application of the technology investments we made over the last 18 months. Our expectation is to attrit between 5,000 and 7,000 positions over the next 4 years without replacements as these positions have become difficult to source and we expect that will continue to be the case. At the same time, we continue to focus on providing the best workplace for our employees and leveraging our asset network for growth. Regarding our 2022 financial outlook, Devina will provide more details. But at a high level, we expect to deliver total company revenue growth of approximately 6%, driving operating EBITDA growth of approximately 7% in 2022. It's fair to point out that both our revenue and our operating EBITDA guidance are at or above the high end of the ranges we targeted for the long term at our Investor Day in 2019. We expect margin expansion in the second half of the year with full year operating EBITDA margins expected to be flat to up 40 basis points compared to 2021. This sets us up for another year of robust cash generation. The extraordinary cash generation of our business positions us to plan a 13% increase in our 2022 dividend rate, while at the same time, making substantial increased investments in high-return renewable energy and recycling projects. Tara Hemmer was appointed as our Chief Sustainability Officer last summer, and she's charting a path to an aggressive long-term growth for our sustainability businesses. In light of our very strong cash generation, we plan to invest approximately $275 million in 2022 to expand our network of renewable natural gas plants with incremental investments in 2023 through 2025 totaling approximately $550 million. We expect to build 17 RNG plants over the next 4 years, which would grow our RNG generation by 6x. With conservative assumptions, these projects are expected to generate operating -- annual operating EBITDA run rate operating EBITDA of more than $400 million by 2026. And at today's higher prices, that operating EBITDA more than doubles. In the recycling business, we expect to invest $275 million in 2022 in MRF technology with incremental investments in 2023 through 2025 totaling approximately $525 million. These investments accelerate our automation of recycling process, processing to reduce costs, improve product quality as well as expand our single-stream recycling footprint. Together, these projects are expected to generate annual run rate incremental operating EBITDA of approximately $180 million by 2026, assuming $125 per ton blended commodity price. These growth projects further WM's sustainability leadership by increasing the renewable energy generated from our landfill network, expanding single-stream recycling capacity and automating recycling processing to reduce costs and improve product quality. They also are expected to generate excellent returns that are superior to those of solid waste acquisitions. In closing, we delivered a fantastic year in 2021, overcoming the challenges the year presented. As we look ahead to 2022, we remain committed to advancing technology investments that differentiate us, automating our processes to reduce our cost to serve and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Our success would not have been possible without the best employees in the business and I want to thank all 50,000 of our team members for their contributions.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss in more detail our operational results. John Morris : Thanks, Jim. Hey, good morning, everyone. Our team finished 2021 strong with fourth quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business of 6.5%. Our fourth quarter core price of 6.7% in the commercial line of business and 5.2% in our landfills clearly demonstrate continued discipline and pricing momentum. These strong fourth quarter pricing results were the leading contributors to robust collection and disposal core price of 4.8% for the full year. 2021 yield was also strong at 3.5% and reflects an improvement in rollbacks of almost 500 basis points as well as continued improvement in customer churn. As we move into 2022, our revenue management teams are focused on continuing to recover inflationary cost increases, improving residential profitability and remaining disciplined on disposal pricing. With the strong momentum we have entering 2022, coupled with our team's continued diligence, we expect to deliver core price of more than 5.5% and yield approaching 4%. Shifting to volumes. Fourth quarter collection and disposal volume grew 2.8%. For the full year, our collection and disposal volumes grew 3% and service increases outpaced service decreases nearly twofold. Organic growth trends in the first few weeks of 2022 have been encouraging even as some parts of the U.S. and Canada have seen spikes in Omicron cases during January. Commercial yards are tracking above 2021 levels. And while industrial hauls are modestly below last year, we see that as mostly due to weather disruptions in a few areas across the country. Overall, we expect 2022 collection and disposal volumes to grow about 2%, with commercial collection and MSW landfill volumes as leading contributors. Turning to operating costs. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 63% with commodity-driven impacts from recycling brokerage rebates and fuel totaling 100 basis points. The remaining increase was related to higher labor costs as overtime increased due to the highest number of COVID-related absences we have seen as well as some risk management costs. During the fourth quarter, our teams remain focused on controlling operating costs. And while the impacts of inflation and the tight labor market continue to put pressure on our metrics, there are positive trends in the fourth quarter results that position us well to deliver on our 2022 plan. Maintenance expenses improved sequentially as our continued efforts to standardize maintenance processes, particularly in our ADS locations, is reducing downtime and improving fleet availability. We also saw efficiency, net of incremental training hours, improving all lines of business. We expect these efficiency gains to continue and overtime hours to improve as our teams are taking intentional steps to improve retention, and we see that making an impact as annualized driver turnover has improved every month since August. We estimate that our focus on operating efficiencies and productivity helped to moderate the impact of inflationary cost pressure by about 60 basis points versus the third quarter. So putting it all together, when you combine our pricing efforts with our progress on cost containment, we expect operating expense as a percentage of revenue to improve by the second half of 2022. Our collection and disposal business is well positioned to deliver great results in 2022 and so are our recycling and renewable energy businesses. As Jim discussed, our sustainability businesses are central to our growth strategy, and we're pleased with the strong results we're achieving in both the recycling and renewable energy businesses. In recycling, each quarter of 2021 earned a spot among our 5 most profitable quarters of all time, and we're anticipating an equally strong year in 2022. Our current outlook for 2022 is based on an average blended commodity price of $125 per ton, which is modestly above current values of $115 per ton. And similarly, renewable energy business delivered a very strong 2021 results and is expected to match this earnings contribution in 2022 as 2 additional renewable natural gas plants come online. We expect our fifth plant to be operational early in the second quarter and the sixth plant to be online by the end of the year. Our 2022 outlook is based on a RINs price of about $3, which is slightly above our 2021 rate but below current RINs pricing. And finally, our integration of Advanced Disposal continues to go smoothly as we marked the first anniversary of the acquisition at the end of October. To date, we have combined virtually all the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems. And with $36 million of synergies captured during the fourth quarter, we exited 2021 on track to exceed our expectations for full run rate cost and capital synergies of $150 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for their focus on safely and reliably servicing our customers. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations, and I know that this will continue in the year ahead.  I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2021 financial results and 2022 financial outlook in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning. Our teams worked tirelessly this year to provide essential services to our customers and communities, and we're proud of the results we accomplished together. 2021 operating EBITDA growth of 16.5% was achieved by accelerating collection and disposal core price, capturing robust commercial collection and landfill volume growth, successfully integrating the ADS business and delivering record-high recycling profitability. Controlling our discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the cost of our sales and back office functions also contributed to the strong EBITDA growth in 2021. In the fourth quarter, SG&A was $481 million or 10.3% of revenue. Our fourth quarter SG&A costs came in higher than our run rate due to the timing of some of our technology- and sustainability-oriented investments. 2021 SG&A was 10% of revenue. That's a 20 basis point improvement over 2020. Over the long term, we target SG&A as a percentage of revenue below 10%, so we're pleased to be nearing that target so quickly after the ADS acquisition. In 2021, we captured SG&A synergies from the acquisition ahead of schedule and started to realize the benefits of our technology investments, particularly by optimizing our sales coverage model, growing our digital sales channel and streamlining the customer setup process. We're confident that our technology investments will continue to deliver value as we differentiate WM and reduce our cost to serve, both on the operating cost and SG&A lines. Fourth quarter capital spending was $774 million, which is above the expectations we had last quarter as we were able to opportunistically accelerate investments in recycling and renewable energy at the end of the year. While we continue to see supply chain constraints, slow delivery schedules and some important traditional solid waste asset categories, we worked diligently to close the year with strong momentum on capital investment to support growing volumes, particularly in our landfill line of business. Growth in both cash flow from operations and free cash flow were particularly strong in 2021. At $4.34 billion, cash flow from operations increased 27.5%, and when excluding the onetime benefit from the required divestitures related to the ADS transaction, our free cash flow grew over 28.5% in 2021 to $2.53 billion. Over the course of the last year, we returned a record $2.32 billion to shareholders, a $970 million in dividends and repurchasing $1.35 billion of our stock. We accomplished all of this while achieving our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75x, demonstrating that we are well positioned for future growth. Moving to our 2022 financial outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate organic growth in the collection and disposal business of about 6%, which is the high end of our long-term growth target. This revenue growth outlook drives our 2022 operating EBITDA guidance of $5.325 billion to $5.425 billion, and that represents almost a 7% increase in operating EBITDA at the midpoint. As Jim discussed, we are well positioned to allocate our cash both to growing shareholder returns and to increasing growth capital investments in our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Setting aside the planned growth investments and focusing on the capital expenditures we plan to invest in the normal course of business, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion in 2022. Free cash flow, excluding these sustainability growth investments, is projected to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. We expect to make approximately $550 million of growth investments in recycling and renewable natural gas projects in the coming year. While these investments will be reported as a component of our capital expenditures and therefore reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow, we see these investments to be similar to an acquisition dollar as they will produce high-return growth as a strong complement to our existing business. When considering these growth investments, free cash flow is expected to be between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion in 2022. This free cash flow outlook anticipates an increase in cash interest and taxes of $75 million to $125 million and a modest improvement in working capital. Our long-standing commitment to a strong balance sheet and consistent and disciplined allocation of available cash towards growth and shareholder returns continues. Our 2020 priorities will be to invest in the business, grow the dividend, fund tuck-in acquisitions with strong returns and buy back shares. Given the Board of Directors' approval of a 13% increase in the 2022 dividend rate, we expect dividend payments to total about $1.075 billion in the year ahead. We also expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2022 as the Board recently provided authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our stock. While our guidance does not specifically include acquisition growth, we will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing the right deals at the right price. In closing, we are proud of what we achieved in 2021, and we're excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for 2022 and future years. Our team is hard at work so that we can deliver on our commitments to our customers, communities, the environment and shareholders.  With that, Faith, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Lots of places fruitful for questions, but I guess we should start with the announcement around the increased investments in sustainability. And specifically, I'd like to understand how you're approaching the economics on a long-term basis of these RNG investments. It seems like there is an awful lot of upside and downside in having the economics fairly exposed to the prices of RINs. And given the scale of the investment that you're contemplating and having the exposure through the EBITDA of those RIN prices, how are you thinking about potentially derisking that over time? It does seem like there's a market for long-term contracts in RNG. And while that would significantly haircut potentially the RNG EBITDA versus what you projected, you'd be getting more certainty. So I guess at a high level, how should we be thinking about that and how it impacts the predictability of earnings for the company? Devina Rankin : So Noah, I'll start with some comments about how we approach the volatility and then I'll turn things over to Jim so that he can cover the strategic overview with regard to how we're thinking about this portfolio. In the renewable energy space, we currently and expect to continue to manage the volatility by looking both at the very short-term market-driven prices and then long term, those attractive long-term contracts that you mentioned. So we participate on both ends of the spectrum and I would say almost anywhere in between, and we'll continue to assess what's best in order to both reduce volatility but then also optimize the returns of the portfolio and what you can see outlined in the press release that we provided. We're really happy with the return profile and the payback period when you see a 3-year payback period at the conservative levels that we've assumed. That indicates that even with the incremental volatility, we know the returns outpaced the solid waste acquisition returns that we've discussed. James Fish : Yes. And I think just to add to that on the strategic side, Noah, I think there really isn't -- I guess I'll say it this. We have 4 critical capabilities that nobody else has that enable us to really have confidence in these investments. Devina talked about how we mitigate risk. But as we think about them strategically, we have a team that's been doing this since 2015, and they know how to scale these plants across the whole portfolio. We have an asset that nobody else has, which is the amount of gas that we own. Nobody else can bring that to the table. We have the biggest CNG fleet in North America, and that enables us to fully close the loop and leverage the fleet to monetize the RNG. And then lastly, we've got the balance sheet. So if you look at all 4 of those, this made a ton of sense for us to accelerate investments in 2022 out through 2025. I don't think anybody expects that over the next 3 years that we're going to see significant downside in RINs pricing or, for that matter, natural gas pricing. But if there is, we built in pretty conservative estimates and still come up with these very strong returns that Devina referenced. Noah Kaye : That's very helpful. And then my second question is just around labor or really around people. You've talked for many years about really making Waste Management an employer of choice not just in the waste management industry but amongst all companies. And now that you're really embarking on a program of attrition and automation and increased efficiency, I guess, how do you approach the challenge at the same time of remaining that employer of choice and continuing to make positions at Waste Management attractive to an increasingly constrained labor force? James Fish : I think you used the right word there, which is attrition. I mean, we're not talking about announcing a big layoff next week. We're talking about using high turnover. This whole Great Resignation as we've heard, we've been talking about that for a while now. And you've heard me talk about my daughter saying in her high school class, nobody wants to drive a truck or operate a piece of heavy equipment. So this is not something that just came to us in the last 3 months. We've been focused on it for a while. We built out those 3 single-stream plants, which we've discussed at length, and those have provided a significant labor benefit to us. So as we started thinking about it more, we saw other buckets of opportunity. When we look at moving, for example, from traditional rear load, we have call it, 3,000 rear load trucks available to shift to ASL. And those rear loaders probably driven more by safety than anything else so it's a safer vehicle at ASL, but there's a labor opportunity there in a category that's very difficult to fill, particularly in today's world. I mean, it's hard to get somebody to ride on the back of a truck and throw trash. So we've got some categories here where we feel like we can really use attrition to our benefit, become much more productive from a labor standpoint. And it's part of why I've maybe never been more optimistic than I am today, coming off of 2 pretty rough years, maybe as rough as any of us have seen in our lifetime and all of a sudden looking at a '22 where we can really start to leverage those investments we've made in technology in those buckets where we have transactional type jobs that are really hard to fill. I don't think this affects what we've tried to do with the culture. The culture is still absolutely being a great place to work. We've done a tremendous amount of benefits, offering to pay for college education for dependents, which I don't think any other company out there does. So we still feel very good about the fact that this is a great place to work. But where we have high turnover, let's take advantage of it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Jim, I'm wondering if you could just expand on the offtake part of the conversation. You just had 22 million MMBtu of gas is going to come online. How much of that do you anticipate going into transportation applications where it will be eligible for RIN 3 credits? And how deep are your conversations with industrial gas customers that won't be using RIN 3 credits? Can you just talk about how that market is evolving and how deep that market might be at this point? James Fish : Might be giving me more credit here on a pretty technical question. I guess I would tell you that -- and I'm not going to give you a very technical answer because I just don't have the expertise. But -- and we can definitely get you an answer on that. But if we look at the -- the 1 thing that I mentioned was our fleet and having that fleet that's 70 -- over 70% of our routed fleet is now natural gas. That number came down a bit when we bought ADS, but we continue to buy 90% of the trucks each year as natural gas trucks. So it does give us a chance to sell those credits and fully close the loop but also paints a nice sustainability picture for us that Tara and the entire WM team are able to leverage. I'm not sure I can answer the more technical aspects of your question there, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then if we could just pivot and talk about the yield outlook, so nice to see the acceleration for '22. I'm wondering, can you talk about how you expect the cadence to play out? On the last call, you spoke about bigger commercial and industrial price increases coming once we annualize. So does that mean we should look for yield to accelerate as we head through the course of '22, so exit rate higher than 4%? Can you just put a finer point on how you expect that dynamic to play out? James Fish : I think if you look at the year-over-year comps, the comps will certainly be easier purely from a price standpoint in Q1 and Q2. And then we started to kind of get our sea legs a little bit in Q3 and Q4. As we saw inflation, I would tell you that, that inflation that we started to see in Q3 did catch, I think, the entire world off-guard. But nobody expected coming into the year that we'd have 40-year high inflation. So Q3 was playing a bit of catch-up. Q4, we started to really catch up. But there is a lag in terms of how much pricing we can get to cover inflation. And honestly, we probably will be happy just to get to a point where we cover that cost. That's why the labor aspect is so important because we're attempting to raise margins here and add EBITDA dollars. And I'm not sure we do that purely through pricing. In fact, I would argue that pricing, we think, can be the primary offset to inflation. But in terms of adding EBIT dollars and adding margin points, we think the labor piece is a critical aspect of that.  To kind of talk about where it goes for the rest of the year, I mean, I would tell you that -- and I think John and I both talked about it in our prepared remarks, but the fact that we're seeing landfill pricing, and I gave an example of a couple of disposal customers that took pretty substantial price increases, who previously had been very, very price sensitive. And I think they -- that told us that they understood they're seeing inflation in their system. And so we needed to take significant price increases on those big landfill customers. John has talked about residential for a long time, and we're finally starting to see that residential is showing vast improvements on the price front. So I'm happy that we're seeing this across all lines of business. To me, that is maybe the best sign in terms of pricing is that we're seeing this not just in the commercial line of business but we're seeing it across all lines of business and all waste streams. Our special waste, if we look at our special waste and we look at just our baseline, we were up 7.9%, I think, was in our base business, pricing in special waste. And that doesn't really go into our yield number because it tends to be work, but that's a big increase. So we're happy with the progress we're making on price. I don't know that, that really spells out where we're going to be each quarter. Suffice it to say we're going to have easier comps in Q1 and Q2, though. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Tyler Brown : So it looks like margins fell about 140 basis points year-over-year here in Q4. Any way that you could kind of unpack some of the moving pieces? I mean, I think ADS closed in late October, as John mentioned, so that impact seemed to be maybe watered down a bit on a year-over-year basis. And I would think that commodities were a help. Can you just talk about what was really working hard against you? Devina Rankin : Yes, sure. So commodities actually worked against us in the fourth quarter by 100 basis points, which is what John remarked to in his prepared remarks. So that's the recycling brokerage part of our business as well as fuel. And we expect that both of those impacts would continue into the first half of 2022. When I look at the remaining components of the fourth quarter, there were about 90 basis points of impact to margin in the quarter that aren't representative of our run rate. And so that's what gives us confidence in our outlook for the 28.1% to 28.5% EBITDA margin in the year ahead. Achieving 28.1% EBITDA margin in this year, integrating the ADS business and having the significant cost inflation that we had in the second half, we're really pleased with. We know that we have additional margin expansion opportunities, particularly with ADS synergy realization that ramped in the back half of the year. So we'll see that continue into 2022. We had some incentive compensation headwinds on a year-over-year basis. Those actually, on a year-over-year basis, were more significant than we expect to be in the way of rollover benefit in 2022. That rollover benefit could be as much as 40 basis points next year. So all in all, what I would tell you with respect to margin, when we compare WM's margin to industry margins, finishing this year at about 30% is a real accomplishment because that's been a target that we've all talked about for a long time. And using both recycling brokerage and the impacts of accretion that are adjustments for the rest of the space, we came in at exactly 30% for the full year and 28.9% for the quarter. James Fish : Tyler, I know you asked a margin question, but I have to say, I guess time will tell whether investors are as optimistic as we are about this. But I got to tell you, I mean, 2021, I mean, I don't need to tell you what it looked like. But at no point in our lives that we've seen in 2021 where we're having hand-to-hand combat with a pandemic and, at the same time, seeing 40-year inflation. And with that, we still raised guidance twice and -- but for a couple of kind of one-timer type expenses, would have finished in the middle of -- almost in the middle of the range for that EBITDA guidance. I was actually stunned that we were able to work our way through 2021.  And then when we look at 2022, looking at our guidance, you remember the Investor Day in 2019 and that's why we referenced it. But putting guidance out there that's at the top end of that range, by the way, if you remember that presentation, we had 3% to 4% inflation in that 2019 presentation when we said that the range would be 5% to 7% for EBITDA, long-term range, and we're coming out with guidance at 7%. And that's off of a -- also the baseline that we raised twice in a kind of a crappy year in 2021. So that's why we're as optimistic as we are, and we'll see whether the market feels the same way. Tyler Brown : Yes. No, no, definitely strong. But just going back to, again, kind of not to harp on margins, but you talked about them -- it sounded like you were maybe implying contraction in the first half and then expansion in the back. But just for our modeling and so that we can kind of get the quarterly flow right, I mean, should we think something like down 100 basis points in the first half and then up maybe more than that year-on-year in the back half? Or just any color there? Devina Rankin : Yes, Tyler. So if you look at the year-over-year comps, Q2 of 2021, in particular, is a really tough comparison because that quarter, we had 29.3% margin. So what you outlined just now is exactly what our projections are. We'll be down about 100 basis points in margin on a year-over-year basis in the first half of 2022 and up 100 basis points to 140 basis points in the back half of the year. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay, so a great jumping off point to '23. Okay. And then just my last 1 here. On the recycling side, Jim, so the $800 million spend, how much of that is for automation versus new MRFs? And to be clear, the $180 million EBITDA uplift, so $60 million to $70 million of that is from labor savings, is that right? And the other $120 million to $130 million is just from increased material flow? James Fish : Yes, it might be a little bit more on labor. I don't know. We just had this meeting the other day where we talked about how much of this is going to be new plants versus rebuilds. Both of them have really high payback really or really low payback period, really high returns. So they're both great investments. And -- we're -- the good thing is we're not really constrained on -- in terms of cash. So we can probably -- it's less about either/or and more about and. We just want to make sure that we're as on those new markets, we're picking the right markets. I know Brent Bell and his team are looking closely at that. And then with respect to the labor savings, the number that we're giving is -- that we've talked about is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,200 positions over about a 4-year period. So if you kind of take the high end of that and you call it, I don't know, let's say, $75,000 all in, and keep in mind, some of these are -- a lot of these are temps, so we get charged a different number than they actually make. So let's say, $75,000 all in, that may or may not be the right number, but you can use that kind of to do the math. And that's probably where most of these [5 to 7] are. We're not talking about $200,000 jobs here. But the high turnover, the high attrition that we see in those jobs really, I think, is -- makes this the absolute right move to move away from those, particularly in a time where we have such a hard time filling those positions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Kevin Chiang : If I could just maybe ask the investments you're making in these high-growth areas. It looks like your renewable energy projects will generate roughly double the returns of recycling. So just wondering, what are the gating factors that wouldn't have you accelerate investments in renewable over recycling? If I just think of $1.01 giving you double the return of the other? James Fish : I think we've given a lot of thoughts on this. I think the cadence that we've laid out internally is the right one. I think we mentioned 17 plants and that's a lot. So these things are complex. There is -- there are some questions, I guess, around supply chain and how much does that lengthen the amount of time that's necessary to build out these plants? But the acceleration, we think, is absolutely appropriate for all the reasons that we mentioned. Do we accelerate it further? I don't know that we do. I think we're -- I think we have the right amount of plants planned in the right places. We've looked at where the right places would be, what landfills will be feeding them, all of that. But I'm comfortable with the plan that we've laid out. Devina Rankin : And I think what's important is that the teams that are working on this are independent and not constrained by 1 another, right? So we're able to work on both things in parallel and move 2 really important parts of our business forward simultaneously. And they each have great returns and returns greater than we're even seeing on some of our core solid waste acquisitions, which makes us really confident in making these investments at the same time. James Fish : But Devina, adding $400 million in EBITDA. I mean, and we've talked a lot about that, and that is at these for very conservative numbers. So $400 million EBITDA for the existing plants plus those 17 new plants is a lot. And that's why I mentioned in my remarks that, look, if you extrapolate it out at today's natural gas and RINs pricing, it's not $400 million, it's north of $800 million. So I think the amount of plants that we've planned is appropriate. Kevin Chiang : No, that's a fair point. The returns across all these projects seem to be very high. Maybe sticking on this topic. If I look at your free cash flow guide, including the spend just over $2 billion, Devina, you talked about targeting just over $1 billion on dividends. You did renew the buyback for up to $1.5 billion. If I put that all together, does that suggest something about the M&A pipeline, that maybe you're seeing either a deceleration in opportunities or maybe the regulatory environment and the DOJ just make it tougher for you to maybe execute on deals or the time line of those deals get pushed out? Just is that something we that we should be reading into based on some of these investments you're making? Devina Rankin : Yes. I would tell you that we're certainly not taking our eye off the ball or the amount of focus that we have as an organization away from core solid waste acquisitions. And we're not seeing significant constraints with respect to DOJ pressure or anything like that outside of what we discussed when we were closing the ADS transaction. For us during the integration of ADS, that was the top priority organization, particularly in that part of the country. And for us, that was over half of the areas that we oversee. And so it was really important for us to make that priority #1 from an M&A perspective. The team is definitely looking at the landscape and participating in conversations. As you see some of the smaller players make decisions, we've always talked about the driving forces in their decisions. And this tight labor market has certainly been an accelerant for them. And so we're part of those conversations, still focused on that. We are going to remain disciplined in terms of return. And so buying at the right price is what will be important for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Hey, Houston, I hope things are good down there. Can we go back to RINs for a second? Are you taking 100% ownership of the 17 or are you partnering? James Fish : At this point, the plan is 100% ownership of the 17. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. And you can't do a financial hedge on RINs yet? Maybe somebody will figure out how to create that. But in lieu of that, are there other creative ways to develop a hedging approach to the RIN? Because everybody has been alluding to, are you trading 1 volatility for another having fixed recycling to this. So what's the opportunity there? Devina Rankin : The opportunity there really is on those long-term contracts that I mentioned earlier, and we continue to work very diligently in that space and have had some good success. And we looked for those long-term contracts to be an appropriate balance to market exposure, so that we do have an appropriate level of volatility without giving up too much of the upside potential. Michael Hoffman : How long is long? Devina Rankin : Some of them have been more than 10 years and less. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Jim, what's your Washington, D.C. staff telling you about EPA and the messaging they have around the RFS and the RVO? Because that's the greatest point of volatility. If they move that around wrong, that crushes the demand side and you can't control that. So what are they telling you? James Fish : I think our -- the good news is that they have their finger on the pulse up there. It's just the pulse seems to be a little bit erratic, I guess. I would tell you that areas like CCRs, I mean, coal combustion residuals, which have been discussed within the EPA longer than some of the other items. That is an area that we really see the opportunity starting to develop. And we like -- the pipeline is kind of 40 million-ish tons over $1 billion for us in the next 4 years. And then things like PFAS. PFAS is -- we've always talked about that as an opportunity for ourselves. But there's a lot that is being discussed. I'm not sure we've seen the full consensus maybe is the best way to put it on a lot of those topics, with the exception maybe of ash and some of those have been talked about longer. John Morris : I think, Michael, the other thing we're watching is a small refinery exemption, right, because that's also been part of what's in that market. And there's been some commentary there. There's nothing decided yet, but to the extent that, that they extinguish some of the exemption there, I think that obviously bodes well. Michael Hoffman : Well, and the good news is in December, EPA set an outlook for '22 and '23 that seem to recognize, don't compromise whatever you do with the exemptions by setting too many -- [the numbers too]. That seems to send a good signal for at least the next 2 years. If we could shift to price, what's the early reaction to the 5.5 average core price? A year ago at this time, the customer was taking more price, and we ended up with a better outlook on price. What's the current early reaction to the 5.5? James Fish : I think the -- probably the best indicator would be in our churn numbers. I mean -- and I mentioned the churn was at an all-time low there. So I think the reaction is that people understand that inflation is real, that it's out there in the economy and that we're being judicious about how we apply it, but we're attempting to recover our costs. And look, that's been no easy task. We've seen a pretty heavy hit from labor inflation, particularly in Q3. That started to come back down the north a little bit in Q4, just simply because we've taken a lot of those adjustments already. But I think, John, the number was almost $100 million in adjustments for 2021. John Morris : Yes, slightly over. James Fish : Yes. So I think the reaction has been reasonably accepting, Michael. John Morris : I would add, Michael, too, that our most labor-intensive line of business, Jim talked to the automation benefits and the path we're pinning down with regard to residential. But you've seen the sequential improvement in residential core price and yield. You've also seen some of the volume degradation. We're going to continue to be selective there, especially in this kind of labor environment, which we don't see as short term. So we look at that price and labor trade-off as good for the shareholders. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And so if I then look at the volume side, would you say you're still seeing new business growth helping that? Or is this still mostly service interval upgrades of existing? James Fish : I think it's some of both, right? John talks a lot about service increases versus decreases. There's -- I think it's almost like by a factor of 2 higher on service increases. So it's a bit of both, Michael. I mean, I mentioned probably the most forward-looking volume that we have, the revenue stream that we have would be in special waste. And I think what that portends for the economy is a good -- is that we don't see a big downturn in the economy coming even with the inflationary pressures. Our special waste pipeline looks really good. Our special waste in Q4 was really strong. And so the only areas that we saw that were weak were really driven by difficult year-over-year comps. I mean, roll-off volume was flat. But it was not because we're -- it wasn't something for us to be concerned about simply because 2020 had a lot of fire volume in Northern California and also a lot of -- you remember the late hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast last year. And so there was a lot of volume from that. So without that, we would have seen a much more positive number in roll-offs. I think volume looks to be a bit of both of those, still kind of an emergence from COVID and which is kind of the service increase, service decrease piece, but also growth of the overall economy. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then to clarify the M&A question, how would you frame the corporate development pipeline? Is it busy? And is it a reasonable -- you're not modeling this, but is it reasonable to think that you can participate in the ongoing consolidation at 1% or 2% rev growth, which is a little less than the underlying organic growth of the industry? James Fish : I think we'll always focus on -- we'll always have our eye on M&A. And where there's opportunities, we'll try and take advantage of those. But at the same time, we don't want to overpay for these so we're careful there. But it doesn't look like the M&A landscape has changed that significantly. But we just felt like, as we looked at somewhat of a capital allocation decision here with respect to these big incremental investments in renewable natural gas and in recycling, that the returns on those were better than the returns for solid waste acquisitions. And while the cash generation of the business has been tremendous, it's not an infinite bucket. It's a finite bucket. And so therefore, we feel like we will invest more heavily there. But again, with M&A, to the extent that an opportunity arises and we feel like it builds a gap, we'll explore it. Devina Rankin : And then, Michael, on -- from a planning perspective, our 2022 guide does not include any rollover benefit from M&A. The solid waste acquisitions were only about $40 million in 2021 and divestitures actually had a larger impact. So from an outlook perspective, the '22 guide doesn't contemplate anything from acquisition contribution. James Fish : I mean, that's a great point, Devina, because when I -- I've talked about that 7% EBITDA growth number at the high end of that long-term range. But that is almost 100% organic. I mean, we're not talking about a big rollover from acquisitions. We had very little in the way of acquisitions, solid waste type acquisitions in 2021. So that 7% is in the face of still pretty significant inflation, but it's at the high end of that range, which is why we're talking about it. Michael Hoffman : So you've mentioned 2019 several times. The world's changed a lot since 2019. Do the assumptions need to be revisited? James Fish : Well, we'll see. I mean, you might argue that the assumptions need to come down after the last 2 years. But yes, I mean, at Investor Day in 2019, we talked about what the world has been for the last 3 or 4 years, 4 or 5 years even, and which was pretty low inflation. So we built low inflation into those EBITDA and revenue ranges. We may decide after 2022 or 2023 that the world has changed sufficiently enough to have another Investor Day and to talk about different ranges. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Last 1 for me. John, you've been focused diligently for a couple of years now improving the resi margins. What's left? Is there much left or are you pretty much done that and now it's just maintaining? John Morris : We're not done, Michael. I mean, I think when you think about this labor environment, right, from where we started to talk about the world changing a lot, well, the labor world has changed a good bit. We talked about that in our prepared remarks and a bunch of the question-and-answer period. So I would tell you that the goal line there has moved a little bit, right? The rate -- the labor intensity of that business is higher than the others. We still have automation opportunities there, and the margins there are still not competing with commercial and industrial. So as much as we've made terrific progress, we've seen some additional pressure, especially in the back half of the year on wages inflation, if you think about the impact of Omicron in Q4, I mean, all those things, I think we still have a good bit of opportunity there. Operator : Your next question is from Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : I wanted to go back on -- you talked a little bit about in terms of the special waste pipeline. But I just wanted to take a step back and talk more broadly about the economy at a high level and what you guys have seen. Obviously, a lot going on with the market but housing is doing well, while maybe consumer sentiment spending is weakening. Maybe just any notable details that you could point to at a high level how it impacts your business, given that you have exposure throughout the broader economy. James Fish : So Kyle, I think the challenges that we're looking at in 2022 are largely going to be inflation and maybe, to a lesser degree, this labor challenge that it feels like a long-term challenge and hence, the need to really become more productive from a labor standpoint and then the 5,000 to 7,000 positions that will attrit away from the business that we plan to replace the technology. By the way, what I didn't mention is we saw some add in 2021. We've talked a lot about these investments we've made in customer service digitalization. And so in 2021, as maybe somewhat of a test case, we fully automated our customer setup function. It was not a huge number of jobs. It was maybe 200 jobs, so about $7 million in savings. We did something similar with some of our -- we call it sales optimization. So we've gone through a piece of it and then, of course, some of what we saw with recycling. We've gone through a piece of it. But I would tell you that in general, we see and we hope to see 2022 be a much quieter year than the last 2. Hard to be no easier than the last 2, I guess. Kyle White : Yes, we'll see. Time will tell. In terms of the rise of Omicron late in the quarter and into January, did you see any impact on your volumes from this? I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned maybe, I think Canada, I know it's a small exposure, but just any impact from the rise in Omicron? John Morris : Matt, it was -- yes, it was really spotty. I mean, it wasn't -- it was more of an impact on our overtime and our ability to service our customers. There were a few pockets. You referenced Canada, where it's been a little bit of a unique circumstance up there in eastern Canada. A little bit of volume impact there but generally speaking, no. James Fish : We did see -- we talked about the fact that we had as many -- I think the number we gave was 800 employees in Q3 at the peak who are out with either the virus or some exposure. And so therefore, they were quarantined, so 800 out of 50,000. Omicron, fortunately, it seems less serious but definitely more contagious. And so -- and that showed up in our numbers. The peak was 1,500, and probably John, half of those were drivers. John Morris : More than half. James Fish : More than half. So if there was any good news about it, it was that it happened in kind of December, January, which are slow volume months for us as opposed to the peak from Delta, which was in August, and early September, and those are our peak months for us in terms of volume. But right now, we're seeing those numbers come back down pretty dramatically. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : My first question -- and I know you touched on the margin side, but I just had a follow-up on just operating leverage. As you had said, right, you hit 30% margins but basically, margin expansion still seems pretty low relative to high single-digit organic growth. Could you maybe just talk about is -- and I understand labor inflation, et cetera, could you have been more aggressive on pricing earlier on the discretionary side? I know the CPI site sort of resets kind of first half, second half. So that's kind of point 1. And then second point, is your labor turnover higher than your peers because it seems like your peers are getting margin expansion on similar organic revenue growth. So I'm just curious whether you could have been more aggressive on price earlier or whether your turnover is higher. I know you're a much larger company. Devina Rankin : I'll start on the margin commentary. Pricing, I think, with respect to our pricing activities, what you saw was a much more significant and acute change in the cost environment in the third quarter across the U.S. economy, right? Whether or not our competitors saw those impacts, I observed their third quarter results as well. And so what I would tell you is that what we saw is that we were taking active steps with our employee base to be sure that we were curbing the impacts of turnover that were happening across the economy. From a margin perspective, I definitely don't think that you should take away from our 2020 results any indication of a plateau. Instead, what we know happened in 2021 is 2 things : one, we were integrating the ADS business, which has a 400 basis point lower margin base than the WM business. And so we knew that would have pressure on our margins coming into the year. And then secondarily, we saw that acute labor inflation cost hit us in the third quarter with a very prompt response really late in Q3, early in Q4 from a pricing perspective that you saw provide really good margin cover in the fourth quarter to the point earlier, that provided about 60 basis points, both from a price perspective and efficiency perspective benefit on a sequential basis going from Q3 to Q4. And we think some of that sequential improvement continues into Q1, where pricing activities will continue as we've mentioned before. John Morris : I was just going to say, so I think if you heard what Devina commented on earlier about how we'll see that margin improvement kind of in the back half of the year. But if you assume that we'll see some margin pressure in the first half and you do the math to get to the second half of the year, I think it really gives you a certain level. It tells you about our level of confidence about what's going to happen with margin. I think on your CPI point, I mean, we think about 2.5% is what we're going to see for the full year next year. And as Jim mentioned earlier, some of that -- a good chunk of that comes is in the residential revenue line, and we see that the biggest lift for residential in July.  As far as turnover, I can't comment on the others. What I can tell you is we've had a very concerted effort and process that we've put in place. We are pleased with what we're seeing. It's obviously not a trend you fix overnight. But since August, we've seen improving acquisition and retention numbers. So when you look on a net basis, we are making headway in terms of those we're bringing on and those we're retaining. James Fish : I think -- I mean, Hamzah, real quick, first of all, with respect to turnover, I don't know what the other guys' turnover is, I can't really compare. I would tell you if they're not seeing any inflation in their business, then they're operating in Antarctica because the whole world is seeing inflation. And regarding pricing, our core price is 5.2% for Q4. And you might say, well, you guys aren't very good at covering inflation because inflation was more like 6% for us and we were only showing 5.2% core price. We're not getting there. But as we talked about, there is a lag. Could we have been more aggressive? I don't know. I mean, boy, this thing came out of nowhere. I don't think anybody expected it. So I'm happy with the progress we're making. We've made a ton of progress sequentially between Q3 and Q4, and we'll continue to see that in 2022. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Very helpful. And my follow-up question is on the investments, more specifically around execution risk. You have the 17 RNG plants. I think you said you're going to take 100% ownership. Do you have the bench strength and engineering talent to sort of execute on that? I'm assuming you're not JV partnering on this. You mentioned a bunch of accelerated recycling and automation investments too. Again, great paybacks and you mentioned the EBITDA ramp. But just help us think through execution risk. I know historically, Jim, when you were CFO, WM had made a ton of investment. I guess this was a long time ago, right, waste-to-energy, ethanol plants, oil fields. Then the company sort of refocused back to the core, and now this is sort of a new phase of investment but it is definitely very much sort of in your core wheelhouse, RNG, recycling, et cetera. But just help us think through execution risk as you execute on all these different initiatives going forward. John Morris : So Hamzah, I'll start with recycling. I mean, if you look at where recycling was 3, 4, 5 years ago, we charted a path to make that business compete from an investment and return standpoint with other lines of business. And even with the commodity tailwinds, even when you look at commodities were down, we were improving the returns on the margin on that business. And then if you look forward, I don't think we have a -- we have total confidence in our ability to execute on the recycling side. I think we've demonstrated that even when commodity prices were not the tailwind they were with the fee-for-service model, we've talked about. So I think we've got back steps on the recycling side. In terms of the team, we have in place to be able to build and operate these recycling plants. We're the biggest recycler in North America and we do -- I like to believe we do this better than everybody else. On the WM RE side, I think what Jim said is right now, we're assuming 100% of the risk. We've got optionality and Devina talked to some of the other backstops we could potentially put place down the road in terms of the commodity risk. In terms of the execution, Jim mentioned we have the fleet and we have a team that's been in the RNG business for a bunch of years right now. So to me, this is less about execution risk. It's really just about, given Tara and that team the resources they need to go faster. James Fish : I mean, there's been no shortage of potential suitors, Hamzah, on the RNG business for us. But at this point, we feel good about doing it on our own. But we have -- we still have optionality. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. And by optionality, you mean that you could potentially bring in somebody, is that what you mean? James Fish : If we wanted, sure. I mean, one of the assets that I talked about, 1 of the 4 things we bring to the table is the asset itself. And we have more landfill gas than anybody else. And so those 4 things I think are really what differentiates us in this foray into RNG that we think is going to be hugely valuable for us that we talked about 400 million at very conservative numbers, could be as high as 800 or more. So we like our position. But yes, that's the answer is that optionality means if we wanted to partner up with somebody, we could. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : So you likened the growth initiatives to acquisitions and also kind of framed it as growth. And my question, I guess, is on how much, and I'm going to use the word cannibalization, but it's probably -- it's not the right word for it, but how much to the extent that you might have invested in either growth CapEx over the next 4 years or your investment in acquisitions over the next 4 years might have come from or been impacted by your decision to deploy capital in these areas? Were they at all affected? Or is this something that is completely 100% incremental and therefore, capital that, let's say, would have gone back to investor returns is now because of the return potential is now being allocated to this. Is it complete? In other words, do we open our models, our long-term models? Do we add that EBITDA dollar -- the complete level of dollar EBITDA to our year for those years, those out years? Or is this something that might have been also built into what we would have otherwise modeled in terms of M&A and/or growth CapEx? Devina Rankin : Yes. So the easy answer here is that it's not a trade-off for us. So this is not taking the place of some other investment that we otherwise would have pursued way of growth or M&A. For us, this is incremental. And for that reason in terms of how you think about it in looking at our long-term growth outlook, this is incremental to that long-term growth outlook that we've outlined. Walter Spracklin : Okay. That's fantastic. I appreciate that. On the customer -- on pricing and the impact on customer churn, every day seems to be a new day in terms of how -- what the level of pricing is that's passed on. My question is, is there any incremental change even as of -- as we enter the new year, as you go back to those customers with the price increases, as fluid as it seems to be that all sectors and all services and all goods manufacturers seem to be able to pass on price, is there any level of churn that is coming little more than expected? Is there any behavior among your competitors that's shifting at all, again, not so much in the fourth quarter, but in recent trends that would suggest that customer churn may be picking up a little bit here with the higher pricing? John Morris : I would tell you, Walter, as you look at our momentum into Q3 and Q4, what we see in the outlook here, and we've talked about for 2022. And believe me, I asked that exact question of our revenue management team about once a week. And the short answer is no. I think the receptivity of just about all of our customers, they understand that inflation is real, that it's not going away. And we're trying to be thoughtful about it. One of the comments I didn't make to Hamzah's question was really trying to take our customer lifetime value view of our base and being -- obviously, we have, as Devina said, some acute inflationary headwinds that took everybody a tad off-guard. And while we're doing our best to recover that as quickly as we can, we're also -- this is also the long game, too. And I think that's when we're going through the model and customer lifetime value is certainly something we're factoring in there. And I think you're going to see that continued momentum throughout '22. I don't think from a -- I haven't seen -- other than what I commented on some of the selective revenue decisions we're making in residential, the receptivity of the customer base has been pretty consistent. James Fish : I think also, Walter, worth mention here, I honestly can say I have no idea what the competition is doing other than what they publicly talk about on their calls. So it's not something we really pay attention to. We have a certain cost structure that we're trying to cover, and so that's how we focus our pricing. Walter Spracklin : Yes. My question on competition is at the ground level, are you seeing competitors taking customers with a little less price than you're bringing on the table? But it sounds like that's not the answer. I really appreciate -- yes, go ahead. James Fish : It's always a competitive business. So I mean, are there competitors out there that are taking customers? It's a very competitive business. We have cities where we have a dozen competitors or more. So I think the answer to that is, yes, that's just part of what we deal with day in and day out. But I don't I don't really focus on it because I feel like we are -- we have a really solid, robust plan in place with respect to all of these financial aspects and pricing is a big contributor. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : So you guys have said previously sort of that 50% free cash flow conversion is a sustainable level? It looks like you're guiding to close to that in 2022 when you back out the accelerated investments. So I'm just trying to think longer term, going into 2023, do we think about 50% underlying conversion and then maybe assume sustainability investments remain elevated? I mean, any kind of color on where that $550 million goes and that underlying sustainable conversion rate would be helpful. Devina Rankin : Yes. Sean, that 50% target remains our goal, and we were happy to accomplish that in 2021. And you're right, from a guidance perspective, we're kind of right at the bottom end of that targeted range. When I look at the longer-term outlook, you're exactly right from a sustainability project perspective. With the outlook we gave for 2023 through 2025, you can expect that, that elevated level of growth investment will continue through that period. And that would be treated similarly to how we provided our guidance in 2022. When I look at the contributing factors, we think that there's more work that we can do on working capital optimization. EBITDA growth continues to be that long-term outlook of 5% to 7% that we've talked about. So we'll certainly continue to revisit that as we see different factors contribute to both the headwinds and tailwinds of the business as appropriate. So one, I can't really comment on because it remains a big question mark, and we can't predict it is the future of cash taxes and whether it be the corporate tax rate or look at bonus depreciation impacts. Those things could put some downward pressure, and that's just too hard for me to predict with regard to the things that we can control, we're going to continue working to not just hit that 50% benchmark but try and improve it from here. John Morris : It also depends, too, right, Devina, on the free cash flow. Obviously, the piece is 1 of the 2 numbers there. And if you look at our free cash flow, excluding those growth types of investments, then your ratio is right at 50%. If you look at the way we define it, which is pulling CapEx out and this is -- as we've talked a lot about today, those growth investments in RNG and recycling, we're essentially kind of making a capital allocation decision and spending extra CapEx. So the free cash flow guidance that we're giving is technically in that $2 billion-ish or a little bit more than that range. If you use that number to calculate the ratio, then it ends up being under 50%. If you use that the free cash flow number that we typically would report as a range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, then you're talking about something that's 50%. So there is a little bit of math in that, that needs to be understood. Sean Eastman : And just shifting over to the technology investments. Just in the context of WM\u2019s other levers to combat cost inflation beyond the pricing programs. Obviously, you talked a lot about automation, we've got the back office, IT efficiencies. How is that reflected in the 2022 margin guidance? And I guess, I'm trying to just think about the juice you guys have there going into 2023? John Morris : I think, Sean, I think, Jim, we all spoke to it. I mean, it's about making the labor pool that we have more efficient, right and using technology to replace some of these transactional jobs. And frankly, we're having a hard time filling. But that's where the operating side. If you look at it from a revenue side, we've talked a lot about the technology we've installed in our operations. And one of those is the technology we put on trucks. And if you look at service increases and decreases, some of the revenue growth we're seeing in commercial in particular, we think technology is part of the reason that's happening. We've automated a lot of those processes, where the folks behind the wheel don't have to worry about whether they have to take a picture, send the picture and that's all done with the technology and data and that analytics team we have. So it's not just the operating side, we are also seeing -- the investments we've made in what we call smart truck, as one example, sales coverage optimization, which is really about getting more efficiency out of our sales force, which I think is also contributing. Those are a couple of examples where the technology is actually helping directly on the top line.  In terms of the margin, juice. Devina Rankin : Yes, I\u2019d tell you, when we look at margin, the one place in the business that we specifically see technology showing up other than what John has already mentioned particularly on the top line is on the SG&A side and our SG&A margin for 2022 are expected to be below the 10% that we accomplished in the current year. James Fish : One last thing here. And I know we're a little bit of a long winded answer here. But to John's point, he talked about our data and analytics. So our team our data and analytics team is in the process of fully optimizing, they're working on a specific line of business. So fully optimizing roll up line of business and the number of permutations there, there's a massive amount of data, they built an engine there. And now they're in the process of kind of rolling this out over a period of months, but it will fully, fully optimize the ultimately all collection lines of business. Right now we're working on roll up but imagine all the data that goes into this is got road information, it's got driver data, it's got traffic, it's got customer data, containers, all kinds of stuff. The number of calculations is a ridiculous number. It's got like 17 zeros behind it. So it's a ridiculous number. But what it does for us is get to a point where we can fully, fully optimize these lines of business, and then you start talking about it the way maybe an Amazon talks about it and probably nobody else with respect to optimizing these routes.  We think there's a huge productivity take-up there. So what we haven't talked about are some of the driver turnover that we'd love to be able to take advantage of it. And this is one of those avenues. Operator : Your next question is from David Manthey from Baird. David Manthey : You've covered a lot here. But just a question on recycling automation investments. What percentage of your recycle volumes are processed by your single stream facilities today? And then what would that be by 2025? And just if I can understand, do these investments include adding more facilities? Are they just about expanding capacity and improving productivity of the existing 49? Devina Rankin : So we'll get you the information and Ed and Heather will be sure to circle back with you in terms of the percentage of our tonnage covered by the single stream network. Sorry, we don't have that at our fingertips. But with regard to the investments that we're making, it's more heavily weighted toward automation, but we will be exploring new markets and expanding our single stream footprint into markets that we don't currently serve. James Fish : Some of the new market investments as we heard David there in our internal meeting was that it might be a city where we don't have a presence, but we do have a presence in a city that's 150 miles away. And we feel like the better of the two would be actually to go to the city to the South, and close down the facility in the city to the North. So there is a bit of a strategic decision there too. It's not always just where do we have underserved markets and how do we add capacity there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Feniger : Hey, guys. I know it's been long, so I'll just ask a quick one. When we think of your core price of 5.5 and the yield of 4% for '22, that's very strong. Can you just help us, what's embedded for the cost inflation for 2022? Jim, in Q3, you gave us great color around the acute inflation. You mentioned, I believe it was like 7% on some lines of business. I'm just curious what that should look like year-over-year, as we think of 2022 versus 2021? Thanks. James Fish : The 4% to 5% inflation is what we built in Michael. So -- and that's why we think that we do get to a point where we are able to cover that with pricing. And then a lot of the margin growth comes from places like automation and removing some of these transactional type positions. Michael Feniger : Got it. And just lastly, Jim, just on the CPI side, it depends on when you look at CPI because you can get half the year of the COVID type of CPI while the other half of this really high inflation CPI print. So I guess, just when I think about CPI running through your book of business, is it mostly really second half-second half or even like a 2023 is when we'll see these like really robust CPI print kind of come through the system? What's the timing on that? James Fish : I think you nailed it there, Michael. It really is probably second half of '22. There's a lot of these, as we've discussed, a lot of these contract adjustments have a 12-month lookback. So it won't fully capture this pretty aggressive ramp-up in inflation until we get to July or even January of next year. You may recall we've talked about almost 70% of the adjustments that we take happen in the front half of the year. And so the ones that we just took in January, which I forget what the exact percentages are, but the big 2 months for adjustments are January and July. And what we just took in January, to the extent that there's a 12-month lookback, it's not going to include a whole lot. It's going to include maybe 3 months of the big inflation ramp. Next year, it will include 12 months. And so the farther we get into -- the deeper we get into the year with these adjustments, the more they will include this big ramp-up in inflation. Operator : There are no questions over the phone. I will now turn the call over to President and CEO, Jim Fish. James Fish : All right. Well, thank you. Long call today, but I think, hopefully, you felt we gave some good details. Thank you all for joining us. We're very excited about finally coming into a year where it feels like we're going to have a bit quieter year. And so thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you out on the road. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Egl, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Edward Egl : Thank you, Lorrie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You will hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover high-level financials and provide a strategic update. John will cover an operating overview, and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules of the press release include important information. During the call, you will give forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless stated otherwise, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume. During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the first quarter of 2021. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA margin and SG&A expense results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release and tables, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of WM is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The first quarter of every year sets the tone for the rest of the year, and our strong first quarter results really set us up for success in 2022. We delivered exceptional core price and yield results, grew profitable volumes and managed our costs. The result was double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA and cash from operations. In fact, our cash from operations was the highest we've ever generated in a quarter, allowing us to return $0.5 billion of cash to our shareholders. Our operating EBITDA margin of 27.6% was ahead of our plan, even in the face of record inflation and the delayed approval of the alternative fuel tax credits. So we executed extremely well in the first quarter and achieved better results than we anticipated, positioning 2022 to be another great year for WM. In addition to the strong start in the first quarter, we see signs that the economy is trending positively. Several of the key leading performance indicators within our business, such as special waste volumes, construction and demolition volumes and new business formation pointed to continued strong economic activity and business performance for the balance of the year. The positive economic activity, combined with WM's diverse customer base, the recession-resilient nature of our business and nearly 75% of our revenue that is annuity-like, gives us confidence to reaffirm the full year outlook we provided in February. As we progress through the year, we remain committed to executing on our strategic priorities of providing the best workplace, advancing technology and automation that differentiates WM and reduces costs and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Turning to our sustainability and technology investments, we're excited about the future. We see the opportunity to further our sustainability leadership by expanding recycling capacity, automating recycling processing and increasing the renewable energy generated from our landfill network. We opened a new recycling facility in the first quarter and we're on track to bring online another fully retrofitted MRF in the second quarter, along with the next WM-built renewable natural gas plant. These projects are expected to generate excellent returns that are superior to those of solid waste acquisitions. Regarding technology, last quarter, you heard us discuss cost-saving opportunities for automation and optimization, which involves creating a competitive advantage for WM by differentiating the customer experience, while reducing our labor dependency on certain roles. Through our focus on digital technology, we anticipate reducing 5,000 to 7,000 positions over the next 4 years. In this tight and expensive job market, it makes complete sense to use technology to reduce our dependency on certain high turnover jobs. In addition to tackling this attrition, technology produces a significant amount of data that we view as a valuable asset. John has referred to our trucks as rolling data centers and we're using that data and analytics to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Currently, we're piloting the full end-to-end optimization of our roll-off routes, which will be the first of its kind in the industry. Early efficiency results in our pilots are very encouraging and our plan is to have our roll-off routes fully optimized by mid-'23. Finally, while we use automation and data to our advantage, we will invest in training and upskilling of our existing employees to -- existing employees to ready them for higher-skilled future roles. To sum it up, we've set the bar high in our first quarter with our results, and we're confident in our ability to deliver strong performance throughout the remainder of 2022. I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. I know that they continue to work to deliver on our commitment to our customers, our communities and our shareholders. And we very much appreciate that. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 began on a high note with first quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business topping 9%. Our expectation was that the first quarter would be our strongest quarter of the year, both for pricing and volume growth, and our teams delivered revenue that exceeded our expectations. Core price of 7.3% is more than double the result for the same quarter in 2021, as we work to secure price increases that keep pace with the inflationary environment. Strong pricing results across all lines of business translated into collection and disposal yield of 5.5%, with standout performance of 7.9% for commercial and 5.1% for landfill MSW. We remain confident that our pricing strategies appropriately respond to the rising costs and prioritize our focus on maximizing customer lifetime value. In the first quarter, we delivered record high core price, while maintaining churn near historic lows by using a data-driven and customer-focused approach. Shifting to volumes, first quarter collection and disposal volume grew 3.8%. Landfill volumes continue to be strong, with MSW volumes increasing more than 5% and special waste volumes growing almost 30% in the quarter. And while we expect some moderation in special waste volumes from our first quarter levels, our project pipelines remain strong. Also contributing to our strong volume results was significant growth in our national account business. In the first quarter, our Strategic Business Solutions team won more than $20 million of new annualized revenue. These wins were driven by our ability to meet customer sustainability and operating needs through a differentiated use of customer-facing data analytics and service capabilities. Our teams remain focused on controlling operating costs. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were 62.3% of revenue in the first quarter. While cost inflation in the first quarter persisted in the high single digits, our operating costs improved 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021, largely due to encouraging trends in our largest cost category, labor. First quarter overtime costs and training hours came down compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, as we've improved retention and been successful in onboarding new team members to transition from training hours to productive hours. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily comes from 3 areas : 50 basis points in our collection and disposal business related to inflationary pressures, including the proactive and intentional steps we took last year to increase wages for frontline team members; 40 basis points from the impact of higher commodity prices on our recycling brokerage business; and 30 points related to the alternative fuel tax credits received in 2021 that have not yet been renewed for 2022. When we think about the balance of the year, we expect the inflationary cost pressures to ease in the second half of 2022 as we lap acute inflation that began in the second half of 2021. We do anticipate some pressure on maintenance costs in 2022 as a result of delays in our truck delivery schedule resulting from ongoing supply chain constraints. Turning to our residential collection business, we continue to execute on our long-term plan to improve this line of business through pricing and automation. The impacts of higher labor costs are most pronounced in this part of the business, and we are focused on appropriately pricing our contracts and reducing our costs by transitioning more of our residential fleet to automated single-driver vehicles. Our first quarter revenue growth results reflect our success in moving residential pricing as our yield was 5%. In the recycling line of business, we delivered another strong quarter with operating EBITDA growing by $23 million. Our blended average commodity price in the first quarter was about $126 per ton, which is in line with our full year expectations. We continue to see strong demand for recycled materials, and we remain focused on educating customers to help unlock additional supply of recyclables and employing technology to maximize the value of the material recovery while reducing our cost of processing. And finally, our renewable energy business contributed an additional $13 million of operating EBITDA in the quarter. We have a new renewable natural gas plant coming online in the next few weeks in Oklahoma, the 17th R&D plant in our network and the fifth developed by WM. The next RNG project is on track to come into service by the end of the year, positioning us to deliver on our 2026 targets as we expand our leadership in the landfill gas energy business. In closing, I want to thank the entire team for the fantastic job they do safely and reliably serving our customers day in and day out. We've had a great start to 2022 and look forward to building on our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our disciplined pricing programs robust volume growth and solid recycling performance fueled strong top line growth, and that translated into a nearly 11% increase in operating EBITDA in the first quarter. Our operating EBITDA growth completely flowed through to cash from operations, as lower interest payments more than offset a modest decline in working capital benefits related primarily to higher incentive compensation payments in 2022 for a strong 2021 performance. We're pleased with these strong results and are well positioned to comfortably deliver on our full year outlook. Turning to capital expenditures. First quarter capital spending to support our business totaled $371 million, and we invested an additional $47 million in our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Given our acceleration of sustainability growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, we spent a little less capital on these investments in the first quarter, but we remain on track to advance these projects in 2022 as planned. We expect that our investments in recycling and renewable natural gas projects will ramp up as we move through the balance of the year. While we continue to see supply chain constraints slow delivery schedules in some asset categories, we're managing spending across our portfolio and expect capital expenditures to support the business to be within our full year guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, and sustainability growth investments to be approximately $550 million in 2022. As you heard from Jim and John, our teams are executing on the recycling and R&D growth projects we discussed last quarter, and we're confident in the strong returns these projects provide. Keep in mind that these investments are reported as a component of our capital expenditures and reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow. Yet we view these investments to be similar to an acquisition dollar as they produce high-return growth as a strong complement to our existing business.  Putting it all together, our business generated first quarter free cash flow of $845 million. Before sustainability growth investments, first quarter free cash flow was $892 million, which puts us well on our way to achieving our full year outlook of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. We are well positioned to allocate our cash to sustainability growth investments, traditional tuck-in acquisitions and growing shareholder returns. We used our free cash flow to pay $275 million in dividends in the quarter, and we allocated $250 million to share repurchases, while maintaining our leverage ratio well within our targeted range. Turning to SG&A. We remain focused on controlling discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the cost of our sales and back office functions. First quarter SG&A was 10.1% of revenue, a 60 basis point improvement over 2021. We fully expect to achieve SG&A as a percentage of revenue of less than 10% for the full year, even as we continue to invest in technology to differentiate WM and lower our cost to serve. In closing, our strong results are a testament to the dedication of our 50,000 team members. We're proud of our performance in the first quarter and excited about what we can achieve together over the remainder of the year. With that, Lorrie, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Just given the strength we saw in Q1, just hoping you could add any additional color on why not raise the guidance? I know you said it puts you in a really good place for reaching the full year guidance. But is it the supply chain issues or uncertainty just in the macro, just wanting to understand some of the drivers there? James Fish : I think, Toni, the last year was actually a little unique for us. I think it was the first year we've ever raised guidance in the first quarter. And so we didn't want to set a trend necessarily. I think we felt like the quarter was fantastic, sets us up well for the year. But before we would change that outlook, we wanted to get another quarter or 2 under our belts. Toni Kaplan : That's great. I wanted to also ask about on the labor side, just an update on what you're seeing in the labor market, maybe churn. And I just wanted to ask if there's sort of -- in terms of the projects that you're implementing any sort of impact on like delaying those projects because of the tight labor market? John Morris : No, Toni. We've seen some increases in overtime, which I've honestly moderated over the last couple of quarters. So that's good news. We've been successful in bringing down our turnover numbers. They're not where we want them to be, but they're about 300 basis points better than they were 2 quarters ago. So we're seeing good trends overall on the labor front.  We were, to some extent, paint a little bit of a premium to service some of that business a few quarters ago as the overtime was up, but the good news is that's moderating. Our overtime percentages are coming down, our retention rates are better. So we feel pretty good about where we are and our ability to service any of these volume opportunities that present themselves. Devina Rankin : And then, Toni, with regard to our process on labor to advance the projects that we've discussed in sustainability and recycling. One of the things that's unique about WM is that we started this journey with a really strong team that's been developing these projects over the last several years, and we're leveraging that team and building it where appropriate in order to accelerate the investment from here, and we're really satisfied with where that stands. Toni Kaplan : That sounds great. Maybe just one last thing for me. Core pricing looked really good in the first quarter. When you think about sort of the ability to offset inflation, it seems like that should be able to do it. Can you go beyond offsetting inflation? And when do you see core pricing sort of normalizing? James Fish : Yes. Look, I would tell you, for the quarter, we were pleased with the results from a price perspective, considering that we talked about a 4% yield and 5.5% core price. As you know, things do moderate a little bit as we get later in the year just because the comps change. So you shouldn't expect to see the same raw numbers in Q3, Q4 because of the difficult comparisons. But we certainly have, I think, shown that we're pretty effective at using price to cover the cost inflation. I think it's also important that we focus on the cost side of the business, and that's why we're starting to really talk a lot about technology. I mentioned this 5,000 to 7,000 jobs, that\u2019s in a low-cost way, meaning we use attrition to take them out, that will be a significant contributor as we go down the road. So we're not just relying solely on price to improve margins. Some of it has to come from the cost side of the equation, it's going to be a combination of things that I think get us on a significant margin improvement path. Operator : And our next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Yes, I'd love to continue the discussion on core price. If you don't mind, really impressive performance. I'm wondering if you can talk about whether you folks went back to customers that had a price increase within the past year with the second price increase? Or is the acceleration that we're seeing an upside versus the original expectations driven by higher pricing on contracts that are rolling? James Fish : Yes, Jerry, I'm not going to say that there isn't a single customer out of our $25 million that didn't get 2 price increases, but we've really, really tried to move away almost completely from that. And I hope that there aren't any, but -- what we're trying to do is when we take a price increase on customers, make it an annual thing. And so I can't say with 1,000% confidence that something didn't slip through the cracks. But I would tell you that that may have been a practice from years ago, but that practice has changed. So that pricing is more of an annual item for our customers. Jerry Revich : That's super. So it sounds like the leading edge pricing is probably a couple of points even higher than the strong core price. And in terms of the landfill gas cadence, can you talk about as the RNG plants come online, is there a ramp-up period to get to full production and full efficiency? How quickly relative to the time lines that you outlined, Jim? Can we expect the full run rate earnings contribution? James Fish : Yes, Jerry. I mean most of those plants have infrastructure in place already. So we're managing that gas. In most cases, the difference is we're switching over from the technology we were using to manage the gas to an RNG process. So once the plant is up and we've kind of knocked the kinks out, if you will, it comes up to speed fairly quickly. None of these are landfills where we're starting with no infrastructure, if that were the case, it would be different, but that's not our situation. Devina Rankin : And Jerry, just to put a fine point on how we're thinking about the build of financial value from these plants, our 2022 guidance did contemplate the two facilities that we're bringing online in 2022. And because of the timing of bringing them online, it really did have a pretty inconsequential impact, particularly the one that comes in the fourth quarter. But we do expect a step change in 2023, and we'll give you more clarity on that as we get closer to that point. Jerry Revich : Super. And I'm wondering if you folks would be willing to tell us the timing of additional plants coming online in '23 with the type of precise schedule that you laid out for '22 at this point? Devina Rankin : At this point, it's too early for us to give you those details. We are actively pulling in the equipments and the permitting processes. And because of the uncertainty in those processes, we just can't predict at this point with the same level of certainty that we've given you for 2022, what we expect in the year ahead. But as we get closer to those dates, we certainly will. Operator : And our next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Just in terms of pricing, do you have a sense of what percent of your customers actually push back on pricing? Because pricing in this sector from '09 to 2012 was very, very low, 1%, 1.5%. And maybe the sector found discipline, maybe 2015, and it's a small ticket cost item. So is it 5% that pushback or 10%, 20%? Just any sense of that would be helpful for investors. John Morris : Yes. So I can't speak to the sector. What I can tell you, though, is there's a couple of those metrics we pay close attention to. One is churn, which in my comments, I said, is still near historical lows. So we haven't seen really a lot of movement there even when you look at the pricing that we posted for the quarter. We look at service increases and decreases as also a measurement of the health and those continue to be positive in a big way. And then lastly, the metric we look at is rollbacks. And I will tell you that rollbacks are much stronger year-over-year. So even as we've addressed this -- and I think we all agree that customers understand that there is real inflationary pressure. And I think that's -- that, coupled with the value in terms of service we're delivering is the reason why you're seeing rollbacks even lower despite us having push through more on the revenue quality side. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. And then just lastly, I'll turn it over, do you -- I guess, do you have a sense of as it relates to the sustainability investments? Does that create more volatility in your portfolio or less volatility? I know the recycling piece, you talked about sort of more of a cost takeout. But I guess on the landfill side, landfill to gas side, I guess have you made a decision on fixed price versus kind of levered to the end market? And just any thoughts as to volatility in the portfolio post some of the investments? Is there less or more? Devina Rankin : It's a great question, Hamzah, and one that we're focused on internally in terms of how we'll manage this over the long term as this becomes a larger part of our business. Volatility in the natural gas business will certainly increase relative to the traditional solid waste business. That volatility, though, only comes from the top line of the business. There really is no volatility in the middle of the income statement. And so for us, it's about how we evaluate every vantage point of the revenue life cycle and think about what we're exposed to in spot markets and what we can secure long-term contracts for. And we are currently addressing some long-term contracts. We've discussed the fact that some of those are extending beyond even 10 years at this point. We want to ensure that while we consider long-term contracts, we don't somehow diminish the return of the portfolio because we are making sizable investments here. We want to be sure that we're appropriately balancing ourselves between spot market and the long term to maximize the returns. Operator : And our next question is from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael Hoffman : So to come back to the pricing, which was terrific, and you stood up and delivered on what you said you were going to do which was get in the market and do it aggressively to make up for '21. Just to remind us all, your once-a-year objective is on contract renewal cycles, not just once a year at a point of time. Is that correct? James Fish : Yes, that's right. Michael Hoffman : Yes. Okay. So there's a rolling effect of price all year long, it's just you're not intending to come out of a customer more than once is the objective? James Fish : Well, that's right. And I think the point about the price increase being once a year is that there may be some price that's still on the table out there because we didn't take price increases as aggressively in March of last year or in April of last year. So those will come around. I mean inflation didn't really kind of hit us hard until Q3. So you will see some pickup there that we didn't choose to take, even though that customer may have -- that the cost for that -- for servicing that customer have increased dramatically in Q3, Q4, the price wouldn't have mirrored that until we get to the anniversary this year. Michael Hoffman : Right. And then I fully agree and appreciate that not raising guidance now allows for the normal seasonality to occur and the like. But when I think about what you did give in guidance, 5.5% in core and 4% on price, 2% on volume, the 1Q numbers are, how much above your own expectation were they comparatively? The 7.5%, the 5.5%, the 3.6%, how much did you exceed your own expectations? Devina Rankin : So on the price side, I would tell you, our expectations had been when we set our guidance that we would see stronger price performance and volume performance in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, simply because of the year-over-year comp. We continue to see that math holds. And that, therefore, means that as we look at both the guidance we established and where we are today, that we expect Q1 to be the peak, I would say, in terms of the print on core price and on yields. That being said, if I look purely at the numbers, I would tell you, we were about 100 basis points, maybe a little higher than that, above our expectations on core price. On the volume side, they were stronger than expectations, particularly in special waste. The rest of the business really performed according to plan. James Fish : Well, I think commercial was very strong too, on the volume, Scott. I don't know -- Devina Rankin : It was. It was just generally, speaking in line with what we would have projected for the year, we're really optimistic that the commercial volume strength continues. But as John remarked earlier, the special waste volumes is one of the things that we have our eye on, because approaching 30% increase on a year-over-year basis, certainly isn't something that we had predicted. James Fish : Michael, sometimes we talk a little bit about what the current month looks like. And we're not seeing anything that would change our view right now in April. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. And just so everybody is looking at data, the $148 million of volume versus the -- which is like 3.5% versus the almost 8% landfill volume increase. The difference there is that there's a huge chunk of special waste in that almost 8% landfill volume year-over-year number. James Fish : There was -- definitely special waste was a strong point. But the great thing about the quarter, if we're really focusing on just kind of this short-term quarter and then the remainder of the year is that we kind of had universal strength. And I'm not sure we've had a quarter like this where virtually everything looked good. I mean even C&D, you might look at C&D and say, \"Well, that was flat.\" But if you look at last year with all the fire and flood volume in it, if you pull that out, C&D was really strong on its own. So whether it's MSW volume or commercial volume or special waste or C&D, everything looks strong. We are keeping our eye on the macro economy because there's a lot of chatter out there about that. But we're not seeing any signals right now in those forward-looking waste streams that would indicate that there's a big downturn coming. And believe me, we're looking at it. Nothing shows up right now. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then the fuel -- the industry fuel surcharges, they're very good at it. We had a big spike in March. Can you help us get this right instead of guessing what should we be modeling for that dollar change for the second quarter based on what happened coming into 2Q? You did $90 million in surcharge in 1Q. It's got to be bigger, but what's the right place to be? Devina Rankin : Well, a quick clarification on the $90 million on the fuel surcharge line, it's important to note that, that also includes renewable energy pricing. So the fuel surcharge was about $70 million of the $90 million. That being said, March was about 45% of the quarter. And so the ramp that you mentioned was significant, and we continue to expect that will persist through the remainder of the year. Our prediction right now is $90 million to $100 million per quarter. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right. That's terrific. And then since you alluded to the cadence, Devina, on CapEx. Can you give us a little framing of how we should land that to get the free cash flow per quarter kind of close to right, since it's such a big number to flesh out? Devina Rankin : John did a great job of talking about the supply chain constraints. And so while we would love to give you some clarity on the cadence of capital for us right now, it's just more difficult for us to predict quarter by quarter, particularly for truck capital where we're seeing delivery schedules lengthen. I would tell you, Q2 is usually the point in time that we start to see ramp, particularly in the landfill line of business. And so you'll see that -- I do expect Q4 to be a pretty heavy capital quarter again, though, for us. So I think you can take our guidance for each of them and make it pretty ratable over Q2 through Q4. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then you shared with us last quarter your second half of the year, internal cost inflation kind of ran at 6% and 7%. What were we running in the first quarter? Devina Rankin : It was closer to 9%. Michael Hoffman : And is it coming down? Devina Rankin : No. We think that this is effectively the peak, and we expect it to plateau and then as we discussed, we expect to see some moderation in the back half because we'll lap the labor increases that we executed upon beginning in the third quarter of '21. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then last one on the renewable energy side, you have shared that your objective is to kind of create that stability on the profit line through the long-term contracts. The big change here is that we're moving away from a transportation buyer to a nontransportation buyer. And have you gotten more than indications of interest that they really are willing to pay a sustained premium. And I'm not talking current market rate, even just something higher than the long-term average of what the RIN has been to create that stability on the profit line? John Morris : Yes, Michael. We've executed a handful of contracts being commented. One was around a 10-year mark, one was a little longer than that. And the short answer to your question is yes. It's a small percentage of the gas we produce now. We're going to continue as Devina said, to look to stabilize the portfolio by putting a portion of those contracts in a fixed position. But the short answer is yes, people are willing to buy and yes, they're willing to pay a premium on an MMBtu basis. Michael Hoffman : And it's a non-transportation buyer, it's utilities, it's institutions, property maintenance, trends, things like -- right. Last question, Devina, you've shared in the past that the ramp in the contribution is modest in '23, a little more in '24 and then it really moves up in '25. That pattern has not changed, right, in light of one of the earlier questions? Devina Rankin : Yes, that's correct, Michael. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Great. Good luck for the rest of the year, nice start. Operator : And our next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : So if we go back to the volume, you mentioned special waste and even commercial coming in a little bit better than trend. We seem to be fairly through the recovery phase and yet you still are putting up some pretty good volume numbers. Historically, we've always looked at waste as kind of a few demographic aspects and urbanization and so on being offset by some diversion and net-net, looking at overall a flat volume cadence over the long term and really pricing being an opportunity. Is that changing now? Has it -- when you look at your volume trajectory here and the continued growth you're seeing in volume, is there anything structural that you think is going on right now that you think will have longer-term impact in terms of perhaps positive volume growth going forward? James Fish : I think what structurally is changing versus maybe previous quarters is that we're starting to really separate ourselves, I believe, from the pack. So it's not just driven by micro and macroeconomics, it's driven by the fact that WM is -- we don't tend to -- we tend to on these calls talk a lot about kind of short term, the outlook and what the quarter looked like and what the remainder of the year is going to look like. But we also tried to inject in a bit of what we're doing strategically. And I would tell you, Walter, we're making huge strides in digitalizing our customer service. It's something the airlines did years ago, and now we're doing that. And it is separating us from a lot of others in the industry. We believe we're taking share. I believe that's part of what you're seeing in the volume picture. I can't break it out for you by line of business, but as we do that, and we believe that's kind of a 3, 5, even a 10-year strategy, similar to what we're talking about with sustainability, there's an awful lot of customers out there that are talking to us about data and analytics for their own sustainability initiatives. And we're really the only one that can provide that level that they're asking for. Nobody else can do that. So I would tell you this is not just about micro 101, this is about not only microeconomics, but it's also about the strategy we're putting in place that I believe is absolutely taking share and will take more share as we further differentiate ourselves down the road. Walter Spracklin : I think if that's true, you would probably see it in the special waste and commercial areas, which is where you are indeed seeing the strength. So that's a -- James Fish : That's absolutely right. I mean, look, the short story is, that's why I'm still bullish on this company. Obviously, I'm biased, but I got to tell you, I mean, I'm really bullish on it even at $160. I mean it's -- the strategy to me, whether you're talking about the brand that can't be matched, the labor -- the reduction of labor dependency, which doesn't address the volume aspect, but addresses the cost aspect and using the digitalization customer experience and to help us reduce our labor dependency by 5,000 to 7,000 jobs hasn't gotten a lot of comments from investors, but that's a big deal. And so all of that, I think, helps separate us from others who just simply can't replicate that. Walter Spracklin : Great points. Turning now to M&A. One of your competitors obviously has moved a little bit outside of pure solid waste into a little bit of hazardous and there's been some discussion or rumor out there that you may do the same without you commenting on that. Is that something conceptually that's in the cards for you? Or are solid waste kind of your singular focus for M&A opportunities? James Fish : Yes. I mean, look, we've seen the rumors. And I would tell you this, we're -- just as I went through with you kind of our strategy, which is really an organic strategy, we're really pleased with the results of our organic strategy. And at the same time, we'll continue to look at some of the small tuck-ins we may do, something that's an adjacency. We've talked about those as well that are related to our sustainability strategy. And that's probably where we draw the line as far as M&A goes. I will tell you that, in my view, there are reasons today to be conservative when it comes to M&A. It goes back to what I said about us being differentiated. Some of these other haulers, by the way, some of them are talking to us that have pressures on driver and technician turnover, significant pressures on driver technician turnover that are absolutely seeing wage inflation there, they're having a difficult time getting capital equipment probably times 2 versus where we are. And they don't have a sustainability service offering that is now being requested. Those are reasons to not go out and pay a big, heavy multiple to acquire some of these folks. Walter Spracklin : Very good point. So I appreciate the color and congrats on a great quarter. Operator : And our next question is from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Devina, I may have missed it. But I was hoping you could just give us a little more color on the 70 basis point decline in margins? Just thinking about some of the puts and takes there. I'm thinking about things like fuel, commodities, maybe the tax credits maybe that would have influenced it year-over-year because with 9% core inflation and, call it, a 5% to 6% yield, were core margins down? Devina Rankin : So it's really interesting when you look at the margin of the quarter, it certainly outperformed our expectation, and that started at the top line and continued through in terms of managing costs, which John mentioned earlier, particularly on the labor side. I think what's important is that you normalize for the fuel tax credit first because that really gets us focused on the rest of the business and how we've performed. And that was 30 basis points. And so when you look at Q1's performance, and you can see that we were only down 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis, and that compares to our expectation that we'd be down about 100 basis in the first half. We're certainly very pleased with that performance. The overall puts and takes just to build the bridge is that I would tell you the positive drivers from a margin perspective in the quarter were 20 basis points from the renewable energy business, about 10 basis points for leverage on SG&A beyond expectations. Recycling, this is the brokerage business. It's led by the brokerage business. It includes all elements of the recycling line of business, but that was down 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And then the collection and disposal business overall was down 30 basis points. But what's really important to highlight there is that sequentially improved 50 basis points when you remove the impact of the fuel tax credit. So we're really pleased with that performance, and it outpaced our expectations. We still remain cautious about margin in the first half of the year relative to prior year because as a reminder, Q2 of last year was, I believe, an all-time high at 29.3%. So we still expect margins in the first half to be on a year-over-year basis, a more difficult comp and therefore, a decrease, but we expect the margin momentum that we began in the first quarter to continue throughout the year. Tyler Brown : Okay. So that leads me to my second question. So it's still going to be soft, it feels like in the first half. I don't want to put you too much on the spot, but do you think that margins can still improve for the full year despite the dilutive impact of the fuel? And I'm thinking that fuel is maybe an extra 50 basis points of dilution, but I don't know if that's in the right ZIP code? Devina Rankin : So I'm going to separate fuel tax credits and the impact of rising fuel costs. But fuel tax credit, I would tell you, we hope, is a timing difference. Our outlook right now is that, that 30 basis points may continue, and we would love to see resolution sooner rather than later, but we think it could go all the way through the fourth quarter, but we do expect that to be a timing issue only not contribute to the margin of the business overall. From a diesel fuel rising cost perspective, we certainly saw that impact in the first quarter. And like I said earlier, at ramp in March, we estimate that the impact of that for every dollar change in diesel fuel is about 20 basis points of margin pressure. James Fish : To my previous point to Walter about margin, there seems to be a real focus on pricing, which is the right focus. But when you think about margin, there's a cost aspect too. And then so just to give you a couple of examples, we fully expect that with the digitalization of our customer experience, for example, that we have built into our plan that we won't rehire some customer experience positions, I talked to Mike Watson about this morning and -- so we've built that into our plan, probably as many as 300 positions that won't rehire when they trade away. So this isn't laying anybody off, this is just saying when we have 50% turnover in some of those positions and calls come through our call centers that are asking for ETA or asking for status of a payment or a bulky pickup, those have fully been automated. And so we've agreed that we won't replace those positions and that amounts to somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 positions for the year that we built into our plan. Similarly, with this move from rear load to ASL, we think there's as many as 2,000 of those that over the next 4 years, come out. And so you get a helper on the back of the truck that comes out, but you also get -- we know this from experience, a 30% pickup in efficiency when you move from rear load to ASL.  The Brent Bell is taking out positions as we automate these plants, somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 positions net and I say that because we'll be upskilling some positions there. So that includes both positions coming out and then positions being added back. And the net of that is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,200 positions over the next 4 years. And some of those do start hitting us in 2022 and then really accelerate in 2023. All of that, in addition to what we're doing on price, will have an impact on margins. Tyler Brown : Right, right. Very idiosyncratic. I appreciate that fully. So the bigger question on pricing, so -- can you break it down on the 5.5% collection disposal yield between, call it, your open markets and your more restricted markets? Because it feels like a lot of the pricing momentum is being driven in the open market right now, but that CPI linked to that regulated return pricing should accelerate as '22 plays out? So I know you're talking about the high watermark in Q1 on core price, but why would it fade if the restricted piece is going to accelerate? Or is it just not enough mathematically to get it -- to keep the pricing where it is today? Devina Rankin : So Tyler, I think the easiest way to look at it, we don't have specific breakdowns between open market and restricted prices. But what we've talked about is with rate restricted pricing, we do reset about 70% of that in the first half. And so those resets being loaded toward the first half is one of the reasons that we expect the high watermark to exist in the first half relative to the second half, and then it comes back to those comps. What I would say is that our pricing on The Street continues to have momentum over the course of the year as our contracts come up, particularly on open market and some of the actions that we took and the impact of fuel that we discussed will certainly continue to drive price higher. That's not reflected in your collection and disposal yields. But I really do think that this comes down to being focused on our market-based pricing and knowing that, that momentum is not what's flowing, it's just the comparisons on a year-over-year basis and the fact that we started to take pricing action more reflective of the cost environment in the second half of last year. Operator : And our next question is from David Manthey of Baird. David Manthey : First question on labor and benefits, both OpEx and SG&A. I think you noted that the proactive 2021 wage increases from last year, but are there any other parts of that cost stack that are elevated or understated this quarter that we should watch for the remainder of the year, things like, I don't know, incentive comp or health care or anything like that? John Morris : I'll start the operating side, Devina can weigh in maybe the SG&A and benefit side. I would -- we spoke to labor, obviously, been a long pole in the tent continuing to see high single, low double-digit inflation on labor. I think it's most pronounced. We mentioned in the residential line of business, most labor-intense line of business that we have. I would tell you, maintenance, in my prepared comments, David, we think that if there are some supply chain disruptions that linger through the balance of the year, we may be in a position where we're going to keep some of our older fleet employed for a little bit longer until we catch up. We don't see that as a barrier to be able to take advantage of some of the volume and market share that Jim commented on, it may put a little pressure on OpEx versus CapEx. But as Devina said, it's early in the year, and we've got a little bit of time here before I think we need to pivot. That would be one spot in the P&L where you might see it on the operating side. Devina Rankin : And then on the incentive compensation and health and welfare specifically, what I would tell you is I do think that incentive compensation could modestly increase over the remainder of the year from the Q1 level, just as we get further into the year, we'll get finer on our estimates and outlook and therefore, the accruals. But with regard to health and welfare, we are seeing the trends of those costs return to pre-COVID levels, where medical activity is getting back to normal. And as a result, those costs are pretty well in line with what we would have expected. They do tend to moderate over the remainder of the year, but nothing unusual on a year-over-year basis. David Manthey : Okay. And second on recycling, could you update us on what percentage of recycling revenues are under some form of fee-for-service agreement? And historically, you've told us that about 2/3 of the material that you collect has 0 to negative value. And I'm wondering is that still directionally the case? And as you put in these state-of-the-art automated MRFs, does that percentage change materially? John Morris : So David, the MRFs that we're automating are certainly producing a better product and doing it more efficiently. And I think that model actually gets better with the labor increases we're seeing, right? We're employing less labor in these plants. The rates are going up. So the investments we were talking about 18 months, 24 months ago and upgrading these plants is actually printing better not just because the arbitrage has gotten better, the quality of the product coming out of these facilities is better when you use a mechanized process to pull that material out. It stands to reason that you would get a better, cleaner product coming out of there. I think on the pricing side, what we're seeing is very consistent and strong demand on the fiber side, mixed paper has been a good tailwind over the last couple of years, and we're seeing continued demand increase for some of the other streams, the plastic streams. So we feel good about the top line and the demand that's being created. And as I mentioned, that's something we're going to continue to do is to educate our customers and use technology to unlock some of those streams. I would tell you in terms of negative value, the one that probably stand, I mean there's a residual content that tracks in the high teens to about 20%. We've been working on getting that down over the last few years. We feel technology will continue to help us in that regard. It's really the residual piece and glass, right? There's not really any positive market for glass. There's an environmental benefit to arguably keeping it out of the stream, but there's not a market that's positive for glass at the moment.  Did I catch all your questions? David Manthey : That does it. Operator : And our next question is from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital. Sean Eastman : Just coming back to the margins. As a summary, do we need to be thinking about that 0 to 40 basis points of expansion for the full year differently in light of what we've seen in the first quarter and the movements on fuel? And are we still going to be down 100 bps in the first half, like you had communicated previously? If you're willing to sort of refresh those expectations, that would be super helpful. Devina Rankin : So Sean, I think fundamentally, what this comes back to is us not wanting to be in a position to revise guidance across the board after just one quarter. And so the overall trend that we expected where our first half comps are just going to be tougher from a margin perspective than the second half comps. And therefore, we will relatively underperform our full year outlook in the first half and see a build as we get into the third quarter in terms of margin performance still holds.  In terms of the magnitude of it, I think Tyler's question earlier about the impact of fuel, framing that as about a 20 to 40 basis point impact, given what we're seeing in diesel fuels, we're pretty satisfied that we're going to be able to absorb the negative impacts of that. And so when we look at full year outlook for margin, we do see some upside particularly because price has come in so strong and we've seen positive momentum on retention. It's just too early for us to update the specificity with regard to how we see that flowing through for the rest of the year. Sean Eastman : Okay. Totally fair. Great answer. And coming back to the alternative fuel tax credit dynamic and those not being renewed yet. How is that built into the full year? And how big of a swing is that if -- or once those tax credits are renewed? Devina Rankin : Yes. So it was $12 million for the quarter. The full year impact is expected to be a little north of $55 million. So the impact for the remainder of the year, we estimate to be about $45 million. We fully expect that we'll end the year with some clarity on this. But if we don't receive that clarity, it would be about a $55 million to $60 million negative impact relative to the guidance that we've provided. Sean Eastman : Okay. Excellent. And then just real quick, relative to the $400 million EBITDA guidance for the RNG facilities by 2026. Can you tell us what that EBITDA number was in 2021 actual and what that number is in the 2022 guidance? Devina Rankin : I don't have the specifics on that. Ed and Heather will be able to get you more color. The only thing that we provide is the year-over-year increase in that was $13 million of a year-over-year benefit in the quarter. The color there I would give you is that we estimate that for every $0.10 change in RIN values, we see a $4 million to $5 million change in our EBITDA, and that continues to hold through 2022, we will see that increase as we get into '23 with additional production. James Fish : I think it was about $180 million in 2021. But Ed and Heather can verify that, but I think it was about $180 million. Operator : And our next question is from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : You mentioned you picked up about $20 million in annualized national account revenues this quarter. I think you mentioned also the sustainability services were a big driver of that. So Jim, I just want to build on your comments earlier. Can you give us some examples for investors of what services the customer is actually asking for in values, what you're providing here that maybe smaller competitors aren't that's helping you to win this business? James Fish : Well, when we talk specifically about national accounts, I mentioned that data and analytics are very important to them. They all have sustainability initiatives, every one of them. And so when we think about renewing some of these big national accounts that we renewed or signing new accounts, one of their primary asks is what kind of reporting tools do you have that can provide the information on a store-by-store basis, for example. So that's critically important, and that's been a real differentiator for us. Noah Kaye : Okay. That's helpful. And then I just want to understand a little bit the way you're proceeding with the automation initiative on the resi line transition to ASLs. Are you thinking about those investments as timed with contract renewals? Or is this really a substitution for fleets that are on existing contracts? In other words, this is sort of a mid-contract type initiative? John Morris : So I would tell you, Noah, where we have the opportunity to do a mid-contract we're going as fast as we can. We're not waiting, so to speak, for contracts to roll. I think a lot of municipalities we're having some really productive discussions with them because they've seen whether that we're a service provider or not, that's a strain on labor is showing up in the ability to service some of these municipalities, and we've seen opportunities to step in and convert these mid-contract. And certainly, to the extent that we are not able to do that, there is that period of time when these municipalities or franchises are going out for RFP and we're trying to make sure we're in front of that to have productive and educational conversations, if you will, about what the benefits are of automating these services. Noah Kaye : But just to clarify, I mean, for some of these routes, these municipalities, I mean the type of container may have to change as well. So there is some work involved, right, in educating and getting that change in place. But for you, just to clarify, the ROI is good enough such that you can put in the time and effort to have those changes take effect and convert the fleet over and you're just getting the savings on the labor and the efficiency? John Morris : Absolutely. I think for the municipality, you bring up a good point, when you go to kind of the pick up everything at the curb model to a containerized model, it helps in terms of the municipalities understanding, managing their costs and the quality material on the recycling side. And I think I won't go down this rapid trail, but all the technology we put on the trucks becomes that much more valuable when you automate the service, and we've got the ability to look at each of these transactions to help educate these customers. James Fish : When you think about the returns, Noah, I mean, it's a pretty easy math equation. On the negative side of the ledger, you get a higher capital cost for an ASL versus a rear loader to the tune of about $60,000, maybe 20% of the cost of the vehicle. But on the positive side, obviously, you get a helper coming off the back, put whatever number you want on that. And that is perpetual, whereas the capital cost is a onetime cost for the life of the vehicle. And then you get a safety improvement. You get a 30% -- as I mentioned, a 30% pickup in productivity or efficiency because we're just -- we're picking up 30% more homes per hour with an ASL than over a reloader. So the math is really compelling. It makes sense for us to move as quickly as we can on John's point. Operator : And our next question is from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Just on pricing, you mentioned Q1 as a high watermark. And when we think of 2020 with your core price of 5.5% yield to 4%, just why would those parameters just top-down view, why wouldn't they be higher in 2023? Is that what we should be expecting, would you let your foot off the gas, maybe on the open market as the restricted reset higher next year? I guess I'm just trying to put it together with the Q1 being really strong, the high water mark yet is going to decelerate a little bit in the second half, yet how do I think about those -- that 2020 parameters as we kind of move to 2023? Devina Rankin : I think, well, I may have said it a couple of tons already. I do think some of it becomes about the math. And I don't intend to make it overly simple in terms of looking at that. But next year's Q1 comp will be very difficult. We do think there is benefit from the rate reset on the restricted part of the book because this year's reset didn't fully contemplate all of the inflationary impact because they are backward looking. So we think there will be another step change in that part of the business a year from now. In terms of our activity on the street, I think it's important to know we are assuming that\u2019s slowing this momentum down. So we would like to create some decrease in the cost inflation environment that would allow us to view this a little bit differently going forward. And I just want to focus on customer lifetime value. We'll always ensure that we're being data-driven and customer presence in how we push our pricing efforts. Michael Feniger : Very helpful. And just last one, Devina, you mentioned how the cost inflation stepped up from 7.5% in the second half to 9%. Now obviously, you guys are driving price. I'm just curious, what's kind of embedded on that full year cost inflation? Because I know there's expectations that that's going to moderate with the cost. But how should we kind of think about that plus 9% number for the full year? Devina Rankin : We generally look at our cost of inflation at 3% to 4%. So just the normal course would be at that level. And so you can see that we're meaningfully higher than that now. our expectation in the back half of the year isn't necessarily that we get all the way back down to 3% to 4% that we land somewhere in the teens. Operator : And our next question is from Kevin Chiang of CIBC. Kevin Chiang : I'll be quick here. Congrats -- first of all all, congrats on a good quarter. Maybe just on the comments, you made it a few times, Jim, just on the data analytics and the demand from national accounts or larger customers and requiring this data as they go on their sustainability path. Is that something you charge for? Is that looking to accelerate revenue service that you're offering? And if not, does it become an ancillary revenue service? I suspect more customers are going to need to kind of track their Scope 3 emissions and their broader environmental footprint? James Fish : Yes, it's a good question, Kevin. We don't currently charge kind of a separate price for it. It's packaged together in our service offering from national accounts. But it's an interesting -- it's kind of an interesting prospect that could we charge something. And it's something we've thought about, could we charge for these separate services related to data and analytics. So for today, the answer is it's a packaged deal for tomorrow, potentially something we could charge for separately. Kevin Chiang : Okay. That's helpful. And that's kind of a follow-on question. You kind of mentioned again this is one of the levers you're pulling on to grow volumes above about what the market is doing when you're taking share. I suspect the smaller accounts that this might not be a service as appealing to them. So I suspect you're solving other pain points for customers as you grab that market share and it doesn't feel like you're getting aggressive on price to win volume. So what are some of the other pain points you might be solving for, let's say, smaller accounts that onboard with waste management if it's nothing pricing driven? James Fish : I think the sustainability piece should be important to everybody, but you're right. I mean it tends to be more important to the bigger customers. When we think about the digital approach that we've taken to customer experience, that impacts everyone as well, and that may be even more heavily used with smaller customers. I refer to the airlines a lot and what they did on the front end of their operation with moving away from the call centers 20 years ago. So we're in that process now where we're digitalizing that entire customer experience and everything can be handled via your personal device or your laptop at home and you don't have to reach out to a call center. That's why we've said, look, for those positions as they as they attrit, we've made a decision to not replace many of those, and that starts in kind of Q2, Q3 of this year. Operator : And there are no further questions on queue. I will now turn the call over to President and CEO, Jim Fish. James Fish : All right. Thank you. Well, I guess it goes without saying that we're very pleased with the quarter. The short-term outlook is very bright for us even with some of the economic pressures that were discussed today. But I think most importantly, we're really focused on this strategy that produces, we think, great results and differentiated results over the next 3 to 5 to even 10 years. We're excited to see the results of those. So thank you all for joining us this morning, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call.Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of WM is prohibited.  Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish. James Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The strength and resiliency of our business was clearly on display in the second quarter as we built on our first quarter momentum to deliver results that exceeded our expectations. Our teams remain focused on recovering inflationary cost pressures with our strongest-ever core price yield results. Our pricing results, combined with volume growth and sustainability contributions, drove quarterly revenue above $5 billion for the first time. Our robust revenue growth translated into operating -- into adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7.8%, which is above the upper end of our long-term growth profile of 5% to 7%.  Cash from operations remained strong in the second quarter, positioning us to return more than $0.5 billion of cash to our shareholders to bring the year-to-date total of shareholder returns to more than $1 billion. You'll hear more details from Devina, but our strong start to the year gives us confidence to increase our 2022 outlook for revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow. In the second quarter, we continued to see strong volumes, an encouraging sign for economic activity across the areas we serve. Currently, our key business indicators point to continued positive economic activity. That said, WM is well positioned in any economic environment. Our resilient business model is underpinned by our diverse customer base and essential nature -- the essential nature of our service and the annuity-like characteristics of about 75% of our revenue.  We continue to advance our long-term strategic priorities of providing the best workplace for our employees, investing in technology and automation that differentiates WM and permanently reduces our cost to serve and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Investing in making WM a great place to build a career while also reducing our labor dependency through attrition and automation together position us to navigate this tight labor market. In our sustainability growth journey, we achieved 2 exciting milestones in the second quarter. We opened our fifth WM owned and operated RNG plant in Oklahoma, the first of the 17 new RNG facilities we announced, that are expected to add 21 million MMBtu of RNG to our renewable energy portfolio by 2026. We expect to complete construction on the next RNG facility by the end of the year.  On the recycling front, we brought online our Houston MRF, the sixth redesigned recycling facility utilizing advanced technology to reduce labor and improve product quality. Our advanced technology MRFs are yielding tangible benefits, resulting in about a 30% labor cost savings per ton compared to the rest of the single-stream network. In the second half of the year, we expect to open 2 additional advanced technology recycling facilities and enter a new recycling market, keeping us on track to meet our recycling investment goals.  I want to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation priorities, particularly related to M&A. Our strong operating EBITDA growth has allowed us to absorb the $4.6 billion acquisition of Advanced Disposal and quickly return our balance sheet to pre-ADS leverage levels. We consider a typical M&A year to be between $100 million and $200 million of acquisitions. This year, we have the strongest pipeline we've had in a long time and expect to close between $300 million and $400 million of acquisitions. We will remain disciplined in our approach to traditional solid waste tuck-in and recycling acquisitions to maintain our strong financial position and generate industry-leading returns. Our cash generation plus our strong balance sheet affords us the ability to allocate capital to our priorities, investing in organic growth and sustainability initiatives, predictably growing our dividends, completing accretive acquisitions and returning cash through share repurchases.  In conclusion, I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. I'm excited about the remainder of 2022 as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our team members, customers, communities and shareholders.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Once again, we achieved exceptional organic revenue growth in the second quarter, led by collection and disposal yield of 6.2%. Our pricing accelerated sequentially as we continue to address persistent inflationary cost pressures throughout the business.  Second quarter core price increased 20 basis points from the first quarter to a record 7.5%. Core price was strong across every line of business, and we had standout performance of 10.6% in our industrial business and 9.4% in our commercial business. Customer receptivity to our pricing remains strong as second quarter churn, adjusted for the intentional loss of an unprofitable national account contract, was 9%. We remain confident that our pricing strategies are appropriately responsive to rising costs while prioritizing customer lifetime value. Our teams continue to be focused on disciplined pricing in the second half of the year, and we now expect 2022 core price of more than 7% and collection and disposal yield approaching 6%.  Key indicators in our business continue to signal healthy economic activity in the quarter. Second quarter collection and disposal volume grew 2.3% with commercial volumes growing 1.6% and special waste volumes up more than 19%. Additionally, new business exceeded lost business as service increases continue to outpace service decreases by a wide margin. Second half volumes are expected to remain strong and for the full year, we expect collection and disposal volume growth of about 2.5%. Our teams remain focused on controlling operating cost. Adjusted operating expenses were 62.4% of revenue in the second quarter, a 130 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was largely driven by fuel and commodity price impacts, 70 basis points from higher fuel costs, 30 basis points related to the alternative fuel tax credits received in 2021 that have not yet been renewed for 2022 and 30 basis points from the impact of higher commodity prices on our recycling brokerage business. In the second quarter, we again saw high single-digit inflation in our costs, and we are managing through this with both pricing and cost controls. Our core price is recovering our cost of inflation in each line of business, except residential, where the impacts of higher labor costs are most pronounced. In that line of business, our conversion of approximately 2,000 railroad routes to automated side loaders will both reduce labor and significantly improve efficiency. This is one of the ways where we are investing in technology to reduce our dependency on certain high-turnover positions.  Additionally, early results from our pilot programs to fully optimize our roll-off routes are showing efficiency gains in the range of high single to low double-digit percentage increases. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect inflationary cost pressures to ease on a year-over-year basis given the proactive steps we took to raise frontline wages in the second half of 2021.  As Jim mentioned, we're excited about growth opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, and both businesses continue to deliver strong results. Together, recycling and renewable energy contributed $19 million of operating EBITDA growth in the second quarter. The recycling business is on track to deliver results on par or modestly higher than the record earnings we achieved in 2021. Our blended average recycling stream commodity price was $131 per ton in the second quarter, and we continue to expect a full year average of $125 per ton. In the renewable energy business, better pricing for renewable natural gas, electricity and environmental credits is driving our full year outlook for this business higher than our original guidance by $35 million to $45 million. Overall, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations as we demonstrated our ability to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and manage costs.  I'm extremely proud of having the entire WM team work together to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning. The strong operating and financial results of the second quarter confirmed a number of important indicators we saw emerge in Q1, positioning us to increase our full year financial outlook. I'll cover our updated guidance in a moment, but I want to give a little more color around our second quarter and year-to-date financials first.  As John discussed, our results have been driven by robust organic growth, led by our disciplined pricing focus as well as diligent cost management. Proactive management of our SG&A has been an important element of those cost management efforts. In the second quarter, adjusted SG&A was 9.4% of revenue, a 20 basis point improvement over the same period in 2021. We accomplished this result in spite of an increase in incentive compensation due to our focus on controlling discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the customer sales and back office functions. We are on track to deliver SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 9.6% for the full year.  Operating EBITDA increased more than $100 million in the second quarter, driven by an increase in the operating EBITDA of our collection and disposal business of $107 million. Operating EBITDA margin in the quarter was 28.1%, a 50 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2022. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full year margin outlook, which is a particularly strong result given the dilutive impacts from rising fuel costs, which we now estimate could be about 60 basis points for the year. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was up $142 million or about 6.5% from the prior year, which has been driven by operating EBITDA growth of over 9%. Cash flow from operations growth was slightly muted relative to operating EBITDA growth due to higher cash taxes, which will continue throughout the year, and working capital pressure that we expect to moderate over the remainder of the year.  During the first half of the year, we've invested $856 million in capital to support the business, and we invested an additional $112 million to support the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Our year-to-date free cash flow, which includes the impact of capital outlays to support our sustainability growth investments, is $1.35 billion, putting us on pace to exceed the upper end of our initial 2022 guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion.  While the pace of capital spending has been slower than expected in the first half of 2022, we currently expect truck deliveries, landfill construction and sustainability capital projects to ramp in the second half of the year. We're encouraged to see supply chain constraints in certain asset categories begin to show promising signs of improvement, though we are proactively managing the business in anticipation of the longer delivery schedules we've experienced over the last year. We will revisit capital and free cash flow guidance in more detail next quarter.  As Jim discussed, we are well positioned to allocate free cash flow among all our capital allocation priorities. In addition to increased acquisition expectations for the year, we now expect to allocate our full $1.5 billion authorization to share repurchases.  Turning now to our updated 2022 guidance. We expect revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. The $175 million increase in operating EBITDA guidance is driven by more than $325 million from increased price and volume performance and $40 million from better performance in the renewable energy business. Those things are partially offset by approximately $190 million of higher costs, which were driven by a combination of inflation pressure and incentive compensation.  Note that this outlook assumes fuel prices remain at June levels for the second half of the year, equating to a 60 basis point drag to full year operating EBITDA margin. Even still, we expect to deliver margin of 28.1% at the midpoint of our guidance. We remain optimistic that the alternative fuel tax credits will be approved in 2022 and continue to include the approximately $55 million benefit we would expect to receive in our outlook.  In closing, our excellent first half performance sets us up to deliver another year of strong financial growth in 2022. I can't thank the WM team enough for all their contributions to our success.  With that, Valerie, you let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Brown : You guys threw out quite a bit in the prepared remarks, but I just want to make sure I have it. So on the down 120 basis points on the margin walk, it was 70 basis points from fuel, 30 from the CNG credit and 30 from commodities. Is that right? Devina Rankin : That's right. And that's looking at the operating expense line, so we would also -- for the EBITDA margin, and I think it's important in thinking about EBITDA margin in 2 pieces. So one is how did we perform relative to the expectations that we laid out at the beginning of the year. And what we can say there is that we're extremely pleased. And really, our outperformance relative to expectations is in 2 places, and that's our traditional solid waste business that outperformed expectations by about 40 basis points and the renewable energy business that outperformed expectations by 20 basis points.  As we've mentioned, we've had a couple of headwinds relative to our initial expectations, and those headwinds are fuel and the alternative fuel tax credits as well as incentive compensation. But when we put all of that together and think about our outlook for the full year and our performance in the first half, particularly relative to our original guidance, we can say that we're 60 basis points ahead of expectations on base performance, and that's a really strong outlook. When we look at Q2 specifically, the walk forward between the 29.3% that we achieved in Q2 of '21, which I'll remind everyone, is the best quarterly performance that we've had in our history from a margin perspective, to what we delivered at 28.1% today for Q2, really, fuel is the story there in terms of that walk forward.  So what you saw in that 120 basis points is 80 basis points led by fuel. And that 80 basis points is 50 basis points from higher fuel costs, 30 basis points from the alternative fuel tax credits. Recycling was 40 basis points negative, that was in line with expectations. 30 basis points of that is from the brokerage business that we talk about, where it's effectively pass-through revenue. So higher commodity prices just translates into pretty much a dollar-for-dollar increase in cost. And then the other piece of that was higher incentive compensation cost at 30 basis points.  So really happy with the strong performance of the solid waste business, and I think that's the highlight when you look at the margins for the business in the quarter. James Fish : That's why she's the CFO, Tyler. Patrick Brown : Yes, I was going to say that was extremely helpful, very detailed. So real quickly, not to focus too much on the margins, but it does feel like you're looking for a margin uplift in the back half, I think, somewhere circa, call it 50 basis points. But I just want to kind of think about it conceptually. So is it that the pricing contribution will kind of hang around the same place, but your unit cost inflation kind of eases? Because I think John talked about it, you pulled some frontline wages, I believe, forward in the back half of '21. Is that kind of how that will work? James Fish : Yes, I think that's right, Tyler. I mean, listen, we got out from the labor issue kind of Q2, Q3 last year. So we feel like while we're still seeing labor inflation, it's not going to be at the same rate. And there's other obviously inflationary pressures, but I think you got it right. Patrick Brown : Okay. Great. And just my last one, John, just real quick. Can you remind us what percent of your revenue is, call it, temporary roll-off in C&D landfill volumes? Just I've been getting some questions about housing, just kind of your exposure there. John Morris : Yes, we're not really exposed too much there, Tyler. The temp C&D business is low single digits. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Nice quarter. I'm wondering if we could trouble you just for an update on how pricing is tracking now that your landfill gas facilities are coming online. Jim, how are you feeling about the pricing point relative to the mid-20s that you underwrote the investments in? And is the offtake market developing? James Fish : So I thought you were going to go down to the solid waste pricing path. But on RNG, look, I think our expectation here is that -- we built in $2.80, Jerry, for the back half of the year. We think that's pretty comfortable. As you know, based on our discussions, and we're with you that the business was pro forma-ed at much lower numbers. And even at those lower numbers, $2 for RIN and $2.50 in natural gas, even at those lower numbers, this is an outstanding business in terms of the returns. But specifically for the back half of '22, our expectation is that we'll see $2.80 in RIN pricing, and we feel comfortable with that number. Jerry Revich : And Jim, in terms of the offtake market, is that developing? What's your level of inbounds for folks that are looking to lock in long-term agreements? And can you comment on how those conversations are going? James Fish : Yes, Jerry. I would tell you that we're obviously -- the RIN market is what it is, and that's a part of our portfolio. But we have started to become -- and I think last quarter or the quarter before, started to do some direct offtakes for renewable natural gas. And we're seeing good momentum in some of those contracted rates. Jerry Revich : Okay. Super. And Jim, since you want to talk about it, the solid waste pricing. Can we talk about that? So big CPI tailwind into next year, obviously positive revision to pricing over the course of this year. As you look at the book of business today, what's your best sense for how pricing might look in '23? It feels like just with CPI pricing rolling and the timing of C&I increases, you probably have 5 points of core price already in your back pocket entering '23. But I'm wondering if you could comment on that. James Fish : Well, you're absolutely right, Jerry, about the tailwind on those businesses that are driven by an index-type increase. The 12-month lag that we've talked a lot about really starts to help us most significantly in the first quarter of next year.  So if we believe that CPI has gotten pretty close to the top here at 9.1%, then we would see pricing -- let's just assume for the sake of discussion that inflation starts to taper back down. I think you'd see pricing in those open market businesses follow that down but not exactly. I think we've kind of talked about it compared to banks, for example, where their spreads are better at lower rates. And I think that's what you would see with our pricing is that if inflation starts to really taper back down, that you'd see a bigger percentage of our price go to margin improvement, not just cost recovery. Right now, we're kind of in a street fight trying to cover costs at 9.1% CPI.  And then with respect to your initial question, yes. When we get to really the first half of 2023, and recall that what we said about those index-driven price increases is that -- about 70% of that takes place in the first half of every year and 30% takes place in the second half of the year. So we will see some tailwind in the second half of 2022 from CPI, but it's just not as pronounced because only 30% of the revenue is getting it.  When we get to the first half of 2023 is when we get the real tailwind in -- it's primarily residential because that's the line of business that is most tied to an index. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Jim, I'd like to follow-up on the price conversation because I think this is one of the most critical issues the industry has going for it. So tackling what you just said and summarizing it, you're about 60-40 open market versus index, and I get the weighting first half, second half. But if CPI goes to 3%, you're still going to get a good spread to it, call it 100, 150 basis points in your open market. And then you're going to have your index at an 8-something, maybe closer to 9%. In just the algebra formula, there is a greater price in '23 than I am in '22 before I factor in churn. That's the math, right? James Fish : I think you're spot on, Michael. I mean, look, we're not crazy about 9.1% inflation. And as I said, we're doing everything we can with price and doing a good job with it, but to cover our cost. If inflation comes back down to a more reasonable number, let's call it 3% over the next kind of 2 to 3 quarters, then I think we have a greater percentage of our price that actually goes to margin improvement and not just focused on cost recovery, which is kind of where we are today with the open market pricing. Michael Hoffman : Right. And so I was thinking -- go ahead, John, sorry. John Morris : I was just going to say, Michael, I think the one caveat to that is what we're specifically doing in residential. And you can see that we continue to make progress on the core price side and the yield side, and we're still being pretty deliberate about what volume we're going to keep and what volume we're not going to keep. That would be the one caveat to what Jim commented on. Michael Hoffman : Yes. And I get that, and I keep trying to convince the market you're supposed to pay attention to price, not volume, because at the end of the day, you'll have a better quality business. So the other part of the price question that keeps coming up and we try to help the market understand is how sticky unit prices are. So the rate of change in open market might go from a 7 core to a 5 core, but the underlying unit prices are very, very sticky, price per yard, price per ton, price per pull. Can we help everybody appreciate the significance of that as well? John Morris : We consider our business to be very price-inelastic. And the reason is that it's such a small percentage of the customer's overall cost structure. I mean, we've estimated it differs a little bit whether you're a residential customer versus a business customer, but it's probably 0.5% of a small business' overall spend. And then when you add to that what we're doing to truly differentiate ourselves, those 2 things cause pricing to be pretty darn sticky for us. So you're right. It is -- we tend to hold on to more of it than maybe other businesses might. James Fish : Right. And my point being is if all of this unwinds from an inflationary standpoint or there's a recession, you don't walk back unit prices. You hold on to the unit price, plus I've got the favorable trend of higher price versus underlying internal cost of inflation in '23. The power of that is pretty compelling. John Morris : Yes. No, that's right. I mean, the unit price stays where it is. And then it's just about the percentage, which is yield or core price. Those are percentage growth figures. And we think that the percentage growth figure, as I've said, does kind of taper down as inflation comes down, but the spread improves a bit. So we have a little bit more that goes towards margin improvement at 3% CPI than we do at 9.1% CPI. Michael Hoffman : The RIN recycling upside of $35 million to $45 million, I'm assuming that's mostly all weighted in the first half because the RIN's coming down, recycling's come down sequentially. And so the benefit of that has already been captured. Devina Rankin : So I'll take that in 2 pieces, Michael. On the recycling side of the business, we were better in the first half about $28 million. We expect actually to give some of that up in the second half of the year. So we expect about $20 million to $25 million of earnings pressure in the second half just because of where commodity prices were in the second half of '21 relative to what we expect them to be in the second half of '22. On the renewable energy side, we have captured $27 million in the first half of '21 -- or '22, and we expect another $10 million to $20 million of incremental earnings in the back half. So when you net those 2, we expect to be down in the, call it, $10 million to $15 million range. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's very helpful. And then Devina, on the guide at the beginning of the year, you framed it as negative 100 basis points of headwind. First half, plus 100 to 140; second half, sort of 0 to 40 up. You were actually pretty close to the negative 100, a little less actually. But you're now telling us it's less than positive 100, 140 in the second half. That's if we're revising part of the messaging, that's the other part of it? Devina Rankin : That's right. But what I would say is the plus 100 to plus 140 now looks more like, call it, plus 80 to plus 120. And when you consider the impact of fuel at 60 basis points, that really does speak to the strength of the underlying fundamentals of solid waste and the incremental benefit of the renewable energy business relative to our initial expectations. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. And just to be clear, that 60 basis points is just a pass-through math. It's not a real cost impact. It's -- you offset the cost increase with the surcharge, and it's just the pass-through math. Devina Rankin : Yes, that's right. From an earnings perspective, you'll really -- should be a zero-sum game for us. What we see on the fuel surcharge side of revenue growth, what we had in Q1 -- or Q2, I'm sorry, was $129 million. We expect similar levels, maybe a moderate decrease in the second half of the year on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But that effectively is a dollar-for-dollar offset as higher operating costs, both for direct fuel and our indirect costs from subcontractor costs and other transfer elements of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : My first question is just maybe you could frame for us how this business you think will perform in a new recession. I know the business is pretty resilient. I know most companies are not seeing a downturn either yet, but -- just the reason I ask that question is the sector is pretty different from '09, when volumes fell 10% and it took a lot longer to recover.  And then most investors kind of have the COVID year in front of them, where your internal revenue growth, I guess, was negative 3%. That was more of a shock to the system. But just frame for us how your business is different. We're clearly seeing pricing, how the sector is more disciplined. Just frame for us your downturn playbook and just resiliency of this business. I know it also lags going into a downturn. James Fish : Thanks, Hamzah. So you really kind of talked about it, primarily volume, right? But there's a couple of different components to your question here. I'll tell you what gives us cause for optimism here. We knew that 99% of the focus on this call is going to be about forward-looking statements. So a couple of things. First of all, I mentioned that on the price side, we -- to Michael's question, we have a very price-inelastic customer base. That's a real positive in terms of the stickiness of price, and price is one of the big 3. If I think of the big 3 being price, volume and cost control, we feel really good about price.  If we think about volume a little bit, and so just maybe a little bit of inside baseball here. We just had our 16 area vice presidents on for their quarterly reviews, and almost to a person, they're feeling really optimistic about their own individual areas. And when we look at our July numbers in terms of volume, they look pretty good. I mean, they look basically exactly like we saw in June. You have to kind of consider that we had 1 less work day. Fourth of July this year was on Monday, last year was on Sunday. So there's a little bit of -- we have to consider that. And we also are, on the commercial side, considering things like we intentionally shed a big national account that affected us by almost 1 percentage point.  And -- but if we factor those onetime things out, volume still looks pretty good. And the most forward-looking component of our volume is special waste. It was up 19% for Q2. But as we look out towards what the pipeline is telling us in -- for the remainder of the year, it still looks really good. Our volume in the first 3 weeks of July looks good in that special waste stream. So that's 2 of the big 3 there.  And I would also tell you, Hamzah, to your question about why we're different from other industries. I don't know that we're different from other industries necessarily. But our company, we do believe that we're starting to take some share. It's a tough operating market, a really tough operating market for a lot of companies. John talked a bit about this labor shortage, and I don't think that's a short-term trend. That is a long-term trend. That's why we've talked about kind of the third of the big 3, which is cost control and taking advantage of the attrition in our business, the cost categories that we're looking at, not backfilling for have -- some of them have 50% turnover.  So why go through that hamster wheel every single day? Why not use technology to let some of those jobs have attrit away and actually use that to our benefit? And the -- most other companies out there in our space just don't have the technology or the wherewithal. So some of this that ultimately makes us look better even in a recessionary environment is that we feel good about taking share in a tough operating climate. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Very helpful. And just you had flagged an above-normal M&A year. I know it's still sort of $300 million, $400 million figure. But just maybe frame for us, what's driving that? How long do you think an above-normal M&A environment could last? And any change in valuations you're seeing in the private market? James Fish : Yes. So I just talked about the fact that it is a bit of a tough operating environment out there for a lot of companies. And so what we don't want to do and we've said this on several of our previous calls, we don't want to bail somebody out of a problem. I mean, we're still going to be conservative when it comes to valuations.  But we think there's some really good companies out there that are not asking for ridiculous prices, purchase prices, and those are attractive to us. And we see enough of those to say that in the solid waste space and in the recycling space, we feel more like a $300 million to $400 million a year versus more of our traditional $100 million to $200 million is appropriate. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Just a clarification question and I'll turn it over, just for Devina. I think you had flagged $129 million sort of out of the $153 million that's fuel surcharge recovery in Q2. Just comparing that number, did you mention sort of how much fuel increased for you, when we're looking at that $129 million number? What did your cost increase for fuel just comparing the $129 million? Was it over $100 million or less than $100 million? Just any sense there. Devina Rankin : It was effectively equal. So it was a combination of direct fuel and indirect. So the indirect will show up in lines like the subcontractor category. So you can think of it effectively like a dollar-for-dollar offset. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Eastman : I just wanted to come back to inflation. Last quarter, you guys quoted, I think, around 9%. Wondering what that was in the second quarter. And just this dynamic around comping the heavy wage increases. Last year, it was interesting how we think about how that part of the inflation algorithm trends into the second half. But what else should we be aware of in terms of what's happening under the hood in terms of inflation? I mean, outside of wages, are things still ramping, cooling off? Any color on that element would be helpful. John Morris : Yes, Sean, I think the commentary on labor, we got out front of it last year. And we see, while it's not going all the way down, it's going to moderate in the back half of the year because of the intentional steps we took last year. Devina touched on it, but we're still seeing inflationary pressure on third party on maintenance and repair. Subcontractors is one that sticks out. And clearly, whether it's by rail or by truck, we're seeing the fuel impact there as well. That's a big chunk of the indirect pressure we're seeing. And I think the commodity piece runs through that a little bit as well. When you think about third-party maintenance and repairs, there's a commodity element to that.  So I would tell you that I feel like it's peaked, generally speaking. And I think the benefit we'll see is in terms of what we did with our labor, which is a big chunk of our operating expense line. James Fish : I do think, Sean, that Devina touched on it in her remarks. But the supply chain itself, I mean, she mentioned that we're seeing a little bit of easing there, and that is true. But that's pretty important to us, particularly as you think about the delivery of trucks to us. I mean, last year, we didn't get the trucks that we ordered. And so far this year, we have not gotten to the number that we expected. We're hopeful that in the back half of the year, we start to see a pretty significant ramp-up there in the vehicles that we've ordered. That's a pretty important part of the inflation picture because, as John mentioned, maintenance cost is not insignificant as a cost line item. And that obviously is impacted as you're having to keep older trucks in the fleet. Sean Eastman : Okay. That's interesting and kind of a segue into my next question. I think in the prepared remarks, you guys had mentioned that capital spending is running a little below expectations in the first half. Maybe you'd revisit that guidance next quarter. I mean, is it really just trucks we're talking about here? I wondered if some of these capital spending delays also are being seen around the sustainability investment program. And whether there's any risk to that incremental EBITDA we're expecting to see roll out of those investments into next year. Devina Rankin : Yes, great question, Sean. First and foremost, I would say it's important to hear the message that we are very confident with the rollout of our sustainability initiatives, and those investments are on track. We talked about both the renewable energy facility and the recycling facility coming online and expectations for the remainder of the year there. It continue to be strong relative to our initial expectations. So when we look at capital being below our guided levels, it really is more in the traditional solid waste space and specifically for trucks. As Jim just mentioned, our truck deliveries in 2022 has really been slow relative to our initial expectations. And even after we saw Q1 unfold, we revised those expectations, and they're still below what we had expected at that point in time. So as we look at how we spend our capital, we're adapting for that slowdown on the truck front. And we're looking at places across the rest of our business to proactively pull forward capital, whether it be in the landfill line of business where we've seen strong volumes, particularly in special waste, or as we look at other parts of the business that are performing well and have continued investment opportunities because those returns have been strong.  So overall, what I would tell you is we still need Q3 to unfold before we can give you the additional detail on the traditional capital part. I would tell you, at this point, we completely expect to stand firm on the sustainability capital at about $550 million for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Actually, that last question really feeds into what I wanted to ask about, which is kind of the medium to longer-term planning for some of the investments that, Jim and John, you've talked about in terms of ramping up ASL's percentage within the fleet, of course, the recycling automation. But just generally, these investments that are helping to reduce your labor intensity, can you kind of outline for us? You talked about where you want to be in 4 years. How should we think about maybe the next couple of years? Hopefully, you put some of these supply chain constraints behind us. But can you just talk maybe about 24 to 48 months -- sorry, a 12- to 24-month type expectation for where you think you can get to? James Fish : So I think that what you're talking about, your question is really around -- is it where we expect to be with respect to capital? Or is it about what we think the impact will be from an operating standpoint by not backfilling some of these roles? Just so we're clear. Noah Kaye : It's both, right, because we understand that one will follow the other. So... James Fish : Okay. So let's talk about the capital piece first. And if I just think about kind of the big buckets around where -- I've talked about 5,000 to 7,000 positions that we wouldn't refill. The big bucket's, as John mentioned, shifting from a rear-load truck to an ASL truck. There's about -- if you think about a rear-load being maybe a $280,000, $300,000 truck and ASL is maybe $100,000 more, so there is some additional capital going to an ASL. But really, if you think about that, that pays itself off in almost in 1 year's time because you're taking a helper off the back, and you're picking up a pretty significant chunk of productivity there.  We've done this many times, moving from rear-load to ASL, and the pickup in efficiency is about 15%. And then you take a helper off the back, the all-in cost of -- a lot of those are actually temp laborers. So we're paying a temp firm, might be $75,000 to $100,000 all in for that person on the back of the trucks. So it pays itself back almost in a year's time. That's bucket one. So there is some additional CapEx for the truck, but the OpEx goes away pretty fast. If we think about another bucket, we've talked a lot about recycling. And we've said kind of somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,200 positions there as we -- and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've seen 30% reduction in the labor cost at those first 5 that we've done. And we think it's anywhere between 30% and 50% reduction. So one of the plants that we rebuilt was in Salt Lake City. That one actually was closer to 50% reduction in labor. So it's a range of how much labor comes out and the capital is already accounted for. We've already talked about the $800 million-ish over a period of 4 years, that's in that number. And then we also, in recycling, gets an improved quality of the material at the back end of the plant, and that doesn't show up in -- that shows up in top line revenue. Use Salt Lake as an example there. Previously, before we rebuilt the plant, they were having to sell all their mixed paper as a low-grade paper. Now they're able to separate it. And they have a pretty big component of the high-grade paper that obviously comes at a higher price. John Morris : The only thing I would add to what Jim has already said is we're taking kind of a total cost of operation view. Residential is a good view of that between capital and OpEx. And I would tell you, the other thing that's happening is when we started down this past few years ago, recycling and residential are 2 good examples. Kind of the calculus we were doing then, in this labor inflationary environment, those are actually -- those investments are getting better as we go along. As Jim mentioned, I don't think any of us think this labor shortage or the labor wage pressure is going to abate anytime soon. So as we continue to invest, these pro formas actually look better as time goes on. James Fish : Yes. So to kind of complete the answer there -- and good color, John. Thank you. It is -- what do we expect this impact to be? I mean, look, put a number on -- put whatever number you want on those 5,000 to 7,000 positions that don't get refilled. The good news is that this is not your traditional, okay, we're going to rip 10% of the workforce. That's not at all what this is. This is a very strategic approach to reducing our labor dependency by taking advantage of these very high-turnover numbers in some of these jobs. And so the cost of -- the exit cost is just very low. The capital cost is largely accounted for. And the operating improvements, whether it's SG&A or operating cost, if it's 5,000 jobs, let's put a number on that of $50,000 to $100,000 per, it's a big -- it's a material impact to OpEx and to SG&A. If it's at the higher end of that job range, 7,000, then it becomes even better. Noah Kaye : Yes. That's great color. Just wanted to get a little bit of color as well on the M&A pipeline, and good to see you coming back in greater force to the market. But is this primarily traditional solid waste? Is it recycling? Can you give us a sense of the mix in terms of where you're seeing the opportunities? James Fish : It's a little bit of both. I mean we kind of consider -- we consider recycling to be traditional solid waste, but it's a bit of both. We announced the continuous investments last quarter or a couple of quarters ago and which is taking low-value plastics that we weren't getting paid a lot for and some of those mixed papers that I mentioned that are low value as well, and combining them and making a roofing material. And so there's a little bit of both in this. How do we take material that is, for example, coming into the landfill today that really doesn't add a lot of value, that maybe is light? I mean if I'm thinking about plastics, plastics are very light, but plastics are also very recyclable. And so it's -- we're already doing everything we can with things like PET and HDPE, going through a traditional single stream. Are there other things we can do with plastics that come into the landfill? Taking them out of the landfill, where it doesn't decompose for 700 years or something, and doing something that's both environmentally and economically favorable to the existing model.  And then you're right, the other piece is just very traditional solid waste acquisitions, tuck-ins, that -- where we may have kind of a hole in our network or we've got something that feels like it's -- it would be additive and makes a lot of sense for us at a reasonable valuation. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC. Walter Spracklin : So I'd like to keep on the M&A front. You're doing 2x to 3x this year what you would do in a normal year. When you look at the addressable market for acquisitions and look at what's not held by the majors, do you see that entire market as being in your sights? Or would you consider some lower portion of that as being where you would focus your attention over the coming -- and I'm not saying this year, over the coming 5, 10 years in scope? James Fish : I guess if we're talking geography, we're a North American company. So we really haven't looked outside of North America for a big -- for any type of solid waste acquisition. Obviously, that doesn't meet the definition of a tuck-in anyway because we don't have operations overseas. So yes, within North America, when we look at these acquisitions, we're always looking at where it makes the most sense strategically for us and where we can bring it -- by the way, Walter, it's part of what -- of why we're excited about the -- this reduction in labor dependency.  It enables us -- if we believe that our competition can't do the same thing, that they're not able to use technology to reduce their labor dependency, then it gives us the ability to bring more synergies to the table when we acquire a company. So I think we're -- everything would be on the table within North America. And then, of course, if it requires a filing of some type, then we'll have Justice look at it. But we always feel like we want to be conservative on valuations, and that's maybe the single most important piece is does it meet our strategic goals? And is it valued properly? Walter Spracklin : I guess, not only does it bring in more synergies, Jim, it also makes it harder for those mom-and-pops to compete with you and perhaps drive more to you, given that they can't match your technological investment. Is that fair to say? James Fish : Yes. Look, I mean, it's -- I don't think it's against the rules to say that trying to reduce our cost structure is something that's very important to us. And to the extent that somebody else can't do that, that's their problem, not ours. I mean -- but it does present an opportunity. It's why we're seeing a pretty robust pipeline here.  I think there's a lot of companies out there that say, look, I'm not going to -- I don't want to be an HR coordinator 24/7. And I don't want to make the investments in technology to try and do the same thing that WM is doing, so I'll turn around and sell to them at a reasonable valuation. And that's okay. Walter Spracklin : That makes sense. As we -- as that market kind of gets acquired by yourselves and your -- and the larger majors, I know, Jim, you've talked a little bit about the potential for going a little further afield and possibly into hazardous. And is that still an option for you?  And would you go even further? I mean, we always worry a little bit about it getting beyond our core competency. So just curious, your view on what is an addressable market for Waste Management outside of solid or even outside of hazardous waste. James Fish : No, I think we're kind of staying away from just strictly kind of a services-type business. And yes, there are some ancillary businesses that might be interesting to us. But at this point, there's -- as we've talked about, there's such a nice robust pipeline of just traditional solid waste that we feel like we can focus there. And then add to that a little bit of the recycling-type businesses that I mentioned earlier, and that should take up all of our time. Operator : Our next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. James Fish : We lost Dave. He fell off the screen. Operator : Looks like our next question is going to come from Michael Feniger. James Fish : We've done a good job in answering the questions. Did he miss the call? He just disappeared from the queue. Operator : So our next question comes from Kevin Chiang. Kevin Chiang : Can you hear me? Operator : Yes. Kevin Chiang : Third time's the charm here, I guess. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe just a couple of quick ones for me. It sounds like you're feeling -- you're kind of moving past peak inflation here, but I guess who knows how long it will take to get back to normal inflation. And obviously, you've been pricing to offset inflation dollars. But I'm wondering, has there been a push to capture more of that inflation via core price versus using a surcharge program? I presume, and correct me if I'm wrong, that if you can kind of capture more of that inflation through the core price, it just ends up kind of being stickier as inflation starts to roll over and CPI starts to come down here. James Fish : I think it's -- I think I heard you right. But it's a little bit of a combination of the 2. I mean, there's some surcharges there. We don't really -- we don't capture fuel in our core price or our yield numbers. It truly is designed to just be a pass-through for us. We do have an environmental fee, and that environmental fee does get captured in our price figures. But if that was your question, it's a combination of core price increases. And then also, there's a second component to that, which is holding on to those price increases, and that's why there's always a little bit of give and take in pricing. And that's been the model as long as I've been with the company, as long as we've been in existence, I think. So holding on to a higher percentage of those price increases is an important component. Kevin Chiang : No, that's helpful. No, that's exactly what I was looking for. And then just last one for me. You're talking about some of these -- the repricing of index contracts. You talked about this 12-month lag. Some of the other industries I cover, just given how acute inflation has been, there's been a push to shrink, I guess, that time line between when they start seeing that acute pressure to when they can start repricing for it or start getting compensated for it. Has there been any push on your end to maybe shrink that lag? Has there been any desire from your customers' perspective to shrink that lag like we've seen in maybe some other industries? John Morris : Yes. I think residential is probably a great example of that. If you look at what our core price and yield results have tracked at the last 6, 8, maybe even 10 quarters, it certainly outpaced up in the last couple of quarters what CPI has been. That's not the case the last handful of quarters, which kind of shows you, Kevin, what we're doing on the pricing side to strike the right balance between what we're seeing in our contracted rate escalators, what we're willing to accept going forward.  So I think the most encouraging thing is when you look at that residential line of business, that's probably the best example of that index, we've outpaced what CPI has been. And as I said, the exception is the last couple of quarters. And we've also -- in terms of -- we don't want to necessarily shed the volume, but we want to be profitable. And when you look at the volume trade-offs we did and what's happening on the price side, you're seeing that strategy play out again in this quarter as well. James Fish : And just one last point. That 12-month lag that you talked about is really contractual with these big municipalities. So there's not really an option for us to change that, unless they choose to change their bid specs. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Michael Feniger : Apologies about that. My main question, I know we're up on the hour, Jim, is your margin is going to finish this year at 28.1%. 5 years ago, it was at 28.3%. So it's basically been kind of range-bound. Yet now, you have a very profitable sustainability business with renewables. Your pricing is very strong in Q2. Does it feel like 2023 is when this margin range really breaks out 50 basis points or higher? Just based on where this business is today compared to even where it was 5 years ago? James Fish : Yes. I mean, I think there's been a couple of things that have happened as we've kind of shot for this aspirational number of 30% or whatever it is. Obviously, ADS had an impact on margin. That business was more like a kind of a 24% margin business when we were 28% so digesting that has had an impact on margin. But look, it's been a great acquisition for us. And then all of a sudden, we kind of finished digesting ADS, and then we get this big headwind from fuel. And Devina did a nice job of talking about the fact that it's really -- it's margin-destructive, but it's not earnings-destructive. It's designed to be neutral from an EBITDA standpoint, but it does hurt us on the margin line.  So to the extent that you see a couple of things going on, one is you see us continuing to raise the ADS business up to our level of kind of margin. That will help us. As you see fuel come back down, nothing that we're really doing there to affect margin, but it does have a positive impact on us.  And then the other thing that we've talked a lot about is 2 other things. One is we talked about pricing right now basically covering cost and starting to -- as you see inflation coming down, a bigger component of price goes to margin accretion. So that's number one. And then number 2 is this whole cost piece. As we take -- permanently take cost out of the organization and become less labor dependent, that definitely has an impact on margins. So all of that gives me reason for optimism that as we think about '23 and beyond, I think we will really see margin improvement in the overall business. Devina Rankin : Jim, I think that color was fantastic. The one thing I would emphasize, Michael, in terms of looking at the total company margin over that 5-year period, in addition to what Jim outlined specifically for commodity-based impacts and the ADS acquisition, is that when you think about the investment we're making in technology, it's showing up in our SG&A in a different way than it would have had we effectively decided to have SG&A dollars be to run the business model.  And so what you see from us is that we have a different level of SG&A than we otherwise would have if we weren't making these strategic investments that will provide significant returns over the long term. And so I really do think that you have to consider that aspect of how we have strategically changed over the last 5 years in terms of thinking about how our margins have adapted in that period. Michael Feniger : That was helpful to give us context of how to think about it over that 5-year stretch. And just lastly, Jim, I mean, what do you think is the right level of CPI for the business? What is the sweet spot? Because obviously, CPI of 1% for like that decade clearly doesn't feel like that's a great place for the industry and for your operations. Now CPI at 9%, that's another story.  Is there a sweet spot that you feel like is the right number where it helps you get good pricing resets on those contracts, yet you guys can also handle the cost inflation on the business in terms of also getting productivity savings every year? What would be that CPI sweet spot for the business, you think? James Fish : I mean, it's a good question. I'm not sure I know what the right number is. I can tell you the wrong number is 9.1%. So I don't know where -- we have talked about the fact that as we see inflation drop off and I compare it to banks, I mean, as you know, the banks probably try and do that math as well. Where is the sweet spot for me in terms of rates? And I don't know where the sweet spot is on CPI. It might be 2% or 3%, if I had to kind of pick a number. But I don't know for sure and we haven't really done the math.  But there was no reason to do the math until 1.5 years ago because it's been the same -- it's kind of been sub-2% for most of my career. But now there is a reason to try and answer that question, and we'll do a bit of work on it. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : A macro question. So you're not seeing a slowdown within the -- at this point despite maybe some increased caution on the macro environment in general. But are there any particular industries within commercial, for example, that are just being a little bit more cautious? That the conversations have changed a little bit? James Fish : Well, you're right, Toni. I mean, there's a ton of speculation out there about what this -- when does the recession hit, how deep is the recession, how long is it?  I mean, the good news for us is that we are pretty -- I mentioned 75% of our business is pretty resilient to a downturn, so we perform well in any environment. We've talked a lot about special waste the last couple of quarters. And we're -- most of our revenue is kind of more of a lagging indicator. But special waste is the one leading indicator. And we have maybe a couple of leading indicators. One might be our construction and demolition, but that's -- as John said, it's a small part of our business.  Special waste is leading because it's largely industrial-type jobs, and those industrial companies have some discussion as to when they spend a lot of those dollars. And we're not seeing them turn that off. So our special waste was very strong for Q1. It was very strong for Q2, and we continue to be optimistic about special waste. Even when we look at our numbers in the month of July, we still are seeing very positive comparisons in special waste.  So as I think about the macro economy overall, I do think there is a recession coming. I'm not going to kind of buck the trend there because everybody is saying there's one coming. But I just feel like we're in a great industry to weather the storm and, ultimately, with some of the things we're doing with technology and reducing our labor dependency, come out of this thing better than anybody else. Toni Kaplan : Sounds good. And then just as a follow-up, strong results, pricing, and the outlook, obviously raised there. Just wondering if you could talk maybe one on just commercial and industrial pricing this quarter sounded great. Just how are you thinking about pricing, commercial, industrial landfill on -- as the year goes on? James Fish : Well, specific to landfill pricing. I mean, landfill pricing has been a focused area for probably 3 or 4 years for us. It was very good in Q2 and Q1. So we're pleased with the fact that we're able to put landfill pricing through.  And you're asking kind of more specifically around commercial and industrial pricing. Commercial and industrial pricing has been excellent as well. I would tell you that pricing, really across the board, I can't find a weak spot in terms of how we're performing on the price front. Whether it's residential or commercial, industrial landfill, everybody seems to be able to put price through.  I think part of that is that the customer is watching -- they're watching these business shows on TV as well, and they know inflation is out there. They know it's real. And because it's a small -- because our business is a small percentage of their overall spend, they're willing to take the price increase. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Fish, President and CEO, for closing remarks. James Fish : Great. So thanks for joining us today. Just quickly to conclude. At a time when there's so many questions about the outlook from a macro standpoint, we are -- we're really proud to be somewhat of a symbol of stability and strength to our investors.  We stressed today that the short-term outlook looks good for WM, but I think maybe more importantly, we're very excited about and confident in the long-term outlook. The long-term strategy is playing out just as we have expected, just as we communicated way back in 2019 at our Investor Day. And we expect that to play out through, not only the end of '22, but '23, '24 and beyond. So thanks again to everyone for joining us this morning, and we will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect. Have a great day.",

After the speakers presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ed Egl, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ed Egl : Thank you, Katherine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You'll hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover our high-level financials and provide a strategic update. John will cover an operating overview, and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules of the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless stated otherwise, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2021. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA margin and SG&A expense results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of WM is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our team delivered strong results in the third quarter, growing adjusted operating EBITDA by 11% compared to last year. The outperformance is driven by the strength and resiliency of our collection and disposal business. In a quarter where the preponderance of macroeconomic discussion is centered around signs of a slowing economy, WM's collection and disposal operating EBITDA grew by more than 12% and margins expanded 60 basis points. Collection and disposal organic revenue growth was 8.8%, elevating quarterly total revenue -- company revenue to above $5 billion for the second consecutive quarter. The growth was delivered -- excuse me, the growth we delivered was driven by delivered steps to grow revenue and efficiently manage costs, which together, position us to overcome inflationary pressures. Our solid results through the first 9 months of the year position us well to achieve the updated guidance provided last quarter, even with a recent downturn in recycling commodity prices. An important contributor to our improving trend in operating expenses and overall cost structure is the strategic decision to leverage, through automation, the tight labor market and high attrition. John will touch on this as he discusses our significantly improved turnover in more detail. By the end of 2022, we will have reached almost 1,000 full-time positions in difficult-to-source job categories that we've chosen not to refill, putting us well on our way to reducing our labor dependency by 5,000 to 7,000 jobs. We're pleased to see early benefits from our investments to reduce our cost to serve while also differentiating WM by enhancing the customer experience. Continuing on this discussion of our 2023 and beyond strategy, we're very pleased with our investments we're making in both renewable natural gas and recycling businesses. On RNG, we continue to make great progress on building out our new plants as we expect 2023 to be the heaviest capital investment year. We're on track to see meaningful earnings contributions from 2022 and 2023 investments in 2024, with full incremental operating EBITDA contributions coming in 2026, which are conservatively estimated at $400 million. Our recycling business not only provides an important service that our customers want and need, it continues to be a profitable business generating solid returns. We worked hard to adjust our business model over the last several years, and we saw the results of that in the third quarter, particularly in our automated facilities. Our 5 fully automated MRFs are now delivering differentiated results relative to our single stream network, with about 30% lower labor costs, 13% lower total operating costs, nearly double the operating EBITDA margin and most importantly, a 40% improvement in key safety metrics. We're on track to complete four automation projects and add one new MRF in 2022. The significant investments that we're making in growing and automating our MRF network are strengthening the business by reducing costs, increasing throughput and improving product quality. As with our R&D investments, 2023 will be the heaviest year of capital spending, and the rebuilding of our single-stream MRFs was the biggest increase in incremental earnings coming in 2024 and 2025 as the majority of the rebuild and new MRFs come online. Additionally, as part of our commitment to growing our recycling business, we announced that we are acquiring a controlling interest in Avangard Innovative's U.S. business. The planned acquisition will grow our plastics recycling capabilities by delivering circular solutions for films and clear plastic wrap used commercially. We expect to receive investment returns comparable to our recycling automation investments yet on a more prolonged horizon, given that operations are in the early stages of scaling. We plan to provide a more detailed update during our fourth quarter earnings call once the deal closes. Also on the M&A front, we completed more than $200 million of acquisitions in the third quarter, putting us well on our way to our full year expectation of $300 million to $400 million. We closed two nicely-sized solid waste tuck-in acquisitions in Indiana and Arizona during the quarter. These acquisitions are a complement to our existing operations that we expect to generate solid returns and earnings contribution in 2023. And finally, I'm pleased to share that earlier this month, we released our 2022 sustainability report, providing details on our ESG performance and outlining our new 2030 priorities. These new priorities are strongly linked with our overall company strategy and directly support expansion of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Even as we celebrate continued progress in our sustainability journey, we're already focused on driving improvements in the future. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. We're focused on finishing 2022 strong while continuing to progress our investments in recycling, renewable energy and automation to drive growth. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Exceptional organic revenue growth continued to be a key contributor to our strong results in the third quarter, led by collection and disposal yield of 7.1%. Robust core price across every line of business led to third quarter core price of 8.2%, up 70 basis points from the second quarter. We continue to prioritize customer lifetime value in our pricing strategies, and we maintained third quarter churn of 8.7% when adjusted for steps we took to intentionally shed three large unprofitable contracts. We remain focused on disciplined pricing in the fourth quarter, positioning us to achieve our full year revenue growth guidance of about 10%. In the third quarter, volume remained at healthy levels as workday adjusted collection and disposal volume grew by 1.7%, including special waste volume growth of nearly 15%. Commercial volume adjusted for the contract losses I mentioned was 1.4%. We continue to grow volumes as our team's focus on differentiating WM as a preferred service provider. In addition, our teams in Florida are rising to the challenges from Hurricane Ian, taking care of their teammates and communities. While there were increased costs from business disruption and property losses in the quarter related to the hurricane, we are well positioned to handle storm volume as clean-up activity ramped up in fourth quarter. We remain focused on controlling operating costs. Adjusted operating expenses were 62.2% of revenue in the third quarter, in line with prior year. And while we still see high single-digit inflation, our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the solid waste business improved 70 basis points compared to last year. Over last year, we made significant investments in our people, including proactive wage adjustments, an improved benefit package and increased training. Those investments are paying off as driver turnover improved 410 basis points in the past three months, and sequentially, the rate of increase in labor costs improved more than 400 basis points.  [Indiscernible] repair costs remain elevated and are being impacted by the slowdown in truck deliveries, a tight labor market for technicians and higher cost for parts and third-party services. The impact of higher fuel costs increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 50 basis points. This increase was completely offset by the alternative fuel tax credits realized in the third quarter related to the first half of 2022. While cost inflation appears to be easing, the inflationary environment only serves to reinforce our commitment to using technology and automation to reduce our labor dependency across the business and lower our cost to serve. As Jim discussed, we continue to have strong conviction in our recycling business. While global markets drive the value of recycled commodities, the steps we've taken over the past few years to shift around 85% of our third-party volumes to a fee-for-service model provides protection on the downside. So while there is a level of earnings variability, the recycling business is profitable and generate solid returns in any economic environment. Our blended average commodity rate in the third quarter was about $94 per ton. We are assuming a blended commodity value of about $50 per ton for the fourth quarter of 2022, which compares to $132 in the same quarter of 2021. These recent commodity market moves, combined with persistent cost inflation, are expected to be about a $50 million year-over-year headwind to operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter. We're very focused not only managing costs in recycling business but also investing in automation across our MRF network to structurally lower the cost of processed material and achieve better quality, which further enhances the protections afforded by our fee-for-service model while providing profitability lift even in the toughest markets. In the renewable energy business, we continue to see strong performance with operating EBITDA in the first 9 months growing $24 million. The second of our 17 new RNG plants announced at the beginning of the year is on track for completion at the end of the year and is expected to begin generating revenue in the third quarter following EPA certification to generate RINs credits. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, and we continue to operate our business with notable focus on disciplined cost control and responsible revenue quality improvements. I want to thank the entire WM team for their invaluable contributions to our success. I will now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we've seen all year, our team delivered strong results in the third quarter, driven by organic revenue growth, diligent cost management and proactive steps to automate the business. We continue to see improvement in our collection and disposal business as our strategic focuses on fostering a people-first culture and investing in automation are driving nearly tangible results. Adjusted operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew $174 million in the quarter, which contributed to total company operating EBITDA margin expansion of 50 basis points to 28.6%. Performance in the collection and disposal business, net of fuels, drove 120 basis points of margin improvement. Operating EBITDA margins also benefited 50 basis points from the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which secured alternative fuel tax credits through 2024. These 50 basis points relates to the catch-up adjustment we made in the quarter to recognize the benefits of these credits for the first half of 2022. Partially offsetting these very strong results were headwinds of 50 basis points from recycling commodity prices, 30 basis points from the impact of higher fuel costs, 20 basis points from increased technology and automation investments and 20 basis points from damage to some of our facilities and vehicles caused by Hurricane Ian. Proactive management of SG&A continues to be an important element of our business optimization efforts. In the third quarter, SG&A was 9.2% of revenue, a 50 basis point improvement over the same period in 2021. Through the first 9 months of the year, SG&A was 9.6% of revenue, which is consistent with the full year outlook we provided last quarter. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations increased more than 4%, driven by operating EBITDA growth of nearly 10%. Cash flow from operations growth is muted relative to operating EBITDA growth due to higher cash taxes, higher bonus payments, a delay in cash benefits from alternative fuel tax credits and some moderation in working capital benefits from last year when we saw significant benefits from our new source to pay system. Through the first 9 months of the year, capital expenditures have totaled $1,725,000,000 with just over $1.4 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $322 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. As I mentioned in July, we were starting to see some encouraging signs of improvements in truck deliveries, and we're gaining traction on our sustainability investment project. These early indicators continued throughout the third quarter, and we're pleased with the increased pace of capital investment that our teams have secured. We currently expect this accelerated rate of capital to continue in the fourth quarter, positioning us to finish the year on plan for capital expenditures. Turning to our 2022 outlook. Our solid operational performance in the first 9 months of the year positions us to achieve the guidance we provided last quarter. We continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted operating EBITDA within the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which represents an operating EBITDA margin of 28.1% at the midpoint. Our operational performance puts us on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance of greater than $2.15 billion. However, in the fourth quarter, we now anticipate making an additional cash tax payment of about $100 million related to a 2017 matter. Considering this payment, we expect 2022 free cash flow of between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion. When we call all of this together, we're pleased to report results that meet or exceed expectations across all key financial metrics. Combining this strong performance with the stability and certainty afforded by a healthy balance sheet, business confidence in our ability to deliver on strategic priorities through the uncertain economic backdrop. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.65x and 19% of our debt portfolio had variable rates. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the company's performance in 2022. We have strong conviction that the investments we are making in growing our sustainability businesses and in using technology and automation to optimize our business are setting us up for future success. The team remains hard at work on delivering a strong finish to the year and setting a solid foundation for 2023. With that, Katherine, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Patrick Brown : Jim, just to start, I know you guys mentioned that you broadly maintained the guidance for the full year. I think that included the EBITDA of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. But obviously, that's a pretty big range with one quarter left. I know we've got a lot of movement in commodities. We've got a weak Canadian dollar. Are we kind of tracking more towards the low end of that range? Just any help would be appreciated just to kind of tighten up that range. Jim Fish : I think we're tracking still around the midpoint, Tyler. I mean, it is a fairly broad range of $100 million, but we feel pretty comfortable about the midpoint. Some of it obviously depends on what happens in Florida. But for the year, it's going to be a little bit of a positive. I mean -- actually, a little bit of a negative. We were $20 million cost for Q3 and Q4 combined is what we expect it to be. And so right now, we're estimating kind of a $15 million benefit. That will change. And so that's going to help determine where we finish within that $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. So I'd say it's a little bit of a negative. That is based on what we know today, but that number will certainly change. And so that's why we're thinking that the middle of the range is achievable. Patrick Brown : And then, Devina, I know it's just maybe a little too early to give too much. But when we start thinking about some of the puts and takes on free cash flow next year, number one, can you just kind of remind us what your floating debt mix is? And at current rates, is that a headwind? Two, how do we think about cash taxes in light of this $100 million payment? And three, will some of the incentive comp bonuses be paid, will that be a headwind or a tailwind as we think about '23? Devina Rankin : Yes. That's a great question, Tyler. And I think in order to frame it the right way, I'd focus on how we finish 2022, and 2022 has been a fantastic free cash flow year for us. And really, we start that and look at it most importantly on EBITDA strength. When I look at what we expected for the year, we were expecting a $300 million to $400 million increase in EBITDA on a year-over-year basis, and we're going to knock that out of the park and finish the year. We've already achieved $371 million of EBITDA growth through 9 months. And so when you think of the fact that we should deliver another $100 million to $200 million of growth in the fourth quarter, it really does speak to the strength of the year. When we look at the headwinds though for the year ahead, it really is what's creating a little bit of noise in our 2022 free cash flow. Interest and tax is leading the way but there is some working capital noise as well. On the interest and taxes line, we now expect a headwind on a year-over-year basis of about $250 million. We started expecting that headwind to be $75 million to $125 million. And when I look ahead, the fourth quarter payment I mentioned relating to the 2017 matter really doesn't do anything to change the trend of cash taxes. But the trend of cash taxes will be impacted by the step change in bonus depreciation. So there's a 20% reduction in the amount of benefit from bonus depreciation in the year ahead. That will create some sort of impact. I haven't yet quantified that. We'll give you more color on that in the fourth quarter. Interest, on the other hand, will be more significant. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about 20% of our debt is at floating rate. When I look at that, combined with the rate resets on maturing debt, you've got about $2.2 billion of our debt balances that will be exposed to some rate lease set in the next 12 months. We're currently projecting that could be about $100 million headwind in the year ahead, but more color because, candidly, that number has changed very dramatically in the last three months. Three months ago, I was looking at a $40 million annualized headwind. So to see that move that much in just a 3-month period is quite significant. On the working capital side, through 9 months, we've had a headwind of $22 million from not having cash from the alternative fuel tax credits. Right now, we expect that to normalize. And for '22 to '23, there should be no impact from that whatsoever. On the incentive comp side, that's a headwind this year of about $40 million. Incentive compensation is expected to be higher for '22 performance than it was for '21, so there could be an incremental headwind for that in the year ahead, but I don't have specific amounts to share. All in all, what I would say is the below-the-line headwinds are offset substantially by that growth that we're seeing in the EBITDA of the business, particularly from strong solid waste performance. And as we continue to make capital investments in sustainability businesses, there will be noise associated with what that total free cash flow number looks like over the long term. But we expect to see growth in core solid waste performance that track to those long-term trends and even exceed the long-term trends that we've set forth. Patrick Brown : I'm sure there'll be some talk about pricing so I'll go ahead and turn it over. Operator : And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Tyler just teed it up. Why don't we talk about pricing? This year, some of the strongest pricing we've really seen. How are you thinking about pricing in terms of a trajectory into '23? I know some of that's already just based on the inflation this year sort of locked in. Just how are you thinking about the trajectory there? Jim Fish : Obviously, pricing continues to be a key driver for us on the top line. All of the lines of business show really significant price strength. Commercial yield was approaching 10% at 9.81% for industrial, 6.3% resi. So -- and then I guess, 6.5% on the line. I expect that price will continue to be an important driver of our earnings. We've kind of been using price to combat this inflation issue over the last 12 months, and so most of it is really good cost recovery. I'd want to get to a point where price is not just cost recovery but also margin expansion. And I think that's going to be the theme for price going forward. We do expect that inflation will start to come back down a bit in 2023. And so I think we were asked the question last quarter, what's the ideal inflation number. I don't know what the ideal inflation number is, but I said it's not 9%. I know that. And so I think you'll start to see us apply a little bit more price to margin expansion, not just cost recovery, and that's really what it's been. Even with very high price numbers, it's been something that we've had to do in order to cover the cost inflation. I will say this, I think maybe a piece of our earnings and Devina and John have talked about how good solid waste was, but the piece that might have been the most surprising to us was volume really. If you think about collection and disposal volume being positive 1.7%, and there was a little bit of a headwind in there with the hurricane. But still, 1.7% at a time when everybody is speculating about when is the economy going to turn down was really impressive to us. I looked at our numbers this morning. Special waste was still up 50% last week. So our volume continues to be relatively good and that was the positive part for us. I think you -- when we ask why are we seeing that? I think it's probably two things. So even in the face of really pretty heavy pricing, I think we are seeing us continue to take market share. And I also think you're seeing our service show up better than our competition, which is positive for us. Toni Kaplan : I wanted to ask also about the commodity basket. I know you talked about it and sized it in the prepared remarks. But could you just remind us, I guess, I know you have in the past had some sort of sharing agreements with customers to mitigate exposure to commodities. I guess what percentage of contracts have that or however you think about sort of the mitigation of being exposed totally to the price? And I know you have the recycling brokerage business. And does that sort of mitigate you as well? And I guess outside of OCC, which commodities are you most exposed to? Jim Fish : So Toni, on the brokerage piece, we've always said that certainly augments what we do in our -- in the piece of the business that we actually process the material. And that's low margin, no capital, but from a return standpoint, it makes a lot of sense and helps us leverage our ability to move all the materials. So we still feel good about that business. From a marginal standpoint, it actually abates from the margin as prices go down. On the traditional side, we've talked about how we protect the business on the downside two ways. One is floor pricing for some of the fiber grades that we have, and that's certainly something we consider when we're talking about the movement in fiber prices and how it affects the overall P&L. The second piece is really what we've done from a fee-for-service model over the last couple of years. And I think the takeaway is, while we're showing some variability and profitability at these prices have taken such a precipitous drop, and it's really mostly the fiber side, the takeaway is the business is still performing well. We're still happy with it. It's making money and it's not changed our long-term view of what we're going to do on the recycling business. John Morris : Yes. Let me one add there, and that is to give you a little bit of insight into what we've done with these contracts, just to put this in perspective, if -- when the price drops from $110, and this is our bucket of commodities, dropped from $110 to $100, the impact on that is about -- on earnings, it's about $8 million, $8.1 million to be exact. If the price were to drop from $50 to $40, the impact is only about $3 million, a little bit more than, a little maybe $3.5 million. So you can see that as price drops, the negative impact on EBITDA really starts to slow. And that is representative of all the changes we made contractually over the last five years. And to John's point, even with a significant drop-off in price for the third quarter and expecting that in the fourth quarter, too, that we still have the ninth best recycling quarter in our history for Q3. I don't think we would have been saying that five years ago. Operator : Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering if we could -- can we talk about how you're thinking about your collection and disposal pricing from here? Just conceptually, do you feel like with the headwinds in recycling, we now need to push pricing more on the collection and disposal part of the business to offset the $100-plus million headwind in EBITDA from recycling into next year? Said another way, do you feel like you've got enough pieces in place to continue to push percent margins as we think about what the next 12 months might look like? John Morris : Yes. I mean, I kind of think of them a little differently. They're such different businesses from a price perspective. I will say this about price in the solid waste business. I feel like there's room for price increases. Jerry, we went for almost 15 years with kind of nothing. I remember talking about 1% price, 1% volume many, many years ago. So the business really went for quite a long time without getting any price increases. And yet now all we're doing is trying to recover this, as I said, this four-year high inflation. I think in the core business, in the solid waste business, you'll continue to see us use price in a significant way to cover cost but also improve margins. At the same time, as John and I have discussed, taking cost out of the organization, taking advantage of this tight labor markets through attrition, we saw a fair amount of that in '22. We'll see more '23 and '24. Devina Rankin : I think the other thing I would point out on the margin side, Jerry, is if you look at Q3 of 2022 as a barometer of how we're performing, we talked about solid waste improving on a year-over-year basis by 120 basis points based on where we are today. And the impact from recycling commodity prices being 50 basis points of an offset to that. And we're really happy to say that we delivered 28.6% so I think that's a great indicator of where we're starting '23. And so that's with the headwind of recycling almost fully baked in. And so I think we're set up well with where the pricing levels are today. And then we have continued expectations for price based on the rollover of our index pricing that happened in the first half of '23 that sets us up well there too. Jerry Revich : And can I just shift topics on the landfill gas side? And nice to see 30% of your volumes locked in. I'm wondering, can you just talk about the terms are prior to last week's announcement was talking about the market essentially being in the 20s with attractive escalators for long-term deals. Can you comment on, is that similar to the structure that you're seeing or any additional context you could provide for us on the terms? Devina Rankin : Yes, it's a great question. And what we're looking at is the mix of business that we'll have over time. And if we look at our expectations for how this portfolio grows, we could see our renewable energy grow 6x from where it is today. And with that level of growth, we've got to look at this as a portfolio. And the step that we took and that you saw the results of in the third quarter to secure some of this pricing over the long term is an indication of our desire to ensure that we're securing returns as we outlined in our initial expectations. So as Jim mentioned, those are certainly conservative outlooks for how we see this business grow. I won't specifically speak to the terms of the contracts that we have in place. But as we have thought about it, these are on the longer end of what we expect to do. As we manage this portfolio over time, they're more on the 10-year end where we think that we will also be managing things with three- to-five-year contracts as the portfolio grows. Jerry Revich : Super. And lastly, can you just talk about how the voluntary landfill gas purchase market is coming in so non-RIN market? How is the marketplace developing? Obviously, on paper, a lot of folks have commitments to purchase landfill gas. I'm wondering as you're having the conversations, how have the conversations played out versus your expectations on market debt? Devina Rankin : Yes. That's one of the key points that Tara and her team keep speaking to us about, that this is not just the transportation part of the market, it's the non-transportation part of the market. And people in public utilities and institutions who are looking to decarbonize are seeing the RINs market as an attractive place to help to achieve their goals and objectives, which I think is speaking to the strong demand and outlook for the years ahead. We do expect the other thing that will help bolster some clarity on the outlook for this business will be the EPA setting rule in Q4. And so hopefully, those things working together will give us better visibility as we set our expectations for the earnings contributions of this business in '23 and beyond, which we'll give you color on in the fourth quarter call. Jim Fish : I think, Jerry, it's important to point out that this big investment that we announced a couple of quarters ago really is only covering 17 new plants. And we have close to 100, and we discussed this with you when we're on the road, 100 landfills that could go into that bucket. Right now, we're really focusing on just 17. So there's a lot of opportunity to grow the business beyond that. Jerry Revich : Super appreciate the discussion, and don't worry, we won't put the 100 million in our models yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : First, just a little bit of housekeeping on the recycling impact in the quarter. Can you maybe help us understand, was there anything in the timing of how quickly the basket dropped in the quarter that impacted your profitability versus, say, a normalized run rate? Because it does seem like the decrementals were a little bit higher maybe in quarter than what you are talking about even for 4Q or on a run rate basis. John Morris : Yes. I think that was certainly the precipitous drop, particularly in the fiber markets. There's a little bit of lag there so you'd argue there was a little bit of an outsized impact on the quarter. I think what I would point to, Noah, is we looked at the -- not just the sequential but the quarter-over-quarter change in pricing and how that affected the overall EBITDA headwind. And I think what you're seeing is resiliency in the business that we would, to Jim's point, we wouldn't have seen four or five years ago. It's still profitable business. And if you look at kind of the old calculation of what this $10 a ton means, we've certainly separated from that. You can see that in what we did in Q3 and you can see in Q4 going from $130 to $94 produced a $36 million headwind. And for Q4, we're seeing $50 a ton going from $131 to $50 is a $50 million headwind. And as I pointed out, it's still a profitable business. So I think we've achieved a big part of our goal. But specifically on your question, because of the precipitous drop, there's probably a little bit of a lag there. Noah Kaye : Yes. And I just want to clarify, I think someone earlier talked about a $100 million headwind from where recycling is that today going into 2023, if we just sort of levelize today. Is that math correct? I think Jim had mentioned the decrementals would actually get even better as we get to lower levels here. So if we just take today's basket price and say, okay, here's where we're at for 2022, as we enter 2023, do we have a $100 million headwind or should it be something less? John Morris : Yes. No, I think -- I don't think it's going to be $100 million. of it is if we had a crystal ball where the price is going to look like. And we have a view of what pricing will do. And I think you'll see a little bit of improvement from Q4 to Q1 and then sequentially throughout the year. The level of improvement is really what is going to drive that answer. But I don't think even in this environment, it's, I think, quite $100 million. Noah Kaye : And one quick one on pricing and churn, if you don't mind. You talked about kind of continued headroom for pricing. That certainly makes a lot of sense. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the current customer discussions and whether you're starting to see any greater pushback on price? It would sort of point to some of the macro concerns that people have been raising. John Morris : Yes. If you look year-to-date and even quarter-over-quarter, you can see the improvement that we've made both in core price and yield. But we didn't talk too much about it but it's a good spot. When we look at a, we're still growing volume in commercial, industrial when you take out a little bit of the noise I mentioned in my prepared remarks. The residential piece, again, we've got a strategy there that we've employed over the last couple of years. But the other thing we look at is obviously what's going on in Net Promoter Score, customer receptivity, the pricing. We're looking at churn. We're looking at holdbacks, and holdbacks actually improved quarter-over-quarter. So all indications are that the pricing activities we,re engaged in. And we've taken a much more strategic look at that over the last handful of years and use some tools that we didn't have a handful of years ago. And I think that's why you're seeing the uplift in pricing performance without really conceding our ability to grow volume and take some share. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael Hoffman : If we could come back to price, has core crossed the lines of business and yields peaked yet? And if not, when do you think you start hitting a peak? Jim Fish : Core -- did you ask as core price peaked? Michael Hoffman : Yes, right. Yes, core price and then the conversion to yield, which, by the way, you had a very good conversion to yield this quarter. It's improved each quarter. So I'm trying to understand the core and yield overall and then that [Audio Gap] conversion ratio, has it peaked? Jim Fish : It's a tough question to answer just because I don't know exactly what happens with inflation. But what we did say is we expect inflation probably starts to come back down, which then would imply that core price has peaked. If inflation went to 15%, which nobody expects, then I would tell you the answer is no. So for now, I think you could say that core price has peaked. I think the most important aspect though of pricing is the point that we've made a couple of times, which is instead of just recovering costs, we'd love to be able to have a little margin with price. And for most of 2022, it's been kind of fighting this inflation battle with pricing. Michael Hoffman : Sorry, Devina. Go ahead, sorry. Devina Rankin : Your point on the conversion of a core price seller to a yield dollar is a great one. And I think it goes to what John was speaking about just recently on customer receptivity rollbacks turn. And we do really think that all of that is being benefited by was a tough operating environment right now and the hard work that the men and women who pick up the garbage for all of our communities every day are doing. It's a tough labor environment. Operators are seeing challenges, and we are differentiating our services and continue to be a go-to service provider. And so when price is most affected in translating to yield, it's when we hold on to existing customers. And because our service levels are differentiated and because small competitors are having a hard time meeting the needs because driver availability has been a challenge, we are holding on to more and more of our customers and differentiating ourselves each day. And I think that, that will continue to be a strength for the business in the year ahead. Michael Hoffman : So the segue for me on all of that is your entry price going into '23 basically should reflect your exit price coming out of '22. And then you are all alluding to, there's structurally a point at least to volumes. So we're having conversations as you're somewhere around 8 on the top and I'm asking for directional not guidance, just am I in the right neighborhood? You're 8 on the top before you get the M&A rollover, which I would love to hear what your current thought is on your M&A rollover. And then costs start coming down. So I think there is a wider-than-normal spread setting up between where you're going to report a price and where your actual costs are going to play out over the course of the year. And that would lead you to above-average margins. And Devina, you suggested we should start with the 28.6% as sort of a baseline and then it can improve. If I do that, looking at this year, I'm having -- you're having above-average margin expansion here in '23. Have I thought about that correctly? Devina Rankin : I think when you think about the solid waste business in isolation that is absolutely correct. We have talked about the recycling line of business and the headwind increase and that will be a drag on margin, particularly in the first half of '23. But I think your overall thesis about pricing and exiting '22 and crossing over into the beginning of '23 is the right one. And the flow-through of that to earnings expansion to Jim's point about wanting to see more of that really start to be more than accretive rather than just covering our cost. I think we'll start to see better traction on that in '23. I'll give you two data points because I think you kind of asked for them in your question, one being the rollover benefit of M&A. It was about $200 million of acquisitions during the quarter. That's $135 million of annualized revenue, so the rollover benefits a little south of $100 million to 2023. And then the other point is on the index pricing. And our index pricing, we look at that, that's the 40% mix. And our current projection is that with the puts and takes between what's CPI-based, which what is fixed and what is capped, we think that, that will be at about 5.5% in the year ahead, which is pretty consistent with what we were seeing in the back part of this year. So we're pleased that, that gives us strength going into the rollover of overall core price starting in Q1 of '23. Michael Hoffman : So one last piece on that, then what I'm hearing is sales are up, EBITDA are up somewhere in an 8% to 10% zone based on what you just shared. But based on an earlier question about free cash, free cash all-in capital spending, including above-average growth is probably flat to down, given the headwinds? Devina Rankin : All-in capital spending is flat to down? Is that what you said or free cash flow? Michael Hoffman : All-in -- free cash flow with all-in capital spending, meaning all gross spending, not just normal growth. You're flat to down... John Morris : Look, I think we'll give a lot more detail here in a couple of months. But to be a surprising but when we come and say free cash flow for 2023 is going to be down all-in versus 2022 because you've got -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we -- the biggest year of CapEx for these RNG plants and for the rebuilds of the recycling plants is going to be 2023. So we're talking about something in the $1 billion of CapEx for those versus $500 million -- $550 million, I think, is the exact number for this year. So it's going to be $450 million or $500 million of additional CapEx just for that. So if we're looking at free cash flow all-in for 2023, it's going to be down. Michael Hoffman : I think just everybody needed to understand that directionally, just so there are no surprises, right? You're going to have a great sales EBITDA trend. Free cash is what it is for all the growth, and then I'm going to get a real nice bump in that free cash come '25, '26? Jim Fish : Yes, that's right. That's right. One quick to what Devina said about -- she talks about index-based pricing. We've said a lot -- several times that because of the 12-month lookback on a lot of these contracts, the two biggest quarters for adjustment will be Q1 and Q2 of 2023. So we are looking forward to that. Michael Hoffman : Yes, okay. And then last thing on the RNG just so I understand this. You have shared that in '21, you get about $40 million of contribution from that and then you've added new projects in '22. That $24 million improvement is partly spot market rates plus new or is it all new projects? Devina Rankin : No. It's some spot market rate increase. As a reminder, RINs pricing in the first half of '22 was really strong above $3. So there was a big piece of that, that was RINs pricing. There was some that was electricity and then some was incremental contribution from project development. Michael Hoffman : And again, managing expectations, I know the $400 million is a good number, no question on that. But it's really weighted heavily back-ended because the bigger -- two bigger driving projects of this are later in the development cycle. You got a whole bunch of little ones early and then a couple of really big ones later. That we should all remember that, right? Jim Fish : That's right. Look, 2025, for RNG, this thing really takes off like kind of a space show in 2025 because so many projects are coming online in 2024. And a lot of that CapEx is being spent in 2023. So if we think about kind of inflows and outflows of cash, we started it basically in '22, maybe a little bit before. But '22, the big outflow on the CapEx side for RNG plants is in '23. But these things have -- there's a bit of a lag with respect to construction. So a whole lot of those plants, I think 11 to be exact, come online at some point during 2024. Some of them are -- and they're pretty much spread throughout the year. So the big inflows really start in earnest in 2025. And then we get to a full, full run rate in 2026 for RNG. It's a little bit sooner for recycling. Michael Hoffman : And then I realize you're still in budgets, Devina, but you shared with us bonus depreciation change like. How do we think about the effective tax rate for next year? Is it up, down, flat? Devina Rankin : Effective tax rate, we've guided at around 24.5% generally. I expect it will be a little higher next year. But as we've talked about, I don't have specific. Michael Hoffman : Yes, I got it. I just didn't need to directionally tune the model. All right. Thank you very much. Nice job on the price, folks. Keep it up. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Sean Eastman : I wanted to just come back to the sustainability growth investment program, how that translates into EBITDA over the next couple of years. I feel like the discussion with Michael there gave us a good idea on the RNG piece, just as we think about when these projects are kicking in. But then if we move over to the kind of recycling automation side, maybe help flesh that part of it out a little bit. And then even beyond the sustainability element, my understanding is there's another automation bucket in terms of more back office elements. And understanding how that kind of EBITDA benefits flows into the model in terms of timing. Anything around this would be very helpful. Jim Fish : So I'll take a little bit of it, and then maybe John can add on here, Sean. So you've kind of touched on the strategy there, which is really reducing our labor dependency, taking advantage of the tight labor market and attrition. And so that's one bucket. And we've said that's -- we think that number can be as many as at 5,000 to 7,000 positions, we've gone through what those different buckets are. Some of them come out of recycling. These rebuilds are worth somewhere between 30% and 40% reduction in labor. Most of that, by the way, is third party because a lot of those are pickers on the line, and that's what those are, in large part, third party. But as John talked about, third-party has been a pretty big source of inflation in our cost over the last year. So there's that bucket. There are -- there's our customer experience bucket. By the way, Sean, our card calls are down almost 27% year-over-year. That's a sign of our improving customer service. And so at the same time, we're -- as we've used technology within customer experience, we're just simply not replacing some of these positions. We've had as high as almost 50% attrition in customer experience. And so while we don't like that number, it's an awfully high number, it makes it challenging for our management teams to kind of staff, this is an opportunity for us to use the technology that we put in place to take advantage of that attrition, and we have done that. So by the end of this year, there will be, as I said, about 1,000 jobs that we won't have chosen to replace. And then that goes from 1,000 up to as many as 5,000 to 7,000. That's kind of bucket one. And then we talked a lot about RNG, as you said, and that kind of gave you a bit of a layout there. With the recycling investments, there's really three forms of earnings uplift there. And the earnings uplift comes from the 30% to 40% reduction in labor. It comes from improved quality at the back end of the plant, and then it comes from increased throughput. So as you add all this technology, optical sorting technology, you really start processing a lot more material. One of our big plants in Wisconsin plans on going from 12,000 tons a month to 18,000 tons a month, so the throughput is going up by almost 50%. And as you look at the rollout of that, as I said in my script, we think that the EBITDA pickup is maybe a year sooner than RNG. We think RNG kind of gets to full run rate by 2026. We think it's probably maybe 2025 for these rebuilds. We're kind of rebuilding as quickly as we can. Fortunately, I haven't seen a lot of pressures, John, on the supply chain side for equipment coming in. At the same time, Sean, we're also building some new plants where we have a need. So there's -- and we are taking a sharp pencil of that in today's low commodity price environment. But there are some markets, even with low commodity prices, where we definitely have a need. So I think what you'll see is the big CapEx coming in '23, the EBITDA continuing to show up in '23, but really the big EBITDA bump will come in '24 or '25. Sean Eastman : Okay. That was very detailed. I really appreciate that and I'll turn it over there. Operator : We have a question from Walter Spracklin with RBC. Your line is open. Walter Spracklin : So my question is coming back to -- I know, Jim, you and the team were talking about what you've done within your contracts on the recycling side to limit when commodity prices go down, the negative impact on EBITDA kind of contracts as prices go down, which is great. I'm wondering if there's -- as the industry consolidates, as the desire for recycling goes higher, and Jim, your own comment about getting recycling margins up to more your average margin. And finally, given the increased volatility in your earnings stream associated with commodity prices from recycling and natural gas waste energy conversion, is there anything more you can do with regards to your contracts akin to, say, what a transport company will do with a fuel surcharge and effectively pass the entire price change on to the customers? Is that something you could envision that it will be a pure fee-for-service and you will relinquish or get rid of any of that exposure that you have to commodity prices via some kind of surcharge program that you could adjust in your current pricing? Just curious as to what you're thinking about further changes to contracts that would allow for that. John Morris : So Walter, we've talked about that a little bit in general, but I think specifically to your question, that's what you're seeing show up in our results. When you look at the numbers I referenced about Q3 to Q3 and Q4 forecast -- Q4 actual and Q4 forecast, a couple of things. One, that business is still generating healthy margins and great returns. We've talked about returns on the recycling business, not just EBITDA margins. And I think the reason why you're seeing that is because we've kind of repriced, if you will, about 85% of our third-party processing agreement. So we've got a little bit of room to go there. And the way we're doing that, you've heard us talk about the revenue structure, but also this battle against contamination and the phases of revenue levers that we've pulled to make sure that folks look at our processing plants is just at a processing facility, where we're going to get paid the process and we're getting a fair restart on top of that before we really start to engage in what the revenue share is. So while none of us are happy about the drop and how precipitous the drop was, I think what we're all taking inventory of is the fact that our recycling business at our MRFs are still producing good returns, good cash flow and margins. And that's why years of conviction about us, in particular, on the automated capital we're going to invest because that's not really commodity-based. That's really driving down OpEx and positioning us, I think, your earlier point, to be able to continue to grow that business even in a down environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Feniger : Just to clarify, the $50 a ton assumption in Q4, Devina, is that what your basket looks like in October or is that assuming maybe some recovery in November, December to get to that $50 a ton number? Devina Rankin : It's a projection of our blend over the three-month period, and there has been basically a continued decline, so we projected that. Michael Feniger : And then just on RINs, like I think they're now at 250. So just so we understand the moving pieces there, this was -- it was flat contribution this quarter. It's been a positive on a year-to-date. If RINs stay where they are, Devina and step below the first half of next year, does that mean this is a headwind to EBITDA in 2023 or because of maybe some projects coming on, that offsets that? Just trying to think about the RIN being at 250, and that's below where we saw a very strong RIN in the first half of this year, just to level set what that means for 2023. Devina Rankin : That's a great question, and you're thinking about it the right way. Because RINs have come down from the highs we saw in the first half of '22, our current outlook for '23, although preliminary would be that you could have some EBITDA headwind associated 4ertyuioyuiopwith the market prices. The offset, as Jim's talked about, for earnings growth associated with new plants coming online doesn't really start to materialize in any material fashion until more like 2024. So 2023 still meaningfully construction-oriented, not significant impact from new capacity. Michael Feniger : And Jim, a while back, you laid out these targets, revenue growth 4% to 6%, EBITDA growth 5% to 7% with a cost inflation of 3 to 4. When you look today with the cost inflation, obviously high, what should we kind of be thinking about these ranges and what cost inflation could kind of look like for 2023, since that cost inflation is one of the factors you were talking about that kind of drives your guys' pricing decisions in the open market? Jim Fish : Yes, Michael, I mean we're going through that exercise right now, looking to see what costs look like for 2023. We have some pretty aggressive goals we've discussed internally. And I think there's 5,000 to 7,000 positions that we will choose not to refill. With technology, that helps us get there. The pushback on that on the other side is inflation. And so hopefully, we get a little bit of help from inflation that starts to come down. But we do feel like the business can run at a lower cost structure, whether it's an operating cost structure or an SG&A number. When you heard Devina talk about SG&A number for the quarter, which at 9.2%, I don't know that anybody would have thought about that number for a quarter a few years back. And so it's pretty impressive that we're there. Some of that is attributable to some of these positions that have come out. It's a little bit of kind of both categories, OpEx and SG&A, where these positions have come out over 2022. But we do think that cost and cost efficiency is going to be a very important part of our strategy going forward. Devina Rankin : And of the three that you articulated, Michael, the most important of those is the EBITDA growth outlook. And if we look at 2022's performance, that traditional range that we guided to of 5% to 7%, we have meaningfully exceeded that in a year where this business grew organically, and it was managing the toughest cost environment that we've ever seen. And so we're really pleased to see EBITDA dollars up 11% in the quarter. So we're revisiting what that long-term range should be. Operator : And our next question comes from Dave Manthey with Baird. Your line is open. Dave Manthey : Sorry, I jumped on the call here a little late. But if you covered these, I can follow up offline. As we're looking down the cost stack here, just a couple of minor questions. You may have commented already, but on hiring and retention, what type of labor inflation are you seeing currently kind of on a per person basis before these productivity-related attrition trends and so forth? Can you just talk about that? And then second, wondering about maintenance and repairs. I'm not sure if you manage that top down or bottom up, but are you seeing any delays there because parts or labor shortages? And any kind of update you can provide on the level of routine maintenance activity today. Devina Rankin : Yes. They're great questions. And basically, from a wage inflation perspective, a year ago, we were at around 11%. We've seen that come down to about 7%, so that's that 400 basis point improvement that we're talking about. Very happy to see where we are today, and we think the proactive steps we took a year ago are paying dividends today. On the repair and maintenance side, I would tell you, we manage it both top down and bottom up. We also side to side. We manage it in every direction, and it's something that we have collaborative approaches on across the business. And it's the toughest cost category for us. And it's got a lot of different factors that result in it being so difficult, 1 being delayed trucks, and that's one of the places that we really need to see some traction on, and we're working with the manufacturers to be sure that we get the trucks that we planned for when we expect them. The other things that are happening is technicians in the marketplace are very valuable across the transportation space. And so making sure that we are the preferred employer, it has been a priority. We have made investments there and we'll continue to invest in the future. Aside from that, the things that are really driving increases are commodity-based inflationary pressures that we've seen on lube and parts and supplies. And we are seeing some moderation there that gives us some hope that in 2023, there will be some moderations on the high levels we saw in '22. Operator : And there are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Jim Fish for closing remarks. Jim Fish : Okay, thank you. And I do know that some of our Florida team are on the call listening today, and I just want to let them know how proud of them we are during this recovery from Ian, a tough hurricane particularly with the storm surge coming in as much as it did. And we did lose property. We've talked about that. Our folks lost some property as well. Fortunately, everybody was safe. Everybody on the WM Florida team was safe. And you should all know that we're standing right next to you and standing next to Floridians in general during this recovery. So thank you, though, for your efforts throughout this, particularly there in southwest Florida. Thanks again to everyone for joining us today, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. 2022 was another very successful year at WM. Coming into an uncertain 2022, I wouldn't have predicted that we would grow adjusted operating EBITDA by more than 9.5% for the year, and 8.8% for the fourth quarter, all while recycling was down $59 million for the year on a sharp drop in commodity prices. That's exactly what happened. Strong operational execution and an unwavering commitment to our strategic priorities led to our full year adjusted operating EBITDA growth of $480 million. We achieved this tremendous growth in the face of elevated inflation, a tight labor market, and a downturn in the recycled commodity price market. So, we're very proud of our results. Our robust operating EBITDA translated into record cash from operations of more than $4.5 billion, which allowed us to return more than $2.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As 2023 kicks off, we're confident that our long-term focus is on sustainable growth, transforming our business through technology and automation are setting us up to meet the changing needs of our customers, our people, and our business environment, while leveraging our competitive advantages. Turning to our high-level outlook for 2023. We expect to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA of between $5.825 billion and $5.975 billion in the year ahead, representing growth of just over 7% at the midpoint, which continues the trend of robust operating EBITDA growth that we've delivered since 2019. Since then, we've grown operating EBITDA almost 26%. And at a time when the economic outlook is increasingly uncertain, we're pleased to be anticipating another strong year of earnings growth in 2023. The essential nature of our service, our diverse customer base, and recurring revenue streams provide stability in times of economic uncertainty. Much of the growth in our 2023 outlook comes from deliberate steps that we've already taken to grow revenue and efficiently manage costs. Overall, we're anticipating between 40 and 80 basis points of adjusted operating EBITDA margin expansion in the year ahead, driven by our collection and disposal business. Moving now to our sustainability growth investment. Let me give you an abbreviated overview of the supplemental deck that was posted to our Investors website. The investment in our renewable energy business is a unique opportunity that we simply couldn't afford to mass. You're all aware that since the passage of the subtitle B and associated air quality regulations in the 1980s and 1990s, landfill has been required to install gas collection systems. Historically, we've been collecting our landfill gas, converting much of it into electricity, which provides an earnings stream for us. Fast forward to present day, with landfill gas designated as a renewable resource, we are increasing the value of the gas that's an inevitable byproduct of most landfills. These RNG plants are simply taking gas that's naturally produced from the landfill and converting it into a cash-generating machine with a three-year projected payback and a far better environmental outcome than the status quo. And our returns far surpass those of our competition by virtue of our CNG fleet, which today represents 74% of our routed vehicles. As a result, we're better positioned to close the loop and capture extremely valuable regulatory RIN credits. At the same time, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will provide tax credits and benefits that served to amplify the value creation of WM's renewable energy business. The supplemental presentation to the earnings press release provides details on the investments and our projections for cash flow and operating EBITDA growth. But suffice it to say, we view this as a very strong positive for shareholders. We have a number of attractive options for our renewable energy portfolio. Internally, we said there are three possible outcomes from this opportunity, good, really good or great. And we're heading down the great path by owning the landfill gas and renewable energy facilities, generating RINs through our CNG fleet and maximizing the value of new tax benefits to increase the resulting earnings and cash flows. We're also advancing our planned recycling investments and have provided more details in the supplemental presentation on our website. Our portfolio of projects to automate existing and build new material recovery facilities have three key financial benefits; reduced labor costs, improved product quality that commands a price premium and capacity growth. In the fourth quarter, labor costs per ton at our single-stream automated MRFs improved by 35%. The automation of these plants enabled us to reduce 137 positions through attrition in 2022. And in 2023, we expect to reduce labor dependence by another 200 positions. By the end of 2023, we're anticipating about a 15% increase in processing capacity from our automated facilities and new markets. We will host a virtual information session for investors on April 5th to provide even more insight into our recycling and renewable energy growth plans. Devina will discuss our 2023 capital allocation plans in more detail, but I want to emphasize our confidence in our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities, including investing in these high-return sustainability growth projects, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and acquiring accretive businesses. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another fantastic year. We look forward to 2023 as we continue to execute on our operating plans and progress our investments in renewable energy, recycling and automation to drive growth. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Jim described our fantastic results in 2022 and that all begins with our collection and disposal business. In the face of some of the highest inflationary cost pressures, our collection and disposal business delivered double-digit in adjusted EBITDA for the full year. During the fourth quarter, collection and disposal results were even more impressive as adjusted operating EBITDA grew more than 11% and margin expanded 40 basis points. This momentum sets the stage for continued growth in 2023 and strengthens our conviction that the investments we're making in our people in automation and in differentiating our service offerings are the right decisions. The growth in our collection and disposal business starts at the top of the income statement with robust organic revenue growth. Full year core price was 7.8% with collection and disposal yield of 6.7% and volume of 1.8%. As we work to keep pace with decades high inflation, our revenue management teams delivered record core price in 2022 in every one of our lines of business, led by 10.5% in our commercial line of business. We talk often about our focus on generating appropriate returns in our residential and post-collection lines of business. And in 2022, we delivered core price of 6.5% in the residential line of business, 6.4% at our landfills and 5.9% at our transfer stations. Our revenue metrics demonstrate that our customers' receptivity to our pricing remained favorable through the fourth quarter. Our rollback percentage was almost 400 basis points better for the full year, while new business pricing increased more than 6% in our commercial line of business. The results clearly demonstrate our ability to manage cost pressures through continued pricing discipline and momentum, while maintaining our focus on customer lifetime value. As we move into 2023, our disciplined pricing programs combined with the strong momentum from 2022 and are expected to deliver core price of between 6.5% and 7% with yield approaching 5.5%. Our expectation is for strong rollover of 2022 price performance. Given the acute inflationary environment in 2022, we increased certain fees that we don't expect to step up again at the same level. We remain committed to securing pricing that outpaces our cost inflation, which is demonstrated by the operating EBITDA margin expansion that we're anticipating in 2023. Shifting to volumes. In the fourth quarter, event-driven volumes remained strong with special waste and C&D volumes growing double digits. Our commercial and industrial volumes were positive for the full year. However, we saw some softening in the fourth quarter. Given these recent trends, we are tempering our volume expectations in the year ahead. Our guidance includes 2023 collection and disposal volumes that are relatively flat with 2022. We continue to see the rate of labor increases easing in our business, and we remain focused on managing our operating expenses and flexing down costs, flexing costs down with the changing volumes. In our collection and disposal business, we are seeing improvements in our labor costs as inflationary wage pressures are easing. Turnover trends are improving and the investments that we are making in automation are showing benefits. These improvements were on display in the fourth quarter \u2013 in our fourth quarter results as we saw operating expense margin improved by 30 basis points despite still stubbornly higher maintenance and repair costs. For the full year of 2022, operating expenses increased 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue, but that was largely driven by negative impacts from higher fuel costs and recycling commodity prices that together impacted the measure by 80 basis points. This increase was partially offset by lower labor and related benefits costs in our collection and disposal business and improved risk management costs. Putting it all together, when you combine our pricing efforts with our progress on cost containment, we expect 2023 operating expense as a percentage of revenue to improve between 30 and 50 basis points for the full year, with those improvements beginning in the second quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter, our recycling operating EBITDA remained solidly positive even with the sharp decline in commodity prices to about $47 per ton. Over the last several years, we have intentionally taken steps to shift the business to a fee-for-service model that has reduced our sensitivity to commodity market changes. When we started this journey in 2017, commodity prices were 60% higher than what we are anticipating in our 2023 outlook, yet 2023 operating EBITDA is expected to be about 13% higher than in 2017. This clearly demonstrates that our business model is profitable and generate solid returns in any economic environment. As we look to the future of recycling, we remain focused on advancing automation across our MRF network, which we have proven can lower the cost of process material, achieve better quality while enhancing recycling profitability. Our employees delivered strong results in 2022, and I want to thank the entire WM team for their commitment to providing the best customer service while focusing on improving our operations. The team has done an exceptional job, and I know that this will continue in the year ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2022 financial results and 2023 financial outlook in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning. Once again, our solid waste business was at the center of WM's strong quarterly results, capping off a great 2022. Our team delivered strong organic revenue growth with a diligent focus on leveraging core price to offset cost inflation, while prioritizing customer service and customer lifetime value to minimize customer churn, all resulting in record high yield. When combined with strong cost control, these efforts delivered an 80 basis point expansion of operating EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved these excellent results while investing in technology and sustainability growth that will benefit WM for years to come. Full year adjusted SG&A was 9.6% of revenue, a 40 basis point improvement over 2021 as we achieved back-office operational efficiencies through standardization and process improvement that enabled us to reduce more than 600 positions through attrition. You can clearly see our strong performance and the record cash flow from operations that we achieved in 2022, which grew 4.6% to $4.536 billion. The increase in cash allowed us to accelerate investments at year-end, which brought full year capital spending to the high end of our expectations. 2022 capital expenditures totaled $2.587 billion with $2.26 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $561 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Putting these pieces together, 2022 free cash flow was $1.976 billion despite an increase in cash taxes of $370 million. During 2022, we returned a record $2.58 billion to shareholders, paying $1.08 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.5 billion of our stock. In addition, we spent $377 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business. We accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability and growth investments and achieving our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75 times. Our balance sheet is well-positioned for growth through capital investments in our business or strategic acquisitions. Moving to our 2023 financial outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate organic growth approaching 5.5% from yield. Given an expectation for a little more than 1% revenue growth from acquisitions, and a decrease in revenue contributions from recycled commodity sales and fuel surcharges, we anticipate total revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5%. When combining our plan to deliver strong organic revenue growth with a focus on optimization and cost control to drive 40 to 80 basis points of operating leverage, we expect to generate adjusted operating EBITDA of $5.825 billion to $5.975 billion in 2023. We expect to allocate $1.1 billion to capital investments in recycling and renewable natural gas growth projects in the coming year and 2023 is expected to be the peak investment year for each business. While these investments are reported as a component of our capital expenditures, and therefore, reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow. We view these investments as better than an acquisition dollar as they will produce even higher return growth as a strong complement to our existing business. Our normal course capital to support our business is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion in 2023. And free cash flow is projected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, including the impact of sustainability growth investments. Our outlook anticipates an increase in cash interest and taxes of $175 million to $215 million and about an $80 million headwind from working capital due in large part to the timing and amount of incentive compensation payments. As Jim discussed, even as we step up our investment in high-return recycling and renewable energy growth projects, we remain well positioned to allocate our cash among all of our capital allocation priorities, including returning cash to our shareholders. Given the Board of Directors intended 7.7% increase in the 2023 dividend rate, we expect dividend payments to total about $1.1 billion in the year ahead. We also expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2023, as the Board recently provided authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our stock. While our guidance does not specifically include acquisition growth, we will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing the right deals at the right price. In closing, we are proud of what we achieved in 2022, and we're excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for 2023 and future years. I want to thank our hard-working team members for all of their contributions to our success. With that, Josh, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your may proceed. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. Devina Rankin : Good morning. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering, if you could just talk about the puts and takes around the guidance. If recycled commodity prices remain tough over the year. That should be about a $ 50 million drag to EBITDA, give or take. And in that scenario, I'm wondering if we should be thinking about yield that's above the 5.5% target that we're laying out here this morning as we think about the potential for the yield number to move higher over the year as we've seen over the past couple of years? Jim Fish : Jerry, let me tackle the first question first on recycling, and then I'll touch on yield overall. Recycling, obviously, fell off the table there at the end of the year. I think a lot of it had to do with China itself, even though China isn't a big customer of ours anymore, they still affect the overall market, particularly when we think about OCC. And their zero COVID policy certainly destabilize the market. I think as they've reopened, we've started to see some stabilization there. So that should help, and that's part of why we are a bit more optimistic in '23 with pricing starting to climb back up. It did climb up a bit in December, and we think it will continue to climb, albeit not back up to where it was for the year in 2022. To your question about yield in general and 5.5%, yield is doing exactly what we thought it would do. It's doing exactly what we said it would do last year. I kind of felt like we yield and cost, we're in a fistfight for the last 18 months with really no winter. And what we said was that we hope that when inflation moderated, which it is, that we would start to be able to use yield to not only cover costs, but also put a few points on the board in terms of margin. And that's exactly what's happening. So, we think that 5.5% yield number is absolutely the right direction. We're sensitive to customers. I mean, some of our yield numbers last year were double digits. And when inflation comes back down to 4%, 4.5%, I don't expect to take commercial increases at the 11.5% range. So I think we're pleased with the projection, and we're pleased actually with the fact that costs are starting to moderate and we can actually apply a little bit of our yield to the margin line. Jerry Revich : Super. And Jim, maybe just to expand on that last point, given the margin cadence over the course of the year to get the margin expansion that you're targeting for 2023, it looks like you're going to be exiting the year with margins up maybe closer to 100 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter, just given the seasonality and cadence. Can you just comment on that and whether that momentum could continue into early 2024? Devina Rankin : Yes, Jerry, I think that that overview that you provided is spot on in terms of how it is that we're looking at margin for the year ahead, 60 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint indicates our confidence that the momentum that we saw in the back half of 2022 should continue into 2023. We expect some of the margin pressure from the recycling part of the business to continue in the first half. So we are seeing strong fundamentals in the solid waste part of our business that should help to offset that as they did in Q4. That being said, some of the cost execution, we really are laser focused as a management team on what we're doing on the cost side of the business. And that's not just looking at inflation and responding to it but being proactive in terms of what we can do to manage it appropriately. And truck delivery trends are favorable now relative to where we started 2022, and that should give us some relief both in repair and maintenance and in truck rental costs. Our frontline retention efforts are showing really strong benefits, and we expect that to continue in 2023. We're managing down professional fees, particularly in our SG&A. And then on the SG&A front, we're also leveraging technology to automate our processes, which is improving the customer experiences and reducing our cost to serve. So all of that gives us confidence that it's our strong execution on the cost side of the equation that will complement the yield that Jim just spoke to in terms of delivering that margin expansion and exiting 2023 with 100 basis points above kind of this current run rate feels like the right target for us. Jerry Revich : Super, Devina. Thank you. And can I just sneak one more in. I really appreciate the landfill gas disclosures. I'm wondering, Tara and team, can you just give us an update on Offtake Agreements. A quarter ago, you were at one-third of your Offtake Agreements were done. Can you just give us an update on where that stands today and whether the pricing point on Offtakes in the market is still in the 20s or if that's come in, given the pullback in Henry Hub gas. Thank you. Devina Rankin : Yes. So Jerry, in 2022, we were at 30%, and we're projecting in 2023 to be at 40% of our Offtake in fixed. And I think what's important to note here is we really took a look at this back in early 2022, looking at the volume ramp of our R&D, and we were pretty intentional about thinking through how to tap into those voluntary markets. So those markets today, we're seeing them be quite robust. If you think about large public utilities and industrial end users. This is a great way for them to tap into a low-carbon fuel and we're not seeing any price back at the moment. We'll give a bit more detail in April on what it looks like longer term as well. Jerry Revich : Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Wanted to start out on renewable energy. Thanks for all the details in the supplemental presentation. I know you had previously talked about 2023 as an elevated year for investment. But it seems like maybe you decided to accelerate it and expand even more. So, I guess what sort of -- why is this the right time? And maybe just cadence of the investment during the year. And maybe just -- does this mean that M&A will be lower this year versus last year? Thanks. Jim Fish : We didn't really give guidance on M&A. Historically, we've said $100 million to $200 million, so it's likely going to be kind of in that range. But the reason to your point that we've decided to accelerate some of this is just simply the opportunity itself. I mean I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but it really is part of our solid waste business. This is gas as a result of Subtitle V and Air Quality Regulations that's coming to us anyway. About half of that gas has been monetized over the last, I don't know, 20 years, but we still have half left and we're certainly not monetizing the full amount when you look at that deck, but that, that we are monetizing we're effectively paying kind of a three times multiple instead of what you might pay for an acquisition, which would be kind of eight to 12 times. So, that's why we're feeling so good about it. And we've modeled these at very conservative numbers. Right now, we're well above those. So, I think the opportunity just started to present itself through the designation of this gas as being renewable. The markets themselves opening up and now with an opportunity which Tara can go into about electricity. In those cases, we don't even have to add capital if we already have electric facilities generating facilities out there. Tara Hemmer : The only other thing I would just add to what Jim said regarding the acceleration of the investment is the investment tax credit and the fact that, that is a really strong pathway for us to get some tax credits on our investments and there's a timeline associated with that. And we feel really positive about where we are in our ability to capture those tax credits. We've modeled about $300 million, which you see in the deck. Regarding our broader portfolio, I mean, this is one of the reasons why we talk about this opportunity being so great because we preserved so many options for WM because we own the gas. We own our projects. We announced 20 projects. There's a whole pipeline that can come after that. And then with the e-RINs [ph] pathway, if you look at our legacy landfill gas to electricity projects, we can create an earnings stream with no incremental capital, and that's not in our numbers today. So, that's upside long-term. So, we're really optimistic about what we have in front of us here. Jim Fish : And one -- maybe one last point here that I did mention also, but I'll mention it again. That differentiates us from our competition, and that is that CNG fleet. I mean 74% of our fleet is CNG and the way RINs works is you have to burn the fuel before you can monetize the RIN and having a fleet that is three quarters natural gas gives us a potential stream there, earnings stream that our competition who might be at 15% to 30% CNG, they simply don't have that or at least don't have it to the same potential that we do. Toni Kaplan : Super. And I wanted to ask about volume. You mentioned the softening in commercial and industrial in the fourth quarter. Maybe just a little bit more color there, the magnitude, how quickly how it -- like was it early in the quarter or throughout the whole quarter, et cetera? And if you're expecting any softer volumes in the remainder of the business implied in the guide? Thanks. Jim Fish : There were a few moving parts in the volume that was down slightly for Q4. Some of it was by design, residential specifically. Some of it was a couple of lost contracts in the commercial line of business and that was typically going to be in our national accounts group. And then, some of it is maybe softness showing up in the roll-off line of business. I guess, if there's any good news there, and it is that when we just looked at our January numbers this morning, they were actually better than Q4 on the volume front, particularly C&D, although some of that C&D might be coming from the hurricane cleanup in Florida. But MSW was a positive sign for January. So even with that, we felt that a negative 0.5% to a positive 0.5%. So a flat volume with last year, as John mentioned, was appropriate. And I guess, as we look at the tea leaves for the economy -- there are a few factors that are concerning out there; the housing slowdown, for sure. I mean, that's been widely discussed and that housing slowdown. While our C&D volume has been very good and continues to be good. We think that C&D will come back a bit. It almost has to with the housing slowdown. Special waste continues to be a strong point for us and the pipeline is good there. But I think as you think about, whether it's the housing slowdown or whether you think about the consumers saving at 7% in 2020 and now down to almost zero, because inflation has eaten up that savings. That's going to affect the consumer. But the good news for us is that our strategy is really not built around the volume aspect. It's built around cost controls, it's built around building out this sustainability strategy, and it's built around pricing. And so, we're pleased with being able to come in at the top end of the range on EBITDA at 7% for 2023. Toni Kaplan : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. You may proceed. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning, guys. Jim Fish : Good morning. Devina Rankin : Good morning. Tyler Brown : Hey, Jim. Thank you for the supplemental deck. But I do kind of want to get to the heart of it. So is the idea here that the contribution in 2026 between RNG and recycling, maybe it's now expected to be $740 million, I think, if my math is right, and that was upsized, is that right? Devina Rankin : That's correct. Jim Fish : Yes. Tyler Brown : Okay. But you're also in the midst of a labor automation effort. And I just want to make sure that I'm not double counting, because some of that is probably in recycling. But how much additional EBITDA are you expecting by 2026 from that effort as well? Jim Fish : So there is a bit of the -- when we automate in the recycling piece in the deck, there is a bit of that in the $260 million, I think, was the number, but... Devina Rankin : Yes, there's $70 million in the deck on\u2026 Jim Fish : But there are other areas where we're automating away positions and that are not captured in that deck at all, that really have nothing to do with RNG or recycling. Tyler Brown : Yes. That's my point. Can you quantify that piece? Devina Rankin : Tyler, I would tell you that it's too early for us to predict the impact of that to 2026 and beyond. What we're really emphasizing in our 2023 outlook is that we're starting to see some of the benefits. Yes, recycling is a piece of that. But beyond the recycling line of business, we're seeing back office to 600 headcount attrition that I mentioned in customer experience, specifically is a strong example of that. And the leverage we've gotten in SG&A margin is in large part due to some of that success. So the 40 to 80 basis points of margin expansion really is all solid waste. And so that strong performance in 2023 is an indicator of future value that we think will come as we start to see, in particular optimization efforts in the collection line of business take hold. Some of that is delayed because of truck deliveries as well as some of our efforts to take that across additional lines of business. We started in the industrial line of business intentionally, and we're seeing strong success in some of those pilots. And we're happy with where we are, but too early for us to predict how much efficiency gain we can get across all lines of business in 2020 and beyond. But I think taking the 40 to 80 basis points accomplished or predicted for 2023 is a strong indicator of the strength of those initiatives. Jim Fish : Tyler, let me expand so quick on what she just said about the 600 position, because that will become close to 1,000 positions just in customer experience. And we've talked a lot over the last couple of years about automation. But we haven't really given you kind of the numbers and where it's benefiting the bottom line. This is a good example. I mean, what we really did there was used a turnover number that was close to 50%. And customer experience, took advantage of that attrition. And at the same time, we automated the customer experience, which every other industry, by the way, has done over the last 20 years, and we hadn't. It was -- ours was still kind of a person-to-person experience. We haven't eliminated the person-to-person experience, but we've just made it available, made a self-service option available to our customers. And as a result, our call volume is down close to 25%. That's a huge drop in call volume. And hence, our ability to take advantage of attrition to the tune of 600 positions in 2022 and another close to 400 positions in 2023. Tyler Brown : Okay. Yes, that's extremely helpful. A lot on to come there. Okay. Devina, kind of coming back to 2023 margins, though, and I don't want to be super -- I do want to be specific. Can you just talk about first half and second half margins? So are margins going to be a little bit more flattie in the first half and then up quite a bit in the second half? I just want to make sure that we all kind of get the shape of the year right and could margins actually be down in Q1 year-over-year? Devina Rankin : Margins could be backward in the first quarter of the year. The pressure from the recycling line of business is the most acute. And while drop in commodity prices is typically something that we see benefit our margin in that part of the business, because of the pass-through elements of some of it. We have seen some pressure. So we are predicting some flatness, I would say, in the first quarter, with expanding margin in the second quarter, particularly on the cost side of the business and starting to see the pricing parts of the business really contribute as they did in the second half of 2022, as we anniversary some of those impacts from the recycling line of business I mentioned. So first half, second half, I would say you'll see more muted margin expansion in the first half, stronger margin expansion in the back half. That being said, I wouldn't expect the minus 100, plus 100 that we saw in 2022 because we've overcome so many of the operating cost headwinds that we were experiencing this year and really starting to see some strong momentum there. Tyler Brown : Okay. Perfect. That's extremely helpful. And my last one, just real quick, you kind of went through quite a bit on the free cash flow puts and takes. But can you kind of go back over what the expectation is year-over-year for cash taxes, cash interest and then maybe working capital? Just trying to help build that bridge. Devina Rankin : Sure. So EBITDA growth at the midpoint is $390 million, and so that will be the driver of free cash flow growth, cash flow from operations growth next year. Unfortunately, with this interest rate environment, we're going to have to give some of that back because our cost of debt is going up. As you can see, when you look at our fourth quarter results, our weighted average borrowing rate in the fourth quarter actually went up 80 basis points. And so that was an increase of $26 million in the quarter. We were virtually flat all year long in advance of Q4. And when we take that Q4 impact and extrapolate it to 2023, that's what's going to be driving our interest costs higher. So that in and of itself is a little over $100 million of impact. And then we do expect our debt balances to increase in the year ahead. Our debt balances are going to increase because we are seeing such strong growth, and we are going to be investing in all elements of capital allocation with that strong balance sheet. So not pulling back any on our allocation of cash to share buyback in the year ahead, is our current plan. We may moderate it some, but we'll give you more color on that over the course of the year. So with the higher debt balances and the higher interest cost that really is all of the $175 million to $215 million that I mentioned in interest and taxes. Taxes are actually going to be essentially flat. So while we would have expected some moderation in that, because of the one-time payment that I mentioned of $100 million, we're really seeing that offset by two things : one, higher pretax income; and the other being the expiration of a piece of bonus depreciation and the asset mix that we're putting in place. So those are the interest and tax pieces. The $80 million headwind I mentioned on working capital, we had an $88 million contribution to working capital in 2022. So we're essentially saying that, we think we might give some of that back. Some of that is a moderation in DSO, just because of the recessionary environment that we're predicting. But a large contributor is timing and amount of incentive compensation payments. Tyler Brown : Very detailed as always. Thank you so much. Devina Rankin : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. One moment for question's. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. You may proceed. Noah Kaye : Good morning. Thanks. D&A stepped up in 4Q. Can you first provide a little color on that and then give us what should be D&A for 2023? Devina Rankin : Sure. So the color there is really inflation in our landfill costs. And it's both from normal inflationary cost pressures, as well as the regulatory environment, that's driving some of our costs for closure, post-closure higher. So the charge that we took in the fourth quarter relates predominantly to our closed site part of the portfolio, though some of it is also representative of changes we're seeing in management of the active landfills, too. In terms of next year's DD&A, we're not predicting another step change from this current level, but we are expecting DD&A levels to reflect better delivery of trucks in the year ahead. So you'll see some increased depreciation in the first half of the year rather than waiting to see all of that impact in Q4. Noah Kaye : Okay. But we could again be above that $2 billion number for 2023. So net-net D&A would step up year-over-year? Devina Rankin : Net-net G&A is going to be moderately higher just with the capital expenditure deliveries, but it's not going to be another step change from this level. Noah Kaye : Yeah. Okay. And then just on pricing, I guess, Jim, listening to your comments around some of the softening in the commercial sector. How do we think about the cadence of price growth expectations? It seems hard to sustain double digits in C&I as we go through the balance of the year. There is some math on that, of course. But how do we think about pricing? And what elements of the business may see the greatest sequential price declines on a cadence basis? Jim Fish : Well, I think we think about it -- I mean, we're thinking about pricing because there are -- there's a two-fold exercise here. One is combating cost increases or inflation, which was why the last 18 months have been so challenging, because we really felt like it was almost all, in fact, in many cases, all of it was going towards combating inflation. And then a second piece is adding a few margin points for us. So as we look at this through our price group, particularly for commercial since that's where your question was, we think that pricing will moderate a bit, because inflation is moderating significantly. And that ends up being a good thing for us. If you look at collection and disposal yield for last year versus our guidance for this year, last year was $6.7 million this year guidance is 5.5%. So there is some moderation in yield there. But significantly, we're projecting at least a significantly different cost picture. So we think the price starts to contribute to margin again, whereas, it hasn't for the last probably three years. John Morris : I think the only one I would make there, Jim, is the residential line of business, specific if you look at our volume loss there, clearly, we continue to make deliberate decisions. We mentioned some of the franchises that we've parted ways with. And even if you look at the 4.5% or 4.7% negative volume, our revenue was still up over $50 million for the quarter in residential. And as we've said, we're going to continue down that path until we get acceptable returns and margins for that line of business. And so we're happy with that progress. We don't like intentionally shedding that business but under these conditions, like Jim said, the inflation is what we're combating and it's been most acute in residential, partly due to the labor intensity there. Jim Fish : Yeah, I think maybe one place where it might not moderate as much is on the landfill side. I mean, we have a differentiated product there and so not that we don't have a differentiated product on the collection side, but landfill in particular, the yield was 6.2% MSW last year. I think that's probably the highest annual yield for MSW maybe in our history. And I don't expect that to come back to at a lot. Noah Kaye : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. You may proceed. Bryan Burgmeier : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I understand free cash flow will get near-term. But do you think WM can emerge from this investment period with structurally higher free cash flow conversion from EBITDA than you had in 2021 and before, it seems like these investments will be highly cash generative once ramped and can potentially exceed where you were before the investment period. Devina Rankin : Yes, Brian, you're spot on there. Our ability to convert revenue and EBITDA dollars to free cash flow with the sustainability investments will be heightened as we come through the investment period. Fundamentally, that's because there's a different capital outlay model for this part of our business than there is for the collection and disposal business, where you're having to spend capital dollars effectively each day that you service the customer. So with maintenance capital levels meaningfully lower in both recycling and renewable energy, we're optimistic that cash flow conversion will be stronger after this investment period. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Thanks for that. And last question for me. The press release called out investment in plastic recycling infrastructure. Maybe just from a high level, is it possible to say what makes that such an enticing market for WM longer term, do you have any thoughts on how the margins or returns could compare to your existing business? Devina Rankin : Sure. The investment we made in Natura PCR, this is really about taking film and film plastic and mechanically recycling it. Film has very low recycling rates today. And on top of that, if you look at -- all of the brands out there, CPG companies have very strong commitments to use more recycled content products. So it's a market where there is a very strong need and we have a strong fit. Also, if you think about the plastics that we collect on the brokerage side of the house, so it felt like a natural fit for us. What you're seeing in the press release are some capital dollars to invest in building out that plant portfolio in Houston and also in the Midwest, and we'll be providing a bit more information on that in April. Bryan Burgmeier : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. You may proceed. Kevin Chiang : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for the supplemental information here. If I look at your pro forma earnings contribution from these sustainability investments of -- and if I do kind of a quick back of the envelope math, it seems like you'd get to something like 15%, maybe even upwards of 20% of your earnings coming from recycling on RNG. And then the payback looks phenomenal. ROIC is obviously very big. But I guess how do you think about the underlying earnings volatility of the business now that it becomes more commodity exposed once these investments are completed? Devina Rankin : Yes, I can speak to the commodity volatility on both sides of the business. So on the RNG side of the house, we've talked a lot and I mentioned it today that we have 40% of our volume that's really tied into fixed price markets. And then we also have the ability on the transportation side of the house to leverage WM suit and tie it into ERINs [ph]. We're really -- sorry, RINs, conventional RINs, we're really being thoughtful about how our ramp looks long term and how to tap into those fixed versus transportation markets. And so we'll give a bit more information on that in April. But suffice it to say that, it's something that we're tracking very closely, and we have a whole host of options to ensure that we can navigate that. I think there's very strong fundamentals. If you look at what the EPA did with their announcement on the renewable volume obligation and setting a three-year pathway. So it really shores up where we're headed on the renewable natural gas side of the house. On the recycling side of the house, I think what's interesting is, if you look at the $240 million in EBITDA, 60% of that is really independent of commodity prices, and that really speaks to the fact that a big piece of it is coming from labor and labor improvements. 35% exiting the quarter in labor cost per ton improvements at our automated facilities. And then revenue quality, and a great example of that is how we're able to take mixed paper and remove cardboard from those bales and sell it at a higher price premium. And that's independent of market prices. So a lot of what we're doing will help us inflate ourselves from those wings. Jim Fish : And I might add one thing because in your question about adding volatility, I mean, I guess you could say that. But look, as I said, and Tara has mentioned as well, this gas is coming to us regardless. I mean, this is gas that is produced by these landfills as a result of MSW going into them. And about half of it is monetized in some form today. All we're doing here is taking advantage of a situation that was presented to us, but also taking advantage of our natural gas fleet and turning that 50% that isn't monetized into some value add for shareholders. Does it add some volatility? I guess it adds some, although Tara has gone through a part of her answer to question earlier was to -- that we are looking to take some of that volatility away by fixing some of the pricing. But I think there's this view that why would you add a volatile business here? And the answer is, we're just taking gas that's being produced by these sites and turning it into a very, very profitable revenue stream with very, very strong paybacks. Kevin Chiang : That's great color, Jim. That's very helpful. Maybe just my second one just maybe on some of the automation you were talking about on the customer service side. It sounds like, obviously, some huge wins there. Just wondering what you're seeing from -- I guess, the labor cost savings -- would you track, I guess, like a Net Promoter Score or like a customer churn, as you roll that technology out and maybe do some of the friction that some of your customers might have had calling into call centers. Are you seeing other benefits, whether something that promoter score or churn rate that you'd be tracking alongside just the labor cost savings? John Morris : Yes, that's a good question. A few things are happening on that front. One is we've digitized a lot of the customer-facing elements of sort of these transactions. So customers have the better ability to transact with us when and how they want to from a digital perspective. We're seeing that translate to NPS scores, not a surprise that we in the beginning of the year had some dips in our NPS scores as we were challenged on some of the labor and asset fronts that Devina and Jim commented on, but that started to improve in the second half of the year, which has also helped our service quality. So, we're seeing our NPS score start to move the right way in the back half of the year. And we're also, at the same time, seeing the benefits from some of the labor arbitrage. As Jim mentioned, these are not jobs we're moving out. These are jobs that we're not replacing because they're because they're high turnover. And I think Tara and Jim gave good color on what's happening with the recycling and the recycling front with respect to automation benefits. And we've touched on the other big bucket is moving from sort of the traditional manual rear load system to the ASL system, that's another element of automation where we're clearly seeing benefits. Kevin Chiang : Excellent. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much Jim. And just following up on Kevin's question there regarding -- and to your point, Jim, it is fluctuation, but it's something that can be managed and it looks like you're doing you're setting up for a great job managing some of that fluctuation. But I guess investors are -- and you touched on it on your pricing, right? In the solid waste sector, investors are accustomed to price never going down. Yes, it might go up less and the volatility is really just how much more does it go up one year to the next. But with some of the renewable energy fluctuations and recycled commodity prices as you pointed out. I mean, you're getting EBITDA going down this year as a result of those. My question, I guess, is that as you build these out more, is this something that you would you would consider spinning off while retaining a stake as to kind of separate the two so that investors who desire that volatility, want that volatility and willing to pay for the volatility can do so and then those that are -- prefer the more steady EBITDA stream that your company has delivered so well in the past, can focus more on. Is that something that is in the cards in the future? How much have you thought about it? Just curious in that regard? Jim Fish : Well, a couple -- I think you're making a couple of points here. Just to maybe correct one thing. Price isn't going down if that's what you were implying. It's not going down. It's just going up by slightly less than it did last year. And to your question about whether we would consider spinning off the RNG business. I mean, first of all, there's a lot of options for us and we would never take any options off the table. But what Tara said earlier, which I think is important is we -- part of the value for us is that we like owning the gas, we like owning the facilities. And so for the time being, the answer is we're going to develop these ourselves. We're going to -- and we're going to see the full benefits come to ourselves. And we'll do everything we can to try and mitigate the volatility -- but we like owning the gas itself. We like being in a position -- I've been in a position in the field where I managed the landfill where we didn't own the well field. And that was not a great position to be in, having been there a number of years ago. So, we like being in a position where we manage the well fields that produce the gas. Not to say we wouldn't consider that down the road. But for now, we're kind of in our infancy and we're going to own and develop on our own for now. John Morris : I think Jim -- Walter Spracklin : Okay. That was my only question. Thanks very much. Jim Fish : Yes. John Morris : I was just going to add on the recycling side. If you look at that separately from the RNG comments you made, if you went back five or six years ago and looked at the commodity price versus what their earnings stream was out of the recycling facilities was much different. But in my prepared comments, you earn at $47 a ton. We're still seeing strong earnings and returns in our -- in all of our MRFs, not to mention the fact that when you were to carve out the automated plants, which is only a small portion, we're going to add to that next year, as Tara mentioned, those margins are even higher. So I would argue that we've taken out a lot of the volatility in the recycling business, and that's why you continue to see our conviction in those investments going forward. Jim Fish : Yes, I'm glad you made that point, John, because we did change a lot of these contracts from four years ago, and I think that's your point. Walter Spracklin : Yes. No, that's absolutely -- that's clear that you've done a lot of good work in terms of restructuring those contracts to produce some of that volatility. Just curious in terms of the spinout, but addressed that question. Appreciate the time. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed. Sean Eastman : Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I just wanted to reconcile the -- there was a 35% labor costs per ton reduction on the recycling footprint mentioned, also a headcount reduction of, I think, 127. Just trying to reconcile those two data points. Tara Hemmer : Yes. So John mentioned in his remarks, the 35% reduction on our automated plants on labor cost per ton, and that's what we saw in Q4. And then that 137 number is related to the headcount attrition related to automation in 2022, and we're expecting 200 in 2023. Sean Eastman : Okay. Helpful. It's impressive. And then, the other one is just kind of nitpicking here, but the some of the inputs on the guidance for this year, $70 OCC, $2.30 RIN price. Could you just tell me where those numbers are today? And if you can, just how to think about sensitivity to the extent we don't climb up to those numbers? Tara Hemmer : Yes. So just to clarify, it's $70 per ton in our commodity basket, not on OCC, just to -- Sean Eastman : Okay. Yes. Tara Hemmer : Yes. So $70 a ton number for 2023, exiting December of this year, just north of $50 a ton. And we're seeing some signs on the plastic side, is a great example, where we're seeing plastic pricing increase a bit. And we've seen that uptick related to, again, CPG companies trying to meet their sustainability commitments on using recycled content. So we expect, if you look at that ramp through Q1, Q2, Q3, we'll start to see that ramp over the quarters when you look at how commodity prices will move on the recycling side of the business. And then, on the renewable energy side of the house, that $2.30 RIN price, exiting 2022, RIN prices were higher. We've seen a bit of a dip on RIN pricing that definitely recognizes what we're seeing in the market today and where we expect it will hedge throughout 2023. Just remember, 40% of our off-take is fixed. So the other 60% is exposed. Devina Rankin : And I would just say the midpoint of our guidance anticipated the commodity values that Terra just went through, the downside has contemplated some of the downside risk should those values be less than what we are currently predicting. Sean Eastman : Understood. Thank you, very much. I\u2019ll pass it over. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. You may proceed. Michael Hoffman : Good morning. I just want to make sure this is very clear. You are not seeing unit prices come down, the rate of change in price is narrowing options coming down? John Morris : No, sir. Michael, no, we are not. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And you are in a position today where you have a real spread against the internal cost of inflation? Jim Fish : Yeah. That was my earlier point. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Jim Fish : This gives us \u2013 it gives us that spread. We had essentially no spread for the last 18 months. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So then I want to dig into \u2013 I think there's more power in the solid waste business than maybe everybody's understanding. Are you about 80% of your EBITDA, 80%, 85% is solid waste and then 15 to 20 is sustainable investments in recycling. Is that about the right proportioning? Devina Rankin : The way that, I would answer the question, Michael, is if you look at our outlook for the year ahead, we're implying growth from the solid waste business of about $475 million and that rivals the highest levels of growth that we've ever seen in our history. And so what we focus on in terms of measuring solid waste performance is our ability to fundamentally grow that business over the long term, both in terms of the pricing execution and our strong focus on operating cost efficiency and those things are what are driving that $475 million target. John Morris : I would tell you, Michael, I think with Devina and I can share this \u2013 we all do on OpEx. But I think to Jim's point, we were kind of arm wrestling with it, I forget the phrase used, Jim. I think the efforts that we undertook last year and what happened in the last two quarters, in particular, the fourth quarter make us feel really good about what's happening on the solid waste side and some of the commentary was about price and yield and the movement. But when you see OpEx, our guidance on OpEx moving the way it is for next year and the EBITDA improvement in Devina said what the strength of the solid waste business is we feel really good about how we're entering 2023. Michael Hoffman : And I agree. I'm trying to get there by backing into numbers a little more precisely. That's why I was asking about the mix. If I'm right, and you're in the 80%, 85% is solid waste, you're going to end up with a 9% to 10% growth in solid waste in 2023 in EBITDA. And like 90 basis points, maybe even 100 basis points in the solid waste business and then you give a little bit of a back because of the other stuff, right? Devina Rankin : We are predicting that strong solid waste growth coupled with some SG&A margin expansion. Those are really the two levers for next year's overall EBITDA growth. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Okay. Well, I tried. I would \u2013 would you all consider starting to segment where you show us recurring core solid waste versus the alternatives? So we start to be able to track this better? Devina Rankin : We always focus on making sure that you guys have the best information available, and we'll continue to try and meet that goal, and we'll step back and look at our disclosures and ensure that they're appropriately robust. We think that they are today, but we know we can always get better. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Baseline capital spending at 2 to 2.1 comes out at 9.9% of revenues, which is below your long-term average. And it's a little surprising given the vendor side of the world is talking about a lot of inflation in their side of the business still. So I'm trying to understand why that baseline \u2013 and it's essentially flat, sequentially in absolute dollars. So what \u2013 I don't think you're under investing in your business. I know, you're not doing that. But can you talk me through why that's settling the way it is? John Morris : I think, Michael, if you look at the inflationary pressure and the performance on the revenue side related to that, we've been also very sensitive to the fact that capital shouldn't just necessarily go up because revenue is. We're looking at it by line of business and what's happened from a volume perspective. And I think that's what you're seeing part of the leverage there. On the supply side, Michael, I would tell you, this was a challenging year in terms of juggling CapEx mostly because of the truck-related issues that we had. So 2023 will be more balanced, but I think you're seeing the sub-10 number as a result of our discipline around capital dollars. Devina Rankin : The other thing I would point out is we did pull ahead some capital into the fourth quarter. And as a result of our ability to do that, we moderated our outlook for 2023 capital slightly from our original expectations. Should we see a need to adjust that further as we get into the year and perform well as we expect to do, particularly in the solid waste business, we might take some steps to accelerate capital that much further. But this is about strong execution on capital discipline, combined with our ability to ensure that our price isn't just addressing the operating cost side of the business, but also capital inflation. Michael Hoffman : Right. Last two for me. Tara, the $500 million of EBITDA in RNG in 2026, how much of it is fixed versus spot? Tara Hemmer : Today, we have 40% fixed based on the roughly 4 million MMBtu, and so that is what is fixed today. We're working on fixing more of that longer-term. Michael Hoffman : But -- so you don't have a goal for that $500 million? I guess that's what I'm trying to ask. What how much of it. Tara Hemmer : Yes. We have a goal. We'll give you more information on that in April, Michael. We have a pathway to have a portfolio mix longer-term. Michael Hoffman : And will you give a sales when you do it for\u2026 Tara Hemmer : We\u2019re going to unpack that in April. Michael Hoffman : And will you talk about sales in April as well, so we can model this, right? Tara Hemmer : You're talking about revenue, yes, revenue on the RNG business. Michael Hoffman : Yes, yes. I mean in the supplemental document, we have the EBITDA and the free cash, but they don't have revenue. So we're all guessing what that means to our model. Tara Hemmer : You can -- I think you could figure it out based on the $26 per MMBtu number we gave you. Jim Fish : Suffice to say, it\u2019s the margins on this business, Michael, and whether you're looking at margins on the EBITDA side are 70%-ish maybe 75%. I mean, we'll get -- as she\u2019ll still give more detail on in April. And then as Devina went through, the cash conversion is tremendous, too. So it's why this business -- why we're so excited about it. And nobody has asked a question about M&A, but I did mention that I'd rather do a three times EBITDA investment than a 10 times EBITDA investment where there's some uncertainty about integration. So we'll talk about revenue and what it means. But these are hugely high margins on the EBITDA line with these RNG plants. Michael Hoffman : Last question for me. In 2019, you told us that the solid waste business would compound at 5% to 7% EBITDA free cash. When I add in the $740 million by 2026, will that new baseline still compounded by the aggregate number, 5% to 7%, or does that 10% increase dilute that compounding, the aggregate compounding? Devina Rankin : It's a great question, Michael. And what we're doing is working to segment these parts of the business very clearly so that we can articulate the level of growth that each of them is expected to have. The solid waste business has outperformed that 5% to 7% target that we established, and we couldn't be more proud of those results. In terms of what's happening in the RNG and recycling businesses, we're talking about a new step level change in our free cash flow generation for the business. Our ability to grow that, I think done a great job of articulating the fact that this opportunity and what's outlined in the supplemental deck is just a starting point for us. Our portfolio provides tremendous upside opportunity from here. Our ability to say whether that's 5% to 7% or some other number, that will come as we further articulate our plans for building out the total addressable market that we have across our landfill network. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. You may proceed. Michael Feniger : Thanks, everyone. I know we're over. So I'll just keep it short. Tara, apologies if you touched on this, but why has RINs rolled over in the beginning of this year? And any policy actions that we should be monitoring that helps get that RIN recovery to that 230 for the full year? Tara Hemmer : Yeah. I think the important thing to remember here is that earlier in -- really in December of 2022, EPA came out with their that rule, which on the positive side, set a three-year framework for renewable volume obligations, which for us for the long-term is positive because at the end of the day, it really sets the standard for the program and the RIN pathway for us. I think there's been a little bit of speculation in the marketplace around whether or not those were the right numbers that EPA issued. We're confident that come June when EPA issues their final rule, there'll be more clarity. So I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing. But long-term, strong fundamentals on the price side related to RINs. Michael Feniger : Thank you. And just, Devina, the last four to five years, I think your EBITDA margins have been in the tight range of 28% to 28.4%. You are now guiding for 40 to 80 bps, so moving up there. Just can you quantify how much of a headwind is there on the margin for RNG and OCC in 2023 based on the guide? Devina Rankin : It's 10 to 20 basis points. Michael Feniger : Perfect. Okay. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. You may proceed. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Thank you. We'll keep it brief. And, kind of, just a continuation of the last question. Just wanted to talk about what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint in your renewable energy business. I know that does include RINs, but it does include some other factors as well within your business. And then longer term, I know near-term, Devina, you just kind of discussed with the EPA standards and RIN pricing. But is there any kind of risk of maybe a supply-demand in balance with more supply at some point as more and more of certainly you guys but also your competitors also bring these renewable natural gas facilities online, just what that can mean for pricing, not necessarily this year or next, but longer term? Thanks. Devina Rankin : Sure. I'll speak to the price side, and this is a footnote in our press release, but we did see pricing come down in the three categories, slight decline on the power side. And as you can imagine, we saw some record power prices related to some of the dynamics in 2022 related to weather and whatnot. So that's reflected on the power side. On the natural gas side, natural gas pricing has come down. We were north of $5 in 2022 and now coming in and around 360, that's what we're guiding to. And then on RIN prices, again, 230 is what we have in our guidance. And I think I just went over a little bit of the dynamics there. As far as the supply and demand dynamic, I think what's really important to note on the renewable natural gas side is there are two markets, and they're quite robust. The first is on the transportation side, which is where we generate D3 RINs. And for us, we're in a unique position. Jim has mentioned this before, where we own our own fleet, so we're able to capture more of the value, and we have robust discussions with obligated parties. So we're able to trade those RINs and have a long history with that. At the same time, you have this voluntary market that exists where many, many public utilities have come out with announcement where they need to decarbonize their own portfolios and the fastest way for them to do that is to buy renewable natural gas and buy renewable natural gas at a price premium. And again, we'll give you more information on this in April, but we feel really positive about the options that we have for each of those. Stephanie Moore : Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Stephanie Yee : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to the 2023 guidance overall, and just ask whether you're assuming a recession in the guide or maybe just a slowing economic environment. And I guess you could probably see this most reflected in the volume guidance range. So is the low end of the range at kind of negative 1.5%, embed some conservatism on the economic environment. Jim Fish : I wouldn't say that any of us are macroeconomists. So whether we're projecting a recession or not is hard to say. But we are projecting some softness for sure. We saw some softness in our volume numbers, as I mentioned, probably particularly in roll-off for Q4, and that's continued a bit in January, albeit -- our numbers were a little stronger volume-wise in January. I think if we try and read those tea leaves ourselves, and we're all reading as much information as we can, it feels like there could be some type of slowdown, especially as the consumer eats through all of their savings. But I am -- the last thing I am as a macro economist. So I can't sit here and tell you, yes, we're going to see a recession next year. We're just having to manage our business to \u2013 to our own best abilities. And that's why we have taken cost control on very seriously. That's why pricing is still an important aspect of this. And then at the same time, for the long-term, these renewable natural gas facilities and automation of a number of these positions makes a lot of sense. So that really is affected by \u2013 by any downturn in the economy. Stephanie Yee : Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Dodge with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed. Devin Dodge : Thanks. Good morning. I suspect we'll get more color on April 5, but could you provide a framework for how meaningful Erin could be from a WM perspective? Tara Hemmer : So, the important thing to remember is it's a proposed rule and EPA will be coming out with our final framework sometime over the summer. I think from our perspective though, you got to look at the 66 landfill gas to electricity plants that we have, that we own. And this, we believe, will be a significant revenue stream for us long term. It's a great example of our ability, where we have owned these facilities and invested in them and retained the value. Now, we're in a position to optimize the value with this pathway. So, really waiting for a bit more color from EPA on what their final framework is going to look like, but really optimistic. Again, no incremental CapEx on that potential revenue stream. Devin Dodge : Good color. Okay. So maybe on the same thread, do you think, Erin's even could impact the development pipeline for landfill RNG projects, or do you still expect RNG to be the most desirable landfill gas project, assuming the site is suitable for it? Tara Hemmer : Yes, great question. I think we're -- first and foremost, we're really confident on the path that we're on with the 20 projects that we have in the deck. And we're actively looking at our portfolio. We're going to make the best economic decision, the best environmental decision. And the good news is, we have a lot of options here. I mean, that's something that Jim said earlier on, good, really good or great. We view these frameworks as great for WM. So we're going to evaluate what makes the most sense for us long term. Devin Dodge : Okay. And then maybe just one kind of more detailed question. But in Q4, we saw that core price and yield in the collection and disposal business, they really converged, which is great. But it was a much tighter spread than we've seen in recent quarters. And then the 2023 guide suggested would widen back out again. Just can you provide some color on some of the factors that impacted that spread in Q4?. Devina Rankin : Yes, it's a great question. And when we wish we had a specific science towards being able to predict the Q4 results were best ever in terms of the difference between core price and yield. And in large part, that speaks to the strong churn that John mentioned during his prepared remarks, the 400 basis point improvement there is a really strong indicator that price is holding with our customers and that we're doing -- I'm sorry, the comment was on robot on churn, but our churn has been really strong as well. And our ability to hold on to every core price dollar and convert that to yield really was the best we've ever seen. In terms of our ability to predict that we'd still see those levels in 2023, I think it actually goes back to Stephanie's question earlier about the macroeconomic outlook. We used our long-term averages of converting our core price dollar to yield, rather than the fourth quarter launch pad. Because we view the macroeconomic environment is a little more uncertain than it is today, though we are seeing those signs of self-antigen done a good job of articulating. We do think that all indicators point to a soft recession in '23, and we didn't want to overpredict our ability to convert core price to yield in the year ahead. Devin Dodge : Okay. Thanks, guys. Makes sense. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m now showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Fish for any closing remarks. Jim Fish : Okay. Thank you. Well, we ran a bit long today, but we have a lot to cover. Thank you for your patience. Thanks for joining us and we will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Ed Egl, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Ed Egl : Thank you, Tawanda. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You will hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover high-level financials and provide a strategic update. John will cover an operating overview, and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release, and the schedules to the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections, or opinions about future periods. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to Internal Revenue Growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. During the call, Jim, John, and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the first quarter of 2022. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA, and margin and operating expense and margin results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operation. These adjusted measures in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures.

Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of WM is prohibited. Now, I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks Ed and thank you all for joining us. We're off to a solid start in 2023 with first quarter results, delivering on our expectations and keeping us on track to achieve our full year guidance. First quarter revenue grew 5% with continued strong organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 7%. We're pleased with these results, particularly when you consider the impact of West Coast weather disruptions on our operations. With that said, our first quarter performance was basically on our budget and our strategic priorities of maintaining strong price discipline, permanently reducing our operating and SG&A cost structure through business optimization, technology and automation and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth are right on track. Executing on these priorities will produce the robust short-term and long-term financial performance that we've projected. As you heard at our Sustainability Investor Day at the beginning of the month, we're very enthusiastic about how the growth in our renewable energy and recycling businesses strengthens WM's compelling investment thesis. We expect the investments that we're making over the next several years to provide meaningful operating EBITDA and free cash flow growth with impressive returns. We remain on track to bring online two new renewable natural gas facilities and seven newly automated material recovery facilities by the end of the year. We're also opening one new MRF in 2023 in the Greater Toronto area, which positions us strongly in the largest growth market in Canada. Even as these important parts of our operations grow our solid waste business will continue to make up the lion's share of our earnings, projected to generate roughly 85% of operating EBITDA in 2026. As a result, our focus on optimizing performance and reducing costs in the solid waste business through technology and automation is critically important and will serve to further separate us from our competition. One excellent example of this is the expansion of our customer self-service capabilities where we've reduced our call center department costs in the first quarter by more than 20% compared to last year, while at the same time maintaining or improving our Net Promoter Scores in the commercial and industrial lines of business. So far in 2023, the WM team continues to deliver strong performance. The investments we're making set us up to further differentiate our industry leading asset network and capabilities. When you combine these strategic positioning -- when you combine this strategic positioning with the essential nature of our service, our diverse customer base and our recurring revenue streams, it provides confidence in our ability to continue to reach our strong financial projections over the long-term. For the remainder of 2023, our outlook remains consistent with the full year guidance provided at the beginning of the year, including adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7% at the midpoint and between 40 and 80 basis points of adjusted operating EBITDA margin expansion, driven by our collection and disposal business. In closing, I want to thank the 49,000 people behind WM's success this quarter and every quarter. Without this team, none of this would be possible. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks Jim and good morning. 2023 has started off as planned and we're pleased to have achieved our first quarter targets. Overall adjusted operating EBITDA grew nearly 4% and operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew 7% in the quarter. One area that exceeded our expectations was pricing as we continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. As Jim mentioned, our first quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 7%. This growth was led by core price of 7.4%, which exceeded both last year and our plan for the first quarter. This strong core price translated into collection and disposal yield of 6.2%, a 70 basis point improvement compared with Q1 of 2022. We saw strong yield performance across all lines of business and are particularly proud of our post collection yield. We have consistently emphasized the importance of post collection pricing and in Q1, we delivered yield of 8.9% of our transfer stations, and 5.4% for landfill MSW, both increases from last year. In fact, the transfer station yield is a new high for that line of business, which is helping to offset, increasing cost of labor and transportation. Our collective focus continues to be striking the right balance between maximizing customer lifetime value and increasing price to recover higher costs. We remain confident that we can achieve our full year pricing expectations for core price of 6.5% to 7% and yield approaching 5.5%. Turning to volumes, first quarter collection and disposal volume grew 0.8%. Landfill volumes led the way with C&D volumes up almost 37% in the quarter, driven by the hurricane cleanup in Florida and MSW volumes increased by almost 3%. Special waste volumes moderated in the quarter due to the timing of event-driven work, but our pipeline remains robust, and we believe that those volumes will provide incremental revenue growth as we progress through Q2 and the balance of the year. Our collection volumes were down modestly in the quarter, driven by intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns. This has led to some non-regrettable volume losses in our residential and commercial business. With profitability improving in each line of business and contract wins with healthy price increases, we're pleased to see our differentiated service and disciplined approach to yield benefits. For the full year, we continue to expect flat overall volumes at the midpoint of our guidance. Turning to operating expenses, which increased 70 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 63%. I want to frame these results and then talk about the efforts in place to optimize our cost to serve in 2023 and over the long-term. There were two primary contributors to our first quarter results, the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and continued inflationary cost pressure. As a reminder, we closed on about $365 million of acquisitions of solid waste and recycling businesses in the second half of the year. Integration costs and upfront dilutive margins of these acquisitions had about a 35 basis point impact in the quarter. While this impact was a little more than expected, overall, we're very pleased with the progress being made on creating value from these businesses. The remaining impact was due to persistent cost inflation, which was most significant in wages, repair and maintenance and subcontractor costs. The good news is we see signs of easing cost pressures and the steps we are taking to combat higher costs are also showing benefits. Frontline wage increases are now in the mid-single-digit range as compared to the high single to low double-digit increases that we saw in late 2021 and 2022. And we're starting to see truck orders fulfilled, which benefits every aspect of our cost structure because employee engagement is better, downtime on route is minimized, repair costs to reduce, and expensive rentals can be eliminated. Getting trucks delivered will also be key to residential automation. As we move from traditional rear load to automated side loaders, we're taking a helper off the back and getting about a 30% productivity pickup, which equates to lower driver technician and truck capital needs. We talked a lot about the work we're doing to optimize our cost to serve. Investments we are making in our people and processes are also important. We're always working to make WM a great safe place to work and delivering our team members of best-in-class compensation and benefits package. One of the benefits we know that comes from these efforts is improved retention, which then translates into even better customer service and optimized cost structure because our tenured drivers are the safest and most efficient. In the first quarter of 2023, we saw the best driver retention we've seen in two years. This positions us to drive down our training and overtime hours, improve overall efficiency, and most important, see continued improvement in our safety performance. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for the fantastic job they do safely and reliably serving our customers day in and day out. We've had a solid start to 2023 and look forward to building on our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks John and good morning. We're pleased to see our robust revenue growth and disciplined focus on cost control translate into solid operating and free cash flow. First quarter cash flow from operations of $1.04 billion is in line with our plan and a strong result, particularly when you consider higher cash interest and incentive compensation payments. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $660 million, with $504 million related to normal course capital to support our business and $156 million of spending on sustainability growth projects. On the capital front, there are two key takeaways. The first is that we're pleased with the continued progress on our sustainability growth projects relative to plan. The second is that truck deliveries are improving. At this time last year, we have received less than 50 trucks. This year, we received about 470. While this is certainly better and shows some easing of the significant supply chain constraints from a year ago, we're still waiting for truck deliveries we planned for 2022. These delays impact our team's ability to deliver on residential collection optimization objectives and targeted improvements in our maintenance cost per driver hour. So, while we're encouraged the worst of the recent uncertainty is behind us, we still need to see a more reliable delivery schedule from manufacturers. Our business generated free cash flow of $395 million in the first quarter and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments of $551 million, which puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance on this measure of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. Even as we invest in high-return sustainability growth projects within our business, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to all of our capital allocation priorities. We returned $639 million to shareholders during the quarter, paying $289 million in dividends and repurchasing $350 million of our stock. We expect dividends to total about $1.1 billion this year. And with our outlook for strong earnings growth over the remainder of the year in a healthy balance sheet we expect to continue to repurchase our shares fairly ratably over the remainder of the year. Our leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2 times, which is well within our target ratio of between 2.5 and 3 times. About 18% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates and our pretax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 3.7%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well-positioned to fund growth investments. Turning to SG&A, we're pleased with the progress we're making to drive leverage from a more efficient cost structure. In the first quarter, SG&A costs were essentially flat with the same period in the prior year, and spending as a percentage of revenue improved by 40 basis points to 9.7%. These results demonstrate our success in rationalizing costs and optimizing our sales and customer experience functions. We expect our investments to continue to drive improvement in SG&A costs and put us on a path toward a permanently reduced SG&A cost structure. Our operating EBITDA margin performance for the quarter was generally in line with our expectations. The 40 basis point margin decline year-over-year is due to three things; one, commodity price impacts on our renewable energy and recycling businesses, which created a 50 basis point margin headwind. Two, the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in late 2022, which had about a 40 basis point impact. And three, cost pressure in our collection and just local business from wage inflation and delayed truck deliveries, which we estimate had about a 20 basis point impact. These margin impacts were offset in part by a 40 basis point improvement in SG&A and a 30 basis point benefit from the timing of alternative fuel tax credit. Our disciplined organic revenue growth and focus on optimization and cost control are expected to drive year-over-year margin expansion for the remainder of the year, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. In closing, the WM team has delivered a solid start to the year, which sets us up for another year of strong financial growth in 2023. I can't thank our hard-working team members enough for all of their contributions to our success. With that, Tawanda, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Your line is open. Bryan Burgmeier : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. EBITDA margins were slight [ph] in 1Q, at least relative to the sell-side, I appreciate all the detail you provided there. You reiterated guidance for the 80 basis points improvement for 2023. So, do you think we see EBITDA margins inflect in 2Q or at least maybe approach flat and they inflect in 3Q? Just a little bit of timing -- a little bit detail about how much about the timing of improvement on margins. Devina Rankin : Yes, it's a great question. We definitely see the lion's share of that contribution of EBITDA margin coming in the third and fourth quarters. We do expect some improvement from what we saw in the first quarter. I want to point out a couple of things that happened in Q1 that we don't see as indicative of the margins that we'll expect for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned on the commodity businesses, that was 50 basis points of the impact in the quarter. We expected our first quarter to be the hardest comp on a year-over-year basis from commodity prices, and so we think most of that impact starts to abate beginning in Q2. But as I said, most of that really comes in Q3 and Q4 when the year-over-year comparisons on commodity prices improve. On the dilutive impact of M&A at 40 basis points, that was about half solid waste and half recycling. And like I said, we're pleased with the traction that we're seeing in each of those businesses on the recycling side because that business is in a development phase. We knew that there would be some upfront costs associated with integrating that business. They just happen to be higher than our expectations. We don't expect that to continue over the remainder of the year. So, that's another thing that gives us confidence. On the solid waste side, we took a really important step that's team member-focused and an investment in our frontline by making the MLK holiday across the entire organization. That emphasizes our focus on people first, but that is a Q1-only event, and that's something else that will abate for the rest of the year. So, those are the things that give us confidence that the Q1 results of 40 basis points will exceed what you see for the remainder of the year. And in fact, we do see some of that coming out in Q2, but Q3 and Q4 is really where you start to see some strong results. Bryan Burgmeier : Great. Thanks for the extra detail. And last question for me. Maybe just how did the value of the recycled commodities in 1Q compare to your expectations? Can you share what you might be expecting for 2Q? And apologies if I missed this, but are you still looking for a $70 a ton commodity basket for 2023? Thanks and I'll turn it over. Answer Jim Fish : Yes. Bryan, we are still looking to see $70 for 2023. The trend has been good and it's what we anticipated. So, at the end of Q4, we were at $47. Q1 was at $54, but it got better as you went through the quarter. So, $57 was our average in the month of March. And then as we're getting into April, we're seeing that continue to improve. Couple of things are helping us. The mill capacity that's coming online is helping with demand on the back end. We're also seeing a pretty significant uptick in pricing for plastics, for aluminums and a little bit for OCC. So, we are still sticking with our $70 and feel pretty confident in that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, getting the additional truck orders fulfilled and that getting more back to normal. How quickly can we see that productivity impact into your results? And could that be upside to the guidance for this year? Or is that already embedded in the guide, that it returns to more of a normal trend? John Morris : No, So, I think -- listen, we're thrilled that the supply chain and truck deliveries are starting to abate. As Devina mentioned, we almost -- we delivered almost 500 trucks year-to-date versus 50 last year. It takes 30 to 45 days to get those vehicles sort of on the road and get the older vehicles off. So, there's a little bit of a lag. That was considered when we put together our plan for EBITDA and EBITDA margin this year. We went back and took a look before the call. We probably -- if you go back to kind of post-COVID, we're probably lagging 2,000-plus vehicles from what our fleet plan would have been. So, we're going to get a full complement of trucks this year, probably 1,500 to 1,600 is what we think. So, we're going to continue to get those assets in play as quick as we can and drive the benefit. But keep in mind, part of the M&R pressure is that -- it's not just the trucks we didn't get in 2022, it's we caught up in 2021 from 2022, 2022 to 2023, et cetera. Toni Kaplan : Great. I wanted to just ask my follow-up on the sort of more recent, like April, late March trends. Have you seen those improving? Or has there been any change? Obviously, the banking crisis sort of doesn't impact your business as much as some of the other business services companies. But any heightened recession concerns with your customers? Like any change in conversations that you're having with customers? Thanks. Jim Fish : So, John can address the cost side and what we're seeing so far. I would tell you that as far as the overall macro economy, we've been looking at it closely because it seems as if every day, somebody comes out with a different projection. Maybe the best indicators for us are things like churn and price rollbacks. Those have been at the historic low end of our ranges and continue to be there. Also looking at some of our volume numbers, especially MSW, MSW was 2.7%. It's around 3% still. So, those are pretty good signs for the overall economy. Now we tend to be kind of at the back end. So, sometimes we don't see the early signs. But everything we're looking at still seems to be okay. It doesn't look like a blowout for sure, but it doesn't look like the bottom is falling out. So, that's encouraging. John Morris : I think on the cost side, Toni, I addressed the M&R and some of the challenges we have seen here. The good news is we're starting to open up. On the labor front, I said in my prepared comments, we were close to high single, low double digits, and that's moderated back down to mid-single-digits. So, that certainly is a benefit going forward throughout the year. Subcontractors, we're still seeing a little bit of lag there, and it's really more of third-party transporters. But as you saw within our post-collection pricing and more specifically our transfer stations, we continue to address that through the revenue quality of the remote gates at or the transfer station. I think -- when it all comes down to it, I think we talk about automation and optimization. It's really about permanently lowering our operating expense exposure. And that's really, as Jim mentioned, what we're really focused on for the balance of the year. Toni Kaplan : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi, good morning everyone. Jim Fish : Good morning. Jerry Revich : Devina, I'm wondering if you can talk about second quarter. So, normal seasonality is your margins are up about 200 basis points second quarter versus first quarter. And you mentioned a number of one-offs in the first quarter. So, I'm wondering, as you're thinking about the cadence, is there a potential for margins to be up stronger sequentially than the typical two points that we've seen in the past. Devina Rankin : Yes, it's a great question, Jerry. And that's some of the analysis we've been particularly honed in and on and looking at. And that is our expectation, is that the first quarter of 2023 had some margin pressures that we see as more related to 2023 specifically, such that the normal seasonal uptick that we see from a revenue perspective will provide the typical expansion. And then on top of that, we'll have some added benefits from lapping some of the commodity price impacts I've talked about. We're also expecting to see some strong accretive revenue come back in the collection line of business, in particular as our differentiated service model really pays some dividends in terms of our national accounts business where we are going to lap some of the contracts' expirations and we're going to see some contracts return. So, those are the things that give us so much confidence that Q2 really will be outsized relative to a typical year. Jerry Revich : That's great. So, really you have high visibility on essentially getting to your margin run rate as early as 2Q. Okay. And can I ask on the post-collection pricing momentum that, John, you mentioned in the prepared remarks. How much more momentum is there, I would have presumed a chunk of that is CPI pricing rolling. But can you just expand -- and really nice to see the strong numbers, both in transfer stations and landfills. John Morris : Yes, Jerry. I would tell you that's something we've been working on, and that's been a tougher hill to climb, obviously, because those are bigger chunks of a volume and big customers when you're making those decisions. I think as I mentioned, the transportation piece, and a lot of that is labor and fuel, if you will, has continued to persist, which is why one of the reasons why you continue to see us be as aggressive as we are on the transfer station side. And on the landfill side, again, the cost of constructing and operating as landfills is not getting cheaper. So, part of our pricing strategy, obviously, a minimum to recover our investment there, but also look for margin improvement where that opportunity exists. Jim Fish : I think, Jerry, it's also worth mentioning that our team is, over the years -- the last couple of years has really come to appreciate the fact that landfill aerospace is a precious commodity and if you think about particularly the East Coast, that space doesn't come cheaply and it's -- there's a finite life to all of those. So, we need to price it that way. And that's, in large part, what you're seeing out of transportation but also largely landfill pricing. Jerry Revich : And Jim, just one last one, if I could. SG&A has obviously been a big focus for you, and really strong cost control this quarter. Can you talk about, did we get a full quarter run rate out of the initiatives that you mentioned on the call center side this quarter? Or is that momentum building over the course of the year? Jim Fish : So, on the call center side, we did not refill about 580 positions last year and there are another 300 that we will choose not to refill this year. So, I would say we're probably -- we were probably 60% of the way there on that piece. But some of those other positions that we've talked about, John mentioned it, which is replacing reloaders with ASOs. And he talked about 30% productivity pick up there. We're not -- because we haven't been receiving the trucks, I mean, you can't make that swap obviously without the truck. There's some work that's involved with our public sector team. They have to talk to our customers and make sure that they're comfortable with going to trash just being in one of those totters [ph] as opposed to everything sitting on the curve. But -- and they've made nice progress there. But as we do that, we think there's another probably up to 2,000 positions that are helpful positions that we just will choose not to refill. And as you can imagine, those have very high turnover, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% for those. So, once those trucks come in, once we've talked to the customer base, we will transition those. And maybe the most important piece that John mentioned is it helps us from a safety standpoint. 70% our injuries happen in the residential line of business. And I would guess that 90% of that 70% are on rear loaders. Jerry Revich : Very interesting. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey good morning. Devina Rankin : Good morning. Tyler Brown : Hey Jim, John, just I was looking back through the Q4 transcript, and I'm not really sure I saw it. But can you just kind of remind us what is embedded -- or the level of unit cost inflation that's kind of embedded in the 2023 guide and maybe where are you today? Devina Rankin : Sure. In terms of unit cost inflation, we expected in 2023 about 4% to 5% unit cost inflation for the year. And when we look at Q1, it was certainly higher than that. But our expectation is that, that moderates. And as John has talked about, in particular, labor and repair and maintenance are expected to benefit from the actions that we saw early signs of as we looked at February, March, but we expect to continue to gain momentum over the remainder of the year. Tyler Brown : Right. Okay. So, that kind of naturally slopes down. So, look, Jim, I don't want to get into the comparison game, but one of your competitors showed core pricing accelerated in Q1. It looks like your pricing may be peaked in Q4. I get that there are a variety of factors at play. But I've got a lot of questions this morning. But just any thoughts on the pricing environment, your go-to-market strategy? And do you just feel comfortable that you can maintain a nice positive spread to unit cost inflation both over the short and long-term? Jim Fish : Yes. Look, I didn't see what their numbers were at. But I would tell you this, first of all, I looked back. Historically, we anticipated the question. And historically, Q1 has been the lowest yield for us over a period of probably a decade. It's almost always been the lowest yield number on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But when I look at how we're doing with things like rollback of price and churn, those are, as I said, near the bottom end of our historic ranges. And I also was very encouraged to see pricing in two particular places that we' re encouraging : residential, which John talked about, and landfill and transfer. Those are -- we just talked about it with Jerry, but those were really important areas for us to kind of -- all three of those. When we talk about it probably four years ago, we're talking about something less than 1%. And now we're talking about much higher numbers, albeit in a higher inflation environment. But still, I think you're seeing the discipline there around pricing very strong. So, I don't know really what the other folks reported, but I would tell you, there's no loss of discipline whatsoever. There's really, I think, Tyler, three areas that we're all focused on for 2023, and those are top of line -- at the very top of the list has got to be price, and then a close second to that is what John has been talking about, which is cost control, both SG&A and OpEx and using technology to facilitate that. And then, of course, the third one is when we talked about three weeks ago, which are those sustainability investments. So, those three are really kind of our near-term focus that will help us out in the long-term. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. And then my last one, I got to kind of go back over this margin walk, there's a ton in there. So, make sure I've got it. So, commodities and RINs were a 50 basis point headwind, M&A was about a 40 basis point headwind. You mentioned something -- I think you said 30 basis points from a fuel tax credit. I was unclear, is that a hurt or help. And then you mentioned in higher incentive compensation, I wasn't sure if you were talking cash flow or EBITDA. And then is the holiday addition about a 50 basis point headwind as well as I would assume it's kind of like one less workday? Devina Rankin : Yes. So, let me take that in pieces. The alternative fuel tax credit was a help of 30 basis points, and that's a help because of timing. So, you might recall that last year, we got -- there was a delay in the approval of those tax credits by government. And so there was a delay in our recognition of those tax credit benefits until the third quarter of 2022. So, what you're seeing this year is that those are going to be recognized quarter-by-quarter. So, we got the benefit in Q1. We'll have another benefit in Q2 and then that moderates in Q3, reverses itself, and then normalizes beginning in Q4. On the dilutive impact from commodity businesses of 50 basis points, you had that right. Incentive compensation was cash flow. So, yes, that was a cash flow impact. When we gave our guidance for 2023, we talked about working capital being a headwind in the year. And a lot of that headwind, really all of that headwind was in the first quarter as anticipated because higher incentive compensation payments happened in Q1 because of the 2022 outperformance relative to our plan. So, that moderates and really starts to become a tailwind over the remainder of the year. On the solid waste side, when I was mentioning the MLK holiday, that was part of the 20 basis point margin headwind that we saw from the solid waste part of the business. What's really important there, I think, in terms of thinking about what it means for the rest of the year is that, that impact isn't something that repeats itself. It actually doesn't become a help necessarily, but it's not something that we see repeating over the remainder of the year because it was a onetime event. Jim Fish : And it was not -- there wasn't one less workday. We still had to work those days. It's just we paid everybody time and a half. Tyler Brown : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Okay, perfect. Super helpful as usual. Thank you so much. Devina Rankin : Thanks Tyler. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open. Michael Hoffman : Hey WM, how is everybody today? Jim Fish : Good morning Michael. Devina Rankin : Hey. Michael Hoffman : So, John, what is the trend on service intervals, new business formation, temporary roll-off asset utilization? John Morris : So, the service interval piece, Michael, is still positive. That's the headline. In addition to the service intervals, though, as Jim mentioned in the commentary a few minutes ago, the other parts of that, that we're really paying close attention to is what the churn rate is doing and what the rollbacks are doing even as we continue to be aggressive on the pricing side. And those have all continued to stay static and in a good spot and service intervals are still positive. So we feel good about that. Devina Rankin : From an asset utilization perspective, Michael, I think it's important that as John mentioned, it takes 35 to 40 days to get those new trucks in service and on the road. That means that we've been holding on to some of our older vehicles longer. And so asset utilization, not necessarily where we like it to be. But that's because we've needed to be intentional about keeping our vehicles and maintaining them so that we meet all of our service needs for our customers. John Morris : So, this is anecdotal, Michael, but we did our business refused with all our areas last week. And one of our areas actually was scheduled to return some rental trucks which, as you can imagine, are done at a premium. And we were told, hey, your trucks are going to be -- and it wasn't a large amount of trucks, less than a dozen trucks. But this area turned their trucks back in and then we got delayed another 30 or 45 days on some of the delivery. So, to Devina's point, there's a little pensiveness by the field, and we understand it's to send those trucks back, whether it's rentals or surplus assets. The good news is, like we said, there's almost 500 trucks that are on the ground, not in service yet. So, when we think about rentals and surplus assets, we have a clear path for the rest of the year and more confidence in the delivery schedule that we're going to be able to take those out. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then just to settle the on temporal losses. I mean, that's sort of a good canary in the coal mine about business activity. What's the temporal loss utilization look like? John Morris : I don't know, Michael, we've seen a meaningful movement there. I would tell you, we don't talk about weather, but there was a handful of areas on the West Coast where we were shut down for a few days and some kind of really odd weather. But other than that, it's been -- I think the temp story has been a consistent one. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then, Devina, can you share something? I know it historically don't, but I think it helps put in perspective Tyler's question. Your 62 is a good number. But what's the mix of index versus open market? Because I think there's some waiting issue there that people should appreciate given that 70% of your index is happening now and it's a number from last summer, not the end of the calendar year. John Morris : So, we've said, Michael, about 40% of our revenue is indexed. It's not all CPI as we've talked about. The majority of that, though, really, as we all know, runs through that residential line of business. And that's when you look at the pricing and the yield results in residential, I think for the quarter, we were up $53 million in revenue. We're down about 29 in volume. So, we continue to down that path until we get to some acceptable spot there. And it's noteworthy that the residential line of business, as you can imagine, is one that eats a little more of the inflation, some of the other one due to the labor intensity and whatnot. But if you look at where CPI was last quarter or this quarter, you look at core price and yield, we're still pricing above that. So, we're getting traction even above that CPI number. Michael Hoffman : But just to be clear, the part of the drag on the 62 with people are looking sequentially is the number that's in the first half isn't the immediate -- just immediate CPI. It's actually -- well, one from last summer, which would be lower than the CPI that was at the end of the year. That's the subtlety of your model because so much of your business resets in the first half. It's not a negative. It's just everybody needs to understand it. Devina Rankin : Yes, you're right, Michael. About 70% of our resets are in the first half of the year, and those are all indexed to a year ago activity. And so we'll see some of that benefit as we go through the rest of the year in terms of where inflation headline numbers continue to be high. Michael Hoffman : Right. Okay. And then on the commodity side, the other pieces of your model are RINs in nat gas and electricity. Overall, you have an assumption all this would improve. I have a suspicion maybe you will end up with two lefts and a right versus two rights and a left to get to the same outcome. But do you feel comfortable about the whole mix, not just recycling that all of those things are going to collectively get to the right place relative to the guide? Jim Fish : I like the way you said that, Michael. I was trying to figure out a good way to say that. You said it better than I would. But you're right. I mean, it's -- in any big business, there's going to be a few things that work in our favor, a few things that work against us. RIN pricing is probably a little bit against us right now. We budgeted $2.30, and it's $2. So, that one may end up being a little bit of a headwind. But we've also gone through some of the tailwinds, too. I mean SG&A, is -- I'm not sure we've ever had an SG&A number as a percent of revenue below 10% for the first quarter because the revenue base is always low for Q1. So, we're doing a better job on SG&A than we actually anticipated. I could say the same thing about MSW volume or a couple of the other things. So, you're right. There's a few things that are coming in a little lower than our expectation. RIN pricing would be one of those. On the other side, recycle pricing, as we talked about a little bit earlier, is right on our expectations. So, we're pleased with that because I know there were a few that had questioned our $70 number, and that looks like it's probably going to hold. So, I think you're right about the fact that there's a whole bunch of pieces in play here. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then last one for me. One of the things I've noticed that you have all been doing, and maybe it was perpetual, first of all, maybe it was just an outcome, is the gap between what you're getting in yield in collection versus the yield and post collection has been closing. How much more can that close? It's a good thing. Well, how much more can that close? Jim Fish : I think it will continue to close. And I said it a little bit earlier, but there's a real appreciation for the fact that especially landfill airspace is a precious commodity. Particularly when you think about it on the East Coast and on the West Coast, I mean, maybe not quite as much in the middle of the country, but definitely on the East Coast, I mean, you see it. Anybody who lives in New York sees it, anybody who lives in Boston sees it. And I'm not sure we've priced it that way over the years. You're seeing us price it that way. We recognize that these have a finite life to them. And so why fill them up with kind of low-priced tons when we can fill them up at a slower rate, maybe at higher price tons, preserve some of that airspace. Give us time to figure out our solution once those do ultimately go away. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Looking forward to seeing you in New Orleans. Jim Fish : Thanks Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Your line is open. Kevin Chiang : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Maybe just on -- in your prepared remarks, you talked about the MRF you opened in Toronto here. Just wondering how that positions you given the province -- if Ontario is looking to put in a producer responsibility legislation or as producer responsibility legislation? Does this MRF make you more competitive as you think of the opportunities stemming from that legislation? Jim Fish : I think it does, Ken, I think it puts us in a great position there. It's the highest growth province in Canada, and Toronto is the biggest city in Canada. So, it puts us in a really, really good position add to that -- that this MRF will be one of the new style MRF, so with a lot of automation in it. So, it comes to us, as any of our new MRF will, with lower labor cost, 30% is what we're seeing in terms of labor cost per unit with the automation that we're adding. So, we're excited about the MRF coming in to Toronto. It's, in our mind, it's a perfect place to put a new MRF. Kevin Chiang : Perfect. No, that makes a ton of sense. And maybe just the EPA did come out with, I guess, a Phase 3 proposal on heavy-duty vehicles, looking to continue to drive to some sort of net zero target over time. And I'm just wondering how you view that. I know you obviously had the curves here versus some of your peers on investing in CNG and RNG suites. But just given some of the stuff you've seen, not sure if you think that impacts your fleet strategy or maybe the need to accelerate some of the investments in electrification or other -- or some other type of propulsion system that gets you to some sort of GHG emission target based on the EPA's proposal here. John Morris : Yes, Kevin, I mean, listen, we've talked a lot about our CNG, RNG strategy and obviously really pleased with the way that's gone and with the outlook of that is, especially as we continue to bring on these R&D plans. But at the same time, we are continuing to look at other propulsion techniques, if you will. Electrification always comes to mind. People are talking about hydrogen. I think the good news is two things. One, we have our toe in all those ponds in terms of watching all the technology advancement and see how it's not only going to progress to commercialization, but commercialization through a heavy-duty fleet like ours, which are two distinctions. So, I think we're in a good spot there regardless of what the technologies. Our fleet strategy is evidenced by what we've done from diesel -- gen 1 diesel, gen 2 to CNG/RNG that we have the flexibility within our fleet plan to be able to pivot without really impacting the business. Jim Fish : I think, Kevin, one important point here about electrification is that it's not a surprise to anybody on this call. The infrastructure is simply not there yet to handle this. I mean, when California is telling people with electric vehicles to not charge their vehicles last summer, and I don't know what the percentage of electric vehicles is in California, it's probably 5%, if that. You can -- we all know that the infrastructure is not prepared to handle electric vehicles. So, we've chosen to make that -- it's an incrementally positive step to go to C&G. We'll be at 75% probably by the end of the year. And our goal is to ultimately get to 90%. If the technology -- the price point, by the way, is important to us. I'm not going to pay three times for an electric vehicle, what I pay for a CNG vehicle. If all of those things are worked out, look, we're all in for moving to EV. But we need to see some progress on -- particularly on the infrastructure. And right now, I don't know that we're seeing any progress on infrastructure. Kevin Chiang : Can I ask just a follow-up on that? Are your RNG or CNG trucks considered essentially net zero? Because effectively, you're in a unique position in that you also produce RNG as your landfill. But would a state like California look at your RNG fleet differently than, say, a typical owner operator running a Class A truck just because you're producing on the front end as well when you're creating a circular economy? Or is that still kind of an unknown now in terms of how they might treat that? John Morris : I think from a progression standpoint going from diesel to CNG, CNG-RNG, it's certainly going in the right direction. But I don't think that California, if it's a combustion engine. I'm not sure they would define it any other way, at least at this point in time. Jim Fish : It's a good point, though, because RNG is a renewable fuel. So, if you're using a renewable fuel to fuel a CNG truck, I don't think you have to be a mathematician to figure that out. It should be a net zero. But I don't think -- to John's point, I don't think they look at it that way today. . Kevin Chiang : Okay. Thanks for the color and best of luck to 2023 year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Sean Eastman : Hi team. I just wanted to confirm that all the guidance is intact, and in particular, including the collection and disposal yield, I think you guys have given us approaching 5.5% number. Just wanted to get that confirmation. Devina Rankin : So, yes, at this point, we're good with each element of the guidance. So, as Jim was saying earlier, specific to the commodity-based businesses, we have some caution around those. But when we look at the yield component, we actually see the revenue results including yield for Q1 being a little ahead of our plan. So, we're certainly confident in that aspect of the guidance that we provided. Sean Eastman : Okay, excellent. That's helpful. And then is there sort of a logical approach we can take to this combined recycling and renewable energy line that's now in the revenue build? I mean, I'm just kind of scratching my head a little bit on how to apply some science to the model there. Devina Rankin : Sure. What we intend to do there, at one point, we had moved our renewable energy business into the fuel line, and with some of the noise it was creating in the fuel line, we saw value in pulling that out. What we do is try and work ourselves towards providing better clarity about the key drivers of our business. And because renewable energy and recycling both have commodity-based impacts, we thought looking at those on a combined basis made some sense. And if you need additional color on that, Ed and Heather are sure to get you the details that you need. Sean Eastman : Okay, helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks. Devina Rankin : Thank you, Sean. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. Jim Fish : Good morning. Stephanie Moore : I wanted to touch on -- clearly, you have made pretty meaningful progress in SG&A reduction and just your focus on cost cutting. But maybe you could touch a little bit about if there's any change in your approach to acquisitions as you continue to kind of balance SG&A reduction as well as acquisitions. And has there been any change in terms of how you look at deals, the integration opportunity, level of automation or other savings that you can get and if that's kind of changed your M&A philosophy a bit as you take a bit more of a cost-focused approach here. Jim Fish : Yes, it's a good question because I wouldn't say that our approach has changed. We always are looking at what makes best sense for the shareholders. But I do think your point about being kind of an added synergy here is an important one. And we are factoring that in as we look at some of these companies. This is truly going to be a differentiator for us as we -- I talked about in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that we are taking cost out of our customer experience centers because we're using a self-service model now. And that was not insignificant. That is something that differentiates us from others who simply don't have that technology in place. So, it becomes a synergy for us as we acquire businesses. Stephanie Moore : No, that's helpful. And maybe taking that a step further. As you continue to look to do M&A as well as you move forward with cost-cutting investments. Is the opportunity for that maybe near-term dilutive impact from M&A in a given period of time to maybe diminish over time because of this? Or how are you thinking about that opportunity? Devina Rankin : So, I think what's important in giving color to the dilutive impact from the M&A that we saw in Q1, it really was twofold. One, in the solid waste business, we make investments in our facilities, the fleet, and our people right up front and that's the cost impact that you saw in the first quarter for the solid waste acquisitions. And then on the recycling part of the business, the Natura business is in early stages and we're making some investments there, too. And that cost about $6 million to the quarter just in terms of incremental spending that we did on the business. So, neither of those really were seeing the full benefit of leverage on the SG&A front -- I'm sorry, it wasn't that they weren't seeing the benefit of the leverage on the SG&A front, we were capturing and realizing that. It was more about investment in the operations and the long-term viability of each of those businesses. And we're making the progress that we expect to make so that they have incremental value creation for both the market in the solid waste business that we acquired, and then also thinking about the differentiated service model that we will now have in the recycling part of the business because this is a new line of business for us. Stephanie Moore : Understood. Very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist. Your line is open. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. With respect to driver retention and overall compensation in that area of your labor force, how do you expect that to trend, and particularly in the macroeconomic headwinds? And how much room for improvement could there be based on the historical ranges of those metrics in prior downturns? Thanks. John Morris : So, it's a good question. So, I think if you look kind of pre-pandemic through the pandemic, we went from obviously historic averages to historic lows, right, in terms of driver retention and turnover for obvious reasons. As we exited those numbers, went up past historic averages. And we've been working really earnestly the last two years not just on the wage front, but from an employee experience to get those numbers down. And I would tell you, we've made 400 to 500 basis points of improvement in a lot of those key frontline roles, and. You heard me in my prepared remarks talk about some of the peak wage inflation where it's moderated to now. So, that's clearly going in the right direction. But the biggest benefit really is when you can stabilize the workforce, those frontline folks. And we talked a lot about drivers, it's our biggest population. Your service gets better, your safety gets better and overtime ratios, training hours and all those things start to go the right way and we started to see signs of that in Q1. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. When you entertain conversations with smaller players in your M&A outreach, what are you hearing from them about the impact of higher rates and the kind of persistent required tech investments to stay competitive with the market? Jim Fish : I don't know that we're hearing a lot about tech because I'm just not -- I think they're more focused on how do they keep drivers on the road. We are hearing that, and some of the companies that we've acquired are showing double the turnover that we're showing. It's why we think there's an opportunity for us to take share -- continue to take share, first, because I think the customer service product that we are providing is superior. When you are able to hold a lot of your drivers, it makes a big difference in that customer lifetime value proposition. So, we are hearing that, that turnover has become a consistent and recurring problem for a lot of those companies. I think the other thing that I would like to mention too is as we think about drivers, why it's imperative that we bring technology to this labor pool. It's a shrinking labor pool. We've talked about it a lot. The Gen Z doesn't want to drive trucks the way a Baby Boomer or Gen X did. So, how do we take advantage of that and the way we take advantage of it is by bringing technology to squeeze 5%, 10% maybe even 15% optimization out. And that's exactly what we're doing in building an optimization tool that understands absolutely the best route to take. It understands things like location of carts. We finally now know where all of our assets are. It understands the expertise of drivers. I mean, there's a whole bunch of factors that go into a full optimization. And I guarantee there's not anybody else out there that's able to do that. It is not inexpensive to optimize that. But once we optimize it, then we become less reliant on labor. And it's a labor-intensive business, and we have 25% turnover in those driver ranks. How do I take advantage of that? And it's got to be through technology. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft with Gabelli. Your line is open. Tony Bancroft : Thanks for the question. Actually a quick one. Would you review -- just quickly review sort of the impact that -- the potential impact from PFAS may or may not have on how the cost of landfills and sort of how -- I know there's going to be some rulings or some hearings coming out here over the next few months about it. But how do you see that playing out? And how do you see that impacting your business? Jim Fish : Yes. So, we've said that we think PFAS is more of an opportunity than a risk for us. It is kind of ubiquitous in these landfills and in the material that comes into them. It has been, at this point, EPA has designated PFAS as a hazardous material. And so I think they're going to have to understand the fact that hazardous sites are -- there are far fewer of them than there are non-haz sites. So, I think EPA is still trying to kind of work their way through PFAS. But it is worth saying that we view this as a big opportunity for us and for all landfill companies once they've kind of finally decided exactly how this is going to be handled. Tony Bancroft : Thanks so much Jim. Congratulations. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Good morning. First question, I guess, is how to think about fuel rolling over in terms of impact to EBITDA and margins over the rest of the year. You have such a high percentage of the fleet on natural gas versus peers. So, maybe it doesn't impact the cost line as much, but perhaps a surcharge line. If you can just give us some guidepost on how to be modeling that or how to be thinking about that, that would be helpful. Devina Rankin : Yes, it's a great question, Noah. So, in terms of the impact, I think when you look at 2022, and the IRD table that we do I think is the best data point for that, fuel was a really significant contributor. And we've already seen in Q1, our fuel surcharge revenue in Q1 versus Q4 of last year was less than half on a year -- or on a sequential basis. And so what we are seeing is that, that revenue decline should actually benefit the margin side of the business. We didn't really see any meaningful margin impact in the first quarter, but we do expect that we will see some margin impact over the remainder of the year. We're also taking some important steps that we think are beneficial in terms of looking at the overall cost structure of the organization that is dependent upon the fact that we are at 75% CNG for fleet and delivery. But when we look at our consumption, we don't just look at the collection line of business. We look at the heavy equipment at our landfills and all of that. So, we're looking at making sure that we're not just doing a diesel-based fuel surcharge, we're doing a blended surcharge. And some of those changes, our customers are going to begin to see in the second quarter. So, we're confident that we're going to maintain that true pass-through model that we've had over the last many, many years. It just will look a little bit different in future quarters, both because of the lapping of the really significant increases in diesel that we saw a year ago, but also because we're taking some structural changes with how we bill that to our customers. Noah Kaye : That's really interesting. And I mean, there's benefits here potentially to the customers as well because historically, I mean, I forget the last few years. But historically, CNG fuel prices have been more stable relatively. So, would that change just be received positively by customers as maybe a way to help reduce volatility to them on the cost side? Devina Rankin : We absolutely see that as something that our customers will receive well. And our customers already like the fact that, that CNG truck that's rolling down the street is quieter than the diesel vehicle. We see this as something else that the customers will receive as a positive from WM investing economically and environmentally beneficially in a differentiated fleet to service. Noah Kaye : Great. And then just on recycling, just trying to get some better gauges or indicators of demand. Maybe you can talk to your sense of the mills inventory position on recycled fiber. Maybe characterize the flow of impounds and inbound. I'm guessing kind of late 3Q, you probably didn't hear a lot of phones ringing in terms of requests for product. How is it trending now? John Morris : Yes, I think we benefited from -- we've talked a lot about our brokerage business being part of the recycling portfolio, and what that's always -- what that's added to us as a benefit is our ability to move the material. So, we don't have any issue moving the material we're bringing in. And even where we're growing volumes, we're still able to move that material. I think the interesting thing, Jim, I think, touched on this, is that there is some domestic capacity that's opening up here this year. And we've seen a little bit of positive movement here just late in the last handful of weeks on some of the fiber pricing. And Jim mentioned that overall, the whole basket of goods has moved up here a little bit as we exited Q4 into Q1 and then even exiting Q1 into Q2. Jim Fish : No, it also helps that China's open back up. And while we don't send a lot of stuff straight to China anymore, they do affect worldwide demand. And when China has closed down with their COVID policy, that hurt worldwide demand. Now, that they've chosen to reopen their economy, that is helping and that will help us out as well. Noah Kaye : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I will now like to turn the call back to Jim Fish, President and CEO for closing remarks. Jim Fish : All right. Thank you, Tawanda. I guess just to conclude here you've heard that we're on track for another solid year. We were right on plan for the first quarter. Looking forward to seeing a lot of you next week in New Orleans. Should be enjoyable. So, thanks for joining us this morning, and we'll see you next week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed and thank you all for joining us. Our team continues to advance our 2023 priorities, including increasing the profitability of our business through strong price discipline, and an optimized cost structure. As I said in February 2023, will be year of pricing and cost control. It's a year of continuing to set ourselves up for the long-term by delivering on what we can control. In the second quarter, our adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points, driven by pricing and the collection and disposal business and diligent SG&A cost control. We deliver this result, despite some things that we can't control, stubborn cost inflation, slower event-driven volumes, and lower than expected renewable energy prices.  Notably, clean-up volumes from Hurricane Ian came in significantly lower than anticipated which had a $9 million operating EBITDA impact in the quarter. We're pleased with our pricing results for the first half of the year as our team is executing well to ensure that our pricing is keeping pace with the pressure from rising costs.  Overall, our volumes are also tracking at or above our expectations. Though the mix of volumes across our businesses is different than we planned.  Event-driven landfill and industrial volumes in the quarter were lower than we anticipated, which we see as a short term moderation in this business. Some customers seem to be taking a more cautious wait and see approach regarding the timing of large jobs, given the economic backdrop. With many anticipated projects moving into 2024. Our pipeline remains strong. So we view this as a temporary shift in project timing.  The impact to our special waste and construction and demolition volumes has been mitigated by strong growth in our strategic accounts business where we continue to differentiate our service offerings. We're overcoming margin pressure from this temporary change in volume mix with continued momentum in pricing, optimization costs and efficiency improvements. And you'll hear more from John and Devina about the success we're having in managing our operating costs and SG&A where we had opportunities ahead. Turning to recycling. We're now expecting a slower-than-planned recovery in recycled commodity prices in the second half outlook. The investments we're making in automating our recycling facilities position us well in any commodity market environment as they drive lower labor cost, processing costs, improved efficiency and enhanced material quality.  In the second quarter, our fully automated recycling facilities delivered differentiated results relative to the rest of the network with 33% lower labor cost per ton and 18% lower total operating cost per ton. During the quarter, we're pleased to have opened a new recycle facility in the Greater Toronto area, and also completed technology and automation upgrades at an existing facility in Arizona. Recycling is a service with strong customer demand and our intentional shift to a fee-for-service business model as well as our high-return technology investments make it a profitable business for WM in any economic environment, with margins now well above our prior commodity cycle lows. On the renewable energy front, we opened our Eco Vista renewable natural gas facility in Arkansas during the quarter, the sixth WM-owned RNG facility and the second of our 20 planned projects in our sustainability growth program. Last month, the EPA announced its three-year renewable fuel standard rule, which provides strong demand and visibility to the market for renewable fuel standard credits, or RINs. This robust demand provides support for our blended average pricing assumption of $26 per MMBtu used to develop our investment strategy and strengthens the case for potential upside. Shifting to our full year outlook. We're updating our 2023 guidance ranges to consider first half results and a slower recovery in commodity prices in the second half of the year. We now expect an adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5.7% to the midpoint of our guidance range, which is still well within the 5% to 7% long-term growth range that we provided in May of 2019. Devina will walk through the key pieces of the outlook in further detail. The WM team continues to step up to the challenges of each day, while at the same time, progressing investments in our business that positions us to further differentiate our industry-leading asset network and capabilities and reduce our cost structure. I want to thank each of our team members for their hard work and dedication.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Pricing remained a bright spot in the second quarter as we continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. Our second quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 6%. This growth was led by core price of 6.9% with collection and disposal yield of 5.8%. We have and continue to emphasize the importance of post-collection pricing, and in Q2, we delivered a yield of 7.5% at our transfer stations and 6% for landfill MSW, both improvements in the growth rates from last year. Our team's collective focus continues to be on maximizing customer lifetime value. That focus led to second quarter churn improving to 8.3%. This lower churn has allowed us to convert more core price into yield, driving our full year outlook for collection and disposal yield to increase to more than 5.5%. Looking at volumes. Second quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 0.2%. As expected, volume growth was weighted to the landfill line of business with modest declines in the collection business. MSW volumes stood out with an increase of almost 4%. As Jim mentioned, some of our event-driven landfill volumes, particularly special waste tons have been tracking below our expectations and below the very strong levels we saw in 2022. Our collection volumes were down modestly in the quarter due to the intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns as well as the impact of lower volumes from temporary roll-off. Net new business and net service increases were firmly positive and improved from first quarter 2023 levels, underscoring that commercial conditions remain solid. Though collection volumes are down, both revenue and operating EBITDA grew in each line of business, demonstrating that we are prioritizing profitable volume growth. For full year, we continue to expect collection and disposal volumes to be flat at the midpoint of our guidance. Turning to operating expenses. We realized benefits from our optimization efforts in the second quarter, leading to 20 basis points of improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to 62.2%. The improvements that we made in Q2 are being partially offset by higher cost due to inflation. While we experienced some impact of lingering inflation into Q2, signs of easing continued as the quarter progressed. The areas experienced the most pressure are labor costs and repair and maintenance costs. There's cause for optimism in both of these categories. Labor costs have continued to moderate during the second quarter, settling in the mid-single-digit range from the double-digit levels that we have seen over the last year.  This improvement can be attributed to better employee retention as evidenced by over 50% fewer driver openings and driver turnover improving 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. We have robust strategies in place to optimize labor efficiency, particularly in our collection line of business, which we expect to further diminish these cost pressures as the year progresses. We are seeing the benefits of these efforts as we progress through the second quarter, with June marking the lowest cost to serve month of the quarter. This is a promising sign as we move through the remainder of the year. As noted, another significant factor impacting our operating cost has been repair and maintenance expenses. The effects of not receiving a full allotment of trucks over the last few years are still being felt. However, the good news is we are now receiving more trucks and it's leading to improved costs. Since the beginning of the year, our maintenance cost per unit have either improved or remained stable across all collection lines of business. Similar to our approach to labor costs, we have comprehensive plans in place to drive continued improvement in our repair and maintenance performance as we progress through the rest of 2023. Our efforts in these two key areas as well as broader operating expense categories give us confidence that we can continue to improve overall operating costs as a percentage of revenue as we progress through 2023. I want to thank the entire WM team for continuing to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. I know they're all working hard to deliver strong results through the remainder of this year and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results and guidance and further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning. The first half of 2023 and our revised outlook for the full year is best framed as the story with two primary themes. One of executing well on our top priorities to profitably grow our business, and the other of pressure from market factors beyond our control that we are working to ensure we navigate from a position of strength. Our team's diligent efforts delivered two particularly strong outcomes in the second quarter. First, revenue growth from price and our focus on cost optimization translated into an increase in collection and disposal operating EBITDA of $95 million or 6.2% in the quarter. And second, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue improved by 30 basis points to 9.1%, and this is the best result in our company's history.  Our commitment to managing discretionary spending and investing in automation to reduce our cost of service is paying off. We're seeing strong outcomes from our investment in a customer experience model that leverages technology to communicate with customers in their channel of choice. Customer feedback has been strong, giving us confidence that with these investments we've permanently reduced our SG&A cost structure, and we will continue to drive improved customer satisfaction that will only bolster customer lifetime value from here. Organic growth in the collection and disposal business and our focus on SG&A optimization delivered 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. Operating EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points overall. So you can see that these two things delivered almost all of these strong results. This is what gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow margin in the back half of the year and into 2024. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was about $2.1 billion. As expected, higher cash interest, taxes and incentive compensation payments more than offset the benefit of operating EBITDA growth in the first half of the year. We expect to see those impacts lessen in the second half of 2023. Capital spending in the first six months of the year totaled almost $1.2 billion, with $963 million related to normal course capital to support our business and $217 [ ph 0 :14:26] million of spending on sustainability growth projects. As Jim mentioned, we're pleased with the continued progress on our sustainability growth program with three new projects coming online so far this year. However, customary construction and permitting delays for certain recycling and renewable energy projects will push about $200 million of our planned 2023 sustainability growth capital into future years. Free cash flow through the first half of the year was $940 million, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was $1.157 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $572 million to shareholders through dividends, and we've repurchased $620 million of our stock. Dividends will total a little more than $1.1 billion this year and we expect to repurchase about $1.25 billion of our shares over the course of the year. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times, which is well within our targeted ratio of between 2.5 and 3 times. About 21% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, and our pretax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 3.8%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well positioned to fund growth. Turning to our updated 2023 guidance. We now expect revenue growth of between 3.25% and 4.25%. The revision from our initial expectations is entirely related to commodity prices in our recycling and renewable energy businesses and the pace of contributions relative to plan for our recycling acquisitions. The key takeaway here is that core price, yield and volume outlook in our collection and disposal business are intact and even performing slightly ahead of our initial expectations.  We now expect adjusted operating EBITDA to be in the range of $5.775 billion to $5.875 billion, which is a $75 million decrease at the midpoint. About $50 million of the revised outlook relates to our performance in the first half of the year relative to our plan and $20 million relates to a slower recovery in recycled commodity prices in the back half of the year relative to our expectations. The operating EBITDA shortfall in the first half of the year primarily relates to three things : inflationary cost pressure that has taken longer to abate in 2023 than we expected; a softening in event-driven volumes at our landfills, and lower-than-expected commodity prices in our renewable energy business. These are market-driven pressures, giving us confidence that our collective performance on the company's top priorities over the first half of the year delivered the intended outcomes. With the strength of our collection and disposal operations and the success from our SG&A optimization efforts, in 2023, we will again deliver on our target of growing operating EBITDA by 5% to 7% annually. In addition, we expect to expand our operating EBITDA margin 40 to 60 basis points for the year. Both measures demonstrate the resilience of solid waste and the benefits of pricing discipline, focused differentiation and cost optimization to drive long-term growth. In closing, the WM team is delivering well to safely and reliably serve our customers and to optimize our costs. We will deliver another year of strong financial growth in 2023 and position ourselves for continued success on the road ahead. I can't thank our hard-working team members and us for all of their contributions to our success.  With that, Michelle, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open, please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning. Devina, so lots moving around in the margins, but can you just talk a little bit about that margin walk in more detail, kind of how we bridge that 60 basis points year-over-year. Maybe talk about fuels, commodity, the CNG tax credit to M&A. I know there's quite a bit in there. Devina Rankin : Yes, you're right, Tyler, there are a lot of moving pieces. Similar to what we talked about in the first quarter, when you combine recycling and renewable energy prices that had a negative impact to margin of about 30 to 40 basis points, again, the dilutive impact of M&A, this is half recycling and half solid waste was about 40 basis points. And then what we had is an offset from fuel that you didn't see in the first quarter. So we're really pleased that when you look at those two things which are more timing and commodity related and focus on the real substance of the margin expansion that we produced in the quarter, that is two things, and its solid waste and it is SG&A cost optimization. Tyler Brown : Right. So maybe fuel kind of offset the commodities and M&A. Is that kind of what you're saying? Devina Rankin : Exactly. Tyler Brown : Okay. Perfect. And then I think last quarter, you guys did talk about 4% to 5% unit cost inflation for fiscal '23. I'm just curious if that number still feels about right or if it is coming in a touch higher? And then how should we think about Q3 margins? Will they be up something like 50 to 70 basis points sequentially and then maybe tick down in Q4, just to help us with the modeling? John Morris : So Tyler, I'll start, and then I'll leave the second part to maybe to Devina. But I would tell you that when I look at probably the best barometer for that inflation question is probably labor. I think the good news, as you heard in my prepared remarks, it continues to moderate. We came down, I think we were right around 6% for the quarter, which is obviously a tad higher than what we had projected in the number that you referenced.  But I think the good news is, is that we continue to see that moderate and it continue to moderate through the quarter as we looked at each of the progressive months as we're anniversarying some of the peak labor increases. The second part would be on the M&R side. And as you heard also in my prepared remarks, the good news is that we're on track to receive about 90% of our trucks this year as opposed to less than half the last few years. So that's another place where we've seen a little bit of persistence in inflation. But as evidenced by my commentary and Devina's, we feel good about the balance of the year and our ability to continue to drive OpEx down. Devina Rankin : And on the second part of your question, Tyler, when we look at 28.7% in Q2, we're really confident in our ability to deliver 29% in the back half of the year in EBITDA margin. And the incremental benefit we expect to come from the traditional solid waste side that John just discussed. But what we're really looking at here is long term being able to target 29% that is based on 62% operating expenses as percentage of revenue and 9% SG&A as a percentage of revenue. And we think that that's just when we look at -- when I say long term, that's what we think we can start to produce in 2024 and there's upside potential from there. Tyler Brown : Excellent. Very good. And then my last one, real quick. So Jim, it sounds like the $740 million of incremental EBITDA from energy recycling is intact. You did mention that the timing may fluctuate, and we did have the $200 million CapEx deferral. So at this point, how much incremental EBITDA are you expecting in '24 from those? If I look back at the Investor Day, it was something like $225 million incremental. Is that still the case? Or has that been pushed out a little bit? Thank you. Jim Fish : Yes. Thanks, Tyler. Look, as far as the end number for both RNG and recycling, which was $740 million, that -- we're still comfortable with that. The interim year were really designed to kind of give some insight into the buildup of that. We knew things would change, whether it was timing of CapEx, supply chain-related, third-party delays, permitting, things like that. So what we'll do is update that number, the 2024 number when we give guidance to incorporate some of those shifts that have taken place over the last few months. Tyler Brown : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. You mentioned that collection and disposal will exceed 5.5% this year. We did see a little bit of a decel in 2Q. Can you just talk about what should cause that to sort of accelerate from this level? John Morris : Good morning, Toni. I would tell you, I think the one thing I would point to is when you look at the conversion rate between core price and yield, that's where we really have seen an improvement as we looked at the first two quarters of the year. And now we're converting close to 85% of what we're putting through in core price into yield, and that's given us confidence that as we go through the back half of the year, we're going to see something better than the 5.5% we originally guided to. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the SG&A optimization. Thanks for calling that out. Just any additional color on what's going on there and how much maybe you have left to do with regard to that? Devina Rankin : Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen really strong traction, particularly in our customer experience part of our back office. And that really underpins the success of our automation and optimization efforts across the business. That's been the most significant driver of the change in SG&A optimization overall. We expect similar things to happen in other parts of our business as well. And so while we're looking at a 9% SG&A number, Jim and I talk about the fact that either of us, if we had said that we could achieve that when we both started the CFO position, we would have told you that was a really hard thing to achieve. So we're pleased to be at this level. How much more room there is in it, it's still to be determined. But what I think you see here is WM's commitment to continuous improvement, and we're seeing success really motivate our teams to figure out how to leverage the success in other parts of our business. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And one moment. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Your line is open, please go ahead. Bryan Burgmeier : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Tony's question, so there's a comment in the press release and prepared remarks about exceeding yield growth of 5.5%. So what level of yield growth do you assume at the midpoint of your revenue guidance now? Is it 5.5%? Or is that above 5.5%, any detail you can have on kind of what's baked into the guidance would be great. Devina Rankin : Sure. It's specifically 5.6% as we're looking at the midpoint, and that's about a 20 basis point increase from where we started the year. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Got it. Thank you. And I appreciate the updated view on the recycled commodity basket. Can you maybe just provide some detail on what the average was during 2Q or maybe where you are in June, July? Just trying to think about how much improvement we need to see in the second half? Thanks. Jim Fish : Yes, Brian, I'm going to let Tara Hemmer, she's sitting here with us. I'll let her take that for you. Tara Hemmer : Excellent. So our commodity price for recycling for Q2 was $60. And I think what you have going on in the second half of the year is really a tale of two different commodity types. If you think about our fiber pricing, we're expecting a slow ramp in fiber pricing, and that's really being driven by some mill capacity coming online domestically.  The bigger story really is on the non-fiber pricing and related to plastics, which is a smaller part of our volume, but higher-value commodity. And we've seen prices decline roughly 30% to 55% from May to July. So that's what's driving our recycled commodity price outlook for the second half of the year. And so we're expecting the second half of the year to now be about $60 a ton. So really the same as Q2. Bryan Burgmeier : Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. I'll now turn it over. Operator : Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open, please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Good morning, Jim, Devina, John and Tara. I was in steaming Houston yesterday. I don\u2019t know how you all live there in the summer. So Devina, what was the value of the assumption for a sequential improvement in all things commodity. So not just recycling, recycling RINs, nat gas, electricity in the original $5.9 billion? Devina Rankin : Yes. So we look at that as a $40 million -- what I would say is we were expecting about an $85 million headwind from commodity price impacts in the recycling and renewable energy businesses. That's now expected to be more like $125 million at the midpoint. So about a $40 million headwind relative to initial expectations, with half of that in the front half of the year, and that's related to the renewable energy businesses.  And really specifically in electricity and nat gas prices specifically. And then on the back half of the year, as Tara just articulated, pressure from recycling commodity prices, particularly plastic being lower than our expectations, which is causing a $20 million decline in the back half of '23. Michael Hoffman : Okay. I didn't ask that question very well. You all in your prepared comments, I think, are inferring this, I'm trying to piece it out in numbers. If you got a Mulligan and we went back to February, and you were giving guidance and you didn't have any of the sequential improvement, what would have the midpoint have been? I think it's like $5.7 billion, which means you were raising guidance in 2Q because of the strength of garbage. Jim Fish : No, I think you're right on there, Michael. I mean, I think if we had a crystal ball and said, \"Hey, commodity prices are not going to improve the way we thought they would in the back half of the year.\" If we know that natural gas pricing was going to come down significantly, which we didn't expect that our electricity would come down or even rent pricing would come down in the front half. Obviously, it's improved in June.  But I think if we had known all those things, clearly, we would have given lower guidance than we gave. But still, as I said in my prepared remarks, and we're still coming in at 5.7%, which is in that range of 5% to 7% EBITDA growth. And by the way, when we gave that back in 2019 that assumes average commodity prices. We are 45%, 40% under average commodity prices. So I walk away from this quarter -- well, initially -- and I'm not going to sit here and tell you I wasn't disappointed when I first looked at the numbers. But then I start looking at what we're controlling and thinking, gosh, normally, when you crush it on SG&A and pricing and margins. Normally, that's a beat and raise. Why are we having the lower and it's all what we've just been talking about. It's all these commodity-based things that are sometimes hard to predict. And we used history to predict, for example, commodity price rebound. It's going to come back. It's just going to be 2024 now.  So I think you're absolutely right. The guidance would have been lower, still would have been within the 5% to 7% range. But I walk away feeling pretty good about things. I might sound crazy today, but I walk away feeling good that we're -- that those things that we're controlling, we're doing a darn good job of it. Michael Hoffman : Right. So I'm repeating the obvious, but core recurring collection and disposal is performing as planned or better. That's the conclusion. Jim Fish : Yes, that's right. I mean actually, I would say, you could argue a little better, right? Devina just talked about SG&A being 9%. I'd tell you, when I was CFO, I mean, I'm sitting there wondering how we get to 12. Michael Hoffman : So she's got bragging rights. Jim Fish : Yes, she is way better at this than I was. Michael Hoffman : On special waste, John, are you below a normal baseline as well. So this is not only -- you didn't get hurricanes, but the normal sort of recurring stuff that happens over and over again, even though it's not terribly predictable, there's a certain baseline. Are you below the baseline too, because of deferrals? John Morris : So two things, Michael. First, the answer is I don't think no, we're not. I would tell you that on the hurricane piece, I mean, when we look back, that was a little bit of a headwind in the first half of the year, a little bit more in Q2. But again, when we were predicting what we're going to do back last year with respect to Ian, we've cleaned up a lot of it. It just moderated a little bit more in the first half and a little bit more in the second half. So that's answer number one.  I think on the special waste side, I've done a little bit of a lot of homework on this and talk to the team here. I would tell you, no, I don't think we're below the baseline. I think what we saw is historic highs in the first two quarters of last year in special waste, and I'm going back until 2017, I think, is as long -- those are two of the strongest quarters we've had. In fact, Q2, I think, was our strongest quarter in recent history for special waste, so no. And really, it was a handful of events, a little bit in the Rust Belt, we saw a little bit of moderation on some really big projects. But when you look outside of that, I'm pretty confident about what's going on in special waste. Jim Fish : Well, I think, Michael, it probably makes sense that I mentioned that these -- a lot of these companies went into somewhat of a holding pattern here until they get better visibility on the economy. And when you think about what was going on was potential for a real banking crisis here. So today, they put a little bit of a lock on the checkbook with some of these projects, which they have timing discretion on. They will do those projects.  The pipeline is still strong. We've been talking about that for several quarters. Still strong pipeline, still really good customers that are all still there, but they just put a lockdown on some of these projects. And so down -- look, down 1.9 million year-over-year tons in special waste and RGC for the first half and down very significantly versus our budget, that mattered.  But again, the good news is all these things that were kind of out of our control. They will reappear. It's not as if they're not going to do those projects. They will do them. It's not as if commodity prices won't come back. They will. So that's why I'm walking out of here feeling better about this than you might think. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then Tara, how does the delay -- and you may have answered this, but so much information was given I missed it. How was the delay in spending impact capturing the ITC since such time sensitive? Tara Hemmer : It doesn't impact it at all. We're confident that we've done the work that we need to do to ensure that we get the benefit of the ITC. Michael Hoffman : And then what is the probability that you can work it up from 30% to 50% based on content and all that stuff? Tara Hemmer : So we're actively looking at which locations can get the energy community benefit, which would take it up to 50% and then also looking at domestic content, which would apply to 17 of the 20. We don't have definitive confirmation there, working closely with Devina's tax team on that, but hope to have some more information perhaps later this year, early next. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So that's another upside pleasant thing. Instead of spending $1.2 billion, you're going to spend anywhere from $700 million to -- $500 million to $700 million. Tara Hemmer : What I can tell you is our teams have been working really hard to figure out how we can maximize the benefit across the portfolio. So anywhere where we think we can get the 40% of the 50%, they're doing the work to get there. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Cool. And then, Devina, if you said it, I missed it, what was the impact of less pass-through fees on margins? Devina Rankin : So on the fuel surcharge, the impact was about 60 basis points. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then what are the chances we might get segment reporting with more details just this is a learned experience from what happened this quarter? Devina Rankin : Yes, absolutely. So what I think is important is you hear the close coordination that's happening between Tara's team and my team on every aspect of growing this portfolio. And I would say the systems, processes, financial reporting associated with the business is something that we're bolstering at the same time that we're building out the asset network. And so we have expectations that we'll be able to build SEC quality level of financial information in the near term, and that's our goal, and we'll keep working towards it over the course of the rest of this year. Michael Hoffman : Terrific. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open, please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks so much. I'll pick it up there on the sustainability investments. And to be clear, permitting delays are absolutely nothing new in the RNG industry, and I think we understand why. But I'd be curious for your color on the development environment, to what extent any incremental challenges are presenting either from a permitting or construction perspective? How sort of temporary do you view this in this growing industry? Tara Hemmer : Well, I think it's important to set some context here. We have a large number of projects in flight at the same time, and we're really portfolio base view. If you think about it, some of them are going to delay. Some of them were working to accelerate. If you think about what's happening in 2024, we'll have well over 10 projects under construction. And so we're working with utilities to figure out how we can advance our interconnects we're working with local permitting agencies to ensure that we get building permits. So a lot of this is, like you said, really normal course. Things that happen on large construction programs and projects, and we're going to continue to evaluate. And that's why later this year, really when we announced Q4, we'll give a bit more color on what the impact will be. Noah Kaye : Okay. And just a follow-up around the RIN assumptions for the full year. Obviously, for the first half of the year south of the original guide, kind of low 2s, RINs being north of $3 now. Is there some sort of impact to the blended average for the year from hedging? If so, can we kind of tease that out? Or could there still possibly be a little bit of upside from where RINs are penciling out today? Tara Hemmer : That's exactly the right way to look at it. So it really is a tale of two halves. And if you think about the second half of the year, with RIN prices now at around $3. You have to remember that we've been selling ratably over the course of the year. So we had some of our volume locked in for the second half of the year. But on a blended average basis, we expect the second half of the year to be more like 270. Noah Kaye : Okay. Super helpful. And then I guess a question for perhaps Jim and John. If you look at the disparity in volumes between MSW and the collection lines, I mean, what is the story that tells? Obviously, you went to some of the detail earlier on special waste around to tough comps in some of the pocketbook deferrals. But just looking at that disparity, help us make sense of it. Jim Fish : Well, it's a little bit hard to tell what is causing the disparity. I mean I think there's a number of different factors. You might look at even kind of the commercial real estate market in downtowns, we -- those have declined a bit because the work-from-home movement has taken hold and kind of held there since COVID.  If you look at MSW, MSW volumes were quite good, but what may be more encouraging is that MSW price was very good. I mean forever we talked about the fact that we weren't able to get price on MSW, and MSW price is sequentially up, it's up significantly year-over-year. So while we're getting MSW volume, we're also getting MSW price, and that is very encouraging for us. I'm not overly concerned with roll-off volume being down. Some of it is related to the special waste projects. Commercial volume is kind of what we expected, kind of flattish, maybe a little bit down. And then RESI is a bit by design. I mean we've lost a few contracts, but that was because we weren't willing to go where they wanted us to go in order to retain them.  So I think we're -- from a volume standpoint, we're basically where we expected. It's just that there was a bit of a shift, especially as you thought more about our national accounts business. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, but that business is doing very well. We're truly differentiating ourselves there and hence, the pickup in national accounts, but it does come at a different margin than, for example, the special waste business that we've talked about. John Morris : The only thing I would add on the front main residential well. And if you look at residential, and you saw it in the back, if you look at the 4% volume versus the revenue improvement, we've seen a similar trend there last couple of quarters, we try and rightsize that business and continue to get those margins up. On the commercial side, I did go back and looked at what printed in terms of the volume. And then you net out some of the franchise impact in addition to one national account loss we talked about that we're actually anniversarying ironically. And at the same time, putting about 15,000 containers back on the street to take that business back, we actually end up about 0.2% positive for the quarter. So there's some noise in there, and that's for the level of granularity, but I think that's why you hear from Jim and I some confidence in our answer to you. Noah Kaye : We appreciate that granularity. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead. Sean Eastman : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to come back to the confidence in that core 5% to 7% EBITDA growth going into next year. I wondered that just in light of the great pricing story, good signs on inflation from an OpEx trend perspective, more opportunity on the SG&A cost optimization. Is that a conservative range going into next year in light of how the model is setting up over the next 12, 24 months in your view? Jim Fish : I guess based on this quarter, I wouldn't say it was conservative. I don't know. Look, I think... Sean Eastman : Well, you said this quarter was the commodities, right? So I'm thinking about. Jim Fish : I know. I'm kind of half kidding here. But look, I think the 5% to 7% that we gave in '19 is a good range. But those components that you talked about, we're feeling very confident in those. I mean, SG&A we've talked about pricing has been a very good story for us and continues to be a good story for us. OpEx, John talked a lot about OpEx today. And while we had maybe a little more stubborn inflation in the front half, we're starting to see some moderation, as you said. We're starting to see things like training hours come down. We're starting to see over time come down a bit. So we're getting efficiency improvements, cost per unit on maintenance, truck deliveries.  All of those things caused us to be fairly optimistic, and Devina mentioned 29% margins as a decent jumping off point. And look, I would say, yes, that -- we've talked about 30% being a number that we felt was achievable for probably the last couple of years. Now we're finally getting to a point where we say, okay, we really do believe that. I mean, we're looking at 60 basis points of improvement in margins in the face of some really strong headwinds that were a bit out of our control. So we'll give you a lot more detail on that as we give guidance. But I would tell you that barring a big downturn in the economy that 5% to 7% still looks like a very good range for us. Sean Eastman : Okay. Thanks for that Jim. And it sounds like maybe stay tuned on this, but in terms of the $200 million of sustainability growth CapEx that has slid, I mean, for now, is it a good assumption to layer that into the prior expectation for 2024, just kind of layer that $200 million on top? Or is that not the right way to think about it? Any sort of preliminary thoughts on that would be helpful. Devina Rankin : Yes, Sean, I think you're thinking about it the right way. So layering that on top of what we plan for '24 is the best view that we have right now. We'll give more clarity on that when we give '24 guidance. But based on our expectations right now, I think what's important for you all to hear is that the teams are working really hard to accelerate projects where we can because the returns on these are so strong and a three-year payback period means that we want to get these facilities up and running as quickly as possible. So while there are some places where we're seeing delays in deferrals like you said, there are others where we're working to see what we can accelerate. So right now, our best outlook is to layer the $200 million on to the prior outlook for '24. Sean Eastman : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead. Jerry Revich : Good morning, everyone. Jim, Tara, can I ask you your views on the EPA's outlook for landfill gas, really interesting decoupling from other credit classes, so landfill gas really has to ramp up to hit their targets. Based on what you're seeing, do you think the transportation fleet that consumes natural gas was on pace to grow fast enough to absorb those credits? And given the visibility the requirements lay out for your business, how does that impact the potential shadow pipeline beyond the 20 initial projects that we discussed with Analyst Day? Jim Fish : I'll give a little bit, and then I think I'll let Tara answer the rest of it. I do believe that there is plenty of demand out there. So from that standpoint, I mean, there's been a little bit of discussion I've heard that, well, are you going to kind of run up against a ceiling here in terms of demand. And I think the answer is there's plenty of demand here as we think about the natural gas fleets, for example. I mean our natural gas fleet is about 70% of routed vehicles. So I think, Tara, I'll let you kind of give a bit more detail. But I feel optimistic about the demand side of this. Tara Hemmer : Yes. And just to add a little bit of color on to that. If you think about what the EPA did by setting a multiyear renewable volume obligation, it did two key things. One is they raise the volume, so that provided a strong demand signal. And two, they provided multiyear certainty. And that's something that obligated parties like refiners were looking for, and so are the producers like WM. So we really feel like there's a strong demand signal from that, and it has a halo effect into the voluntary market. We're seeing a lot more interest in the voluntary market, and we're actively working with our teams to figure what's the right way to transact going forward. Jerry Revich : And to that point, given the visibility on a multiyear basis, how are you focusing about the pipeline beyond the initial 20 projects as a result? And are we looking at potentially accelerating the next batch of projects beyond these lines? Tara Hemmer : We absolutely have a pipeline of projects that goes beyond the 20. We haven't yet determined how we're going to approach that pipeline. So we'll provide some more information down the road. But a lot of opportunity when you think about our landfill gas. It's a phenomenal resource and something that we think we can monetize long term. Jerry Revich : Super. And can we just shift gears, Devina, I just wanted to ask just to make sure I'm on the same page with you. If I'm looking at the second quarter results from a top line standpoint and apply normal seasonality in the 270 D3 RIN and current OCC prices to the back half of the year, I would get towards the high end of your revenue range. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing any headwinds or any differences versus normal seasonality that could drive you towards even the midpoint let alone the low end of the range. Are there any moving pieces that we need to keep in mind? Devina Rankin : No, I think that you're looking at it the right way to really give some clarity on our revenue guide relative to where we started. The commodity businesses, we expect to be down $125 million in revenue over the course of the year with a lot of that already in the first half and then about $100 million decline in revenue from the recycling acquisitions relative to expectations. So our expectations for the back half are normal with regard to seasonality impacts. The only thing that you could see is we did start to see hurricane Ian impacting Q4 of 2022 and those will not repeat. Jerry Revich : Okay. And then can I ask a similar question from margins. Normally, your margins are up 0.5 point 3Q versus 2Q. This year, we're going to have the higher D3 prices and OCC prices as well that could maybe 0.5 point to that? Is that how you're thinking about 3Q versus 2Q or anything else we need to keep in mind in terms of the margin cadence? Devina Rankin : Sure. So in terms of the margin cadence, what we were looking at going from Q2 to Q3 in '23 is a typical margin expansion, but the offset will be the timing difference on the alternative fuel tax credit from a year ago. As a reminder, that wasn't concluded from a regulatory perspective until Q3. So we took all of that benefit in Q3 of last year. So that's the one thing that will dilute the margin upswing that we traditionally will see. Jerry Revich : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open, please go ahead. Hans Hoffman : This is Han Hoffman on for Stephanie Moore. I was just wondering if you could comment a bit on pricing just in terms of where you're kind of exceeding relative to kind of your internal expectations. And then just anything you're seeing from a churn standpoint? Jim Fish : Yes. I think you could -- we would argue that we're probably exceeding almost across the board, which is why we're -- our expectation is slightly higher than our original guidance, both on yield and on core price. But to be a bit more specific about it, and I think I mentioned it earlier, the two places where maybe we're seeing -- we're most pleased would be on the MSW waste stream, which I mentioned it was up sequentially and year-over-year and to a pretty handsome number and then also on residential. Both of those, by the way, in years past, were a bit of a struggle to see good core price or yield. And now we feel good about the fact that not only are they at the absolute, really good numbers, but the trend has been quite good. Hans Hoffman : Got it. That's helpful. And then could you just maybe comment on the M&A environment just in terms of how valuations look like? And any change in activity level there? Jim Fish : Sure. I think the valuations have crept up a bit. I mean as you look at a couple of things. One is a lot of these smaller businesses are seeing an uptick in their businesses coming out of COVID. There's also an expectation from some of these businesses that now is the time to sell, whether it's because they don't have succession plans behind them or because of some of the labor pressures that they're anticipating, there's been certainly an uptick in M&A activity.  And I think for us, it's a double-edged sword. We want to make sure we do have a nice pipeline of M&A opportunities. But we don't want to fall into the trap of paying way up for these. And so we'll be patient when it comes to those. I would rather -- as if these are -- the opportunities are going to go away. So all -- I'll sit back and wait as opposed to paying a multiple of 15 times, I'll wait for that to come down to a more reasonable number unless somebody is willing to sell it to me today at a more reasonable number. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist. Your line is open, please go ahead. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. I was hoping you could discuss your labor turnover and compensation growth in the second half versus the first half? And then maybe from a longer-term perspective, how does that sort of comp and expense growth interplay with your 5% to 7% EBITDA growth target over the next several years? Do you model it being a little diminishing over that period? John Morris : So Tobey, I think a couple of things I'll note for you. One, I referenced that labor rates trended at about just over 6% for the quarter. And if you go back a year ago, that was probably 9%, 10% depending on what part of the country you're looking at. So it moderated. We had expected it maybe to moderate a tad more. But I think what you heard from all three of us is that we have good momentum on the OpEx side and in particular on labor.  What's driving that is there a couple of things we've all commented on, which are driver turnover is down 250 basis points. And why is that significant? It takes a lot of the cost friction out from the labor line. And we're seeing it not only in our quality of service and our safety results, but on a labor cost per unit, we're continuing to see that trend down. And then when you think about kind of where we are first half to second half and when Devina added some color on about what kind of the exit margins look like and what the exit OpEx margins look like. You're seeing that momentum build in the second half of the year and helping us build into momentum for 2024. Devina Rankin : I'll speak to the 5% to 7% for a moment because I think what's interesting is when you look at 2023 specifically, we're guiding about $325 million of EBITDA growth at the midpoint. That includes a $125 million decline from the sustainability businesses. And so when you adjust that, that's $450 million of growth from the combination of strong execution in the solid waste business and the optimization of SG&A costs. That's over 8% EBITDA growth in our business. And so I think it indicates that, that 5% to 7% outlook does have some upside potential, and we start to see the momentum of the optimization efforts that we are putting forth. And when we see the stabilization in labor, which John just spoke about, it really helps drive that forward even more. Tobey Sommer : I appreciate that discussion. What kind of rate in underlying comp growth is there taking the turnover, the hiring, training kind of out of the equation? John Morris : I'm not sure. Could you take one more crack at that? Tobey Sommer : Yes. So what is your compensation growth for sort of -- maybe you could take a look at your existing employees? Like what's the underlying trend there as opposed to your training and hiring costs? John Morris : Yes, yes. That's a good question. That 6.1% that I commented was looking at average unit rate per hour. So that is probably the best barometer for what's happening. And that's what I was mentioning last year, that was 9%, 10%, 11%, depending on what part of the world you were looking at. So on an hourly rate, that's where we see the moderation coming down. The growth of that rate has come down almost in half. Jim Fish : I think this is -- part of this was the emphasis behind looking to take positions out through technology, not take them out but not choose to replace them because there is a concern, and there has been for three or four years now that this labor pool is shrinking particularly on the trade type positions. And John talks a lot about that. But that's why just in '22 and '23, there's 1,500 positions so far that we've chosen not to replace. Most of those, as Devina said, are on the customer experience side, through adding technology, our call volume is down significantly in customer experience.  But there still are a number of those left. We said kind of 5,000 to 7,000 positions. So at the low end of that 5,000 over a period of a couple of years. John has some operating positions to take out as he moves from traditional rear load equipment, for example, to automated side loaders. Obviously, a rear loader has a person on the back. And not only is there an added labor component there, but there's a safety issue, too. It's much more dangerous to be on the back of a truck than to be sitting in the cab operating a joystick.  There are -- we've taken out only 100 of those so far, really having to do more than anything with truck deliveries. But there's another 400 that are geared up and ready to go as soon as those trucks come in. And I think over the next couple of years, you could see something north of 1,000 that we take out, not only do you get a person off the back, but you also get a 25% or 30% pickup in productivity. John Morris : The one thing I would add, Jim, is we skipped over recycling. I mean if you look at the benefits we're showing in the recycling business in these automated plants and the margin expansion and the labor dependency and ratio reductions, that's a clear place where it's showing up. It takes a little longer to do with over 15,000 plus routes. But in the recycling business, Brent and Tara and team have done a nice job of really demonstrating where automation drives real dollars out of the business. Jim Fish : But all of these reduce that risk that you're talking about, which is this kind of inflationary risk on labor. Tobey Sommer : Excellent. I appreciate you being in the recycling comments. Just one brief follow-up on the relate. With respect to the acquisition pipeline and what you're seeing, you kind of gave an anecdote of a really high kind of mid-teens multiple. Is there really that kind of disconnect? Or was that just a single example, but maybe not representative of the pipeline as a whole? Jim Fish : No, I mean that's -- look, I think what -- I guess my point was, you're starting to see some of these valuations creep up. And so really my primary point was we're going to be disciplined about that. I mean, particularly as you think about these investments we're making in RNG and recycling, I mean, if you put a multiple on that, it's a multiple of three or four compared to a multiple -- anything in double digits seems to not make sense compared to those. So it doesn't mean we're not going to do acquisitions. But I think we're going to be disciplined about how we go about that, particularly when it comes to some of these higher multiples. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Your line is open, please go ahead. Stephanie Yee : Good morning. I wanted to ask about the plastic commodity prices being down. It sounds like on the OCC fiber front, that wasn't so much of a surprise. But if you can just comment on what's driven the decline in the plastic piece? And what your expectations are, not necessarily for this year, but just maybe perhaps for 2024? Tara Hemmer : Sure. If you look at what's happening with plastics, it really comes down to the virgin price for plastics is low, which is putting pressure on the recycled pricing. But we think long term, if you think about what's happening with brands, they all have commitments to buy recycled content, and we think that will come back, they are going to come back into the market to buy to meet their commitments. So we would expect that we would see a ramp longer term. It's one of the reasons why we're excited about some of our investments that we've made in plastics recycling and advancing those. And it's one of the things that our automated recycling plants do. They help capture more plastic, which will go to those markets longer term. Stephanie Yee : Okay. Great. And just a question again on kind of the longer-term EBITDA margin expansion potential, the 40 to 60 basis points, I think was mentioned and the 5% to 7% EBITDA growth, is that premised on yields being higher than that 2% level that was presented back in May of 2019, just because average yield is tracking higher than that right now? And it seems like there is momentum behind pricing, generally, both on resi and -- both on the collection and also the post-collection side? Devina Rankin : Yes, it's a great question, Stephanie. I think the way that we're looking at that is not a specific yield number, but instead the spread between our yield and our cost inflation. And what we're really satisfied with is that we've seen flexibility in our pricing programs to be responsive to different cost environments. And so whether the yield in that initial guidance in 2019 was 2% or we're closer to the 5.5% today. What we're focused on is ensuring that we get the right spread from optimizing the business as well as continuing to price to cover cost inflation for long-term growth. Stephanie Yee : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schumm with TD Cowen. Your line is open, please go ahead. James Schumm : Good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in. So you cited inflation in the sustainability growth program. Is it fair to assume that the total CapEx to achieve the '26 targets will be higher than what you laid out in April? And can you give any indication of what that magnitude might be? Devina Rankin : We are expecting that there will be an increase in the overall program, but because of the size of the program and the multiyear nature of executing upon it, we are going to wait to give specific updates with regard to the magnitude of that. It's difficult for us to update this a quarter at a time. And what we look to do is ensure that we give you clarity as we have significant or any meaningful revisions in near-term outlook and the most material one that we have at this point is just the shift of the $200 million from '23 to '24. Everything else is quite inconsequential to the overall outlook at this point. James Schumm : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just lastly for me. You mentioned a couple of the permitting issues and maybe some interconnects. Are you seeing any supply chain issues for equipment or any third-party constraints with like pipeline companies or anything like that? Tara Hemmer : On the equipment side, we did a good job in particular on the R&D side of making sure that we really procured our longer lead time items and those critical components related to our build. So we feel good about that. One of the things that we've been watching on both sides is really electrical components. And so the team has done a good job of getting out in front of that. Those tend to be a year out lead time like items and then working in close coordination with the pipeline and then electrical interconnect, and those are typically very local in nature and very site specific. So we've seen some issues here and there that we're trying to navigate through. And again, this is a pretty normal course when you think about what we're trying to build and the scale and the size of our portfolio. James Schumm : Okay, that makes sense. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Your line is open, please go ahead. Kevin Chiang : Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe just two quick ones for me given -- I appreciate all the detail on this call already. Just to confirm, the ITC expectations that you laid out at the sustainability of Investor Day, the $250 million to $350 million, that's still the right range we should be thinking about just to confirm that number? Tara Hemmer : Yes. We'll provide greater detail in the future once we have a bit more clarity from the IRS, but we feel confident in those ranges. Kevin Chiang : Okay. That's helpful. And then you mentioned, I think, churn in the prepared -- not churn, the conversion rate in your prepared remarks from core price -- between core price and yield, 85%, that's obviously tracked nicely here over the past couple of years, if not longer. Just wondering how you think about that conversion rate, as you crush this inflation we've seen, it sounds like you're starting to see a little bit of disinflation or deflation in some of these buckets or these things aren't rising as fast. Do you think that makes smaller players a little bit more competitive, if they're not seeing the same inflation, they become a little bit more competitive on pricing and that conversion rate could slip a little bit? Or do you think you've structurally changed how you think about core price and yield to kind of hold on to that even in an inflation environment that's, let's say, 3%, 4% versus 6%, 7%? John Morris : Jim said it last quarter or the quarter before, trying to expand margin when inflation is 8%, 9% is not ideal. So as we see inflation tick down and CPI is probably a good example of that. We don't -- we see our ability to grow margin, obviously, get a little bit stronger as inflation comes down. Secondly, CPI, obviously, is tailing off. I look at that two ways, 1 of which is the cost side, which I commented on.  The second piece of it is as you look back on a lot of our index price contracts. We've still got a bit of a tailwind and we talked about that when we gave guidance of about 5.5% conversion rate there. So -- and lastly, I think whether it's been an inflationary environment, high CPI, lower CPI, if you look at our historic pricing strategy, we've priced to get margin on top of operating expenses regardless of what's happened on the CPI side. Kevin Chiang : That\u2019s helpful. And thank you for the color. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Fish, President and CEO, for his closing remarks. Jim Fish : Okay. Thank you so much. And I really appreciate your detailed questions this morning. It helped us to explain why we're feeling good about this quarter coming out. So thank you for those. Thank you all for joining us. Looking forward to talking to you again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Jim Fish : Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter results are a testament to our team's ability to deliver on the priorities we set for 2023, including increasing profitability through disciplined pricing and optimizing our cost structure. Against the challenging backdrop, we have remained focused on the things we can control and this diligent focus is evident in our third quarter results. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew by more than 6% and margin expanded 100 basis points to 29.6% when compared to Q3 of 2022. Our strong results in the quarter were powered by our solid waste business. Organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business remains solid and is tracking well against our expectations. Third quarter core price of 6.6% reflects robust price performance across all lines of business. We're also pleased with the resilience of our solid waste volumes as commercial volumes turned mostly positive and special waste growth improved from the second quarter. And what really stands out for this quarter is our success in managing the middle of the P&L. We continue to drive SG&A leverage and we're also gaining momentum on operating cost optimization and efficiency gains. Our long-term focus on using automation and technology to optimize our cost structure is paying off, as we're choosing not to replace certain high turnover difficult-to-fill positions. Since January of 2022, we've leveraged attrition and technology to reduce headcount by 1,650 positions. We continue to be focused on the full opportunity of 5,000 to 7,000 position eliminations through attrition and technology over four to five years, and we're pleased with this progress to date. You'll hear more details about our cost performance from John and Devina. Putting it all together, our focus on price, efficiency and cost control translated into the strong operating leverage we produced in the quarter. Turning to our strategic investments in sustainability growth, the investment proposition for growing our renewable energy and recycling business remains strong and our project execution is tracking well. Our seventh renewable natural gas plant and the third of 20 facilities in our growth program is expected to be in service in January. And we have another four facilities on track for completion in 2024, including two of the largest projects in the portfolio, Fairless in Pennsylvania and Orchard Hills in Illinois. On the recycling front, we've completed technology and automation upgrades at two facilities in the quarter. And we have two more upgrades at a new facility in Nashville slated to begin service by the end of this year. Our automated network continues to drive great results by pushing our labor and processing costs lower, improving throughput and driving enhanced material quality, which benefits the recycling business in any commodity environment. Yet again, in the third quarter, we saw materially lower labor cost per ton at our automated facilities at about 35% below the rest of our recycling network. Our investments in developing the blueprint for a modern recycling facility sets us apart within the communities we serve and are unlocking further growth opportunities. With one quarter remaining in the year, we're well positioned to deliver on the 2023 financial outlook we provided last quarter, including adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 6% at the midpoint. We continue to expect a margin run rate exiting the year of about 29%, underpinned by 62% operating expenses as a percent of revenue and 9% SG&A as a percent of revenue. We're pleased with our results through the first nine months of the year. Our team is very focused on price discipline and cost optimization to deliver a strong finish to the year and lay the groundwork for further growth in 2024. I want to thank each of our team members for their commitment to our customers and their many contributions to our success. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'd like to open by highlighting the strides we're making in optimizing our cost structure. In the third quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 90 basis points year-over-year to 61.3%. The collection and disposal business contributed 70 basis points of this improvement due to the strong operating leverage provided by our cost optimization efforts. In addition, we achieved pricing leverage as core price exceeded cost inflation by an estimated 100 basis points in the quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made in managing our labor costs, as well as expenses related to repair and maintenance. Our efforts have resulted in a meaningful decline in WM's underlying cost of inflation since the beginning of the year to mid-single-digits in the third quarter. Our focus on efficiently managing labor expenses is yielding positive results. So far this year, we have automated 141 residential routes and have a target to convert more than 400 routes in 2024. As we shift to more automated routes, we've seen a nearly 14% decrease in the number of helpers needed in our residential business. In addition, our focus on reducing turnover continued to produce improvements in Q3, building on the consistent progress we've made over the past 12 months. Our collection efficiency has also exhibited steady progress throughout the year with commercial, industrial, and residential business line showing improvements every quarter. All these focus areas on managing our business are contributing to the improvement in labor costs. Turning to repair and maintenance expenses. Despite some lingering effects of inflation and the timing of fleet deliveries, we're making progress. For the first time in several years, we expect to get an allotment of vehicles that aligns with our fleet replacement strategy with more than 1,200 received to-date. This has allowed us to remove older trucks from our fleet and also reduce rental truck usage by over 40% since the start of the year. Furthermore, our spending on third-party technicians has been reduced by two-thirds compared to the second half of 2022 and continues to improve. With the progress we've achieved in the third quarter, we believe we've turned the corner on this expense line and are optimistic about ongoing improvements as we close out the year. Turning to our revenue growth. We continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. Our third quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 5.7% on a workday-adjusted basis. This growth was led by core price of 6.6% with collection and disposal yield of 5%. Our differentiated service offering is generating value with our national account customers as well as commercial customers. We continue to focus on maximizing customer lifetime value and our Q3 churn of 9% remains at the low end of our historical range, demonstrating the positive momentum we are seeing with customers valuing our service offerings. Looking at volumes. Third quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 0.7% on a workday-adjusted basis. Our landfill business drove most of the volume growth as special waste grew 11.1% on a workday-adjusted basis in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not separate special waste into yield in volume and in Q3, we benefited from several high-priced projects that drove the increase. So, we've highlighted in previous conversations, the timing and pricing of special waste projects is subject to variability due to their discretionary nature. However, our project pipeline remains robust. In addition, Workday adjusted MSW volumes were up 1.7% in the quarter. Our overall collection volumes were down modestly due to the intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns as well as the impact of lower volumes from our roll-off business. Yet both revenue and operating EBITDA continue to grow in each line of business, demonstrating that we are prioritizing profitable volume growth. Net new business and net service increases remained solidly positive and growth in our strategic accounts business, driven by our differentiated offerings, continues to outpace our expectations. Thus, overall collection and disposal organic growth is on pace for the year. With regard to recycling and renewable energy, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations and our recently automated recycling facilities are delivering strong results. As Jim discussed, our sustainability growth projects are tracking well and we're confident that our operating EBITDA expectations for the year remain in the range provided last quarter. In closing, I'd like to express my gratitude to our frontline teams for their dedication to providing safe and dependable service to our customers and communities each day. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks John, and good morning. Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on the fundamental value drivers of our business, disciplined revenue growth and cost optimization. Executing on these fundamentals positioned us to deliver WM's best ever operating EBITDA margin in the third quarter at 29.6%. This is a 100 basis point improvement compared to Q3 of 2022 and it can be attributed almost entirely to 70 basis points of margin expansion in the collection and disposal business. SG&A leverage provided the remaining expansion. We're pleased with the team's focus on optimizing costs and reducing discretionary spending, which together positioned us to deliver SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue of 9%, showing that this long-term goal is not just achievable, it is largely in hand. While the current quarter result has some benefit from lower current year incentive compensation costs, we see this level of SG&A is sustainable, particularly as revenue grows. While there were a number of other margin impacts in the quarter, mostly related to fuel, energy and commodities, these items basically offset each other, giving us confidence that this quarter's results are based on the steps we are taking to price our services above inflation and to permanently reduce our cost structure. Through the first nine months of 2023, we have expanded operating EBITDA margin by 40 basis points to 28.5%, putting us squarely on track to achieve our full year target of operating EBITDA margin of 28.4% to 28.6%. Our operating performance has translated into robust cash flow from operations. Through the first three quarters of the year, cash flow from operations exceeded $3.3 billion, positioning us to deliver more than $4.5 billion of cash from operations for the year. As we expected, cash flow associated with operating EBITDA growth in 2023 has been largely offset by higher interest, taxes and incentive compensation payments. Despite these known headwinds, our conversion of revenue dollars to cash from operations and operating EBITDA dollars to free cash flow in the base business were both near peak levels in the quarter, demonstrating the sustainable value creation from our diligent focus on optimizing the middle of the P&L and/or capital expenditures. Capital spending in the first nine months of the year totaled almost $1.9 billion with $1.456 billion related to normal course capital and $397 million of spending on sustainability growth projects. We now expect sustainability growth capital spending of about $750 million in 2023. The $150 million decrease from prior expectations is based on a shift in the timing of spending across the next two to three quarters. As a result of this lower anticipated capital spending, 2023 free cash flow is expected to be $150 million above our prior expectations and in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. Free cash flow through the first nine months of the year was $1.552 billion, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was $1.949 billion. We're confident in our ability to achieve our full year targeted free cash flow before sustainability growth investments of between $2.575 billion and $2.675 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $855 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchased $990 million of our stock. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.73 times, which is at the midpoint of our target ratio of between 2.5 times and 3 times. 9% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, our pre-tax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was 3.9%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well positioned to fund growth opportunities. Looking at our full year expectations. Our solid operational performance in the first nine months of the year positions us to achieve the operating EBITDA guidance we provided last quarter of $5.775 billion to $5.875 billion. This strong result will be achieved with continued focus on pricing our services to recover cost inflation differentiating WM's value proposition with customers to maintain and grow the right volumes and optimizing both operating costs and SG&A. We expect full year revenue growth to be modestly below the midpoint of our July 2023 guidance of 3.25% to 4.25%. Most aspects of our revenue outlook remain intact, but we have seen lower revenue than planned in our recycling brokerage businesses. Given the relatively small operating EBITDA impact from the brokerage business, this refreshed revenue outlook does not impact any other component of our guidance. To sum it up, we're pleased with our performance throughout 2023. We firmly believe that leveraging technology and automation to enhance our operations and investing in our sustainability businesses are positioning us for future success. We're grateful for the hard work of the entire WM team. Their dedication to safely serve our customers and communities will ensure we finish the year strong and move into 2024 even stronger. With that, Victor, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bryan Burgmeier from Citi. Your line is open. Bryan Burgmeier : Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Jim Fish : Good morning. Bryan Burgmeier : Thinking about some of the underlying guidance components, volume is maybe a little bit better than your original view and on that maybe points to a little bit of upside on recycling and renewables versus the guidance you put out in July. I guess, A, do you agree with that to be - it will seem like we maybe could be pointing towards the higher end of the EBITDA range? I think you said 6% EBITDA growth at the midpoint, which is maybe a tough higher but that is towards your model. Any detail you can add there? Thank you. Jim Fish : Yes. So I guess a couple of - you mentioned volume, then you mentioned the EBITDA range. So I'll tackle volume first here, Bryan. When we looked at volume, we were obviously pleased with a couple of things, special waste, as I mentioned, was slightly better. Some of that was rate related, really. But for the most part, volume was as we expected, which was fairly flat. We said at the beginning of the year that volume would be flat. And it's been fairly flat all year. Third quarter was slightly better than the first two quarters. I think the collection volumes have been flat pretty much all year long. It's been a - it's different from one line of business to another. Resi almost really by design has been down probably for a couple of years at roll-off was probably the more disappointing of the lines of business and then commercial might have been the one that was more encouraging. So commercial was up slightly, roll off down and then resi by design. And then within the landfill line of business, not anything really unexpected there other than maybe special waste and maybe C&D a little bit. C&D has a little bit of a mix there. And in particularly when you get to the fourth quarter, C&D is really going to be a difficult comparison because of the hurricane last year. But overall volume, I think is not - it's not going to be a big change when you get into the fourth quarter. And honestly, what you're going to see in 2024, and we'll give, of course, our guidance when we get to the next quarter, but 2024 is going to sound pretty similar to 2023, I think, when it comes to volume. I guess when it comes to the EBITDA range - and we anticipated that there would be a question of, okay, so nice performance on EBITDA. So why not give us a number in the higher end of the range. And I would just tell you, there's going to be a natural level of conservatism here because whether it is - not that we're affected much by geopolitics, but there's a lot going on right now that makes it a little bit hard to see out into beyond a month or two. I think that's why 2024 is still a question for us. How does 2024 look? We're going to wait three months before we really try and put a pin on 2024. But for 2023, we're comfortable with the range. We feel comfortable with the quarter. And to the extent that it ends up where we expect, then we were right to not change it. If it's higher than we expected, then it beat us up at that point. Bryan Burgmeier : Understood. Yes. Thank you for all the details, Jim. Last question for me. If I heard you correctly in the prepared remarks, I think you said you're looking to bring four or five RNG facilities online next year. I think that would be essentially in line with your original plan from January. Is it fair to assume that most of the construction delays that we're seeing in the CapEx line are related to recycling? Can you put a finer point on the facilities might be coming online to 2024? Or is it a little bit too soon to speculate, right? Thanks, and I'll turn it over. Tara Hemmer : Sure. This is Tara Hemmer, Chief Sustainability Officer. I think there are two key takeaways that we want you to hear from us related to our sustainability-related investments. And the first is our level of confidence in our 2026 EBITDA projections, the $500 million for renewable energy, the $240 million for recycling. We've spent a lot of time really looking at our projects and we're very confident in our ability to deliver those numbers in 2026.  The second thing that is important to note and it's one of the reasons why we have this level of confidence is in 2024, we expect to have about 40 projects under active construction. So that gives you a sense of the momentum that we're building within the platform. If you look at the capital related to some of the shifts, it is related to both recycling and renewable energy. It's not just specific to recycling. So I want to leave you with that. But the important thing to remember is these capital shifts that we see, we see something similar in our traditional business where construction projects really don't know calendar years. And so some of this is about shifting some things from Q4 into Q1 and Q2. Bryan Burgmeier : Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Your line is open. Tyler Brown : Hi. Good morning guys. Jim Fish : Good morning. Devina Rankin : Hi. Tyler Brown : Hi. John, I know it's early, but it does feel like unit cost inflation is starting to ease. I'm just curious, you said mid-single-digit unit cost inflation in the quarter, but can you be a little bit more specific on what that was? And two, just any early thoughts on how you guys are thinking about core price into next year in order to offset unit cost inflation to get to that 29% margin that Devina talked about. John Morris : Yes. Good question, Tyler. I would tell you, let me start with wages because that's 1 I've used as a barometer. When you look at where we were beginning of the year Q1, it was double digits. It was 10%, 11%. And when you look sort of right, the big buckets of labor drivers, technicians, have equipment operators. Those numbers are down between 5% and 6% in Q3. So almost half of where they were. So that's part of what we're seeing from inflation moderation. I think on the M&R side, too, maintenance and repairs, part of my prepared remarks is we got 1,200 trucks, and we'll end up with about over 1,300 for the year and we're seeing the same kind of progress in our maintenance and repair expenses. When you look at it in whole dollars or on a percentage basis, we've sort of gone from the mid-teens down to low double digits and now we're in the 6% to 7% range for Q3. So as Devina said, we're not claiming victory there yet. But I think the combination of us getting assets, some moderation in the big buckets, labor being one of them, are what you're seeing translate to the 61.3% in the quarter from an OpEx perspective. On the core price side, I mean, Jim said in his opening comments, it's not really been so much about the core price going through. It's about what are we retaining. And I think when you look at the margin expansion you saw relative to the OpEx. And you heard in my prepared remarks about us making margin and EBITDA improvements in all lines of business. I think that's the end result we're shooting for. So our pricing strategy holistically is working, and I don't think you're going to see any change in that. Devina Rankin : Tyler, I'll just add a little bit of color in terms of specific amounts when we look at core price covering cost inflation for the portfolio overall. We talked about in Q3 that getting to a positive 100 basis points, which is fantastic for us to see. As you can appreciate, pricing activities don't link directly to when we see cost inflation. And so when we look at Q1 and Q2, the variance between those two measures was a negative 500 basis points. In Q2, we had improved to negative 250 basis points. So what you see is the continued progress in terms of making sure that on an annual basis, we are seeing those pricing activities cover our cost inflation and when you couple that with the cost optimization efforts that we're putting forth to more efficiently run the business and getting some help from truck deliveries we're really starting to see the math associated with price covering inflation and hopefully getting to a point at some point where we start to see that as a lever for incremental margin expansion as well really take hold in the third quarter. Tyler Brown : Yes, perfect. I totally get the timing. So I kind of want to shift gears just a little bit. This is for Jim and Tara. I get it that you guys are not giving guidance, and I totally appreciate that. But I do get a lot of questions about the EBITDA contribution from RNG and recycling specifically in 2024. Because if you go back to the Investor Day, I think you're supposed to get something like $225 million combined incrementally from those two. But on the other hand, you guys are pushing CapEx. It sounds like there's some delays I get it may be that, that build was directional, but can you just give any broad stress on what that EBITDA contribution would be next year? I think it would be extremely helpful. Jim Fish : Yes. We can both kind of address this, Tyler, right. I think, first of all, it's important to understand, and Tara mentioned it in her first question there that we really would prefer that you anchor on that $740 million. That's the number that truly is to be modeled against. The other numbers, look, there's - because of the movement and we anticipated some movement in capital spending, we anticipate some movement in permitting. We've had a good story on permitting in Canada. I mean so - but we've also had delays on supply chain and hence, the movement around in CapEx from one quarter to another. And so the numbers that we gave were really more of a buildup to that $740 million, not intended to be guidance. So that's, I think, first point. The second point here is that with 40 active projects ongoing, there's - and a lot of movement by the way, both in recycling commodity prices and D3 RIN pricing, natural gas pricing, those businesses are really - it's why we wait to give guidance until February. I know companies give a lot of guidance this time of year. But our preference is to wait and give ourselves a bit more time, particularly in today's in today's climate, where visibility isn't fantastic. You can't look off the bow at a ship and see for 20 miles. Now it's not 10 feet either, but it's not 20 miles. So we're really giving ourselves the benefit of a little bit of extra time before we try and answer that question directly. And I'm not trying to punch your question, but it is just going to be much easier for us, for Tara or Shahid for that whole team for Brent Bell to give a very precise answer in early February than it is today. Tara Hemmer : And we'll be much further along in our construction process for those 2024 projects. Tyler Brown : Okay. Yes. No, I completely get it. And maybe just my last one kind of in the same day, and I'll try again in a little bit different way, but it looks like you deferred about $230 million, I think, from your original guidance on green CapEx. So should we think about $750 million kind of maybe being a number to use for next year as well just on the CapEx side? Thanks. Devina Rankin : Tyler, I'll take that really quickly. But deferral in 2023 was $350 million in the aggregate from where we started the year. Some of that will roll into 2024, as Tara mentioned, because it really is just kind of a not writing the check in December, but instead writing it in January or February. But then we do expect that some of what we had anticipated as 2024 capital could move into 2025. And so it's difficult to say that we'll just take that $350 million and added on to what we had previously projected for 2024 because we will have some shift from 2024 into 2025. But all in all, those projects, the confidence in them that Tara spoke to, I think, is the most important point. For us, it's making sure that we do the right thing from a working capital management perspective, and pay for this capital when it's placed into service or aligning those two as best we can. Tyler Brown : All right. I appreciate it. Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Jasper Bibb : Hi, good morning. This is Jasper Bibb on for Tobey. I wanted to ask about the SG&A optimization effort. I think if I heard you correctly in the prepared remarks, there was a comment about current SG&A levels being sustainable. So as we look out to 2024, should we think about SG&A at 9% of revenue being a good starting point for the year? Or any context there would be helpful. Devina Rankin : Yes, that's exactly right. When we look at the levers that have been used to deliver SG&A in the current year, it really is our focus on technology and optimization, particularly with some of the success that we've seen in customer experience and sales. And that customer engagement model is something that we know will continue to create momentum in the years ahead. And the cost discipline as well has been really important. So 9% as a percentage of revenue, we feel like is a new long-term sustainable level of SG&A going forward. Jim Fish : It's probably worth mentioning here, too, that - I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, the 5,000 to 7,000 positions that would come out through attrition that has to-date and so far, the number I gave was 1,650 positions since January of 2022. To-date, that has mostly been SG&A type positions. The big buckets going forward to get us to that 5% to 7% are mostly OpEx position. So when I think about what's happened today, most of those positions came out of our customer experience department where we've used technology to really automate a lot of that. Our call volume has been down as much as 25%. So those positions that had high turnover, 50%-ish type turnover we just chose to not replace. Going forward, the big buckets where you'll get up to that 5,000 to 7,000 range, the big buckets become recycling automation. Now that is ongoing. I talked about a 35-ish percent reduction in labor cost per tonne. But as Tara mentioned, there's a lot of projects ongoing. We're not even close to even one-third of the way through those. So there's a lot of positions yet to come out in our recycling business. Those largely fall into the OpEx category. Then John mentioned the conversion from rear load to ASL. Some of those have taken place this year, but probably three times as many next year. And then the last bucket, which is probably the most difficult one, and we have talked about it quite a bit, but is route optimization. That involves a lot of technology. It involves a lot of process change, but there's also a lot of payback in that when we get it right. So those buckets are mostly OpEx buckets. The previous buckets in that 1,650 positions were mostly SG&A. Jasper Bibb : That makes a lot of sense. And then I was hoping to follow-up on the sustainability capital spending. I guess, what are the most frequent issues you're seeing that are delaying these projects, whether it's supply chain or permitting? And the projects that were already delayed earlier this year, any color on what's been the experience or the time line on resolving those earlier delays? Tara Hemmer : Sure. The biggest issues that we have been seeing we're really in two key categories. The first is on utility interconnects, and we're making progress on utility interconnect for us. That's on the electrical side and then also getting the connectivity to be able to push the gas into the system. And so we've been working hard on making sure that we have those agreements in place. And then the second piece, it's construction related, but I would put it more into the permitting category, and we've made a lot of progress on obtaining many of our permits that are necessary on the RNG side. So from a supply chain perspective, we've done a fantastic job of really making sure that we have built slots on equipment\u2019s for both our recycling business and our renewable energy business. So that's less of a risk. Jim Fish : Yes Tobey, we talked about yesterday, the single biggest plan, and I mentioned it in my remarks, which is Fairless in Pennsylvania. That is our single biggest plan that we will build in the 20 and to give you some perspective, that plant was originally, originally scheduled for opening in the second quarter, beginning of May. And it's pushed a little bit. And right now, it looks like it's scheduled to open at the end of June. So it's pushed a couple of months. But I think that gives you a good feel for what's happening here. We're not talking about pushing things back 12 to 15 months, they're moving in kind of 60-day - 30- to 60-day increments, but it is having some effect on CapEx, for example, but I think the fact that we've got 40 active recycle and RNG plants in 2024, you'll have quite a few more - you'll have another big chunk in 2025. And then we get to 2026, we're very comfortable with the end number. Jasper Bibb : That super helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning everyone. Jim Fish : Good morning Jerry. Devina Rankin : Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich : I'm wondering, if you folks can talk about the opportunity for lower R&M and what that could mean for you folks. Really interesting in the quarter to see your operating expenses essentially flattish, given John, the inflation items that you mentioned earlier. And so as you folks get the truck deliveries online, et cetera, how much further could the cost structure improve off of the strong levels we're seeing in 3Q? Devina Rankin : Yes, Jerry, I think it's a great point and John and I have spoken a lot about this. I think one of the best indicators is when you look at the year-over-year increase that we have been seeing in the first half of the year for repair and maintenance costs, that was 14.1% in the first six months of the year. In the third quarter, that was up only 6.9% as the deliveries that we've talked about finally are getting on the road and we're able to get the older assets off the street the team members are having to run much longer than our plans because we hadn't gotten or a lot of trucks for the last 18 months or so. So when we look at sustainable levels of repair and maintenance increase, we think that there's, some good tailwinds coming in the fourth quarter and into early 2024. And when you just look at that 1 metric alone, I think it's a great indication. Jerry Revich : Devina, thank you. Just to clarify, so it sounds like it could be not just lower inflation going forward. It sounds like it could actually be a decline in spending, if I understood your comments correctly? Devina Rankin : No. What we're hesitant to say is a decline in spend, because while there are some parts inflation places where we've actually seen costs going backward and that should give us some benefits. There are places where we're just still catching up with regard to making sure that we've got the right assets in the right places to service the customers. We do think in the first half of next year, you could see effectively flatter cost in repair and maintenance. And that's what we're working towards. John Morris : I think the other benefit, Jerry, is just a little bit more detail than the M&R question, but it's not just M&R. We're also seeing it show up in other parts of the business, in particular, in labor and efficiency, right, because when we're putting newer trucks on the street that obviously benefits in other places just as opposed to maintenance and repairs. And we're seeing that show up in efficiency. Jerry Revich : Super. And can I shift gears, and Tara ask you, if you don't mind. How are you thinking about the allocation of gas that's coming online towards the transportation versus utilities? So it looks like based on the EPA October report, there's about a $10 million and BTU shortfall towards transportation applications. And so, as you think about where you're putting the gas to use, how does satisfying and making sure that, that market gets enough supply factor into your decision versus the allocation plan that we spoke about at the sustainability today? Tara Hemmer : Yes. I mean we're still targeting and using that framework that we had in place, really thinking one year out having 70% to 90% of our volume locked up two years out in that 40% range and then three years out, 10% to 30%. I think what we have to be clear about is when we think about that, it is transportation versus voluntary market, but you can also do fixed priced or longer term deals in either market, and we're going to be accessing both of those. If you think about our portfolio for 2024, one thing that's important to note is we had done some deals in the voluntary market. A great example is we did one with a large utility 20-year agreement with pricing that's north of $20 a ton - sorry, $20 per MMBtu, old garbage gallon, I mean, at $20 per MMBtu. So on a blended basis, if you look at 2024, we have roughly 30% today of our volume locked up, and that will, of course, have an impact on pricing. We are tracking very closely the transportation market, and we've been watching what's happening with RINs and the price pop. What's important to note there though is, we don't necessarily access the spot market. We are looking at the spot market but also selling forward. So we want to just caution people about just taking a $3.4 RIN price that RINs are trading at today for future pricing in 2024. Jim Fish : It helps the future market. Tara Hemmer : Absolutely. Absolutely. Like, we're more positive pricing going forward into the fourth quarter and of course, 2024. Jerry Revich : Super. Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Hi. Thanks so much. First, just a clarifying question following up from Tyler, 29% margin, is that the 4Q number or is that kind of the bogey for 2024? I just want to make sure that we all understand that are on the same page. Devina Rankin : Yes. The way that we've looked at the 29% is basically the second half of 2023. Our target was to deliver 29% EBITDA margin. What you see is a 29.6% in the third quarter that modestly outpaced our expectations for the quarter. So it gives us some room in terms of our fourth quarter expectations. But Q4, you can expect us to be in the range of the 28.5% to 29% margin. Noah Kaye : Perfect. Thank you. Clearly, a big story this quarter is those gains right in margins largely from managing the middle. So I want to delve a little bit more into both labor and equipment availability. Just on the labor side, where is turnover currently? How has that progressed? And then I think in the release, there was a call out of some modest costs for upcoming collective bargaining anything we should be aware of there in terms of how that impacts labor trends. John Morris : Yes. The collective bargaining comment was simply some dollars we spent in preparation for some contracts we had in the Midwest, which thankfully got resolved. But when we have big agreements like that, it's not uncommon for us to spend some money to make sure we're prepared for the worst, so to speak. But in this case, it was a better outcome and those are behind us. And on the labor front, part of my comment earlier was just in the moderation of rate inflation that we've seen from 10%, 11% coming out of last year into the first quarter or two of this year and now being closer to the 5% to 6% range in terms of the rate that labor is going up. And you put that against the backdrop of our pricing strategy, which Jim commented on, we continue - we're seeing a better spread between what's happened with inflation and some of those costs, in this case, specifically labor. Noah Kaye : And the turnover? Yes, go ahead, please. John Morris : And the turnover is still a good story. That was part of my prepared remarks, too, and driver being the biggest. We have about 21,000 drivers in the network and we're continuing to see improvement there down into the low 20s from probably a peak up in the high 20s to close to 30% 18 months ago. Jim Fish : Yes. I was just going to say, no, I mean, what you're really hearing here, and it's not just specific to your questions, but to all questions is what we've been saying for several quarters, which is there's a few things that are outside of our control. And we're very focused on those things that are within our control might sound obvious, but it's not going to sound that different when we get to 2024. And while we're not giving specific numbers for 2024, I would tell you that when we get to 2024, pricing is going to continue to be good. We're going to continue to focus, as Devina said and John have said on the middle of the P&L. We feel good about the progress we're making on OpEx. We feel great about the progress we've made on SG&A. It wasn't that long ago that we were talking about getting below 11%. Now we're saying the number is 9%. So - but I think the technology that we've been talking about for probably three years is finally starting to show that it really is going to produce some results. And then there's a bit of a hangover from the pandemic where we - where there were some things that we simply didn't expect that affected turnover that affected supply chain, obviously, inflation all of that, I think we've really, really gotten our hands around and now we're starting, as John mentioned in his detailed prepared remarks, pull units out that have been sitting on the fence that really we've been keeping there as just kind of a cautionary move on our part. So 2024 is going to look, I think, pretty similar. It's going to look fairly flat on volume. It's going to look good on price. We finally will get a little bit of tailwind when it comes to our sustainability businesses because 2023 was tough from that standpoint. And finally, we'll see some year-over-year positive comps on commodity prices. I think in our RNG business, we've talked a lot about RIN pricing. That looks like it's - it could end up being a good positive year-over-year comp, same with natural gas, last year, Q4 was difficult because of the Ukraine spike in natural gas pricing, all of that kind of went away if you look at natural gas pricing in the first quarter. So I think you're going to see a fairly another year where we're saying, here's what we're focused on. We're not going to try and predict what happens with the economy. But those things that we can control, I think, we're doing a pretty darn good job of controlling them. Noah Kaye : For sure. And I just wanted to follow-up less quickly on the truck delivery side. It's been great. And clearly, you're seeing that benefit on the MNR of those increased deliveries you already comment to what you expect this year? I know there have been some investor questions around the impact of the UAW strike at Mack, but we do have built slots opening up for 2024 now. Can you just comment into visibility into continued strong truck deliveries? John Morris : Yes. We're actually in pretty good shape. That's an unfortunate situation. But we've talked to our supply chain team between Devina and I and the build slots that we have and the trucks really going into the first half of next year don't look like they're going to be impacted, partly because we take delivery of chassis a lot earlier than we take delivery of the truck because it's another manufacturer that's involved in that. So we're in pretty good shape there. Noah Kaye : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for next question. And our next question will come from the line of Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Your line is open. Hans Hoffman : Hi. This is Hans on for Stephanie. I was just curious if we could sort of bridge the 100 bps of margin expansion. I know you guys kind of called out sort of optimizing the overall cost structure in the collection and disposable side, but just curious if you could sort of parse out the other item impacts like fuel, ITC and M&A? Devina Rankin : Sure. So collection and disposal of 70 basis points plus SG&A of 20 basis points basically tells the story, but then we've got puts and takes and the biggest piece there is the timing of the alternative fuel tax credit and that was a headwind of 50 basis points. That was almost entirely offset by the impact of lower fuel prices and our surcharge structure, and that was a 40 basis point impact in the quarter. Then you had recycling and renewable energy, recycling was positive 20 basis points renewable energy was negative 20 basis points. So again, those two offset each other. And we've talked all year about having some dilutive impact from M&A because of the type of acquisitions we had on the recycling brokerage side as well as just a typical ramp of getting good solid waste tuck-in acquisitions to WM standards. That impact has lessened in the third quarter relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year, and that was at about 40 basis points in the first half down to about 20 basis in the third quarter. Hans Hoffman : Got it. That's helpful. And then just kind of shifting gears a bit. Just kind of curious if you could talk about the greatest - where do you have the greatest sort of pricing opportunity? And how should we be thinking about your pricing power in a lower inflationary environment. And I was also just sort of wondering if you could just remind us what percent of the restricted book is tied to waste and see trash collection portion of CPI versus actual headline CPI. I think it's kind of important as that kind of component has been accelerating kind of for most of this year and probably will average a point or two higher than headline CPI, which could have some impact on pricing next year. Jim Fish : Yes. The number we usually give is about 40% is tied to some type of index. Not necessarily water sewer trash, that's one of the indices, but about 40% is tied to an index. There tends to be a bit of a look back on that, a lag. So to the extent that, that number is climbing, that ends up being a positive for us. It just - it takes a little while to get to that full positive. I think to your first question about where we expect pricing to be good. Look, I think pricing has been pretty consistently good across the board. In years past, particularly probably as far back as five years ago, pricing was pretty good, but it was very focused on one line of business. That has changed over the last few years where we've been good with pricing across the board. But I think the piece that we've all touched on a little bit here today that I'll reiterate is really the net price. It's not something we used to talk about, because there wasn't a whole lot of inflation in the economy. But if I just use Q2 of 2022, because that was kind of the high watermark for inflation, so CPI at 9.5% in Q2 of 2022 and if I look at our core price for collection disposal was 7.5% in Q2 of 2022 and yield was 6.2%. Now we're looking at a CPI in the 4% range. I think 4.1% was the exact number. And our Q3 collection disposal core price was 6.6% and yield is 5%. So we've completely flipped the tables there, where in Q2 of 2022, CPI is 300 or 400 basis points in front of our price. And now we flip the table. So collectively, we're kind of recovering - we're adding margin now, whereas we were five quarters ago seeing margin decline. But overall, I think we're on a nice trajectory with respect to margin growth. And that really is a function of having a more manageable CPI. I know one of the questions that quarter was what's the optimal level of inflation? And my kind of smart answer was, well, it's not 9.5%. I think we're - if I were asked that question today, I'd say we're much closer to an optimal level of inflation, because we're able to recover with our pricing programs across the board. John Morris : The only thing I would add there, Jim, is when you look at our customer metrics, which is another benchmark and you look at our new business, our lost business, our net new, our churn numbers, our rollbacks, all those KPIs around how that's impacting the customer are still on a good trajectory as well. So to your point, it feels like overall, we're in a good spot. Hans Hoffman : Got it. Super helpful and if I could just sneak one more question in. Just kind of curious with labor turnover improving, one, just sort of wondering how we should maybe think about productivity or efficiency gains as employees kind of mature into their positions? John Morris : Yes, I think that's a great question. One of the friction points, obviously, of turnover is the experience level, and that does translate to two things. One, it can translate to safety and it could translate to efficiency and we've seen positive momentum since the beginning of the year for each quarter in each line of business. And two of the three lines of business went back positive in the quarter. All three were positive in September. We're seeing the positive efficiency momentum continue into October. So that's probably the best benchmark for us to look at in terms of where that shows up. Hans Hoffman : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Dave Manthey from Baird. Your line is open. Dave Manthey from Baird. Your line is open. Dave Manthey : Can you hear me now? Hello? Jim Fish : Yes, I hear you. Yes, we got you. Dave Manthey : Oh, you got me now. Okay. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So my question is any of the $350 million sustainability CapEx being cut at all? Or is it just being pushed to the right? And then is the plan to catch-up between now and 2026? Or is the time line potentially elongated from here? Tara Hemmer : So none of it is cut. And yes, the plan is to catch up. As Devina mentioned earlier, it would be spread throughout 2024 and 2025 with some of what was originally in '24 moving to 2025. Dave Manthey : Okay. Thank you. And second, a couple of random modeling questions here. 11.7 D3 RINs you generate per MMBtu. Is that a constant or can that fluctuate for some reason over time? And then second, I think you told us last quarter that something like 19% of your debt is floating rate, what is that percent today? Tara Hemmer : So the 11.72 is constant. That's a constant conversion rate on the RINs. Devina Rankin : And then on the floating rate debt, we're at 9% currently. Dave Manthey : 9%? Devina Rankin : Yes. Dave Manthey : Perfect. Thank you. Devina Rankin : A quick piece of color on the 9% just in July, we went into the markets and secured really strong fixed rate debt on a long-term basis at a coupon of 4.875%. And so when you see the 10-year treasury where it is today, you can certainly say that we're really pleased with that timing. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is open. Brian Butler : Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Can you hear me? Jim Fish : Yes. Devina Rankin : Yes. Brian Butler : Just to try to keep it quick. On the pricing side, when you talked about kind of that spread over inflation being negative in the first half of the year and kind of positive 100 basis points, how should we think about that going into the fourth quarter? And then maybe longer term, where does that spread - where do you hope that spread or target that spread to kind of even out in 2024 and kind of beyond? Jim Fish : Yes. It's a little bit of the answer I gave previously, which was the spread obviously was working against us five quarters ago when you had inflation approaching 10%. And we just were not able to get to that number on either core price or yield. So we were looking at 7.5% core price, 6.2% yield. And now that relationship has really flipped around. So, you're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% CPI and declining by the way. And then price, whether it's yield at 5% or core price at 6.6%, we feel pretty comfortable that - by the way, I don't think inflation is going to 1% anytime soon. I think you'll probably see inflation in this range for the foreseeable future. So if that's the case, I'd like to be able to maintain our own price in this position where it's slightly above the inflation rate. And by the way, as John has mentioned, our own inflation is - doesn't track perfectly with CPI. So while we certainly have come down on labor inflation from the 10%, 11%, 12% that we were seeing a year, 1.5 years ago, we're still above that kind of 3% to 4% CPI number. So we need to get price in the 5% to 6% range, which is where I think you'll probably see it going into '24. Brian Butler : All right. That's helpful. And then on the - I know we talked a lot about the productivity and optimization. But just at a very high level, I mean when you think of what's left to do and what's been done, is it reasonable to believe that 2024 can produce kind of the similar kind of levels, if not better, than what you saw in 2023? Jim Fish : I think we'll talk about 2024 when we get to February. But if you just look at what the progress we made kind of quarter-by-quarter, first half, second half, it would certainly give us a better exit ratio from an operating perspective and a margin perspective. And then I think Devina commented on that earlier. We still feel we have upside, and we've always talked about 50 to 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. And as Jim mentioned, we've been chasing that a little bit in the last couple of years because of supply chain and inflation and whatnot. It feels like we're in a much better spot coming out of 2023 than we were coming out of 2022. Jim Fish : By the way, one thing we really don't talk about much when we talk about this rear load to ASL conversion. We talk about the heads coming out because there's obviously a helper on the back of a rear loader. What we don't talk much about is the pickup in efficiency or productivity because we are - our history, and we've got a long history of making these conversions. We are much more productive on an ASL than we are on a rear loader. So there's, I don't know, John, 20%, 25% pickup in productivity in the resi line of business where you're making those conversions. John Morris : That's a good number. Brian Butler : Okay. And then one last quick one. On the sustainability deferred spending, that's all process related. That's not waste management making a decision based on where market prices are to delay any of that. It's really just a matter of going through the mechanics of getting the approvals and things like that? Tara Hemmer : Correct. We are full steam ahead, as I mentioned, with that about 40 projects under construction in 2024. That will tell you what you need to know there, we're moving forward. Brian Butler : All right. Great. Thanks again for fitting me in. Tara Hemmer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Your line is open. Kevin Chiang : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one for me. I know this has been tackled quite a bit here. But it does sound like you have a number of - maybe I'll call the idiosyncratic cost containment programs in place, ones that maybe your competitors or smaller peers don't have. When you think longer term about that price over inflation spread and the typical margin expansion you'd want to get. Wouldn't that increase given those idiosyncratic opportunities? Or do you would you price above your own inflation versus, let's say, industry inflation and essentially those savings get, for lack of a better word, maybe competed away as you go to the market? Devina Rankin : I think it's a great question. I think what's most important is that while we compete in the marketplace, we also compete with ourselves and working to continuously improve our business. And so price is one element of how we grow our business and another part of how we grow our business is ensuring that our cost to serve continues to improve over time. We do believe some of those cost improvement items actually translate into top line growth over time as well. And the best example of that is actually in the national accounts business, where WM is completely differentiated itself in the marketplace and therefore, getting outsized growth on the volume line. The other thing that I think is important, and we don't tend to do this, but I want to do a quick comparison our 29.6% margin in the quarter actually compares to our largest competitors at 31.1% because of the impact of the recycling line of business and accretion. And so when we think about how our margins are comparing in the space, we're really proud of the progress we're making. And I think that 31.1% demonstrates the strength of the process improvements that we've been putting in place and the price execution we've had. Kevin Chiang : That\u2019s great color, and actually very, very helpful. Thanks again and congrats on a good quarter there. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schumm from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Jim Schumm : Hi. Thank you and good morning. You talked a lot about price, but you also mentioned that churn is at historical lows. I mean, why not try and push price a little bit more here? What's the - I mean I know you can lose some business, but given that churn is low, why not push price more? John Morris : It's a good question. I think - listen, we - I mentioned it earlier, we're very focused on customer lifetime value. And when you look at the defection rate, coming down. Those are some of our most valuable customers. And I think you're seeing that show up across our customer metrics and in the margin expansion. And as we've talked about a few times, I mean, getting price for price is one thing, but getting it over our cost of inflation and been able to grow the business. And Devina mentioned our national account business being a great example, where we've differentiated shown value and continue to grow the top line there. So. Devina Rankin : On the disposal side of the business, I think it's important to really emphasize some recent success the third quarter was the best ever disposal core price that we've had in our business. And we're pricing new business up 9% on a year-over-year basis in the disposal part of our business. I think it indicates the strength that we're having there. And pricing has typically in this business been on the collection side. And what you're seeing is we're taking that discipline and customer lifetime value approach and extending it all the way through our value chain. John Morris : The last point I'd make on that is a line of business, which is that we've been very focused on in terms of pushing price to get the right margin as residential and core price of 6.9% yield to 6.3%. I think as an example of where we are absolutely pushing price. Jim Fish : But I don't John - its transfer stations. I mean for many, many years, Jim, we never even took a price increase. I mean transfer station pricing was 0.5%. And if you look at our transfer stations pricing, which really is kind of a proxy for landfill, I mean they're - for all intent purposes, they're kind of close in landfills, if you want to think about it in that way. And our transfer stations pricing and the yield number for transfer was 7.1%. And that is a - honestly, it's kind of close to historical highs. I mean we did have an 8.9% in that line of business in Q1. But other than that, it's close to the highest number on my entire period. It goes all the back to 2017. So not saying we can't continue to push price. We absolutely believe we can. We do have to be conscious of that customer lifetime value that John mentioned. Jim Schumm : Got it. Thank you very much. Last one for me. So you made about $370 million of share repurchases, but weren't very active on the M&A front. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about M&A versus share repurchases right now? Jim Fish : Well, yes, let me kind of say this about the M&A market here. First of all, at a time when interest rates are kind of a multi-decade highs and there's a bit of uncertainty about the economic outlook here. I'd rather pay 3 times this $740 million that we've talked a lot about today than get into a process based on kind of rosy forward forecasts and race to the top. And that's kind of what it feels like in some respects in the M&A market today. So it doesn't mean we're not going to be in the M&A market. We will be. And when we're in that market, we're going to very much focus on strong strategic growth opportunities and tuck-in acquisitions. But I just I don't want to get into a competition, particularly based on these kind of future forecasts that may or may not become realistic or achievable. As it compares to the overall capital allocation plan and share repurchase, we've laid out that we had $1.5 billion in authorization. And we've talked about $1.3 billion being the actual number. We look at all kind of aspects of that capital allocation plan. We will continue to evaluate dividends, share repurchase, M&A. Devina has talked about the balance sheet, and she's always done such a great job of keeping that balance sheet in a good place. But most of - if you think about it as M&A dollars, a lot of that has not been technical M&A. It's been these investments that Tara talked a lot about. And those are basically an acquisition that we're paying three times for instead of 12 or 14 times for. Jim Schumm : Right. Right. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you for the answers. Appreciate it. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : Thank you and one moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Yee from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Stephanie Yee : Hi. Good morning. I was just looking at the average yield guide for 2023. I think the expectation was for it to be over 5.5 percentage points. And based on the trend year-to-date, it seems like there should be a big step-up in the fourth quarter. Is that typical seasonality? Or is there anything abnormal with year-over-year comps in this year, implying a big ramp in average yield in the fourth quarter? Devina Rankin : So the way that we're looking at it right now, we actually expect our fourth quarter yield to be pretty well in line with what we produced in Q3 and that would pull the full year to ride at that 5.5% that we had targeted. I would tell you from a conversion of core price to yield perspective, the trend that we saw in Q3, isn't really representative of a long-term trend or revision in the strength that we had seen of converting more of our core price dollars into yield dollars. It's instead mix related and also because of some of the impacts of noise from hurricane Ian that were particularly significant in Q3 and Q4 of 2022 and that's impacting our year-over-year conversions. So, I think the key message here is confidence in our ability to deliver yield for the year of around 5.5%. Stephanie Yee : Okay. Thank you. That is very helpful. And then if I can just go back to the comment about the futures market for RIN pricing and how you're not necessarily pricing at the spot market $3.40 RIN price. Can you just help educate me a little on? Is there an actively traded futures market for RINs? And is maybe waste management leading that development of the futures market? Tara Hemmer : I think what's important to note is this is a market - even in the transportation market that has been evolving pretty quickly as more renewable natural gas is coming online, and as EPA is raising the RVO, and also the fact that they set a three-year RVO, which had never happened before. So this is something that historically there hadn't been a robust market where you could trade forward, and that's certainly evolved and something that we're seeing activity in. Stephanie Yee : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our last question. And our last question from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much. Earlier in the call, you talked about commercial being encouraging. I was hoping you could add any additional color to that. And I know that you don't want to go too much into 2024, but maybe just give some color on, whether - where you're most optimistic, whether it's commercial, resi, industrial, like recovery in any of roll-off. Anything that you're thinking could be better in 2024 versus 2023? Thanks. Jim Fish : Are you anyway just referring specifically to volume there? Toni Kaplan : Yes. Yes. Jim Fish : Okay. Yes. So I guess specific to commercial and that may be the line of business that we have the most - the highest level of optimism. And it's because our national accounts business, where we really feel like we have a differentiated offering there, whether it's through data and analytics reporting or service itself that business has been growing, and it's been growing fairly significantly over the last three years. So as I look at commercial volume, as we said last quarter, a piece of the commercial volume has been a bit of a swap. So we've traded some of that national account, and we have seen a fairly muted small and medium business performance. And the net of the two on the volume line has been slightly positive. So if you ask me to kind of place a bet on a line of business for maybe where we're the most optimistic in 2024. I'd probably put it on commercial or maybe on the landfill line of business itself. I think you're going to continue to see residential be negative, because we continue to kind of pare down some of that unprofitable work. And we just went through our quarterly reviews with our Vice Presidents last week, and there still is some unprofitable work out there that's going to when the contract comes up, we're either going to bid it up or we're going to lose it intentionally. So I wouldn't expect to see volume in resi get back to flat or positive probably for at least a year and roll off is so dependent on the economy, and we just don't have a great view of what the economy is going to look like. We'll know more in three months. But I'd probably put it on commercial as the one where we're most optimistic. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And with that, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Fish, President and CEO for closing remarks. Jim Fish : Okay. Thank you very much. Well, thanks very much for all your questions this morning, really good questions. We appreciate them. We do look forward to talking to you in the interim period and between now and when we report our fourth quarter. And in that period, we have some holidays. So please enjoy your holidays. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

James C. Fish: All right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The WM team delivered a remarkably strong finish to 2023 driving fourth operating EBITDA 15% higher. This accelerated earnings growth led to full-year operating EBITDA that exceeded the high-end of our most recent guidance range by nearly $25 million and achieved the midpoint of our original expectations from the beginning of the year. Our strong financial results for both the quarter and the year were powered by our collection and disposal business. This performance starts with disciplined organic revenue growth that exceeded our expectations. And once again, our success in managing the middle of the P&L really stands out in our results, as our teams continue to make progress in optimizing our cost structure with the help of technology and automation. When you combine our revenue performance with the improvement in operating costs, we saw widening of our price-to-cost spread and increased profitability. Operating EBITDA margin reached a record 29.9% in the fourth quarter and full-year margin expanded 90 basis points 28.9%. As 2024 kicks-off, we're confident that our continued focus on optimizing our cost structure and executing on sustainability growth projects sets us up for another year of outsized growth. We anticipate operating EBITDA growth of 7.7% at the midpoint of our guidance, which translates to more than $450 million of which $115 million comes directly from our sustainability growth investments. We remain excited about the economic and environmental benefits of expanding our renewable natural gas and recycling platforms. Our execution is tracking well and we expect to commission five new renewable natural gas facilities by the end of the year reaching 30% of our run rate renewable natural gas volume growth. We're also on-track to complete automation upgrades at 10 recycling facilities and add three recycling facilities in new markets in 2024. Turning to capital allocation, you'll hear from Devina, on this topic in more detail, but I want to stress our confidence and our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities. This includes investing in our high-return sustainability growth projects, acquiring accretive businesses and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our tuck-in acquisition pipeline is robust, and there are some indications that 2024 could have heightened activity in this regard. We're committed to a disciplined approach to acquiring companies ensuring that any deals we pursue yield appropriate returns particularly given the high-returns in sustainability opportunities. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another great year. We were just at the WM Phoenix Open last week and I've said before, we work hard for this event to create a representation of the bigger company with a central focus on people and the environment. We've been the title sponsor for 15 years now and the tournament's been recognized as the largest zero waste sporting event in the world for 12 years running. It makes me proud to see the WM team out there making waste diversion operations run smoothly and demonstrating our sustainability leadership so well. I look forward to working with this great team in 2024 as we continue to drive growth by executing our operating plans and progressing our investments in technology, automation and sustainability. I'll now turn the call over to John, to discuss our operational results. John J. Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We're more than pleased with the strong operational performance our team achieved in 2023 showing continuous improvement throughout the year with standout results in the fourth quarter. During this period, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 240 basis points year-over-year landing at 60.3% and marking our second best quarterly performance ever. This improvement was primarily fueled by our collection and disposal business benefiting from the robust operating leverage of our strategic cost optimization. Our proactive measures to accelerate and improve cost efficiency included leveraging technology to manage labor, managing repair and maintenance costs and optimizing our overall cost structure. These initiatives led to a substantial improvement in WM's cost to serve metrics, bringing estimated unit cost inflation to low-single-digits by the fourth quarter. When combined with solid results from our pricing initiatives, we greatly enhanced overall margins. Our strong second half performance translated into full-year operating expenses as a percentage of revenue of 61.7%, an improvement of 70 basis points. That momentum has carried into 2024 and is evident in our January results even as we face severe weather in some areas we serve. Two of the key cost categories driving our operating improvements are labor and repair and maintenance. On the labor front, this begins with our persistent focus on reducing turnover. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a noteworthy milestone as driver turnover reaches lowest point at 18.4%, showing improvement as the year progressed. Additionally, our strategic automation initiatives are yielding positive results in collection efficiency with all three lines of business improving meaningfully in the fourth quarter compared to last year. The results of our technology and automation investments gained traction in the latter part of 2023, leading to significant strides in labor cost management. We expect this to continue into 2024 as we broaden the deployment of our tools across additional sites. Turning to repair and maintenance, with a full lot of trucks received in 2023, we successfully removed over a 1,000 excess assets from our operation, improve the age of our routed fleet and reduce truck rental utilization by nearly 60% since the beginning of 2023. Throughout 2023, our emphasis remained on streamlining maintenance processes, which has resulted in enhanced technician productivity, reduced overtime expenses and diminished reliance on external repair services. This is paid off in the form of lower repair and maintenance costs in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. We accomplished all this with an unwavering commitment to safety and by enhancing the quality of our fleet. We're proud of the strides we made throughout 2023 and look forward to sustained progress. Another core element of the equation that fueled our strong financial results is disciplined organic revenue growth. Growth from price and volume in the collection and disposal business totaled 6.3% for the year, which outpaced our expectations. Our pricing programs continue to be focused on striking the right balance between maximizing customer lifetime value and increasing price to recover higher costs. Our full-year churn rates remain at the lower-end of historical range at about 9% and the year-over-year improvement underscores our consistent delivery of quality service to our customers. Looking ahead to 2024, we anticipate sustained momentum in our disciplined pricing programs to result in core price between 6% and 6.5% and yield approaching 5%. We remain committed to maximizing customer lifetime value up while securing pricing that exceeds our cost inflation. We've seen that spread improve as 2023 progressed and we are confident that our teams are poised to deliver another successful year ahead. Turning to volumes, our fourth quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 1.9% on a workday adjusted basis. Growth was primarily driven by MSW landfill and commercial collection, two bellwethers for demand of our services. Overall growth in landfill volumes was somewhat muted due to the elevated volumes from the Hurricane Ian clean up in 2022. Some of the recent quarters, residential collection volumes declined modestly due to our intentional shedding of low margin contracts as we work to ensure that we achieved acceptable returns for all parts of our business. You can see the benefits of this focus because while our residential collection volumes declined, total revenue and earnings in this line of business both improved. This is a winning equation and we'll continue to execute on the strategy in the year ahead. Organic revenue growth in all collection lines of business remains as positive and operating EBITDA continues to grow. In the fourth quarter, new business grew and net services increases remain firmly positive reflecting our quality of service and focused differentiation. Looking ahead to 2024, our guidance anticipates collection and disposal volume approaching 1%, mirroring the performance achieved in 2023. And finally, I want to convey my appreciation to our frontline teams for their unwavering commitment to delivering safe and reliable service to our customers and communities on a daily basis. It's their efforts that made 2023 successful and laid the groundwork for growth in the years ahead. I will now turn the call over to Devina, to discuss our 2023 financial results and 2024 financial outlook in greater detail. Devina A. Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. Cost optimization was a significant theme in the fourth quarter and throughout 2023. Our team was pleased that our collective focus delivered WM's best ever full-year SG&A as a percentage of revenue of 9.4%. The 20 basis point improvement from prior year was realized through investments in customer facing technology, leveraging enhanced back office systems to become more efficient and a continuous focus on optimizing our spend. We're pleased with the progress made to improve this measure, while at the same time investing in our talent, customer engagement channels and technology capabilities. SG&A optimization delivered 20 basis points of our 90 basis point expansion and adjusted operating EBITDA margin in 2023. The remaining 70 basis points was from the collection and disposal business, which benefited from a combination of fuel price impacts and operating efficiencies. We gained meaningful traction in optimizing labor efficiency and repair and maintenance costs in our collection disposal business in the back half of the year, lifting our full-year adjusted operating EBITDA margin to 28.9%. This result is 30 basis points ahead of the high-end of our expectations and positions us to continue to deliver margin expansion in the year ahead. Our operating performance translated into robust cash flow in 2023. Our full-year cash flow from operations grew to $4.719 billion and our free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was nearly $2.7 billion. Each of these cash flow measures finished the year near the high-end of our initial guidance range. This result demonstrates our strong earnings growth, effective management of interest and taxes and optimizing cash conversion and our disciplined capital expenditure management processes. During 2023, we returned $2.44 billion to shareholders, paying $1.14 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.3 billion of our stock. In addition, we spent $173 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business. We accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability growth investments for future growth and development and maintaining our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75 times. Our balance sheet remains strong and our earnings and cash flow growth are robust, positioning us to continue our commitment to shareholder returns and long-term growth. Moving to our 2024 financial outlook, we're anticipating total company revenue growth between 6% and 7%, driven by organic growth in the collection and disposal business approaching 6%. Operating EBITDA is expected to grow by $450 million at the midpoint of our outlook. When we think about the cadence of our growth over the course of the year, we're expecting collection and disposal growth to be weighted more to the front half of the year, given the momentum we've gained from strong operating efficiencies in back half of 2023. And we're expecting sustainability business growth to be more significantly weighted to the back half of the year as our new recycling and renewable natural gas projects come online. Altogether, we expect this to result in a relatively balanced operating EBITDA growth over the course of the year. We expect capital spending to support the business for the year to total $2.25 billion of midpoint and we expect to invest another $875 million on our high-return sustainability growth projects. Free cash flow before these sustainability investments is anticipated to grow almost 7% at the midpoint to $2.85 billion. We remain committed to investing in an industry leading network of renewable energy and recycling assets, including renewable natural gas projects through recycling automation and new markets and advancements in resource recovery. Our sustainability growth investment strategy is progressing well. So, as you would expect, there have been a number of refinements to the plan since its inception. We've worked our way through customary changes to project schedules and impacts from inflation, all the while delivering completed projects that meet and sometimes exceed the environmental and economic objectives we planned. These successes have positioned us to grow the sustainability project pipeline. In particular, our refreshed outlook includes two new recycling projects in Canada that WM has awarded through a competitive process. We now expect growth investments across our recycling and renewable energy platforms to total between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion from 2022 through 2026. We expect these projects to contribute run rate adjusted operating EBITDA of about $800 million by the end of 2026. This outlook utilizes the same pricing assumptions we've used consistently, a $125 per ton for recycled commodities and $26 per MMBtu for renewable natural gas. We have a great deal of confidence in the value of the projects that are underway and we're enthusiastic about the strong complement they provide to our existing business. In conclusion, 2023 has clearly illustrated that we are driving growth through our diligent focus on optimizing our business, investing in technology and automation, and growing our leadership and sustainability. We take pride in our accomplishments and look forward to what we can achieve together in 2024. A heartfelt thank you to our dedicated team members who have been instrumental to our success. With that, Josh, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. You may proceed. Noah Kaye : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one maybe for, John. You talked in some good details about some of the cost optimization and productivity efforts and the gains they got this year. Can you step back and kind of remind us and perhaps, Jim, as well where we are at in kind of the broader march towards automation and productivity investments and some of the key KPIs that we should be thinking about in terms of progress for 2024? John J. Morris: Yes. Noah, good morning. It's a good question. Originally, we started talking about just in terms of the elimination of some labor dependency in the 5,000 to 7,000 job range. And it was across a handful of pretty broad areas. One, was the customer experience group. One, was through our routing, which would reduce our dependency on kind of frontline driver labor and obviously then recycling a little bit on SG&A. And what I would tell you is, you think about this way, we're about 75% through what we had planned for the customer experience side on the resi automation and this has as much truck deliveries, which did improve in 2023, we\u2019re about 40% of the way through there. On the recycling side, as Jim mentioned in his remarks, we've got a number of plants are going to be automated this year, kind of Jim, can comment more on that, we're about 20% of the way through there. So, I would tell you we're making great progress. I think it showed up obviously across the board in our margins and specifically in labor in Q4 and as the year progressed, but we still got plenty of opportunity out there. We feel like we're on a good pace. Noah Kaye : Very helpful. Just trying to think about cadence on EBITDA margins for the year. I know we have the typical seasonality and it sounds like the front half of the year, the growth is really a story of kind of the collection and disposal side. But Devina, are there any sort of guide post you can give us in terms of thinking about margin cadence, either for the first quarter or for the first half? Devina A. Rankin: Yes, I think it's a great question, Noah. And similar to what we talked about in terms of the EBITDA dollar growth, the cadence, sorry, for margin is pretty similar. We expect margin expansion to be more heavily weighted towards the front half of the year particularly in the collection and disposal business, the SG&A margin expansion will be fairly even over 2024. But then with regard to the sustainability businesses, the commodity price benefits that we expect to see in 2024 aren't quite significant, right. They're pretty muted on a year-over-year basis. But as a reminder, commodity price expansion in the recycling line of business can have some margin compression because of the really high return on invested capital part of our brokerage business. And, on the renewable natural gas part of the business, we expect margin expansion there too because those are such great margin projects, but those will be heavily weighted toward the back half. So, from a margin perspective, while the collection and disposal business is definitely the thing that delivered in Q4, we do expect that to be the thing that lifts margin most significantly in the year ahead and that will be weighted toward the first half of the year. Noah Kaye : Great. Kind of a lot of other questions to take offline, but I'll yield my time in consideration of others. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. You may proceed. Bryan Burgmeier : Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Guidance seems to imply collection and disposal yields growth that you saw in 4Q 2023 will be essentially flat throughout \u201824 kind of around 5%. So, can you just help us kind of understand that, that pricing strength, it was a bit better than what we are forecasting, is it about better restricted pricing starting to flow through, would you attribute that to maybe mix, underlying strength in the market? Just anything you'd kind of call out, on that really sticky pricing that it looks like we're going to see in \u201824? James C. Fish: Yes, Bryan, a couple of standouts really were continues to be residential pricing and disposal pricing, those actually showed increases year-over-year. Not surprisingly, the other collection lines of business were down, but that wasn't unexpected. As we move into \u201824, we think that kind of 4.5% to 5% yield number is a good target for us. And pricing continues to be a strength. We said at the beginning of \u201823 that our focus areas for the year would be pricing and then the cost controls that, John, went through. So, pricing is going to continue to at least add a little bit of margin for us. We think as opposed to \u201822 where we I've said several times we kind of felt like we were in hand-to-hand combat with our cost structure. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Thanks for that detail. Yes, last question for me and then I can turn it over. I know in 2023, there was a small decline in the event driven business that kind of prompted a guidance revision mid-year. I'm just wondering does \u201824 guidance assume that comes back? And then if there's anything else you'd like to flag on the event driven book that would be helpful? I'll turn it over. Thank you. Devina A. Rankin: Yes, it's a great question. And your recollection of our outlook revision mid-year is spot on with regard to some of the softness we were seeing in the special waste part of the business. And, we saw a strong recovery of that in the fourth quarter, which is one of the reasons that we saw revenue exceed our expectations late in the year. We're not necessarily expecting a rebound of special waste volumes in the year ahead, but we are expecting some of this momentum that we saw in Q4 to carry over, but nothing outsized. The one thing that I would call out as a reminder with regard to some of the special project type work is 2023 did have a benefit from Hurricane Ian volumes particularly in the first quarter, and so that certainly will have an impact on the Q1 comparisons in 2024. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Devina A. Rankin: Good morning. Jerry Revich : Devina, I wonder if you could just talk about margins, really outstanding performance by the team in the fourth quarter, if we were to just run the seasonally adjusted annual rate, that's about over 30% margin equivalent that you folks put up in the fourth quarter, the full-year guidance for \u201824 is about a point lower than that. It sounds like yield is still very much at a good place. So, I'm just trying to make sure that there are no items that you would view as one-off in the fourth quarter versus, hey, it's early in the year and we just want to make sure we have room to execute? Devina A. Rankin: I definitely think the way that you summarized it there on the last part of your comment is the way that we're thinking about this, in particular when we were setting our margin expectations for the year ahead, the momentum that we have in the fourth quarter shows that we have tremendous confidence in having the cost improvement work that we've been so focused on as an organization through automation technology, and importantly, the delivery of trucks as something that we can continue to see benefits from in the year ahead. The caution for us, I would say that may have us below that seasonally adjusted margin outlook that you've done. It really relates to a couple of things. It's one, some of the weather impacts that we saw in January. Two, last year when we gave inflation outlook, we tended to see that inflation was sticking around and being more stubborn than we had predicted and so we're taking a more cautious view on inflationary pressures in the year ahead than we did a year ago. But really what I want to highlight is that, there's tremendous confidence in the fundamentals. The price cost spread has improved. The accelerated truck deliveries and our optimization efforts and the discipline in SG&A are all showing strong results. I think the best line to look at is actually our repair and maintenance line and the operating expense as a percentage of revenue category. And, over the long-term that had trended below 9% of revenue for us and through the first nine months of 2023, we were at 9.9%. That measure was down to 9.1% in Q4. So, we know that we've got some really strong momentum coming into the year ahead that will continue those cost benefits that you saw us produce in the fourth quarter. Into 2024, we just think that it's prudent to be on the conservative side when predicting full-year margin. James C. Fish: So, Jerry, real quickly, we did kind of anticipate that there will be some questions on margin. And so, just a couple of things here. First of all, the margin obviously for Q4 was as strong as we could have expected it and to be and that has continued as we look at the month of January. January came in quite strong for us, so we're pleased with that. The second point would be around some of the questions that you're asking around conservatism on margin for \u201824 and Devina did a really good job of explaining that. I think it's really just I guess you could argue that it's conservative based on 90 basis points of improvement from 2022 to 2023. But there seems to be an uncertain year in front of us every time we come to this point. We don't know exactly what the economy is going to do. Some days I feel great about the economy, other day is not so great. So, you could argue there's a little bit of economic conservatism in there and also a little bit of forecasting conservatism coming off such a strong year that you want to try and say we're going to do the same thing going forward into \u201824. But we do feel really good about the way we finished the year and honestly the way we've started the year so far through January. Jerry Revich : Really appreciate the color. And Jim, can I ask you just on a separate topic, landfill gas transactions are coming in at really attractive levels? The Enbridge transaction was $2.70 per MMBtu. It's costing you folks $50 per MMBtu to bring your assets online. So, just given how apparently deep the market is for those type of assets, can you just update us on how are you thinking about what it would take for you to consider monetizing some of the landfill gas assets when you bring them online? Has the attractive market price impacted how you're thinking about the own versus sell opportunity? James C. Fish: So, I'm going I'll say one word on that and then I'm going to turn it over to Tara Hemmer to maybe give a little bit more color. But, that's always an option for us. And we have multiple options and it's good to be in a place where you have multiple options. But at this point, we're pleased with the progress we're making on building these plants. We have a number of plants that are at various stages of construction. Tara, anything to add to that? Tara J. Hemmer: I would just say this aligns really well with our business and we're making great progress on building out these plans. The five that we're going to bring online in 2024, we're going to have strong contribution from them exiting 2024 and this is going to be something we're going to continue to grow. Jerry Revich : Appreciate the discussion. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. You may proceed. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning. Devina A. Rankin: Good morning. Tyler Brown : Hey, Tara, actually, I want to come back to the updated sustainability CapEx figures of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. So, I may have missed it, but if I'm not mistaken that number was closer to $2.2 billion back at the Analyst Day. Now, I get that there are $350 million in incremental recycling opportunities, but what makes up the difference, call it that $300 million. Was that just inflation? Tara J. Hemmer: Yes, the difference really is related to inflation, primarily in our renewable natural gas build and relates to inflation related supply chain, also a little bit on construction increases and interconnects. So, that is the difference. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. That's helpful. That's very helpful. And then, Devina, thank you so much for the WM renewables segment reporting. But, I do just want to make sure that I understand it all. So, I get the impact in revenues from the change in the price of the commodities that are impacting that WM renewables and recycling line, but if you look at the change in that line versus the change in the net revenue for those, they don't exactly line up. So, it tells me that there's likely some volume component in there. So just to be clear, maybe this would be helpful, but when you bring on a facility like Eco Vista, where does that show up? Does that show up as basically volume in your IRG calc, or can you just help us with how the accounting will work? Devina A. Rankin: Sure. And Ed and Heather will be happy to walk you through any details I don't cover here. But, I'm glad, one, that the additional clarity is beneficial. The other that I would say is that on the IRG measures that we do, the internal revenue growth measures that we do, you'll see commodity price impact in a single line, which is recycling processes and renewable energy, so that's all price. And then you'll see the incremental volume from new projects, whether it be automation projects that have more throughput at the plant or the new Eco Vista plant that will be in the volume line. In terms of the segment reporting line, the only thing that might be a little bit of a complicating factor is the internal revenue between the renewables business and the collection and disposal business, you can think of it as the renewables business paying a royalty to the collection and disposal business associated with the landfill gas production that doesn't show up in the revenue line, because it's effectively just a cost for the renewables business. Hopefully that's helpful. Tyler Brown : Okay. Yes, I definitely think so. We'll parse it out. But I think you mentioned the collection and disposal volume could be up maybe 1%. But again kind of going back to that total IRG table, could we actually see that number closer to 2%? Because I would assume that with $115 million of incremental renewables EBITDA, there's probably at least a couple of $100 million of revenue associated with that, does that make sense? Devina A. Rankin: So, the way to think about this is that when we gave that volume outlook that was just the collection and disposal volume. The renewable energy business increases. We have on a combined basis being in the range of 30 basis points to 60 basis points in the year ahead. And, that's a combination of commodity price impacts and volume. Tyler Brown : Excellent. Okay. Last one here, Devina. So, margins were super strong. We've talked about that. I think they're up 230 basis points year-over-year in Q4. But can you kind of help us bridge that 230? I think there was a fewer day, maybe fuel was a help, maybe commodities help, just any color there would be appreciated. Thanks. Devina A. Rankin: Yes, for Q4 specifically, again, the collection and disposal business and the efficiency that we drove was the lion's share of that improvement at 220 basis points. Fuel was another 50 basis points. So, that really does explain almost the entirety of it. There are a few other puts and takes, but I would say that my comments earlier about repair and maintenance and then John's comments about the labor line, those are the two places that are driving that 220 basis points of margin expansion. James C. Fish: I think Tyler, a little bit of an add on here is that I've been told we don't pat ourselves on the back enough, so I'm going to pat ourselves on the back a little bit here. When we started talking about some aspirational metrics, meaning margin, EBITDA margin, SG&A as percent of revenue, OpEx as percent a couple of years ago and then talking about technology and using attrition to reduce our labor dependence. Those numbers were pretty far out on the horizon. And, now in every case those numbers are literally a stone's throw away for us. Whether you talk about 30% EBITDA margin, we're right there for the fourth quarter, SG&A at 9%, we're very close to that and OpEx at 60%, very close to that. So, I'm really proud of the team for executing so well on this and being able to stand up on this call today and last quarter as well and say those things that we put out there, those goals that we set, we're getting close to achieving those. That means we're satisfied. We'll continue to set higher goals, but I'm pleased with the fact that we've been able to get to those goals that were pretty far in the out on the horizon we initially set them. Tyler Brown : Yes. No, love it. Appreciate it so much. Thank you for the time. James C. Fish: You bet. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. You may proceed. Michael Hoffman : Hey, gang. Thanks for the questions. Back to the margin question, John, it seems like looking at this on a two-year stack helps because you can't perfectly time when you get some of your self-help. And that sort of accounts for really strong \u201823, a little more muted \u201824, but the two-year stack is sort of 60 basis points a year. So, where the question underlying that is, recycling is an incremental tailwind because you've got a pretty low estimate there relative to how you finished the year on the basket. GDP, I'm assuming you think it's maybe 1%, 1.5% and the trend is stronger than that. So, that's a tailwind. And then I think your wage growth is probably running closer to 3.5%, 4%, therefore, there's clear spread on price cost. Am I looking at that correctly? John J. Morris: I'll start, Devina. I think on the cost spread comment to you, Michael, I think that's what we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters whether you look at core price or our yield numbers. We've been talking about being disciplined in the way we approach pricing and over time in the last couple of quarters, we've been a great example that we've been able to really drive out, drive some operating efficiencies and drive out some of the labor dependency and Devina commented on the maintenance repair. That's another bucket where we've made a lot of progress. I think in Q4 we were flat to slightly down year-over-year in terms of whole dollars. So, that's part of what was helping us in Q4. Devina A. Rankin: And then I'll just add a little bit of color that provide some clarity on a couple of the points that you brought up, Michael. One, with higher recycling commodity prices, the brokerage business can actually put downward pressure on margin. And so that's one of the things that we have built into our outlook for 2024. And then, in terms of wage inflation, we start at 4% with our folks. And so, wage inflation is still expected to be north of 4% when you take into account spot increases that we have to provide in certain markets to be responsive to various changes. So, 4% is kind of our baseline, and then you add on top of that. Michael Hoffman : And your GDP assumption is pretty muted? Devina A. Rankin: Yes. Basically, what we've always said is that we believe that our volume is about a 75% flow through from GDP. And so, we did have a fairly muted outlook with regard to GDP when we built our plan. I hope your crystal ball is better than mine, but I would tell you that our expectations for economic outlook continue to be that we need to be on the cautious side of things just because there's so much left in uncertainty, you saw that with today's print on CPI as an example, which exceeded expectations. Michael Hoffman : Yes, I get that. It's just the consumer seems to keep plowing ahead. Switching gears a little bit, Tara, if your renewable natural gas or landfill gas is kind of a Swiss army knife of renewable fuel, when do the federal agencies wake up to this and say we get a proper interpretation of the ITC or the 45Q or Z credits or come back to e-RINs. What's your view of where that goes? And then the second piece is, what are you assuming happens out in the out years in that $1.5 billion of RNG spend, how much do you get back for credits? Tara J. Hemmer: So, starting with the real positive, the one thing that the federal government did is, said a three-year RVO and having that for 2023 through 2025, you've seen clear stability in the program and so that's been a positive. With the ITC, we think when Treasury issued their guidance that there was a misinterpretation over what was in the Inflation Reduction Act and we don't just share this view, others do with us that are in the biogas community and generate landfill gas renewable energy from landfill gas. We've commented on that and we're anticipating that Treasury will come out with some further guidance later this year and so cautiously optimistic there. So, there's a whole host of credits that could be stacked. Obviously, the ITC was within our plan and we remain optimistic related to that and of course looking to 2025 with the production tax credit too. Devina A. Rankin: On the ITC point, Michael, just so that we're crystal clear in terms of the implications of that on our 2024 guidance. We contemplated $120 million of ITC benefit in our free cash flow outlook for the year. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then some housekeeping if we could. I love the segment reporting as well. Are we going to get any kind of tons-in, tons-out so we can actually do a bottoms up forecast on sales for the renewable and processing segment, and then how about megawatts and MMBtus to be able to do the same thing on a sales growth for renewables? Devina A. Rankin: So, we want to take a breath and celebrate, all of the incremental transparency we've provided. We're really proud of the work that the team did because, while it looks easy, it isn't. There's a whole lot of work that went into it. With regard to the more, I would say, operational driver elements of the reporting, we'll continue to evaluate whether or not there's anything that it's a strong complement to the financial measures and consider any additions in the years ahead. But right now, we're going to continue to execute on this strong reporting that we've been able to accomplish. And, we actually would like to see the industry follow suit in terms of providing additional visibility because we think it's beneficial. Michael Hoffman : So in the K, one, when will it be recent? Two, will we get quarterly data for all of \u201822 and all of \u201823 and then three years of forecast so we can we build our models in this format? Devina A. Rankin: So, the K will be released early today and we're in good shape for that. So, thank you to the team. With regard to the quarterly data, you'll get that over the course of the year. It'll have the full-year data. The quarterly recast will come quarter-by-quarter. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. You may proceed. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Devina A. Rankin: Good morning. Stephanie Moore : So, just kind of just looking at the 2024 guidance assumption, it looks like you're assuming RINs at about $3 which makes sense given where RINs are today, but digging into a little bit more, can you maybe talk about in terms of what contracts that you have already signed and kind of where you're able to lock in those prices going into the year? I think you said a sustainability day that you were looking to have 70% to 90% locked in any given 12-month period. So, any update on where that stands for 2024 to get to that $3 RIN? Thank you. Tara J. Hemmer: Sure. So we have about two-thirds of our off-take locked in for 2024. And when we think about what's locked in, it is a mix of long-term contracts and also RINs that we purchased really sold on the forward side into 2024 which would have been at a higher rate than $3. So, on a blended basis, you sort of get a lower average there. And then the third that we would be selling in 2024 that's what's at the $3 RIN guide. The other thing I want to just mention is those longer term contracts that we have in place, there is a mix anywhere from five to 20 years, so we're really trying to take an approach where we have different tenors that we're locked in at. Stephanie Moore : Got it. No, that's very helpful. And then maybe sticking on the sustainability front, you talked about some incremental investments included in your updated outlook and you noticed that that involves two projects in Canada. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity? I'm assuming that those are probably related to EPR changes in Canada. If that is the correct assumption, maybe just what how EPR might change the margin or growth opportunity compared to maybe your more traditional U.S. recycling business, so how are you thinking about those incremental opportunities? Thanks. Tara J. Hemmer: The two Canadian projects are related to extended producer responsibility and I think this is a great example where we were able to really showcase our automation investments and how differentiated our assets are really taking the pro to some of the facilities that we have across the United States. And so, that's a great example where we're able to win more business based on those investments. Extended producer responsibility in Canada and the structure that we have there, it really is around us using those assets as manufacturing plants and really it's a fee for service model. So, it's a great example of how we can leverage this technology differentiation for more business in the future. Stephanie Moore : Understood. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. John Mazzoni : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick one in terms of the sustainability EBITDA timing. Is this just really kind of a knock on impact of some of the 2023 project delays, I think we noticed change to run rate versus kind of in \u201826, any color would be appreciated? Thank you. Devina A. Rankin: So there's two key things that I would want everyone to bear in mind as you think about our trajectory. The first is in 2024, we're going to have roughly 40 projects under construction at any given time. So, that really gives you a sense of how we're building and we have a lot of momentum in the ramp. The second key piece is really exiting 2024, we're going to be approaching roughly $300 million in run rate EBITDA which gives you a sense of where we're headed on that ramp to the $800 million. So, what we're really seeing in 2024 is a true build of momentum on reaching that $800 million target. James C. Fish: And John, those supply chain constraints are not that different from what we've seen on the fleet side of our business either. The good news is that as you heard, John Morris, talk about it, we started to see that free up a bit and so Tara seeing the same thing on the RNG and recycling side, but we definitely had some supply chain constraints that contributed to this bit of a slowdown over 2022 in particular, but also the front half of 2023. John Mazzoni : Great color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. You may proceed. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. Wanted to get your sense for acquisition expectations. So, how are the favorable trends in your business, which is a pretty long list of price, cost, yield, new investment production, etcetera, different than those at the smaller players with whom you have a dialogue for acquisitions. James C. Fish: So, look, we said that our acquisition pipeline was robust. I think what you're seeing is that some of those, and I'm speaking just from this is somewhat anecdotal and speaking to some of those folks that we have acquired, is that, there's kind of a multitude of challenges for them, some of which we face and some of which we don't face. So, one that we might not face is a lack of a succession plan for some of these folks. Their kids have just decided they don't want to run the business. They'd rather go take the money and live in Italy. And so, that's not something we face fortunately, but they're also having challenges with labor. We're addressing that as you've heard today through automation and in some cases they are as well, in some cases they're not able to do that. So, there's a number of different reasons why there's a growing list of willing sellers. We're going to take advantage of that. But at the same time, we've invested heavily in these organic growth projects, and we want to make sure that we have similar returns before we go invest heavily in tuck-ins. Tobey Sommer : Good to hear. I'm glad you're not going to go chase the [trust and sun] (ph). So, appreciate that. With respect to the fleet, after a full allotment last year, where are you in terms of being able to just renew the fleet at what might be considered a normal cadence? Do you still have some catch up to do? James C. Fish: Yes. Tobey, we got about, we've delivered about 1,700 units this year, which was a little light of what we had planned for, but that would be really considered a full lot. And we probably have another 300 units on top of that to deliver. So, I would say that by the end of \u201824, we're fully caught up. What I would tell you is, team has done a really good job of not compromising the quality of our fleet had shown up in our service and it's really starting to show up in the back half of the year in terms of our operating performance and we see that continuing into \u201824, and certainly as we get the benefit of some additional vehicles. Tobey Sommer : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. You may proceed. Kevin Chiang : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a clarification on the updated sustainability investments and EBITDA profile as we look up to 2026, I think if I, if memory serves me correct, when you had the Sustainability Investor Day, I think you had about a 90% free cash flow conversion in 2026 from EBITDA into free cash flow. Is that still the rule of thumb we should be thinking about on the $800 million of EBITDA in 2026 in terms of the free cash flow potential from these investments? Devina A. Rankin: We can specifically confirm that number for you. We didn't refresh that. Kevin Chiang : Okay. Devina A. Rankin: But the key takeaway for us there, whether it's 70% or 90%, and that's kind of the zip code that I think we should be thinking about. The free cash flow conversion in these businesses is stronger because, the maintenance capital is lower. And so, it is right to think about that being a really strong fundamental contributing factor to the long-term yield of this business. Kevin Chiang : That makes a ton of sense. And just on the, I guess on the two facilities in Canada related to EPR, are these in Ontario? And just as you think of, I guess, EPR throughout the country as multiple provinces look to implement this, just what that pipeline of opportunity looks like from an EPR perspective and investing in more cycling facilities, I guess, coast-to-coast in Canada? Tara J. Hemmer: You're exactly right. Those two are in Ontario and this is something that we're actively tracking throughout Canada and then of course looking at where there is pending legislation in the United States as well. There's obviously Colorado as an example, which is on the front and making sure that we're well-positioned to respond to the PROs when they eventually implement. Kevin Chiang : Excellent. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from James Schumm with TD Cowen. You may proceed. James Schumm : Hey, good morning. Can you help me understand the monetization of the D-3 RINs credits? Is there a meaningful difference in price if you internalize or use the RNG in your own fleet versus selling it as a transportation fuel to someone else? And I know you'll reduce your fuel cost and emissions if you internalize the RNG, but just curious if there's a monetization benefit as well? Tara J. Hemmer: The way to think about it and what is really unique about WM, is because we have our own fleet of compressed natural gas vehicles. We're in a very unique spot where we are able to close the loop. We produce renewable natural gas. We can allocate that renewable natural gas to our fleet to generate the RIN, so we don't have to give up any of our RIN value. That's probably the most significant advantage with WM as compared to others in the space. And that's how we monetize and create RINs ourselves versus others having to really tie it to someone else's fleet. James Schumm : So Tara, just to clarify that, so when we see the D-3 RINs prices, I mean, I think some people have talked about, well, the actual monetization is a little bit lower than the price that I maybe see on the screen. Is that the case for you guys as well or no? Tara J. Hemmer: No. I think -- James Schumm : Do you get that full value? Tara J. Hemmer: I think we get the full value and the other thing to bear in mind is, you're looking at spot prices. And while we do play in the spot market, we also have been very actively looking at how we can forward sell and really look at selling our RINs six months out, a year out. So, there's a balance there. James Schumm : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just lastly for me, I know that hazardous waste is a relatively small business for you, but I think you guys have a substantial market share of the hazardous landfills. The industry seems to be more profitable now and I was just hoping maybe you could help us quantify your business here and what's the outlook? James C. Fish: Yes. I mean, we've been in hazardous waste space for quite some time and it continues to be a valuable component of our portfolio. And we've got coverage nationally. We've got assets on the East Coast and then obviously to the South East and on the West Coast as well. And, I would tell you, we continue to look for opportunities to grow that business. I think one of the benefits we have is, we've got a tremendous network of transportation assets that allows us to access a lot of the prominent markets, I think the Southeast, the Gulf Coast is one where we are very, very well-positioned, in terms of our hazardous waste presence. James Schumm : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess I'll start just on the price cost spread that you kind of alluded to in your opening remarks. You indicated that it improved and certainly that spread when costs were rising dramatically in 2022, it kind of contracted and then as costs moderated somewhat and your pricing held in, presumably it's been widening here in 2023 or back in 2023. My question for you is what your view is on the go-forward of that spread, is that something that you believe you can maintain at a higher level than it's been historically? Or is 2023 just bringing it back to where it was historically and that's likely where it's going to be going forward? James C. Fish: Well, I think you've hit on the right focal point for us which is that price cost spread as opposed to just looking at price because obviously, in \u201822, price was higher. But as I said, we were really just combating this real high inflation in \u201822. \u201823 was as you said back to a point where the price cost spread starts to widen a bit. And so how much that widens is a little bit of a question mark. We don't know exactly where inflation goes. This morning's numbers were maybe a little disappointing to the market. But we feel good about the wage inflation. We feel like that is much more kind of something we have control of now, whereas two years ago, we really had less control over it. I think you'll see the price cost spread stay pretty close to where it's been in 2023. 2024 won't be a big change from that standpoint. Walter Spracklin : Okay, perfect. And when, I know with your sustainability initiatives, it does introduce a little bit of commodity price variability in there. When you look at the midpoint of your EBITDA guidance for \u201824 and you look at the growth in the dollar value of that, about a quarter of that I think is from sustainability initiatives of that growth. And some of those as you mentioned are back-end weighted. Can you talk to us from a risk standpoint as it relates to two, first, when an investor asks you what about the volatility that commodity prices brings in? Can you remind us about, how you lock in price and give us some assurances there? And then the second part of the risk profile, how much of it is related to permitting or completion of construction projects that might get delayed through the course of the year, how do you feel about that risk component to its contribution in 2024? Tara J. Hemmer: I can go ahead and take it in two parts and I'll speak to the commodity price piece first and then the timeline second. So, on the commodity price piece for recycling, I think one of the things that we've done really well is really change our model to be a fee-for-service model and we have 95% of our contracts through that, which is really insulated us a bit on the commodity side. And then on top of that, recall that a significant piece of the benefit is coming independent of commodity prices, really those labor cost improvements and also some price premiums that we get related to the automation benefit. On the renewable energy side, one of the things that we've been clear on is that we're going to work towards an 80-40-20 framework where 80% of our volume would be locked up within one year, and that would be something that we would be working towards in 2026. You heard me mention roughly a third of our off-take is already locked up. So, that gives us some confidence on the commodity price side. Related to projects, we've really been kicking this around, looking at our project timelines and making sure that we're within a strong and confident range for 2024. We have two large projects that are coming online in Q3 and so feel confident in our ability to hit the project timelines on both the recycling and renewable energy side. Walter Spracklin : Okay, that's great. Really appreciate that color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Hilary Lee : Hi, this is Hilary Lee on for Toni Kaplan. Just wanted to ask on the sustainability EBITDA part, so if I recall correctly during the Sustainability Analyst Day, we were expecting around $600 million from RNG including the third-party e-RINs by 2026. So just wondering what is kind of that delta between the now [$510 million] (ph) versus the $600 million? Tara J. Hemmer: I think you have to compare the $510 million to the $500 million, because the $500 million number was without the e-RINs and the third-party RNG projects. So, the best way to think about it is we've increased our target by $10 million for the renewable natural gas business. Hilary Lee : Got it. Appreciate it. And just on for the recycling, the increase in the is that for essentially the two new projects in Canada? Tara J. Hemmer: A portion of it is from the two new projects in Canada and then a mix of other benefits from our portfolio projects. Hilary Lee : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Fish for any closing remarks. James C. Fish: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us. We're very proud of the quarter we had, very proud of the year, excited about what 2024 holds for us, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Ed Egl, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Edward Egl : Thank you, Towanda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You'll hear prepared comments from each of them today. Jim will cover high-level financials and provide a strategic update. John will cover an operating overview, and Devina will cover the details of the financials. Before we get started, please note that we filed a Form 8-K that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules of the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless stated otherwise, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the prior year period. Net income, EPS, income from operations and margin, operating EBITDA and margin, and prior period operating expense results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. Additionally, projected future operating EBITDA and margin is anticipated to be adjusted to exclude such items that are not currently determinable but may be significant. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release and tables, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections.

James Fish : All right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The WM team delivered another quarter of strong financial results to start 2024, powered by outstanding operational performance in the collection and disposal business. Total company operating EBITDA grew nearly 15% in the first quarter, and margin expanded 240 basis points, driven by substantial momentum on cost optimization efforts and disciplined execution on our pricing programs. Last quarter, we said the areas of strength in 2024 would look very similar to those of 2023, and that was definitely the case in Q1. Continued traction on cost optimization led to our third consecutive quarter of operating EBITDA margin above 29.5%, with Q1 coming in at 29.6% in the historically lowest margin quarter of the year. This margin result exceeded our expectations and reflects the tangible benefits of technology on our operating costs, the sustained effectiveness of our pricing strategy and the substantial progress we're delivering on our sustainability initiatives. It's our track record in these areas that gives us confidence we're positioned to deliver our highest-ever full year operating EBITDA margin between 29.7% and 30.2%, which is more than 100 basis points of expansion from 2023 at the midpoint. Our ability to convert more of each revenue dollar to earnings and free cash flow allows us to raise our prior outlook for both operating EBITDA and free cash flow by $100 million. As we progress through 2024, we're maintaining our focus on 3 priorities : disciplined pricing across each line of business, leveraging technology to permanently reduce our cost to serve our customers, and executing on our strategic investments in sustainability growth. John and Devina will cover more details on where we're seeing traction within the cost structure and where we have further runway, so I want to spend a few minutes on the other 2 priorities, our pricing strategy and the progress we're making in expanding our sustainability businesses. Beginning with pricing, we're pleased with the results we've seen from embracing a customer lifetime value model. Our teams are able to leverage customer-specific analysis to understand where a customer is on their journey and design actionable strategies that will extend the customer retention, improve profitability or both. We're confident that we found a winning approach to data-driven decision-making that optimizes price to reflect the value of the services we deliver, the strength of the asset network and our leading commitment to environmental sustainability. Our first quarter results again show that we have the ability to leverage price increases to cover costs and grow margin while also reducing customer churn. Shifting to our sustainability businesses. During the quarter, we delivered growth projects across the recycling and renewable energy businesses. This includes completing a large recycling upgrade in Germantown, Wisconsin. The updated facility relies on state-of-the-art equipment that reduces labor costs, increases throughput by 20%, up to 60 tons of material per hour, and improves product quality. We have another 9 upgraded facilities scheduled for completion this year, and we'll be opening 3 new recycling facilities and expanding our industry-leading single-stream network even further. Additionally, we've completed a new renewable natural gas facility this quarter at our DFW landfill in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, and we remain on track to commission another 4 new renewable natural gas facilities in 2024. We're also excited to announce that WM was just named the official sustainability partner of Major League Baseball. WM's work with MLB is the first collaboration of its kind between an environmental services company and a professional sports league team -- sports team league. With this partnership, we have the opportunity to offer services to all 30 MLB clubs in the United States and Canada. We expect to leverage our expertise to build comprehensive plans to improve the environmental impact of Major League Baseball and its clubs. In closing, I want to thank our WM team for all their hard work during the quarter. I'm immensely proud of their dedication and execution, which have helped achieve such strong financial results. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. In the first quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 210 basis points year-over-year to 60.9%, continuing the positive trend of our disciplined management of operating costs, particularly in our collection business. Through strategic investments in innovative solutions and process optimization, we delivered improvements in operational efficiency, extracted costs, and setting a new standard for managing the middle of the P&L. Combining this strong operating expense performance with the disciplined pricing performance Jim described, we greatly enhanced overall operating EBITDA margins. In the first quarter, operating EBITDA in our collection and disposal business grew $212 million, and margin expanded 310 basis points to 36.6%. As we continue our journey of automation and optimization, we remain committed to harnessing the power of technology to drive sustainable growth, further reduce costs and improve profitability. In the first quarter of 2024, our continued adoption of technology and automation initiatives led to substantial reductions in both labor costs and repair and maintenance expenses. On the labor front, efficiency in all 3 of our collection lines of business improved meaningfully from the first quarter of 2023 as our implementation continues to gain traction. As an example, we're seeing nice improvements in performance from our routing efficiency program, next day optimization, or NDO, in our industrial line of business. This tool allows us to more dynamically route and it improves our efficiency, which is reducing our cost to serve and improving our asset planning. Currently, we have deployed NDO at 92% of our collection sites, and the majority of those are already achieving or exceeding efficiency targets. Additionally, we are achieving great results in the automation of our residential routes. Through Q1, we have automated over 650 routes and removed almost 800 rear load trucks since 2022. This has led to upwards of a 30% efficiency gain and residential EBITDA margins approaching 20%. The integration of these technology investments, coupled with the benefits of improved driver retention, have resulted in a 135 basis point improvement in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. In the first quarter of 2024, driver turnover improved to about 18%, down from over 22% a year ago. We expect ongoing benefits from continued moderation inflation as well as the investments we're making in our people and processes as we progress through the year. Turning to repair and maintenance. In the first quarter, repair and maintenance spending decreased year-over-year for the first time in several years, and spending as a percentage of revenue improved 50 basis points. In addition to our strong process discipline, we are also leveraging technology to reduce these costs. These technologies have enabled us to digitize much of our workflow, beginning with all of our technicians who now have portable technology in their hands. These tools facilitate our ability to assign and track work, drive technician efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve asset utilization. Our results are encouraging, and we see further runway to optimize repair and maintenance costs in the future. In addition to great operating cost performance, we continued to deliver top line growth primarily through disciplined execution on our pricing programs. Our customer lifetime value model continues to drive strong organic revenue growth, and our sales metrics in the quarter are a clear indication of our success in profitably growing the collection and disposal business. Churn was near the lowest rate that we've ever seen at 8.5%. New business improved 16% and continues to outpace lost business. Rollbacks remain in the low double digits. Net service increases remained positive, and our net promoter score improved by almost 12% year-over-year. Looking at revenue growth, as Jim said, we've seen a strong start to the year in pricing. Volume has been relatively consistent with our original expectations, with the exception of our temporary roll-off business. The softness in this volume category reflects some slowness in the homebuilding and industrial segments of the macro economy. C&D was also impacted with the lapping of volumes related to Hurricane Ian cleanup last year. With that said, our 2 bellwethers for demand, commercial collection and MSW volumes were positive in the quarter, and we also experienced  a nice uptick in special waste tons in the quarter. For the full year, we now expect total revenue growth of between 5% and 5.75%. The revision from our prior expectation is driven by 2 things : the softer temporary roll-off volumes mentioned; and a lower outlook for energy surcharge revenue, given the decline in the average diesel cost relative to our expectations. Our pricing remains on track, and in some lines of business, ahead of our original expectations. Our teams delivered outstanding performance in the first quarter, and I can't thank them enough for all their contributions to our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our first quarter financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning. Growing our adjusted operating EBITDA margin by 240 basis points in the first quarter stands out as the best indicator of WM's strong start to the year. As John discussed, the lion's share of this margin expansion came from the optimization of our operating performance in the collection business, with labor efficiency and improved repair and maintenance costs driving a 270 basis point improvement in our total company margin from the core. Our continued focus on managing our back office spending also contributed 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, with SG&A as a percentage of revenue coming in at 9.5%. Commodity impacts in the quarter largely offset each other as fuel price impacts benefited margin by about 40 basis points, and recycling results decreased margin by about 30 basis points, primarily from the impact of higher recycled commodity pricing in the brokerage business. The remainder of the margin bridge from Q1 of 2023 to Q1 of 2024 relates to a headwind of about 60 basis points from the combined impacts of incentive compensation and costs incurred by our corporate team to drive adoption of our optimization programs. Our strong margin and earnings, combined with benefits from working capital and lower cash incentive compensation payments, led to robust growth in first quarter cash from operations. We're starting the year strong with cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue up over 500 basis points to 26.5%, demonstrating the value of our margin expansion to growing the company's cash flow yield. Capital expenditures totaled $668 million in the quarter, with both capital spending to support the base business and our investments in sustainability growth tracking as planned. Our first quarter free cash flow of $714 million allowed us to invest across all of our capital allocation priorities. We returned more than $550 million to shareholders, paying more than $300 million in dividends and repurchasing $250 million of our stock. In all of this, we still maintained our leverage ratio at our target levels of about 2.6x. With our strong balance sheet and robust earnings and cash flow outlook, we are well positioned to continue our commitment to shareholder returns and long-term growth. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.6%, which includes a $37 million benefit from investment tax credits related to the development of renewable natural gas projects. As we noted during our fourth quarter earnings call, our original expectation was that we would see a $120 million benefit in 2024 from the ITC. And we now expect $145 million for the full year. We expect this to benefit both our tax expense and free cash flow in 2024. As Jim mentioned, our great start to the year has put us on a higher growth trajectory for the full year than we initially anticipated when we gave guidance last quarter. We're confident that our full year operating EBITDA margin results can exceed the very strong 29.6% we achieved in the first quarter, and that is reflected in our increased outlook for 2024 operating EBITDA and margin. As we think about the balance of the year, we anticipate that outsized earnings and margin growth continues in the second and third quarters from our pricing programs and momentum in operating efficiencies that began late in the third quarter of 2023. We continue to expect that growth in our sustainability businesses will be more weighted to the back half of the year as more recycling and renewable natural gas projects begin operations. Pulling these points together, we want to emphasize that $85 million of the $100 million increase in our operating EBITDA guidance for the year is attributable to our team's strong execution on driving efficiency and the improved cost to serve in the collection business. The remaining $15 million is related to higher recycled commodity price expectations for the year. To wrap up, we're very pleased to deliver first quarter results that exceeded our own high expectations. Our sustained strong results are a testament to the investments we have made in talent, technology, and assets over the past several years. As always, I want to thank the entire WM team for their focus and dedication to delivering on our commitments to our customers, our communities, and our shareholders. With that, Towanda, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Patrick Brown : So we've got to come back to the stellar margin performance here. So John, if I just look at collection and disposal EBITDA, I think you said it was up $212 million on maybe only $190 million increase in revenue. So I just want to understand how we're getting such incredible flow-through. I mean, it sounds like you're seeing outright deflation in certain items, but maybe just a little more color. And just to be clear, there wasn't, Devina, any sort of onetime accrual reversal or anything else that really impacted the quarter, is that correct? Devina Rankin : So I'll start with the easy one and confirm there were no accrual reversals or onetime items in the first quarter. The only kind of one-timer that we could point out is actually the loss of the Ian volumes from the prior year that would have been a hill to climb from a margin perspective because, as you know, storm volumes come at high margins. So in fact, the $212 million operating EBITDA growth in the collection and disposal business came with 310 basis points of margin expansion to 36.6% in the collection and disposal business. John Morris : Yes, a little more color, Tyler. I think a few things are occurring. One is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a nice uptick in efficiency in all 3 lines of business from the mid-single digits up to the high single digits for residential. Residential is a really good story. If you look at the table in the back and you see we still traded about 2.9% of the volume down, but we made a good bit more money for the quarter. And I think we're starting to strike a better balance there. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, residential margins are approaching 20% at the EBITDA line. I think the M&R piece is certainly worthwhile on touching. Last year, we took delivery of about 1,450 trucks. We'll get about 1,800 this year, and that's having a meaningful impact. We felt like we've been chasing M&R costs and labor related to maintenance and repairs. And for us to actually tamp down costs quarter-over-quarter for the year is something, as I mentioned, we haven't done in a number of years. So I think it's been good efficiency, good cost discipline, our pricing remains robust, especially across the collection and disposal lines. So I think a lot of that came together in Q1. And as Devina mentioned, there really was no one-timer that benefited that. That was just strong execution by the team in the field. Patrick Brown : Yes, absolutely. Now John, you mentioned 20% resi margin. So can you just remind us where those margins were a few years ago because I believe they're a fair bit lower? And then do you think that those can approach more company average or is this kind of more where you would expect them? John Morris : Yes. You're testing my memory here, Tyler. But I would say around 10%, 11% is what I recall. And I've said when we started down this journey, if you will, to really rationalize some of the residential business, we wanted residential to compete with commercial and industrial. And while we're not quite there yet, we can see a point where that gets a little bit closer to converging. And I think as that happens, that 2.5% to 3% volume that we've been kind of trading off on average will start to moderate as we get closer to that line. Patrick Brown : Okay. And then my last one here, Devina, just want to make sure that we kind of have a level set on Q2. So if I look back historically, margins do typically rise, I don't know, 150, 200 basis points sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Just anything to think about why that wouldn't be the case or can you just help us shape the Q2 margin expectation? Devina Rankin : Yes, I think it's a great question. What I would tell you that we're looking at is a little softer climb from Q1 to Q2 in the normal sequential trends but still a marked improvement from Q1. And coming in, I would say, above 30% pretty handily in Q2 and Q3, in particular. We're currently expecting a little north of 30% in Q2 and potentially even north of 31% in Q3. James Fish : Tyler, I think part of that, I'm not sure it's that we're seeing any softening. It's just that we're kind of in uncharted territory here in terms of margin, I mean, which is a good thing, but to have a range that includes -- we've talked about numbers starting with a 3 for a long time, and now we finally have a number that starts with a 3 in our guidance range. So we're just being a little bit cautious about it. We certainly saw the trend that you just mentioned from Q1 to Q2 and on, but as did the field. But we feel like we're being maybe a little cautious as we get into some uncharted territory. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Bryan Burgmeier : I believe you've said revised EBITDA guidance is about $85 million in underlying improvement. I guess there would be a headwind from the roll-off volume, so it's maybe even more than $100 million sort of underlying number. Did fuel costs play a role in the EBIT guidance raise? And maybe just from a big picture, what changed over the last 2 to 3 months that maybe allowed you to realize these savings a little bit quicker than you may have anticipated in your original view? Devina Rankin : Yes, great question. I would tell you in terms of the $85 million, it really is predominantly oriented to 2 things. And one, the biggest driver is our cost efficiency performance and the really strong execution on reducing cost to serve that John's talked so much about on labor and repair and maintenance. The other is the strong execution on price, and that's moderately ahead of the expectations that we had when we came into the year, and we think that will hold for the rest of 2024.  With respect to fuel, it really didn't impact our dollar outlook for the business. What it did impact is our margin outlook for the business. And so the help in margin was 40 basis points in the quarter, and we think that some of that margin help continues into Q2 and Q3. With respect to how we executed in Q1 that gave us confidence in raising the margin outlook, I would tell you, we saw a really strong margin performance in the fourth quarter, really beginning in the third quarter of 2023 but again in Q4.  And because Q4 and Q1, on a seasonally adjusted basis, tend to be lower volume and lower margin quarters for us, we really wanted to preserve some of the upside potential until we saw some of the normal seasonal upticks in our business in the second quarter. But with the strong performance in the first quarter, we really could not wait to reflect that we now expect a full year that will hit that 100 basis points of margin expansion. James Fish : I mean, I think the risk there, Devina, was as we discussed it, Bryan, the risk was, with such a strong performance, if we didn't raise guidance, there might have been questions on this call about, so is there something that we're not seeing that you're seeing? Is there something that you had that benefited you? And of course, Devina already answered that. The answer was no. But what we were a little concerned, if we didn't raise margin after such a huge margin performance that, by the way, was on the heels of 2 other quarters, that you might start asking questions about it, are we missing something? And you're not missing anything. We're just improving the margin that much. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Last question for me. I know we're waiting for a little bit more detail on the investment tax credits. And it seems like you put a comment in the press release, $37 million in 1Q, $145 million for the year. I guess I'm just curious if that was kind of in line with your original expectations. And are we still kind of tracking for like a $300 million benefit over the course of your investments through 2026? Good luck in the quarter. I'll turn it over. Devina Rankin : Great, thank you. So our original expectations for 2024 were $120 million, so our current outlook of $145 million is a $25 million increase of the ITC benefit in 2024 specifically. With regard to our full outlook for ITC capture over the development plan that we have outlined, we are tracking toward the high end of the original range of $250 million to $300 million. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry Revich : Really nice performance this quarter. And over time, you folks have consistently expanded margins by 20, 30 basis points per year almost like clockwork. And I'm wondering, as we think about the long-term plan from here, should we be thinking about 2025 as a lower year of margin expansion because we're getting such good price/cost spread this year? Or does that not factor into how you're thinking about the longer-term plan that you folks unveiled, what, 6 or 9 months ago? Devina Rankin : It's a great question. And while it's a little too early for us to be looking to specifically set guidance for '25, I do agree with you that there are some fundamentals that would make us a little more cautious to effectively repeating a 20 to 30 basis point margin expansion year-on-year. But that being said, I would tell you there are some fundamentals with respect to what we're seeing that we know have additional runway and growth, and those fundamentals really come on the labor and repair and maintenance side.  So repair and maintenance, long term, has been below 9% of revenue. In Q1, we're at 9.5%. So 50 basis points of savings across the year is $100 million of EBITDA. So if we could see ourselves get there, I do think that, that's one of the things that could give us some incremental traction above that 20 to 30 basis points long term. The one thing that we don't really have clarity on yet, but we -- based on what we know today will be a headwind, is that the alternative fuel tax credits will expire at the end of 2024. And that's been about a $55 million benefit to our operating expenses on an annual basis. So that could be a headwind that would tamp down our margin for the years ahead. But we really do think there's strong traction in labor and repair and maintenance that will more than offset that headwind. James Fish : Jerry, I think there's some -- it's always going to be a combination of headwinds and tailwinds. Tara's here. She can talk about the fact that we have a bit of a tailwind next year when it comes to recycled shutdowns. I mean, this year, we're going to see somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million, maybe a little less as an impact, a negative impact on us from shutting down these recycled plants while we rebuild them. That drops off pretty significantly next year. So you probably have somewhere in the neighborhood of a $25 million pickup or tailwind next year.  The other thing that John and I and Devina have all talked a lot about is this kind of reduction in heads but doing it in a low-impact way, so it's just through attrition. And when we think about that, as I look at our actual headcount from '22, it's down over 2,000 people. And none of those people -- we're not -- none of those people were RIF-ed. We're not going through an arbitrary reduction in force. That's just choosing to not replace folks, and we've given about 4 or 5 different categories where that happens.  But several of those categories are still not complete. One of them John has talked about, which is the shift from rear load to automated side load. Each time you do that, there is a person that is no longer needed on the back of the truck. As you can imagine, we have pretty high turnover there so we just take advantage of that through attrition. Similarly, in Tara's shop and the recycling business, as we rebuild these plants, we're seeing somewhere between a 30% and 40% reduction in labor costs, and so there are some related heads that come out with that.  So we still, even in '24, have another probably, John, 1,200 total heads that will come out if you combine those 2 categories. And that takes us from 2,000 to 3,200, 3,300. So that's a big, big part of this is that we're doing this in a more labor efficient way, and it really is coming to fruition. Jerry Revich : Super. And Jim, maybe just to expand on the recycling part of that conversation. So we have the plant downtime this year but also the returns on the CapEx that you folks are delivering. So what level of improvement are you anticipating '25 versus '24? Correct me if I'm wrong, I think the original plan called for something like a $90 million year-over-year benefit. Is that still the plan for '25 versus '24 so we get that on top of the $25 million swing that you spoke to? Tara Hemmer : I can speak to that. So as we mentioned, we have 13 plants that we expect to bring online this year and another 13 next year, and those remain on track today. If you think about our exit in 2024 related to headcount, we'll be at a point where we've gotten 70% of the headcount out by the end of 2024 on the automation journey. So we should see not just a pickup from shutdown costs but also from the benefit of 30% improvement in labor costs and operating expenses from those plants. It's a great example of how we're able to bring to life in some of these communities. We were just up at Germantown last week for the grand opening celebration. And bringing in more capacity is a great way to differentiate WM in these key markets that we operate in. James Fish : So to use a baseball analogy since we just signed a deal with Major League Baseball, Tara, we'll be in the seventh inning? Tara Hemmer : Exactly, seventh inning stretch. James Fish : All right, perfect. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. Sabahat Khan : A lot of color there on kind of the tangible labor savings. Is there any way to quantify some of the operational efficiencies or savings in terms of the technology investments that you're making, some of the data analytics tools just in terms of how much bps you might expect over 1, 3 years and what you're kind of seeing relative to expectations? John Morris : Well, I think the one line we can certainly look at, I think Devina had some of that in her prepared remarks, is kind of what the ratio is of direct labor to revenue. We saw a nice improvement there. I think that's a combination of 2 things : one, we've continued to be very disciplined about pricing. We've said we're playing the long game here, and I comment about customer lifetime value. So I think part of the benefit is we've continued to drive quality revenue at the top line across all the collection lines.  And frankly, the post-collection line is worth noting it didn't come out, but this was our best quarter in history from a landfill pricing standpoint and a transfer station perspective. So the top line is strong. But I mentioned efficiency. And part of what's driving that mid to high single-digit efficiency is the use of technology to drive efficiency. Our turnover number's worth commenting on again because we are at all-time lows at about 18%. And that takes a lot of pressure off if you think about the cost, the friction cost of training folks, putting second people in trucks and all those things. So that's another part of it. And we're down about 750 routes year-over-year. And you can look at our volume. Part of it is being driven by the automation of residential. But the rest of it is we are less capital-intensive for basically doing more work in the commercial and industrial lines year-over-year. James Fish : John, you mentioned also, and John mentioned that in his script that 90% of the roll-off line of business has been rolled out on this [ India ], which is the term for our optimization model. But we haven't rolled out commercial and haven't rolled out residential on that model yet, so we still have a fair amount of room to go there. And all of this is -- it was really 4, 5 years ago, an admission by us, that our routing was not as efficient as it could be if we used -- truly used technology to benefit that. I think that's probably the case across the entire industry. And so 4 or 5 years ago, we decided that, that had to change and now you're seeing the fruits of that. Sabahat Khan : All right, great. And then I guess, as you think about optimizing and I think pricing and some of the data analytics you're using to figure out the right price for the right customer based on their value, do you believe, based on the work you've done to date, that the model is at the right place? I'm sure there's an element of test and learn. But do you think you've got the right factors? What's sort of your data telling you in terms of how well that model is working? James Fish : I think we -- look, there's always room for improvement so I would not tell you that we're -- that we've perfected this. But from when I was a price guy back in the early 2000s, it's night and day. I think the team has done a spectacular job using data and analytics to their benefit and making sure that we are looking at the customer who really drives the decision as opposed to driving the decision just purely based on a number that we needed to hit in our price metrics. So I would tell you that we've made a ton of progress there. Are we perfect? We're not, but so much better than we used to be. John Morris : I would say, Jim, our customer metrics, I commented on, that's really the barometer. When you look at our gross and net PIs, when you look at customer churn, service increases and decrease and our net promoter score, I think those are all the measurements sort of right to the equal sign of how effective our program is. Sabahat Khan : And then just one quick one, I guess, on the revenue guidance update there. I think just wanted to get a little bit more color on the softer roll-off portion. It sounds like bit of homebuilding and industrial slowdown. Is that just a change in the view of how the macro is going to evolve for the rest of the year based on what you've seen year-to-date? Or was there any specific issue that came up in the industry? Just want to get more color on the evolution of the view on the roll-off and the macro. John Morris : Yes. I think the takeaway here is we were guiding to about 1% volume and now we're probably down to about 0.5%. So it's a move but it's not that meaningful of a move. It's early in the year, too. I would tell you that when we were preparing for today, we're obviously looking at Q1, Q4. And we've seen a little bit of an uptick here in April. It looks like it's getting a tad better.  I think the bigger news is aside from a little softness in the housing sector, which we spoke to, I think the rest of the business is still performing well. When you look at our post-collection volume, particularly MSW and our commercial volume still performing well, that's what really gives us conviction about the $100 million for the balance of the year that Devina commented on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Hilary Lee : This is Hilary Lee on for Toni. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Just want to touch on pricing a little bit. So when you said earlier that you expect price to hold for the rest of the year, does that mean you're expecting core price to be closer to around that 7% rather than the 6% you said last quarter? James Fish : Well, we did say for price that -- and I mentioned it earlier that we actually exceeded a little bit of our expectations. So we're not changing anything for the year, but your point is well taken, that's -- that we actually ended up a little bit higher than the full year guidance and so that's a positive for us. At this point, we'll leave it where we originally set it, though. Hilary Lee : Got it. And as a follow-up, just wanted to touch on the sustainability. I know last quarter, you talked about having about $150 million of EBITDA coming from the sustainability investments for 2024. Just wondering if you would be able to kind of give us a little bit of information on potentially the cadence or kind of the split between R&D and recycling. Any details would help. Tara Hemmer : Sure. The $15 million increase that Devina referenced, the most significant portion of that is from recycling and really from commodity prices and not a whole lot of benefit from the renewable energy business. And the reason for that is we, today, have about 85% of our volume locked in, in either short, mid, or long-term offtake at this point, which is an increase from what we had said during our last call, which was roughly 2/3.  So while RIN prices are increasing and we saw -- we've seen increased RIN prices, we've also seen some offsetting items on really natural gas prices and power prices related to a more mild winter that we had this year. Devina Rankin : And in terms of the cadence of when that shows up, it will be more heavily weighted toward Q3 and Q4 because our time line with regard to the incremental projects that are coming online is weighted toward the back half of the year. Hilary Lee : Congrats again on the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Devina, Jim, John, do we have a new baseline in margins? We can now say 29.5% to 30% is the new baseline and we'll grow from there? Devina Rankin : There's certainly nothing in the current year that tells us that this isn't the right baseline, so I do think that, that's a great way to look at it, Michael. Everything that you know about the WM culture is one that's focused on the customer and focused on continuous improvement. And I think those 2 things shone through and that commitment won't stop. So I do think the new baseline can go upward from here. Michael Hoffman : And then everybody, of course, is trying to figure out how they're supposed to model '25 already. But if we -- but you have to have some assumptions, so like what we think inflation is, what we think GDP is. If we said 3% inflation and 2.5% GDP, your price/cost spread on that number should still produce probably 30 basis points of margin. And then you still have everything John and Tara, that's a mouthful. This is my sixth earnings call in the last 7 hours, so it's running together. All that self-help still left, too. Is that the right way to think about, without putting the number on the increment, I start with 30% price/cost spread management, somewhere between 29.5% and 30%, add that 30% to it, and then I get self-help. Devina Rankin : I think that you've characterized it well in terms of self-help. I think it's that continuous improvement mindset as well as some of the things that were out of our control like truck deliveries. For a while, we've really moved past that headwind and are starting to see strong traction from getting the assets that we need to run our business. James Fish : I look at it as continuous improvement, Michael. Self-help kind of sounds like I was an alcoholic and I'm coming off the bottle. Michael Hoffman : I didn't mean it pejoratively. I think of it as things that you can do, that you control as opposed to relying on the macro. James Fish : I know. Just giving you a little bit of a hard time. Michael Hoffman : But what are you drinking these days? So cadence, Devina, in 4Q, you said first half, second half EBITDA growth should be about equal. Does anything change with the performance at this juncture? Devina Rankin : The only thing I would say is that first half solid waste growth is even greater than what we had projected because what you saw is the strong margin performance and growth from the solid waste business really showed up more quickly than we were expecting. So that solid waste lift comes more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Michael Hoffman : So a little more weighting than slightly as opposed to evenly? Devina Rankin : Correct. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And on the $85 million of operational leverage, how much of that is the ITC benefit that runs through gross margin instead of through the tax line? Devina Rankin : None of it, zero. All of it's in the tax line. Michael Hoffman : Perfect. And then given the improvement in retention, I would assume the safety metrics are also at all-time goods? John Morris : Yes, that's a good point, Michael. I mean, take that sort of a leading indicator of what we can expect from safety. But there's a clear distinction between somebody who's tenured in the seat and somebody who's not. And that's not a critique of folks who are new in the seat. It's just a matter of having that experience. And we do see a pretty wide spread between those who are tenured in operating a vehicle and those who are not. So as we continue to hold that number down, we expect the safety results to continue to improve as well. James Fish : By the way, Michael, the most -- we've said before, but the most important metric in this move from rear load to ASL is a safety metric. It's not a financial metric. Financials obviously are better, but it's a safety metric. And so as we continue to take a person from the back of the truck, which is the most dangerous place, honestly, in our entire operation, behind the truck, as we continue to move that person inside the cab, that will benefit us significantly. Michael Hoffman : Yes. And the last one for me. One of the powers of the roll-off business is that when it does slow, you park equipment, reposition drivers and raise prices. Is there anything different in this cycle? John Morris : No. Michael, I think you said it well. I mean, that's something we've been very focused on. Some of the technologies we've implemented over the last handful of quarters really starting to show benefits is really around capacity planning and making sure that we can see around the corner using, frankly, data and analytics that we didn't use a handful of years ago to be very predictive with a very small deviation between what history would tell us we need to plan from what we actually plan for, and we're still getting better at that. Michael Hoffman : So we might see a revenue hit for volume but you might not see much, if anything, in EBITDA because you make those adjustments so quickly. That's part of the point. John Morris : We talked about the volume being down for the quarter, Michael, but I think the revenue, it was off about $7 million. So when you look at the amount of volume versus what we got from a revenue quality standpoint, from a margin standpoint, from that perspective, it was a good trade-off. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Stephanie Benjamin Moore : I wanted to maybe circle back on the automation opportunity within residential, apologize if I've missed it, but where are we left in terms of automating some of those routes, automated side-arms and the like, what has been complete? What is left to do? And then I think you did mention the opportunity for greater automation on the commercial side as well. So maybe if you could just expand on that opportunity and the time line of starting to really kind of accelerate those efforts. John Morris : I did comment briefly on that. We've taken about 800 rear load trucks out of the fleet and about 650 rear load routes since we really started earnestly pursuing this in early Q2. We've got roughly another 350 to 400 routes we have targeted this year, and I say 350 to 400 because that has to do with some truck deliveries. And that probably -- when we get done in '24, that probably puts us in about the sixth inning, if you want to continue with the baseball analogy. We still got some room to go there. So hopefully, that clarifies that. James Fish : And in commercial? John Morris : Commercial. I think on the commercial side, where we have -- continue to see benefit is really driving efficiency, and Jim commented on it. We've got some more sophisticated, frankly, tools to help us route our vehicles and, in some cases, the dynamic element is where we think -- although it's less in commercial than roll-off, there is a dynamic element to commercial and our ability to real-time route that. And to route around real-time traffic is another capability that we are just putting in, in the system now. Stephanie Benjamin Moore : Got it. And then just to maybe touch on the labor aspect, so clearly seeing an incredible improvement in labor. You called out turnover. So I guess if we could kind of break out the components, clearly, turnover is at a significantly higher level. Are you seeing actual labor costs come down? Is this -- is the average employee being more productive because you're seeing more tenure? If you could just kind of maybe explain what we're seeing on the labor side or the fact -- is there a deflationary element of this as well? Devina Rankin : Yes, it's a great question. And I would tell you in terms of the inflationary cost pressure on wages, we have seen that soften. We're currently at about 5% wage inflation for our driver population, and that's certainly down from low double digits at its peak. So that's the labor component that's associated with inflation.  The other piece is, John really talked about them, whether it's the route optimization work, efficiency, driver and technician retention, improved turnover. And then truck deliveries helps on that front, too, because ultimately, that is their office and they feel appreciated and like they have the assets that they need in order to serve the customer. And so we're seeing help in each of those aspects of the business.  I think that the widening impact in terms of margin expansion from labor in the operating expense category is most significant on the efficiency front but certainly helps on the improved inflation headwind. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist. Jack Wilson : This is Jack Wilson on for Tobey. Can you maybe speak to sort of the other benefits of the recycling facility upgrades other than sort of the potential to remove some positions? And is that capacity-based or is that some efficiency gains we'll be seeing? Tara Hemmer : Sure. There's really 2 other components. The first is we really improved the quality of material that's generated so we're able to sell some of the material at higher price points. So really moving mixed paper into higher grades, and we get a price premium. That's been demonstrated in all of the automated MRFs that we brought online. And then also we're increasing the capacity at these facilities quite significantly, so we're able to bring in more volume. And that's going to be a great example of how we can tie that back to our customers and grow recycling volumes and also grow our collection volumes, too. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : So the really strong flow-through into free cash flow performance, can we just walk through how we get that improvement of $100 million? It sounds like, obviously, there's the operating performance, maybe also some tax items going on and then some working capital improvements. Just how do we think about the delta? Devina Rankin : Yes. So it really is an EBITDA story. And the EBITDA dollar growth that we are projecting of $100 million is expected to flow directly through. And the reason you don't have a tax offset there from the higher earnings is because we have $25 million of incremental expected ITCs. So those 2 kind of offset each other such that our outlook for cash taxes is effectively flat.  So EBITDA is what drove our outlook for $100 million increase in free cash flow for the year. I would tell you, I do expect some upside from that potentially because we had such a strong quarter from a working capital perspective and certainly stronger than we expected. So in my experience, you have to wait to see whether that's timing-related, and so we didn't incorporate any working capital benefit in the revised guidance. Noah Kaye : That's really clear and helpful. And then a question that might not have a clear answer. But on PFAS, it seems like the EPA regulations kind of played out as expected, although pretty inequitable to have exemptions for municipal but not private solid waste it seems. I guess 2 things : one, can you talk about your expectations for cost impacts if everything kind of stands up the way it does as written today? And two, your thoughts on how that might potentially change, whether with congressional action or any further action on the part of EPA. John Morris : So Noah, I would tell you, we're obviously -- that's a topic we're following, I'm sure the whole industry is following very closely. There was some language in the last release from EPA that had some language about some protection for the landfill. But candidly, it didn't go far enough to give us a lot of security around the topic, so we're going to stay close to that. And as you can imagine, we're very vocal in all the right offices to make sure that we find a pragmatic approach to handling this because it is an issue that obviously has to be managed. I would tell you that landfills, both sub C and D are still considered to be very viable, long-term, responsible repositories for PFAS, so we still see it as an opportunity. The circle designation, which give us a little bit more latitude on the super fund side, actually, we see that as an opportunity for some of, in particular, DoD sites that are going to start getting cleaned up. We're already doing some of that work now.  And then lastly, I would tell you on the cost side, a little hard to predict now. What I will say is very encouraging, though, when I was with our post-collection team in the last few days, there's a lot going on in the technology front that we think we can bolt on to our post-collection sites to be able to really effectively manage that at a cost that we can pass on to the customer. So hopefully, I captured it all. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds. George Bancroft : Congratulations, Jim, Devina, and John, the team on a great quarter. Just longer term, what are you -- is there -- are there any opportunities maybe through something transformational, either be it like these large regionals that are still around that everyone talks about or maybe something in a different line of business? What is your sort of longer-term outlook on the business and any interest in other -- maybe other opportunities? James Fish : Yes. I think there certainly are always opportunities for us. Over the last couple of years, we've been focused on internal opportunities. We did say that with respect to M&A that we were sticking with our guidance that we've given in the last couple of years of $100 million to $200 million. But that there was some opportunity and the pipeline looked pretty strong. So I do think there's opportunity for us to grow both organically, as we've talked a lot on this call, but also inorganically, and we're just going to make sure it's the right acquisition that we feel like has a good strategic long-term prospect. Operator : I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Fish for closing remarks. James Fish : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your participation, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of WM is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : Okay, thanks, Ed, and thanks for joining us. Our results for the quarter were fueled by strong operating performance in the collection and disposal business. We once again achieved double-digit operating EBITDA growth in the second quarter, keeping us on pace to achieve the full-year outlook that we provided last quarter. Quarterly operating EBITDA margin reached 30% for the first time in the company's history, driven by operating efficiencies from technology investments and the sustained effectiveness of our pricing strategy. We're pleased with our performance in the first half of 2024 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of strong financial results. Our team's executing very well on our strategic priorities, as evidenced by the expected growth in operating EBITDA, approaching 10% for the full year. A big part of our strategic approach to growth is to find future opportunities where we can leverage our own expertise, whether it's using technology to improve our routing efficiencies, turning landfill gas into renewable natural gas, or automating recycling plants to drive greater throughput and lower operating costs. Each of these recognizes a future need and capitalizes on it. And now our recently announced agreement to acquire Stericycle presents another opportunity to leverage our expertise to drive higher growth. Stericycle has a leading position in the growing medical waste industry. The planned acquisition adds complementary business platforms to further our leading suite of comprehensive waste and environmental solutions. And these strategic benefits are accompanied by attractive financial benefits. Our team is progressing through the regulatory approval process and integration planning, and we're excited to welcome Stericycle's team members to WM. Even as we add medical waste as a new vertical within our business to complement our existing collection and disposal business, we continue to position our solid waste network for future growth. As we've said, the pipeline for solid waste tuck-in acquisition opportunities was strong coming into 2024. Our teams worked hard to move tuck-in acquisitions to completion, and we've now closed more than $750 million of solid waste acquisitions through July. These transactions strengthen our core collection and disposal operations in North America in new geographies like Long Island, New York, and complement existing operations through tuck-in acquisitions in growth markets in Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona. We also continue to execute well on sustainability, our sustainability growth investments. We expect to bring five new renewable natural gas projects online in 2024, adding to the two new facilities completed in 2022 and 2023. We have another nine projects in active construction, with construction beginning or expected to begin on the remaining four facilities later this year. Momentum is building, and we're excited about the progress we're making. Investing directly in building our renewable natural gas platform meets all of our investment criteria. We're driving strong returns with expected payback periods of three years or four years at better multiples than traditional M&A. Plus, we're expanding environmental benefits by collecting and beneficially using more landfill gas, and we're strengthening our core business by positioning our landfill assets as community energy partners. Looking forward, we're exploring the scale of opportunity in future project development, and growth from our renewable energy business across our landfill network. At the same time, we continue to maximize the value of the renewable energy we produce through a balanced marketing strategy that leverages the transportation and voluntary markets to secure returns, reduce risk, and manage volatility. These efforts demonstrate our commitment to scaling this unique growth opportunity to create long-term value for the environment and shareholders alike. Turning to recycling our investments and automating our existing facilities and building capacity in new markets is helping differentiate WM with customers, unlocking new opportunities to further expand our network, such as recent success [indiscernible]. At the same time, our automation investments are providing consistent financial results, improving labor costs per ton by 30% to 35%, and increasing the blended value on commodity sales by 15% to 20%. We completed our Pittsburgh and Atlanta automation projects during the second quarter, and both facilities ramped up quickly. We're on track to complete another seven automation projects and add new facilities in New York, Florida, and Portland by year end. Our progress to date increases our capacity from our recycling investments by more than a 1 million tons. The WM story is one of delivering on our commitments. We achieved strong results in the first half of 2024, and are positioned to continue that trajectory during the balance of the year. As we kick off our planning process for next year, we have some early enthusiasm about 2025. Based on all the opportunities we discussed today, we're particularly bullish on the long term. It's our dedicated team that makes all of this possible, and I want to thank them for all of their contributions. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results. John Morris : Thanks, Jim. And good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter results, particularly our ongoing optimization of operating costs. Our teams remain intently focused on delivering safe and reliable service to our customers, and I want to thank them for their dedication, especially those in areas impacted by Hurricane Beryl in early July. Second quarter operating expenses is a percentage of revenue improved by 130 basis points year-over-year to 60.9%. This improvement is a testament to our disciplined management of operating costs and our collection lines of business. Combining our strong operating expense performance with disciplined pricing, we significantly enhanced overall operating EBITDA margins. In the second quarter, operating EBITDA in our collection and disposal business grew by $203 million, with margin expanding to 37.3%. Our continued adoption of technology and automation was a key driver of these significant operating cost improvements. Specifically, in labor, the use of scheduling and planning tools, advanced mapping technology, expansion of our dynamic routing capabilities, and automation of our residential fleet resulted in improved efficiency across all three of our collection lines of business for the second consecutive quarter. In residential, efficiency improved by nearly 6% in Q2, largely due to fleet automation. Our automated routes achieved over 30% efficiency improvement, contributing to a significant increase in residential operating EBITDA margin when compared to last year. Additionally, our people-first focus led to reduced driver turnover, which improved 300 basis points from a year ago. Company-wide, the integration of technology and improved driver retention contributed to a 90 basis point reduction in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. We remain confident in the value of our technology and optimization efforts, and we expect to continue driving labor cost improvements throughout the year. Turning other operating costs, repair and maintenance spending as a percentage of revenue improved by 20 basis points, reflecting our continued adoption of technology-enabled processes and an improving truck delivery schedule. Lower fuel costs also contributed 20 basis point improvement to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. We remain committed to optimizing our cost structure to meet both operational and financial objectives, and we're proud of the results we have achieved so far. And finally, turning to revenue growth, our customer lifetime value model continued to drive organic revenue growth from price in line with our full year expectations. Our pricing results relative to plan remain on track, reflecting our team's focus on using customer-specific data and insights to deliver price increases that keep pace with inflation and margin expansion objectives. Churn remains at 9%, and service increases continue to outpace decreases, further reinforcing our execution. On the volume front, trends in commercial collection, MSW, and special waste remain strong in the quarter and are generally aligned with expectations. As are C&D landfill volumes when adjusted for the lapping of volumes related to Hurricane Ian cleanup last year. However, volume in our roll-off line of business is one area where we continue to see a bit of softness. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see moderation in both a temporary business driven by home building, as well as a portion of our permanent roll-off business in the industrial segment. While a few segments of our collection volume are trending a bit behind our full year expectations, our discipline revenue management combined with our strong execution on cost optimization continue to give us ample confidence that we are positioned to deliver strong financial performance throughout the rest of the year. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team again for their contributions. Their performance so far in 2024 sets us up for continued success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our second quarter financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning. We're pleased with the strong start to 2024, particularly when we focus on the three most important financial measures we track, operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin, and free cash flow. Starting with operating EBITDA, through the first six months, we have seen this metric grow more than 12%, with all of this growth being organic. This puts us on track to deliver our full year outlook of nearly 10% operating EBITDA growth, well above our long-range annual target of 5% to 7%. As a reminder, in setting our operating EBITDA target for 2024 and then quickly increasing it by $100 million in April, we projected that achieving this year's outsized growth would be driven by two things. The first is the benefits of price and cost optimization in the collection and disposal business, which we expected to be weighted toward the first half of the year. And the second is incremental earnings contributions from our investments in growing our recycling and renewable energy businesses, which would be weighted toward the back half of the year. This is exactly how 2024 is tracking, giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range for operating EBITDA, with our current projection being $6.475 billion. This includes about $20 million to $30 million of incremental growth from tech-in solid waste acquisitions in 2024. Turning now to operating EBITDA margin, it's worth highlighting again that at 30%, Q2 is the best quarterly operating EBITDA margin result in our company's history. In the second quarter, total company operating EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points, and this was driven by about 200 basis points of margin expansion from price and cost optimization efforts in the collection and disposal business, and then a benefit from the sale of non-strategic assets of about 50 basis points. These strong margin results were partially offset by higher risk management costs, an increase in incentive compensation costs, and a modest drag from the net impact of recycled commodity prices and fuel. The key takeaway from looking at these puts and takes is that we saw a 200 basis point lift in our core business versus last year, and we see the benefits of employee retention, truck deliveries, and the use of technology and process to optimize the business that started in the second half of 2023 holding. The significant margin expansion in operating EBITDA growth in 2024 is delivering robust operating and free cash flow growth. Through the first six months of 2024, we've generated cash flow from operations of $2.52 billion, and that's an increase of nearly $450 million or 22% compared to the same period in 2023. Our double-digit operating EBITDA growth, favorable working capital trends, and lower cash incentive compensation payments are driving this strong performance. For the first half of the year, capital expenditures to support the business totaled $947 million. Sustainability growth investments were about $388 million. Both are tracking a plan that we anticipate spending at or slightly above the high end of our prior guidance of between $850 million and $900 million for sustainability growth investments in 2024. Pulling this all together, we've generated $1.24 billion of free cash flow in the first six months of the year, and we're confident that we will achieve our guidance range of between $2 billion and $2.15 billion of free cash flow in 2024. As Jim mentioned, we've closed more than $750 million in Truck-In acquisitions through July, and we look forward to closing the acquisition of Stericycle as early as the fourth quarter of this year. Given our elevated M&A activity, we want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and emphasize our commitment to a strong balance sheet. WM has a disciplined approach to allocating capital to strategic growth opportunities, including the capital needed to sustain and grow our core solid waste businesses and investments that we're making to grow our recycling and renewable energy assets. We prioritize return on invested capital in making these decisions, and we expect all of our investments to provide healthy returns above our cost of capital. We also remain committed to growing shareholder returns, which includes increasing the dividend as free cash flow grows. We intend to finance the Stericycle transaction using a combination of bank debt and senior notes. When combining the impacts of the $750 million of solid waste Tuck-In acquisitions with the funding of Stericycle, we now expect our leverage to be about 3.6 times post-close. In light of this elevated leverage, we're temporarily suspending our share repurchase program so that we can work our way back through our targeted leverage range of 2.75 times to 3 times, about 24 months after the close of Stericycle. The slight revisions in our projected leverage figures since our announcement of the planned acquisition of Stericycle are updates that reflect the impact of layering on the additional Tuck-In acquisition activity this year. We're steadfast in our commitment to debt investors and rating agencies because we know the value of our strong investment grade credit profile. To wrap up, we're very pleased with our strong results, and I know the WM team remains hard at work to deliver on all of our goals for 2024. With that, Livia, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question coming from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning. Devina Rankin : Good morning. Tyler Brown : Hey, Devina, so obviously, you know, solid quarter great start to the year. I think last call you mentioned north of 30% margins in Q2, possibly north of 31% in Q3. Looks like Q2 came in more around 30%. I just wanted to see if that north of 31% is still a good placeholder, or should we maybe think about moving that down a smidge? Devina Rankin : So, I'll start by highlighting that the one item that was different than our expectations at the end of April when we spoke about that little north of 30% for Q2 is the risk management impact of 50 basis points in the quarter. So, if we had not had that item, which we couldn't have predicted, we would have come in at or above the target that I provided on the call last time. What I would say about when we look forward to Q3, what's changed a little bit, there's a couple of things. One is recycled commodity prices, and you guys know that we have a different geography than our competitors do with regard to the impact of recycled commodity prices. And that was a 40 basis point headwind in the quarter, and we expect elevated commodity prices to continue into the back half of the year. So, there is a little bit of a headwind that we weren't projecting from recycling brokerage in particular that would carry over. And then, in addition to that, with lower industrial volumes that John mentioned, the flow through on industrial volumes is generally strong 40% levels. And so, that again is one of the things that created a headwind in the quarter and that would impact Q3. The third item relates to the Tuck-In acquisition contributions. As you know, based on where we are in integration processes, integrated M&A revenue and activity tends to come in in early innings at a lower contribution margin than our base business. So, what I would say is that right now our Q3 outlook is in the range of 30.5% to 31% with all those things taken into account. Tyler Brown : Yes, quite a few things. Okay, perfect. And then, as we think about EBITDA dollars, so I just want to make sure I understand some of the moving pieces to the guidance. So, because I believe at the end of Q1 you had only spent like maybe $10 million on acquisitions. You mentioned $750 million through July. I would have thought that that would have, you know, obviously including Winters Bros, so I would have thought that would have helped maybe the guidance. I assume there's some EBITDA associated with that. So, I guess one, can you talk about what the end year revenue contribution from M&A should be in '24? And then, can you just talk about, maybe some of the puts and takes? Because, again, I would have thought there would have been some EBITDA contributions there. Maybe there's something. You mentioned a few things breaking against you. John Morris : Yeah, Tyler, it's John. Good question. I mean, if you look at what we did in Q2, it was about $77 million of revenue that was acquired. The $750 that we put, that we've all talked about, represents about $300 million of acquired revenue by the end of the year. So, hopefully that clarifies a little bit. And then, what Devina and I talked about is there is some benefit we've talked about in the back half of the year, that $25-ish million that will be a contribution from some of the M&A we've referenced. Devina Rankin : So, in terms of overall EBITDA growth for the year, what I would say is, when we look at the first half of the year, right, the first half of the year, Solid Waste EBITDA has grown $415 million. Quite remarkable. The headwind that I talked about in risk management, it shows up in the corporate and other category. And so, what you see is, you know, there was more of an offset to that Solid Waste growth in the first -- in the second quarter than what we experienced in the first quarter. But the sustainability businesses, we still expect to be on track to generate that $115 million of EBITDA contribution to the year. And when we think about what happened over the second quarter that may not be showing up as a direct increase in that amount, it really is a put-and-take story. One is the value, the incremental value we expect from higher commodity prices in the recycling business, partially offset by the impact of a slowdown in some of the construction projects on the renewable energy business. Now, we're talking weeks, not months here, right? This is contributions that we now expect to start to ramp more in the fourth quarter than what we were expecting earlier in the second half of the year. So, all-in-all, what I would tell you is the EBITDA growth story for us is approaching 10% in the year, and still most of that coming from the solid waste business, with the contributions coming from the sustainability business, in total tracking according to plan, though there was a put-and-take. Jim Fish : So, Tyler, Jim here, let me just give you a little bit of extra color here. The 25 that Devina referenced in kind of our forecast over the revised guidance number of 6,450 that we gave last quarter, that 25 has some of what John talked about, which is the Winter Bros acquisition. We'll get five months-ish of that. We already had baked into our original guidance some M&A EBITDA and revenue, but can't say we baked in Winter Bros. So, you're going to get part of that. You're going to get, as Devina said, you're going to get some of the sustainability stuff, which, by the way, is working both ways for us. I mean, we get some commodity pickup. We also are seeing a few minor delays in a couple of the R&G plants. We're still building five R&G plants for the year, as we said we would, but 30 days or so of delay is impacting us. So, all of that adds up to the 25. I think Devina's point, though, is really worth really reiterating here. I mean, you're talking about almost 10% EBITDA growth, and to some degree, I feel like we have a great story to tell, and sometimes we aren't great storytellers, because I feel like we've got 10%, which is the strongest EBITDA growth, probably back to the 1990s. I'm sure the company grew by more than 10% in 1982, but since the 1990s, that's the strongest EBITDA growth we've ever seen, and yet we're doing it. You remember in 2019, when we said we grew EBITDA between 5% and 7%, we said, at the top end of the range, that's going to be in a really robust economy, where we're seeing, you know, 2-plus percent volume growth. We're not seeing 2-plus percent volume growth. We're flat on volume, and yet, in an economy that's kind of stumbling along, honestly, and yet we're growing EBITDA by 10%. Almost all of that, except for that $25 million-ish or whatever that number is for us, almost all that's coming from organic growth. Same with last year. We grew by 7% last year, and it was almost all organic growth. It's coming from those things that we've talked about in the past. You know, you remember a couple years ago, we started talking about technology, probably five years ago. We're going to talk, we're going to bring technology to bear, and we're going to really make a commitment to sustainability, and we're going to put operating processes in place, improve efficiencies, we're going to get smarter with pricing through data analytics, all that stuff, and I remember on the earnings call getting questions like, okay, that's great, Jim. When are we going to see the impact on the bottom line? You are seeing the impact on the bottom line. When you see 10% EBITDA growth, 160 basis points of margin growth, and still 5-ish percent revenue growth, it's all coming from price, you are absolutely seeing that kind of strategic growth, and then at the same time, we're doing some acquisitions. I mentioned in my script where we're filling holes, either where we weren't before, or adding to really strong strategic positions like Texas, like Florida, like North Carolina, Tennessee, you could go down the list, Arizona, and then you've all seen a deck on Stericycle. I mean, Stericycle is basically a fourth line of business for us. We've got resi, we've got commercial, we've got industrial, now we've got medical. And with Stericycle comes significant opportunities for synergy and comes with a higher growth trajectory in medical waste than in the solid waste space. So we're very excited about that, which basically gets me to a 25 number, and 2025 we'll give you guidance in February. But I could not be more bullish when I think about 2025, when you add all those things up. I mean, think about these sustainability investments. Tara will tell you we've spent probably three-quarters of the capital, or we will have by the end of the year, and we will have only realized 15% of the EBITDA. So 2025, I don't care who gets elected in November. Well, I do, but it doesn't matter who gets elected in November. And it doesn't matter whether we have geopolitical problems. It doesn't matter whether the economy is up or down. We're going to have a blockbuster year in 2025. We'll talk about it in February. But that's on top of what we consider to be a blockbuster year this year. So a bit longer answer than I think you were bargaining for when you got on when you were first in the queue. But I just want to make sure everybody understands all that. Tyler Brown : [Indiscernible]. It's great. I really appreciate it. I don't mean to split hairs too much, but we're kind of in that business. But I appreciate the call. Thank you. Jim Fish : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hilary Leon : Hi, this is Hilary Leon for Toni Kaplan. Good morning, guys. Great quarter. So speaking of the election, sorry to bring it up, but we've had a couple number of inquiries surrounding potential implications of it. Depending on who's elected or who's in the House, how would you expect R&G and RINs to be affected or if at all? And what sort of increase, decrease do you see potentially in your R&G projects? Tara Hemmer : Sure, I'll answer that one. We've been obviously tracking this very closely. And I think what's important to note related to our R&G business is we're in a very different time than we were in the previous Trump administration. You've really seen a lot more development on plants. We've seen the voluntary market really shore up. And we also have the RVO that is in place through 2025. So if you look at analysts that really cover the R&G industry, by any measure, most are saying that they don't expect a significant decrease in RIN pricing really more solidly in that 250 range in a potential Trump presidency. And as you know, that is well above our investment thesis of $26 per MMBTU. Jim Fish : So, Toni, real quickly, you know, Tara did a great job of answering that and she's absolutely right. I would just tell you, we've always said, no matter who's in office, we're pretty agnostic about that. I mean, we all have our own personal preferences, but the business itself does really well in just about any regulatory environment, short of somebody coming in and saying, you know, landfills are closed all tomorrow morning. But short of that, we are pretty agnostic with respect to regulation, whether it's the Chevron doctrine, whatever it is, we do well in just about any environment. Hilary Leon : Got it. Great. Appreciate the color. And just a minor question. So, you know, with Hurricane Beryl happening recently, do you expect any sort of volume impact or top line growth impact, or is that not really significant? Devina Rankin : It's insignificant. We had our quarterly business reviews with the Texas market, who was hit the hardest, and they've made projections. But at this point, it's not expected to be material. Jim Fish : It wasn't insignificant to my heart [ph] Devina Rankin : Yeah. We all felt more significant within the business world. Jim Fish : It was more significant at my house, but as far as the business, it's not going to be material. Hilary Leon : Got it. All right. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Great quarter. Devina Rankin : Yeah. Jim Fish : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Yes, hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Jim Fish : Good morning, Jerry. Devina Rankin : Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich : Jim, on Stericycle, you know, I'm wondering if you just weigh in because historically, the company has really struggled to push pricing. And I think that's been because of the autoclave business. And you folks in your businesses are obviously leaders in driving pricing and return. So I'm wondering if you could just maybe peel back the onion on your strategy for that business and how you folks can have an impact on pricing discipline in the market through your ownership. Jim Fish : Yeah, Jerry, it's a little hard to tell at this point. One thing I can tell you is that Stericycle has talked a lot about the fact that as they roll out new systems that those systems will give them better visibility. And boy, we absolutely concur with that. I mean, you know, we like the fact that our systems give us a lot of visibility all the way down at the customer level. So we don't really know what that means in terms of pricing at this point because we haven't had a chance to kind of stick our head under the covers. But we do know that the better the visibility, the smarter you can be with data and analytics and with pricing. Jerry Revich : And in terms of the volume outlook, you know, I think historically the industry has had a much tougher volume result than what the forecast is going forward. Can you just talk about what's driving inflection in your view? And sorry, this is still on medical waste. Jim Fish : Yeah, you know, I mean, I think this is really kind of an outsider looking in because, again, we're not, you know, we don't own the business yet. And we really, for the most part, are looking at public documents. We're starting to go through an integration process where we get to look at some things. But I would tell you that if we look at kind of the medical industry, not just medical waste but medical services, and as you look at the United States or you look at Canada or you look at just about any country, the U.K., France, Germany, I mean, all those countries are getting older. And so that would seem to be a positive for the volume of services in that industry. And commensurate with that, you would expect to see medical waste increase at a similar pace. So why their volumes have been a bit slower than expected, it's hard for me to say. But I sure do look at the future of this and say, this is a business that should have a very strong volume trajectory to it. I do think it will be helpful as we start to look at their customer base. They have a lot of customers that are moving towards kind of larger national account-type customers. And we're very good at national accounts. Our national accounts business has really been a driver of our growth over the last kind of five years to ten years. So as you look at their business that's going, in large part, from these small-quantity generators to more large-quantity generators, the UNHs and the HCAs and companies like that, I think that's right in our wheelhouse. Jerry Revich : Super. And can I ask one more, Devina? In terms of the risk management costs in the quarter, can you just expand on those, you know, or how much of that is non-recurring out of period versus what might linger with us? It looks like based on the sequential outlook for margins and 3Q, it feels like you're applying normal seasonality to this lower base in 2Q that includes the headwind from the risk costs. So I'm wondering if you could just expand on that, if you don't mind. Devina Rankin : Sure. So in terms of what we experienced in the second quarter, you know, this is a business where we say safety is priority one and getting our team members home safe every day is the most important job that we all do. And I would tell you that, unfortunately, there were some incidents in the second quarter that resulted in reserves associated with some of the, you know, more significant incidences that we can, from time-to-time, incur in our business. It is not representative of long-term trends. It is not representative of something that we expect to repeat. So I would say non-recurring, not out of period. What I would say with regard to the seasonal trends, and I mentioned this when Tyler and I were talking about margins as well, is what's difficult about typical seasonal trends for us is that roll-off is really a big piece of what can drive seasonal trends upward. And we did not see the roll-off volume pickup that we would have expected to see, and we are cautious about that going into the third quarter. Aside from that, we do expect the traditional benefits that you get from higher MSW levels and the commercial collection line of business in particular continues to be really, really strong in terms of both volume growth, price execution, and really strong flow-through from those efficiency gains that we've had. So overall, seasonality expectations are very strong, and we expect that to continue with the exception of the muted roll-off impact. Jerry Revich : I appreciate it. Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and not trying to turn this into a stair cycle deal call, of course, but I just want to ask you one or two quick questions there, and thanks for the deck. The $125 million or greater cost synergies you're, again, referencing, just help us understand what the expected timeline is for realizing those? You talked about run rates. Is this basically something that you get to a run rate on at some point in 2025? Is it earlier in the year? Is it later in the year? How are you thinking about it currently? Jim Fish : Yeah, so it's a good question, Noah. You know, Rafa Carrasco, our officer here, is going to be running this for us, and Rafa is kind of right into the process of looking at what do the synergies look like for this deal. We said $125 at the start. We didn't really give kind of a breakdown of when we realized those. Some of those, obviously, you know you get up front, whether it is some internalization benefits on the disposal side. It's also, you know, some of the SG&A piece. But we do think that, as we said kind of early on, that the $125 is, you know, you can do some math to get to a point where you say that's pretty conservative, even if you're just looking at the SG&A line. We built in 300 basis points on the SG&A line, and their guidance for the year was 22% SG&A as a percent of revenue. And you know where ours is. I mean, we're at 9%. And by the way, as I think Davina said a couple of times, you probably should compare them not to the 9% but to what our areas run at. Our areas run at like 5%. So you can do some math and get to a much bigger number than 125, but that's what Rafa and his team are doing right now is determining, all right, what do the synergies look like? What comprises the $125? Is the $125 twice as big as that? I mean, what is that number? And then to your point, when do we get it? Is it, you know, we've kind of said three years to get there, but you may have most of it coming in year one. You may have most of it coming in year two. We don't quite know yet. That's where he's digging in. We will give quite a bit more color on this. First of all, once we own the business, we'll give a lot more color on it. And secondly, we'll give more color and we'll give guidance in February. Devina Rankin : So one data point, Noah, that I think is really helpful in terms of thinking about timing and why it would differ from, you know, the timeline that we saw on ADS as an example is that when you think about Stericycle and where they are in their journey, they are just completing their ERP implementation, and we think that there's reason to be cautious with respect to the pace at which we could capture synergies with this business. And Jim did a great job of articulating, you know, some of the work that's going on right now in order for us to be able to fortify our expectations and outlook. But I think that the ERP implementation journey that the Stericycle team has been on is one of the reasons that we're not at a position that we can speak to how quickly we can get there, although you know us well enough to know that we're going to move as fast as we can. Noah Kaye : Yeah, I think that those are both very fair points and well noted on the SG&A gap. That's something we look forward to hearing more about. A minor housekeeping question. It looked like in the investing line there was an outflow of roughly $800 million in other. What was that? Devina Rankin : Yeah, so it was about $775 million of unusual activity, and it will be disclosed specifically in the 10Q. But basically because of with the lead up to the announcement of the Stericycle acquisition, we were in a period where we had material non-public information, and we could not remarket our tax-exempt bonds to the marketplace. So we had to repurchase our own tax-exempt bonds for a short period of time. That's what that relates to. We've since already successfully remarketed the ones that have been in place or that could have gone back to the market through July, and then we have additional remarketing activity that will happen in the third quarters and fourth quarters where we expect to fully place those back into the marketplace by the end of the year. Noah Kaye : Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess just one high-level overarching question on the business. I think it speaks to, Jim, what you got into before around the outlook. Organically, you're still continuing to deliver growth. You're seeing this kind of price-cost spread continue. The market seems to be somewhat soft volume-wise around parts of the economy, industrial. How's the strength of the consumer, and what's your view into being able to continue to get a healthy level of price and an outside spread to your cost as we get into $25 million? Jim Fish : Yeah, that's a great question. And I think the consumer has been pretty resilient through all of this, through COVID, through kind of the rebound, and through a bit of a -- look, it's not been a bad economy, but it just hasn't been a -- it certainly hasn't been a blockbuster economy. The consumer has been very resilient, and that's been the encouraging part. I think it shows up when you look at our kind of more small and medium businesses, which are reflected in our commercial. You know, the commercial line of business has been fairly strong for us on the volume side. Resi has been soft, but Resi is not really driven by consumer behavior. Resi has really been driven by John Morris, and John's been really working on improving margins in that line of business. The real softness has been in that temp roll-off, more industrial space. You know, if you look at our numbers, C&D has been soft, but a lot of that is just difficult comps because of the big Florida hurricane last year. Special waste has been pretty good. MSW has been quite good. So we're actually not that disappointed with flat volume, but it's just not the 2% to 3% that we kind of talked about, you know, in 2019 at the last investor day. I would tell you that the consumer seems to be resilient, seems to be fairly strong, so all of that's good for us. Noah Kaye : Thank you very much. Jim Fish : One last quick point here when you talk about Stericycle. We really haven't talked that much about the operating side of this, but look, I think there's a real opportunity on the operating side. John's talked a lot about the efficiencies that we're bringing in the solid waste space, the technology that we're bringing to bear. All of that has application in the medical waste space, too, because they really run trucks the same way we run trucks. Noah Kaye : Yep. Yep, well taken. Thank you. Jim Fish : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Bryan Burgmeier from Citi. Your line is open. Bryan Burgmeier : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just a couple of housekeeping items. So maybe just following up on Jerry's question. It sounds like the risk management margin headwind is going to roll off at the end of 3Q, if that's correct. And then can you provide any clarity on the tax rate for 2024? The 1Q, I think, was in the high teens, and it kind of moved into the low 20s in 2Q. What do you think we shake out for the remainder of the year? Devina Rankin : Yeah, so what I would say is, I would describe the risk management item as a Q2 only item in terms of the magnitude of the 50 basis points headwinds because it was activity-based. It's not something that will be recurring in nature. With regard to tax rate, this is actually a little more complicated question to answer than you might anticipate. But what I would tell you is when we exited Q2, our projection for that is 22%. I'd clarify for you two important things. One is that it includes $145 million of investment tax credit benefits that we expect for the year. And if there is any change in the timing or place and service dates of our renewable natural gas facilities, you could see that change. But that's our best estimate as of right now. And then the second item is, there was a change in accounting in 2024 related to our low-income housing tax credit investment, and that actually has a slight impact on the effective tax rate because of a change in geography on the income statement. And Ed and Heather are happy to talk through that with you in more detail if you would like. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Got it. Thanks for that detail. And just one more kind of housekeeping item is there's a comment in the press release on a small write-down from waste diversion technology. I know it's not exactly material, but just for our own knowledge, what are those investments? I think there was a similar write-down last year? How many of these type of maybe venture capital style investments does WM have out there at the moment? Thank you, and I'll turn it over. Devina Rankin : Sure. So I would tell you in terms of the portfolio, this was the largest investment of its kind that was remaining in our what you call venture capital type suite of investments. So there's not anything significant that I would tell you is looming here for similar investments. For this one in particular, it relates to the continuous investment that we had made, and you'll recall that this was all about looking for opportunities to divert MSW and see what we could do to create sustainable solutions for MSW. We continue to be focused on ensuring that we are thoughtful about what opportunities exist in the marketplace, and we were optimistic about this one, but the viability of it proved to be different than our initial expectations. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Kevin Chen from CIBC. Your line is open. Kevin Chen : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a few questions here on the Winter Bros acquisition. Just wondering strategically, if you could just walk me through. It looks like they have some waste-to-rail assets. Just wondering if that creates a platform for other opportunities for you. I think they were also a carter for an operator in New York City as part of these commercial zones. Does that do something? And then I know it's a multi-part question here, but I guess the third part would be it looks like they also have some shredding services. I'm just wondering how that plays into your proposed acquisition of Stericycle and its shredded assets. Thank you. Jim Fish : Well, I'll start backwards, Kevin. I think with respect to New York City, we've been a long-term licensed Operator in New York City since the mid-'90s. So that's not the reason why Winter Bros was attracted to us. They're certainly the premier environmental service provider on Long Island. I think you hit on a couple of key things. One, it's a white space for us. It was sort of new real estate. It's not a secret that the Long Island market has got some disposal constraints that are growing at the end of this year with the planned closure of Brookhaven Landfill. They've got intermodal assets and capabilities that play very well into our network capabilities. And on top of that, the business runs really well standalone. So for us, we're really fortunate to have those folks join the WM team. They run about 150 routes out there. It's about 500 employees. So we're excited about that. In terms of the commercial waste zone thing, we've obviously followed it like a lot of other folks, but that was not reasonable for our interest in Winter Bros. Kevin Chen : Okay. And just maybe a clarification, just those intermodal assets, does that create a platform for future? I mean, I know you have a lot on your plate now, just kind of thinking further out, or is that primarily something you'd use for kind of internalizing waste, diversion -- sorry, go ahead. Jim Fish : Certainly their ability to move waste off of Long Island in modes other than truck transportation was certainly something that was appealing to us, and we view that as, like I said, as some of the disposal constraints continue to grow on Long Island. Their capabilities on Long Island, in addition to the network of assets we have that can receive intermodal waste, was a key contributor in terms of the strategic outlook for us acquiring that business. Kevin Chen : Perfect. That's it for me. Best of luck in the back half of this year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question, coming from the line of James Schumm from TD Cowen. Your line is open. James Schumm : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just curious on the landfill revenues are sort of just up modestly, look like the tons were mostly flat. It's just curious what you're seeing in pricing trends for landfills? John Morris : I think, you know, we talked earlier about C&D is actually positive net of the lapping of the, and the volume's continued to be strong. If you're talking about the yield spread clearly there's a little difference in our yield outlook for landfill volume this quarter versus last quarter. But that's really, that was really distinctive and showed up in one of our areas that took on a good chunk of volume, great business, but an average lower rate. And that has more to do with the geography of where the volume came in from. So we see, in terms of our overall landfill volume, they're still positive. We still see decent trends on the landfill volume side. And if you look at it from a core price standpoint, which is really what we were focused on. If you look at both the landfill and the transfer station core price, you don't see any deviation there. So we're continuing to drive value in terms of the quality of revenue we're bringing into our post collection facilities. Jim Fish : Yeah. James, I just to add a little bit to that, I, what John said there, I mean, sometimes it gets lost, but, but these different geographies have different rates and this happened to be a pretty big pickup about 20% pickup in MSW. And as John said, it was, it was good, very good for this area, but that area happens to have an average rate well below the average rate for the company. And that's driven by market conditions. That's driven by, by capacity competition, all of those things, this area, which picked up this, this nice bump in MSW is well below that market rate. So when you look at yield, which includes mix, the yield calculation reflects that. That's why John talks about core price because core price takes out the mix effect. Core price is essentially flat. If you look at Q2 of '23 versus Q2 of '24, essentially flat. Well, yield was down a bit and the yield was really mixed related. John Morris : And the last thing I would add is, look at our special waste volume that continued to be strong through Q2 as well. Right. James Schumm : Okay, great. Thank you for that. With, with respect to R&G, there were some news reports out there that I think misled some investors a little bit. There was a report that said you could potentially sell your R&G portfolio for $3 billion. You later said you were offended by that price, which made sense to us because the price would seem way too low, but is there any color you can provide about the strategy going forward with the R&G assets, you know, given the large purchase of Stericycle now? Jim Fish : I'm still offended by that number. I think the way I we'd look at that is as we've said all along, this business is really a natural byproduct of our landfills. It's one that provides significant margin accretion for a strong EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. All of those good things that we like, that we talk about it. And last but certainly not least, it adds to our sustainability focus that we really made, kind of a tenant of our strategy a few years back. So all of those things are really good. We've said kind of all along, everything is for sale at a price, but I would tell you $3 billion is not that price. In fact, it's a long way from that price. So right now our focus has been those 20 plants. I talked about kind of where we are on those, and, you know, we've got two that are out there, three I guess that are out there, and we'll have another four coming online this year. We're in process of construction on all of those. As I said in kind of my extra comments to Tyler's question, almost three-quarters of that CapEx is going to be spent by the end of the year, and only 15% of the EBITDA will have been realized. So that's why 2025 and '26 really look like there's going to be a big step up there, not just from R&G, but also the recycling investments. So, again, I know the Reuters article was out there, $3 billion, anything that we own is for sale at the right price. And if somebody threw a gigantic number at us, we would look at it. But for now we're focused on building out the remainder of those 20 plants. Tara has talked about the fact that we've got potential for kind of phase 2, some of these other landfills that are not in that 20. We're evaluating those as well. We're super excited about the R&G business and the recycling rebuilds that we're doing. James Schumm : Yep. That makes sense. That's clear. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Jim Fish : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I do want to follow-up on maybe Tyler's question at the beginning, and I don't mean to beat a dead horse here, but I think it's important. You know, and I agree. I think, you know, Jim, you're exactly right. It's certainly a blockbuster year with 10% growth. It's really strong. I think, where we're coming from, and this is probably part of all of our problems is that we're always kind of looking for more or where you could see that kind of incremental EBITDA growth. And I think, as you alluded to and Tyler alluded to M&A seems to be a little bit better. Commodity dollars are a little bit better. The underlying business is performing well. So I think, what would be helpful is maybe if you could talk through areas where it's been a little bit maybe worse than expected or slightly negative. Obviously, we call that a little on the volume front, but anything else that suggests potentially maybe not as strong as everything else, which clearly, quite frankly firing kind of on all cylinders. So helpful there. Sorry for it's long-winded. Thank you. Jim Fish : No, no, no. It's a good question. Look, there's always ups and downs, puts and takes in the business. There's hardly ever, in fact, there may never be a year where every single thing we look at goes up. And you touched on the one which we've talked about a bit this morning, which is volume. Volume is softer than we expected coming into the year. We thought it would be approaching 1%. Now it's more flat, but we've offset that. And that's the encouraging part for us is not only have we offset it, but expecting 1% volume growth and 7% -- I think 7.6% was our original guidance on the EBITDA line. And now we're saying, okay, oops, volume is not going to be approaching 1%. It's going to be flat. Oh, but by the way, EBITDA is going to be 10%, approaching 10%. So while not everything is going in the right direction, and there's a couple of other things. We did mention the fact that some minor delays in some of these plants. They're minor delays, but they're not opening exactly when we said they would open. They're still, you know, the five that we committed to opening in '24 are still going to open in '24, but slightly minor delays. I think the impact of that is about $11 million negative. So that's been a negative force, but in no way, shape, or form does that indicate that we're experiencing long-term delays in these projects where we feel like we're on a really good track for construction of those plants. So, yeah, you know, there's been a couple of things. One thing that we don't talk about, for example, is the fact that when you rebuild these recycle plants, there's a shutdown cost for that. And by the way, you're shutting down in a really good commodity price environment. So that ends up in kind of a strange way being a pickup for us. As we get into 2025, there won't be as much of a shutdown cost as there was in 2024. But '24, it's why I've kind of tried to pound the table a little bit on how impressive 10% is. We've got some delays that have amounted to call it 11 million bucks. We've got some shutdown costs that are, you know, you're going to have a shutdown cost because you have to shut the plant down in order to retool it. So there are a few negatives out there. You know, could we have a higher tax rate depending on who gets in office in November? Yes. But really the only thing that to us that looks kind of negative and doesn't seem to have prospects for improvement is that kind of industrial temp roll off business. I'm not sure I see that bouncing back in 2025, but I am. That doesn't mean I'm not incredibly bullish about 2025. I just think we have to offset it just the way we've done this year. Stephanie Moore : Got it. I'll leave it at that. Thank you so much. Jim Fish : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Toby [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. On the acquisition front, I'm wondering if you could kind of look through the lens of the other people that you're speaking with in terms of prospects and what are the pressures they're feeling on the business over the last couple of years? You know, supply chain technology investments and some others have been pressuring them, and perhaps driving them to the table to have dialogues with yourselves and others. How do you see that currently and into next year? John Morris : I think Toby, you hit on one of them on a supply chain and we go back to that for a second. But first let's start with labor. I mean, you know, we still see pressure on a lot of those frontline contributing jobs and I'm sure that they're enduring some of the same pressure there. We've been fortunate and had the capacity to really make some big changes in terms of wages and overall comp packages, etc. And you're seeing it show up in our turnover, which reduces training, improves safety, reduces our labor, etc. I'm sure that's one area where they're seeing pressure. I think there's still a little bit of overhang. You talk to some of these folks on the supply chain side where they've got to recapitalize their fleet or their business. That cost is certainly not getting any cheaper. So those are a few areas we think about when we're seeing some of this activity. But I think Jim really hit on something that was important. I mean, the pipeline is strong. You know, we're on track probably to finish around a $1billion-plus of tuck in acquisitions. We've got obviously three quarters of that done already, but we've continued to be disciplined and make sure that we're, we're filling in white space or buying assets and companies in areas where we see real growth opportunities. And that's why you hear about Arizona, Texas, the Carolinas, Florida, etc. Unidentified Analyst : I want to dig into something you said, can the labor expense trend and that decelerating growth related to, you know, retention and less training expense, et cetera. Can that momentum continue into next year? John Morris : Well, I think I would, I would tell you is, is if you look at our labor trend over the last handful of quarters, it's certainly trended through Q2 and it's a handful of things. It's lower turnover. That leads to some of that labor pressure, easy, right? You're, you're hiring less people. You're training less people. Your efficiency is naturally better with someone who's experienced behind the wheel of a vehicle as is your safety performance. And that's why you continue to hear us talk about it. And the fact that we're, you know, hovering in the, in the, in the high teens for turnover, not only is that low considering what we were dealing with post COVID, but those are historic lows. So we're going to continue to stay intently focused on that. Cause that is driving the labor benefit. Jim Fish : Well, in addition, sorry, I was just going to say, in addition to what John said there, you know, we, we still have call it 50% of the, the way to go on our conversion from rear load to ASL. And in just about every one of those cases, you have a labor benefit. Well, in every case you have a labor benefit. In most cases, you have a labor benefit because you don't have a helper on the back of that truck. So that helper comes off, but at the same time you're picking up 30% more homes with an automated side loader versus a rear loader. So in addition to the technology that John and team have brought on board that, that is producing efficiency growth in these lines of business and, and you know, technology driven pickup, you also get this, this pickup when you're shifting from manual collection to automated collection. John Morris : So the last point I would make on that is we've talked over the last two-plus years about reducing some of the labor intensity from those frontline individual contributor roles that are getting harder to fill and more expensive. You know, we're closing in on 2000 of those positions that we don't need to fill anymore. And we'll be over 2000, call it 2200 to 2300 by the end of the year. And we're approaching sort of the halfway point of what we projected that we could remove the need for as many as 5,000 of those roles. And those are really frontline contributor roles. And again, it's important. It's not like we're walking a single person out the door. Those are folks who are not necessarily lined up anymore to come in the front door. And we're finding ways to use technology and automation to, to replace that. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of David Manson [ph] from Baird. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Thank you for the time. Relative to your strategic intent. For Stericycle, about a third of what you're planning to acquire is document destruction. Could you provide some thoughts on how shredded fits in the WM portfolio? Jim Fish : Yeah. Look, I think the shredded business, we look at that as being complimentary to our own recycling business. It, it wasn't a reason to buy stair cycle, but it certainly wasn't a reason to not buy Stericycle either. I think there, you know, the automation that the terrorists talked about coming into those plants can really be a benefit to the Stericycle business. And by the way, the fact that we're. We're the biggest recycler out there is it matters to size matters in this respect. So we're able to potentially command a better price that we get paid for our material than might a smaller customer of, of those companies like a stair cycle. We process a lot of paper in addition to other commodities. So, so I think there's a couple of places where we really feel like this is going to where we can bring expertise, but we also bring size, which, which makes a difference on, on potentially on price. John Morris : And you made the point earlier, Jim, it's routes and customers. It's worth line of business, got a lot of similarities to what we already do in our three collection lines of business. And that's an opportunity for us to get under the covers here. Once we, once we get to that point. Unidentified Analyst : Yep. Thank you. Best of luck. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is open. Brian Butler : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I'll try to just make it quick. Most of my questions have been answered just on that, that thought about kind of document destruction, Stericycle, you know, as well as the document destruction. There's also a handful of assets internationally. What are your thoughts on the international assets? Is it just going to keep those and run them? Or is that an opportunity for growth that you're looking at? Or, or maybe is that really more of a divestiture scenario? Devina Rankin : So, as Jim said on the document destruction side, you know, it certainly wasn't the reason to buy Stericycle, but it's also not something that we're looking at from a divestiture perspective. I would tell you that when we think about the, the role that their international footprint can play for WM, we've always been intentional about keeping our eye on the U.K. in particular, with respect to traction that they get from a sustainability and recycling perspective. And we've done that more from afar. And this gives us a more active position in an important market to be sure that we're keeping pace with sustainability objectives, more broadly. Jim Fish : Excellent question, Michael. I mean, Brian, sorry. Brian Butler : That's a compliment. I'll take it. I'll leave it there though. Thank you very much. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Now, next question coming from the line of Sabahat Khan from RBC. Your line is open. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks. So just one, one on my part, I'm afraid a lot of color on just your optimism on '25, you know, as you think about next year, you're able to share maybe some color on, are there, you know, maybe it's the cyclical side of the volume market that might be picking up some areas of improvement. Is it the pricing that you have some visibility? If you can maybe just hash out to the extent possible on, you know, what's driving the optimism on '25, as you, as you head into the back end of this year. Thanks. Jim Fish : Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, we're, we're just in end of July here. So it's a little bit hard to say. I did say that. I don't, I can't tell you I'm super optimistic about the industrial side of, of the business, the roll off side. But by the way, I mean, you know, there's kind of no room to the only direction is up on that business. At this point, it's been pretty soft. But everything else seems to be, I think pretty good. Pricing is, is, you know, something we're, we're pretty good at. And, and, and we use data and analytics, I think quite well as we, as we implement, you know, kind of our -- our pricing changes. So I don't, I don't see any reason to, to, to be concerned about pricing for next year. Volume itself. We'll know a bit more as we get to, you know, get closer to 25 and how the overall kind of economy is, what's the, what the economy is going to look like. But look, I, I think, I think roll off is, is, you know, I don't think it's going to be worse. Commercial is a, one of the early questions was about the consumer. I think the consumer looks pretty strong and I don't see any reason why the consumer won't continue to be strong next year. And then, you know, look, we're adding a business in Stericycle that we do think has a, a stronger growth trajectory, even in the solid waste business, just by nature of where they're, where they are. So I, I'm, you know, fairly encouraged by the volume outlook, but I'll, I'll be able to tell you more as we get closer. Devina Rankin : The only, the only other thing I would add is 2025 really should be a big year for us and the sustainability related investment, seeing them roll through. Jim mentioned the seven of the 20 plans that will be online by the end of '24 will represent roughly 30% of our, our EBITDA of the $510 million that we had had told you about. And we have a similar story on the recycling plants, and we should get a bit of a tailwind from the shutdown costs that we've been incurring in 2024. So a lot of momentum, I would say on the sustainability investment side. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Jim Fish : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Fish, President and CEO for any closing remarks. Jim Fish : Okay, well, thank you all for your questions this morning. I hope we gave a sufficient amount of color and we're able to demonstrate our, our reasons for our optimism, both for this year and for the coming years beyond '24. So thanks again for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Jim Fish : Okay. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our quarterly results once again reflect robust operational performance in our collection and disposal business as well as our success executing on our strategic priorities. We're pleased to report another quarter of double-digit operating EBITDA growth, positioning us well to deliver about $6.5 billion for the full year, near the upper end of our guidance. Our cost optimization efforts and disciplined pricing programs together are increasing the spread between price growth and our cost to serve and our sustainability investments are providing margin accretive growth. As we'd anticipated, the third quarter set a new record for operating EBITDA margin at 30.5%, a year-over-year expansion of 90 basis points. This consistent growth underscores our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our shareholders. We remain focused on furthering our cost optimization efforts in collection and disposal in our collection and disposal business and improving frontline retention. And John will share more about the headway we're making here. Our teams are also hard at work integrating acquisitions in key markets and have closed nearly $800 million of solid waste acquisitions through the first nine months of the year with a strong pipeline of additional deals. We continue to progress towards closing the acquisition of Stericycle, which will add a complementary medical waste platform to our business and expand our suite service offerings. During the quarter, Stericycle shareholders approved the merger agreement. We received clearance from all international regulators, except for Canada, which is progressing. We're also advancing our integration planning, which has confirmed our confidence in the value of the Stericycle acquisition. We look forward to welcoming Stericycle team members to the WM team this quarter. Turning to recycling. During the quarter, we completed eight projects across our network, including six automation upgrades and new facilities in New York and Florida. Our team's focus on execution has been excellent with two of the projects completed in the quarter beginning operations ahead of plan. We've now completed 24 of the 39 projects in the growth program, which have added 1.5 million tons of annual recycling capacity across North America. Our automated recycling facilities are consistently delivering lower labor cost per ton and higher blended value on our commodity sales compared to our legacy plants, which translates into better operating EBITDA margins. In the renewable energy business, we remain on track to commission the four new renewable natural gas projects in the fourth quarter, adding to our DFW plants, which we brought online earlier this year. With these five projects, along with the two we completed prior to 2024, we will have seven of the 20 planned projects online by year-end. There are an additional 12 projects in active construction and the final plant will begin construction in early 2025. The seven projects are expected to contribute approximately 6 million MMBtus of annual production in 2025. Next year, is anticipated to be a pivotal year of contributions from renewable natural gas investments, and we're committed to scaling this unique opportunity to create long-term value for the environment and shareholders alike. We came into this year expecting strong execution across several fronts. And through the first nine months, we've delivered results that exceeded our own high expectations. As we look ahead to 2025, we anticipate continued growth in our solid waste business, increased contributions from our sustainability growth investments and the successful integration of the Stericycle business to come together to create a significant step change in revenue, earnings and free cash flow. I want to thank our dedicated team, whose hard work and commitment make all of this possible. And now, I'll turn the call over to John, who will provide a deeper dive into our operational results for the quarter. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Before we dive in our operational performance and financial metrics, I want to take a minute to acknowledge and thank our team for providing safe and reliable service to our customers, especially considering the severe weather events. Hurricanes Helene and Milton effect of both our employees and the communities we serve. We are working hard to support those impacted helping restore a sense of normalcy in these areas. Turning to our results. We continue to prioritize technology and automation to optimize our cost structure and enhance operational efficiency. This is evident in operating expenses of 60.6% of revenue in the third quarter, which improved 70 basis points and overcame a 30 basis point headwind from additional workdays in the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter this measure has been below 61%. This quarter's result is driven by continued benefits from cost optimization, pricing discipline and easing inflation. We also benefited from lower fuel prices and stronger contributions from our renewable energy business, though these gains were offset by the impact of increased recycled commodity prices on the brokerage business. Our operating expense performance was largely driven by our collection business, in particular, in labor and repair and maintenance costs. Labor costs improved through a combination of retention, technology and automation. We've automated more than 800 routes in our residential fleet since 2022, reducing our labor dependence, boosting efficiency and improving safety performance. The continued adoption of scheduling and planning tools, advanced mapping systems and dynamic routing is also driving efficiency and reducing operating costs. In the third quarter, our weighted average collection efficiency rose by 2%, with the residential line of business increasing more than 4%. Our intentional focus on making WM a great place to build a career is leading to reduced driver and technician turnover, improving about 19% annualized, a significant improvement over last year. Repair and maintenance costs also improved as a percentage of revenue, driven by our ongoing implementation of technology-driven processes and improvements in our truck delivery schedule. Our focus and execution in these areas are leading to strong financial performance as adjusted operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew $181 million in the quarter, with margin expanding to 37.4%. Finally, turning to our revenue growth. Our pricing results continue to track well. Our team continues to leverage customer-specific data and insights to deliver pricing in line with inflation alongside our margin expansion objectives. We are being purposeful in allocating our people and our assets to their best use. This approach is very evident in our residential line of business, where we've intentionally moved away from lower-margin business, while at the same time, significantly improving our safety performance, growing organic revenue and expanding operating EBITDA margin. By maintaining and growing the right volumes, we are driving long-term value and enhancing overall returns. Our volume results have trended consistently to what we saw in the first half of the year with growth from commercial collection, MSW and special waste. It is encouraging to see our key volumes continue to grow, particularly MSW, which was up 5.7% in the quarter. While the roll-off business remained soft, the declines in volume showed sequential improvement. Similar to the residential business, we're making the right volume trade-offs as organic revenue grew in the quarter and operating EBITDA margin expanded. Churn was 9.2% in the quarter, which is similar to last year and validates the effectiveness of our customer lifetime value model. Service increases continue to outpace decreases, further reinforcing our execution. We remain confident that our data-driven business decisions and technology investments are leading to greater operational efficiency and improved return on capital, which is reflected in the growth and margin performance of our collection and disposal operations. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team again for their contributions. Their performance positions us for a strong year-end finish and sustained growth heading into 2025. And now I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our third quarter financial results in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning. Our results underscore the effectiveness of our strategy to maximize customer lifetime value and drive operating efficiency. Our success is again evident in the operating EBITDA growth, which was 11% in the quarter and operating EBITDA margin, which reached an all-time high of 30.5%. This result was at the low end of our projection of 30.5% to 31% for the quarter due to higher-than-expected recycling commodity prices. When considering about 20 basis points of margin pressure from higher recycled commodity prices, we see the 90 basis points of margin expansion is a strong result that was right at the middle of our guidance range. This highlights that margin expansion from organic growth and cost optimization met our expectations. Once again, margin expansion was driven by the collection and disposal business. Our disciplined pricing strategy, intentional shedding of low-margin residential volume, improved employee retention benefits from truck deliveries and the use of technology to drive efficiency combined to deliver 140 basis points of margin growth in the third quarter. The 50 basis point offset relates to higher incentive compensation costs. These results have been driven by robust operating -- they have driven robust operating and free cash flow growth as well. We generated $3.88 billion of cash from operations through the first nine months of 2024, an increase of more than 16% compared to the same period in 2023. With capital expenditures tracking according to plan across the business and proceeds from the divestiture of non-strategic assets a little ahead of our plan, we've grown free cash flow by 20%. Our outlook for the full year is strong, with operating EBITDA toward the high end of expectations being the driver. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion for the year. The increase of about $50 million from our prior guidance relates to continued progress on the development of our sustainability growth investments. Additionally, we continue to expect $145 million of investment tax credits in 2024 from our renewable natural gas projects. Putting all of this together, we're on pace to achieve the high end of our full year free cash flow guidance for the year of $2.15 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're well-positioned to fund the acquisition of Stericycle. As a reminder, we have suspended our share buyback program because of the current focus on M&A growth including the pending Stericycle acquisition and the nearly $800 million core solid waste acquisitions completed through the end of the third quarter. We remain committed to a disciplined approach to allocating capital, and we prioritize a strong investment-grade credit rating. Organic and inorganic long-term strategic growth and strong shareholder returns through dividends and prudent share repurchases. With three quarters of the year complete, we're confident that we will meet or exceed the high end of our 2024 guidance for revenue and free cash flow. And we will deliver about $6.5 billion of operating EBITDA, representing a growth rate of about 10%. This strong finish to 2024 will create momentum that we expect to carry into our 2025 plan. When you combine our solid waste growth with an increase in earnings contributions from sustainability projects and the expected benefits from adding the Stericycle business to our portfolio, we expect the year ahead to be one of standout performance. Thanks to the efforts of 48,000 plus team members across WM who are working hard to deliver on all of our strategic priorities, we're bullish about the future at WM. We want to thank the team for all they do. We look forward to delivering on our targets for 2024 as we close out the remainder of the year. With that, Livia, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open. Tyler Brown : Hi, good morning. So I think back in '23, you guys did call it, $40 million of renewable segment EBITDA, but do you guys still feel comfortable that you'll be run rating somewhere around $300 million in sustainability EBITDA here in Q4? And can you guys give us any color, just big picture on how much incremental EBITDA comes from that segment in '25. I think you guys had mentioned that you would be run rating at maybe $0.5 billion by the end of '25. Does that all still seem good or has that been pushed a little bit to the right? Tara Hemmer : So I can take this one. This is Tara Hemmer. You'll recall during our last call, $800 million is what we plan to deliver in 2027, and we had pushed that out. If you look at the earnings contribution for 2024 from the sustainability-related businesses, we're expecting that to be in the $120 million to $130 million range for 2024. And you'll recall, we had originally guided $115 million plus another $15 million coming from commodity prices in the recycling business. Related to what we expect to deliver in 2025, what we can tell you really qualitatively is a little bit of the pieces. We certainly expect higher EBITDA growth as these plants come online, not just on the RNG space, but also the recycling space. And we're going to expect lower CapEx in 2025. So when you put those pieces together, you'll expect greater flow-through. The other thing we should mention is we are expecting slightly higher CapEx for the program. Originally, we had said between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, and we're now expecting about $3 billion. So all in all, we do expect 2025 to be a significant year for our sustainability-related investments. It's a bit premature for us to give you all the pieces for 2025 based on where things may shake out related to the completion of the plants in Q4 of 2024. And then also, of course, we're tracking closely commodity prices. So we'll give more of an update in early 2025. Devina Rankin : And Tyler, with regard to the segment reporting, the one thing I would just clarify is, there's some additional details that we provided in the current press release that will give color to some of the mechanics associated with the collection and disposal business and their contribution to the earnings growth of the sustainability investment portfolio that Tara talked about. And I think it's important to look at those details to see the total picture. Tara Hemmer : And if you look at those details, what you'll see is year-to-date, we've delivered $92 million EBITDA. Tyler Brown : And then Tara, just on the CapEx. So I think if I take the $950 million, and I think you've already spent, call it, 1.4 billion. So your already, I think, by the end of '24, call it, 2.3. So that implies maybe another $700 million. Is that mostly in 2025, so it steps down in 2025 and then a big step down in 2026? Or is that going to be maybe more pro rata between the two. Tara Hemmer : Absolutely. You have that right. You have the pieces right. Tyler Brown : Okay. Okay. Perfect. And just my last one, Jim. So I know you guys don't give a ton of color on the out year, but you did mention that, again, you're kind of set up for an outsized growth in 2025, and we're in the business of splitting hairs. So I just want to kind of understand exactly what you mean by that. So I think of you guys as a 5% to 7% organic EBITDA grower and then we add something for M&A and renewables. So when you say an outsized grower, is that in context to that 5% to 7% organically? Or are you just simply saying that, that growth can be north of 5% to 7% with Stericycle and renewables? Just any additional color would be super helpful. Jim Fish : Yes. So the 5% to 7% is a number that we gave in 2019 with Investor Day, and we've actually been -- over the last couple of years, been outperforming that organically. But if you -- the reason we're as excited as we are about 2025, 2026, 2027 is that when you look at a couple of things. First of all, you look at -- you just talked through with Tara, the sustainability investments. As she said, CapEx, you had the numbers just about exactly right. We probably have about $700 million left in CapEx, maybe a little bit more than that. And most of that happens next year. So you can expect to see a pretty substantial uptick in free cash -- in the free cash flow component. And when I say most of that occurs next year, that is still lower in terms of CapEx than this year because this year is going to be call it, $900 million for those sustainability investments. Next year will be something lower than that. And then 2026 will be significantly lower than that in terms of CapEx. And at the same time, you see the EBITDA really, really kicking up. We do have most of these plants, it seems rolling on in the fourth quarter. So we're not getting the impact of EBITDA in that year. This year is no exception to that with four of the five coming online in the fourth quarter. Kind of the same thing for next year. A number of plants are coming online in the fourth quarter. But we do fully expect to see $800 million by the time we -- the first full year of that will be 2027. You add to that Stericycle, we've had 4.5 months to look at it. We're even more enthusiastic about the strategic side of Stericycle than we were when we announced this 4.5 months ago. Rafael and his team have had a lot of opportunity to look into this. In addition to looking at their core business, which we said four months ago was really just kind of a fourth line of business for us, and we now believe that even more after spending 4.5 months on it. The synergies piece, which we said initially, we thought might be $125 million over three years. We now are pretty convinced that, that's a conservative number. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be yet, and we'll give you more insight into that with guidance in 2025. But look, I mean, the best example is SG&A. We baked in about $40 million worth of SG&A synergies there in the original $125 million. And that takes their SG&A number from 22% of revenue down to 19%. We're reporting 8.9% ourselves today, so you can understand our optimism around synergies. And then John talked a lot about the use of technology. It's something that we probably five years ago, started recognizing that there was -- particularly with these trade type positions, there was kind of an impending shortage coming. And so we started investing in technology to -- when those positions would attrit away from us that we wouldn't have to replace them, that we would use technology. And hence, the investments that we've made over the last five years in technology. And those have really all started to show up. You've heard John talk a lot about, I think, you said four consecutive quarters of sub-61% OpEx as a percent of revenue. That is largely driven by our pricing programs, but also by our cost improvement on the efficiency side. You combine all of those plus still a pretty robust market out there for tuck-in acquisitions. And you can see why we're really, really optimistic. No matter what happens with the election, no matter what happens with the economy, barring a disastrous geopolitical events, we're very optimistic about 2025, 2026, 2027. Tyler Brown : Great color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thank you so much. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the revenue guidance raise. I know you don't give guidance quarterly, but 3Q was a little bit stronger than, I guess, what I was expecting. And so was the raise driven by 3Q performance? And why not? Is there anything that leads you to expect the momentum you had in the quarter won't continue into 4Q. It doesn't sound like it. So I just wanted to understand what was going into the thought process there? Thanks. Devina Rankin : So you're right that the third quarter was an outsized performance on the revenue line, and that and that really came from two things. It was recycled commodity prices and landfill volumes. We're optimistic that the landfill volume contribution continues into the fourth quarter. There wasn't anything specific or unusual about that growth. It's some strong market performance in kind of the Midwest part of our company and really good contribution margin from that business. The recycling commodity price piece of it is recycling brokerage contribution and with the port strike impacts that we saw late in the third quarter and some continuing uncertainty associated with those impacts going into fourth quarter. We're less optimistic that you'll see upside to recycling commodity prices continue into the quarter ahead or into 2025 at this point, it's too early for us to say. So really happy with the core business performance and the contributors from collection and disposal specifically, a little more cautious with regard to the recycling commodity price piece. So that is the lower flow-through part of the business, which is why we're still confident in the EBITDA contribution of that revenue growth. Jim Fish : And I think, Devina, we had a little bit of an offset from lower electricity pricing that hit the top-line for the quarter. So that would tell you that -- it's part of why we were as pleased with the performance at 7.9% growth there on the top-line. I think what it tells us, as we look out to 2025, is that there aren't any storm clouds on the horizon with respect to the economy. It's so hard to tell these days. Obviously, in an election year, it's really hard to tell because both sides are kind of giving their own talking points. But we're not seeing anything that would indicate storm clouds on the horizon for us. We feel like the economy is on relatively good footing. Toni Kaplan : Yes. That sounds great. I wanted to ask also on an update on the price cost spread and how you're thinking about how that progresses in the next few quarters? Thanks. John Morris : Yes. Toni, I think certainly, we're pleased. As I said in my prepared remarks, we remain on track with regard to our pricing objectives for the year. A few things I would point out is when you look at the spread to our you see that CPI is down, again, about 120 basis points for the quarter and 160 basis points year-to-date. And if you compare that to our core price and yield numbers, I think it tells a good story. And then to the comments you heard from Jim and Devina and I had shown up certainly in the margin. So long story short, we feel good about the kind of disciplined approach we're taking to pricing. The customer value lifetime model we're using from a data and analytics standpoint and when you look at -- as I mentioned, when you look at the spread, it continues to show up in OpEx and in margin. Jim Fish : And I think, too, John, the -- we've talked to Toni, a lot about 5,000 to 7,000 jobs kind of trading away from us. I mentioned it just briefly in response to Tyler's question. We're at about 2200, a little bit more than that 2241 to be precise since 2022, positions that we have chosen to not refill that left us via attrition and we've chosen not to refill those -- and we think, John, another potentially 3,000 so call it, fourth or fifth inning to use the baseball analogy is about where we are now, most of those coming out through recycling automation and then through this conversion from traditional rear load to automated side load. John Morris : Toni, the one final point I might make is while inflation is generally coming down, we're not seeing that with our frontline wages and that's part of the reason why you hear so much conviction about the continued investments in automation and technology, whether it's core business, whether it's recycling facilities, we're still seeing 4.5% to 5.5% on general wage inflation with those frontline roles. In fact, we heard from one of our AVPs during the quarterly reviews that we're hiring technicians, and that number starts with a four now and it's going to start with a five in terms of the rate per hour. So when you look at the investments we're making to try to be a little less labor dependent through attrition, as Jim mentioned, it kind of gives us that much more conviction about those investments. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thanks for the color and congrats on the quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jerry Revich : Hi. Good morning everyone. For those of us New Yorkers on the line, we'll ask for no more baseball analogies, please. So congratulations on the strong results. I just wanted to talk about the returns that we're seeing on recycling investments, is it possible just to get a sense for the savings per plant that we're budgeting in the program? What are we seeing as the plants are coming online. Typically, when you folks make these automation moves. We've seen the results of price on the upside. I'm wondering, is that starting to play out? And how should we be thinking about the per plant economics versus what you folks underwrote at the beginning of the program. Tara Hemmer : Well, what we can tell you is we're tracking a couple of key metrics. The first and we've said this consistently, the labor cost per ton is really in that 30% improvement range and that is consistent across all of our plants. The other thing that we're seeing is roughly 17% higher blended value on the commodities we sell. We're creating a cleaner product, and this is really important. If you think about the commodity prices that we're at today and we're expecting to end the year around $90 a ton. Our investment thesis was $1.25. So getting a higher blended value on our commodities is very important, and that's been proven out. The other thing that we track is our gross operating expenses, and those are also 17% improvement across the portfolio of automation plants. And then the other point that we don't talk about as much is volume. And we are seeing a volume growth story coming out of these investments, which was a pivotal piece of what we were going to be really offering to the communities that we have these investments in. And Q3 was one of the first quarters where we've seen that volume growth because we've had some impacts related to shutdowns. So we'll see that transfer across each year. So when you stack those together, we're seeing strong margin improvement on our recycling plants across the portfolio. Jim Fish : And that volume, Tara, is really a function of the plant processing faster, correct? Tara Hemmer : Exactly. So plants processing faster. We're also expanding the size of some of these plants as we're building them. And it's been a great story when we look at one of the markets John is going to be visiting later today in Minneapolis, where we've seen really, really strong volume growth in that market and then also EBITDA performance. Devina Rankin : I think it's really important to pull all of that together. Tara outlined all of the contributing factors. When we look at the thing that made us so confident in this investment strategy, it really was the payback period of the recycling investments relative to investments we make in our traditional collection and disposal assets. And we've always talked about the recycling investments being one of the best return on invested capital that we have across our portfolio. And we are seeing that not just hold, but accelerate. So we're really happy to see payback periods in that six to seven year range. And we've got confidence that with some of the outsized performance, particularly on throughput and volume, as Tara outlined, it's actually going to be better than what we had planned when we built the strategy despite the lower commodity price values. Jerry Revich : Super. And then in terms of the landfill gas facilities that are coming online, roughly speaking of spot market economics, I think that would imply roughly $150 million to $200 million in incremental EBITDA 2025 versus 2024 from these plants. Anything we should keep in mind in terms of your contracting strategy or any other moving pieces as we think about that 2025 versus 2024 bridge on that part of the investment? Tara Hemmer : Sure. I'm glad you brought that up because I think there's a tendency to look at the spot market prices for RINs. And just a reminder, we are taking a portfolio-based view of our RNG that we're producing. And one of the things that we outlined was to really work on contracting more of our volume. So today, we are at about 40% for 2025, and we expect to expand that over the balance of Q4 going into early 2025. And that is a mix of long-term offtake in the voluntary market with utilities and also our ability to forward sell 2025 RINs, and we've been able to do that successfully. So that gives us confidence in really any political environment, whether or not Trump or Harris gets elected, we're seeing strong forward selling on 2025 RINs. Jim Fish : It's probably also worth mentioning that just for everyone's kind of clarification on the plants themselves, we tend to think that once the CapEx stops and once the construction is complete, that all of a sudden, these are starting to produce revenue and EBITDA. And there are multiple steps afterwards that are largely outside of our control, the commissioning of the plant, in many cases, the testing of the gas coming out of the plant and then the final step, which is EPA approval of that plant. And while we'd like to think that all of those move efficiently, it is government. So in many cases, so it doesn't always move as efficiently as we would or as quickly as we would like, which I think is a credit Tara to your team that we're able to get the -- as many plants as we have 20 plants and still stay relatively close to the time lines that we've broadcast, but there are multiple steps beyond just the construction phase. Jerry Revich : Super. And Jim, can I ask you just one last one just to pull the thread on the Stericycle comments that you made earlier on the call. Can you just talk about over the course of diligence, what you folks think about the ability to implement lease management type pricing on that business and the ability to cross-sell. So very interesting to hear about the additional opportunity on the cost side. What do you think based on the diligence on the pricing part of equation? Devina Rankin : So as Jim mentioned earlier, all of our diligence and integration planning processes has really spoken to our bullishness with regard to the long-term strategic outlook of this business. With regard to pricing, what I would tell you, Jerry, is this integration planning hasn't been customer oriented. It's been more about bringing the two teams together, bringing our systems and processes together and thinking about how we can use the WM way of using technology to optimize our fleet using technology to optimize the back office in order to reduce the cost of serving in that business. We'll know more once the Stericycle team is part of WM about the runway and projections on revenue growth. But we still think that the overall investment thesis holds because we think that long-term medical waste is one of those parts of the U.S. economy where we're going to see an outsized growth. John Morris : Yes, Jerry, Devina touched on it, but I do think when you step back a little bit from it, it's there's elements of that business that fit very nicely over top of WM and if you kind of consider it a fourth line of collection business, right, in terms of trucks and maintenance and repair and labor and efficiency and all the things that we've talked to you folks about over the last couple of years, we think there's benefits down the road or we can overlay those investments and processes to drive some -- drive improvement on the operating side. Jerry Revich : Appreciate the discussion. Thank you. John Morris : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks very much. So in addition to Stericycle pending, you spent a lot on solid waste M&A this year. Can we talk a little bit about that, the types of businesses you're picking up? And then from a housekeeping standpoint, what the rollover contribution is on revenue for 2025 . John Morris : Yes, certainly. Yes. So we've had a strong year. We closed almost $800 million of acquisitions. I think on the last call we mentioned that we probably could be in the range of $1 billion. And we still feel good about the pipeline, whether that closes in Q4, it rolls a little bit into Q1 is yet to be determined, but we feel good about the pipeline and the deals that we have teed up I think important to note, we said this on the last call, there's a handful of markets we mentioned Arizona, the Carolinas, Florida and now the most recent acquisition of Winters Brothers in Long Island. Those are both represent not only good deals for us, but in strategic markets for a host of different reasons. So we feel really good about that. They're all performing very well to date and we're focused on trying to get the next handful of deals closed here in the next few months. Devina Rankin : And then, Noah, from a rollover perspective, we see about $150 million of rollover benefit to the revenue line, which we think will translate to about $35 million of EBITDA in 2025. Noah Kaye : Okay. Very helpful there. And then you know what, I'll just stick with short-term modeling housekeeping, so sort of 5% total revenue growth implied for 4Q, your yield trends should probably continue to be pretty healthy. You've got probably what, close to a point here on the M&A side. So it sounds like almost you think the volume could be kind of flattish. I know you had a tough comp because I think you had some cleanup volumes last year. But we also had some storms this year that might provide some opportunities. So just kind of baseline for us how you're thinking about organic trends for 4Q and whether there would be any upside to the volume side? Devina Rankin : So the volume story for 2024 has been one for us where the commercial collection business and MSW, which really speak to us about the general health of the overall economy has been really strong over the course of the year and consistent with expectations. The one soft spot for us has been those industrial hauls and they've been lighter than we expected and certainly, something that we hear in the marketplace about just a little more reservation on industrial investment in this environment. We think some of that could loosen up in the fourth quarter after there is clarity in the election, but yet to be determined and certainly not something that we're creating guidance outlook on. With respect to the revenue guide for the fourth quarter, it really isn't a volume story where we were reserved on top line relative to Q3, it was commodity price. And so I would tell you, the expectation is take those Q3 volumes that we saw and carry them into Q4 and early 2025 is what our outlook includes. Noah Kaye : All right, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question, coming from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Your line is open. Kevin Chiang : Hi and thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good Q3 print there. I was wondering if you could maybe provide any more color on the Canadian Competition Bureau review. It looks like it's the last one before you close on Stericycle. You've noted you feel comfortable you'll get that done in Q4 here. But just any color in terms of what they're looking at since they filed this? I think you do overlap on pharmaceutical destruction, but correct me if I'm wrong. Any color there would be helpful? Devina Rankin : So I would say it's typical competition reviews in the Canada market, specifically, nothing that concerns us with regard to the pathway to getting to close and I just have to say thank you to all of our team members who have been working really diligently both the legal team and the Canada operations leadership in order to work through these processes. And we're optimistic that we're going to be able to get that clearance here yet in the fourth quarter and move quickly to close. Kevin Chiang : That's helpful. And my second one here, good progress on these cost initiatives. If I look at your OpEx line items, a lot of them, if I look at it from a an intensity perspective, let's say, as a percentage of revenue, a lot of them are kind of back to where they were prior to this inflationary environment. Maybe the one thing that does stand out to me is maintenance and repairs tracking kind of mid- to high 9% as a percentage of revenue. I think we've seen that below 9% prior to the move in inflation. Just wondering if there's an opportunity to move that lower. Is there something structural there that keeps that a little bit more elevated in this new cost environment? John Morris : Yes, Kevin, I think that's fair. And you're starting to see, I think this quarter was a 40 basis point improvement in terms of maintenance and repairs. There's two sides to that. There's the fleet side and the non-fleet side. On the fleet side, we continue to -- a couple of things are benefiting us. One is truck deliveries have been more consistent now than they've really been since sort of pre-COVID. So it's allowing us to plan more strategically for assets coming into the system and going out of the system. I will add, when we talk about -- and this is a big part of our strategy, we talk about residential automation. The configuration of that vehicle replacing a rear loader can -- that truck day one is going to be more expensive to run than a traditional rear loader. But what's important to take away from that is we look at it both from an M&R perspective, but we also look at it from a total cost of operation on a per unit basis. So when you double plus the efficiency, we may be willing to pay more to maintain a more complicated vehicle with different technology in it if it's driving overall CPU performance, which you are seeing and you're clearly seeing it in the margins. In residential, I think I'm going off the top of my head here, but we were up about 300-plus basis points for the quarter on 2.9% less volume. And so when you wrap all that together, you're right, there are still opportunities in maintenance and repairs, but we do backstop that against sort of our overall total cost of operation goals. Devina Rankin : And year-to-date, our maintenance and repairs costs in this environment are flat effectively on a dollar basis. So it's a good indication of getting leverage off of the truck deliveries, and we expect that momentum to continue into the year ahead. Kevin Chiang : That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Trevor Romeo with William Blair. Your line is open. Trevor Romeo : Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions here. I thought maybe it was worth going back to the strong landfill volume growth in the quarter. Total depletable tons up 4%, the MSW up almost 6%. I think that was the strongest you've seen in a while. Devina, I think you mentioned there was some strength in the Midwest. But I was just wondering if you could talk about those landfill dynamics a bit more. Was there anything kind of unusual or onetime in the quarter? John Morris : Trevor, I would tell you, we saw a pretty consistent landfill performance through most of the organization. We pointed out there was three or four areas sort of in the middle of the country, if you will, that were the ones that drove the outside performance. One in particular is now a rail served operation that we got opened last year, and we're starting to see continued volume growth there, and that was a chunk of it. That really speaks to sort of the network planning aspect of what we do with our post-collection sites, and you folks have heard us talk about that a good bit. So one of the slugs, if you will, volume that helped us in the last couple of quarters is us opening up another intermodal facility in the Midwest. I think Jim commented too, our special waste volumes were strong and a good part of that volume was flowing through a handful of those same regions in the middle of the country. Trevor Romeo : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the sustainability CapEx sounds like that's going to come in a little bit higher than you anticipated earlier this year, the $950 million this year and then the $3 billion total. Just wondering, is the increase mostly related to cost inflation or something else there? Just any more details on what's driving that? Thank you. Tara Hemmer : It's a mix, primarily on the renewable natural gas side related to cost inflation on the construction of the plants and then also some higher cost on utility interconnects and those utility interconnects are for our electrical interconnect and our natural gas interconnect. So it's really those two categories. Devina Rankin : And then I would say the 2024 increase specifically relates to our intentional acceleration in some of the spending into Q4 as we complete these projects and accelerate the ongoing capital investment at the remaining portfolio. So that is really timing related. It's not an indication of the inflation that Tara spoke to. Jim Fish : But we're still on track, though to -- we said last quarter, we expected by the end of this year, we would have spent about 75% of the total capital. That is still the case, almost right at 75%. And then because of the lag, of course, we won't have realized the EBITDA. We will only have realized about 15%, a little bit more, about 15% or 16% of the EBITDA of that $800 million. So that's part of why we're so encouraged about 2025, 2026 and 2027 is that you really start to see not only the EBITDA growth, but also the free cash flow growth because the CapEx really goes away after -- for the most part goes away after next year and EBITDA really ticks up free cash. Trevor Romeo : Yes. Makes a lot of sense. Thank you everyone. Appreciate it. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Your line is open. David Manthey : Thank you. Good morning. It was asked earlier, and I'm not sure if I caught it, but did you quantify your expectations for the net impact from hurricanes in fourth quarter and into 2025? Or could you? John Morris : Yes, David. There's nothing right now that we've quantified for the balance of year or obviously 2025. These storms were obviously historic in a lot of ways, but first and foremost, our people are safe. Our assets were largely untouched first and foremost. In terms of the cleanup, we continue to talk the teams across the Southeast and specifically Florida. There may be some benefit down the road here, but I don't think it's going to be similar to anything we saw with Hurricane Ian, for example. But there's nothing in our outlook right now regarding any volume we would potentially get from those events. David Manthey : Okay. Thank you. And second, is the industrial vertical potential source of upside for you as we get into next year. So if industrial production starts growing low single digits, like maybe we saw in 2012 or 2018 coming out of a downturn, would you expect industrial volume growth to turn positive in that type of environment? Jim Fish : It's hard to say whether it would turn positive. But certainly, this quarter, we reported negative 4.1% for the roll-off line of business that -- and we've been pretty consistently in that negative 3.5% to negative 4.5% range. It does tell us that while the overall economy has been pretty healthy. The industrial economy, not so much, and that's a good -- that's been not a good, but certainly it's been sign of that. I think you can expect to start to see that come back. Now will it go positive? Don't know. That's a big number to make up. But I would expect that we'll start to see industrial come back. And by the time we get through the election cycle, there's -- the uncertainty is kind of out of the system, then I think we could start to see the industrial economy pick back up. Devina Rankin : And from a macro perspective, I do think some of the interest rate environment will be an interesting watch point for us with things like housing starts lagging recently. And if you could start to see some momentum there, although news out this morning isn't all that favorable. So it's one of the things that we have our eye on because this really is about the temporary side of the industrial part of the business rather than the permanent side. Jim Fish : On the other line of business, of course, that's been negative has been residential. So -- and that's more by design and that was down 2.9% for the quarter. It's been down in that range for, I don't know, John, two years. And I think John has been asked the question before, when do you expect that to get back to more of a breakeven. If that is by design, he even mentioned it in his script that we're some of the -- we're letting some of the business go that has been underperforming business. That's been ongoing for two or three years now. John, it's probably safe to say that we could expect to get back to flat maybe in the end of '25, early '26. Is that fair? John Morris : Yes. I mean the team has done a great job. We've got a really healthy inventory of contracts that are not performing up to par. And I think we'll continue to see -- it moderated a bit, if you look at year-to-date quarter-over-quarter a bit. But when you look, Jim, at the benefits from efficiency, safety and overall margin improvement, we're going to stay on this path until that line of business competes with the other collection lines, which has been kind of our mission since day 1. David Manthey : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question, coming from the line of Konark Gupta with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Konark Gupta : Thanks for taking my question and echo my congratulations on a good quarter. I wanted to follow up on sustainability CapEx. So just like two parts maybe there. I think if I remember correctly, your original $2.2 billion CapEx envelope was, I think, 50-50 RNG and recycling. Today, that's about $3 billion total. What's the split like between RNG and recycling there? And then I think you mentioned that 75% of the CapEx will be done by the end of this year, is 75% of the $3 billion, that's a new number or that's $2.2 million. Tara Hemmer : Yes. So the original number, the breakdown was roughly $1.2 billion from renewable energy and $1 billion from recycling. And so today, the increased number to $3 billion the 75% is based on the $3 billion and the split is roughly $1.4 billion for recycling and 1.6 for renewable energy. Jim Fish : Portion of that difference, though, Tara, is -- I mean, some of it's inflation, but a portion of it is, for example, in Ontario, right? I mean it's new plants. So it's not really an apples-to-apples when you compare the $3 billion to the $2.2 billion, a piece of it is that's related to inflation, but a piece of it is adding new facilities. Tara Hemmer : Adding new facilities. That's a great point, Jim. And also, we changed the plants within the renewable energy portfolio, so the plan slightly different. And that's one of the reasons, if you go back to the Investor Day deck, we were projecting $740 million in EBITDA, and that got moved to $800 million. So it's one of the reasons why that was more contact setting if you go back to the Investor Day, but the numbers that we've outlined and the mix of plants on both sides are different. Konark Gupta : Okay. That's great. Thanks. And if I can quickly follow up on housekeeping on margin side of things, so 3.5% was a great number for Q3. Obviously, your implied Q4 is about 30%, call it, maybe you can do a little bit better there. But exiting '24, you're looking at 30-ish kind of margin right now. knowing what you know today and like post-election, clarity, et cetera, is it fair to expect that your margins can trend sort of in line with what you have seen historically in terms of expansion in 2025 organically, excluding Stericycle? Devina Rankin : Yes, it's a great question, and thank you for excluding Stericycle because it's too early for us to say. But so what I would tell you is over the long term, we've targeted 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion in the collection and disposal business. And when we look ahead, all the conversation about the strong execution on efficiency and retention that have driven the best operating expense as a percentage of revenue really that we've seen in our company's history, we expect that to continue, and we expect that to be a driver of continued growth in the year ahead. So one caveat that I have to that, and it is an important one because it's larger for us than it is for our competitors, is there is the expiration of the alternative fuel tax credit in 2025. That's about $60 million of EBITDA and a 30 basis point headwind to margin in the year ahead. So the 50 to 100, I would tell you, bring down by that 30 basis points for the range. But we're targeting that same execution for 2025. And then when we look at the sustainability businesses, that's incremental upside for us. And we see the sustainability businesses -- the renewable energy business provided 30 basis points of margin expansion for us in the third quarter of 2024. And we think when we look ahead, to a full year contribution from the five facilities that Jim and Tara have talked about bringing online by the end of 2024, we see another 30 basis points of expansion from this level. Konark Gupta : That\u2019s great. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of James Schumm with TD Cowen. Your line is open. James Schumm : Hi. Good morning. Thanks guys. So you touched on this, but now that you've had some more time to spend on Stericycle, I'm wondering if there's a reason why this business might require a structurally higher SG&A cost structure as a percentage of sales relative to WM? Devina Rankin : So I think it's really a great point, and it's one that we're not taking for granted. And I think it's their ERP journey is one that has gotten a lot of attention, rightfully so, both internally and externally and bringing all of their disparate businesses onto a single platform has been a significant undertaking, and we're commending them for all of that hard work and that effort. What I would tell you is that when you have that kind of an undertaking for call it, a $2.5 billion to $3 billion revenue business and you compare that to a similar undertaking for a $20 billion-plus business, that's one of the things that will be structurally different between the two. And we anticipated that when we evaluated the acquisition opportunity. That really is the one that we think stands out. The rest of it, we think there's tremendous opportunity and upside to use the WM Way, so to speak, in order to optimize SG&A as a percentage of revenue long term. Jim Fish : Well, you've said before, Devina, that's really the ultimate comparison. Once you get past the ERP rollout, the ultimate comparison would be to one of our areas as opposed to our corporate SG&A, which came in at 8.9%. And our areas, James, operated 5%. So it's why we're enthusiastic about what SG&A as a percent of revenue can look like for us and what the synergies are associated with that. I think Tara makes the right point about -- not Tara, Devina makes the right point about the ERP and that having to get fully rolled out and there being costs associated with that. But once that is complete, then there's no reason to start that we wouldn't start to think about the Stericycle arm of our business looking more like one of our areas. James Schumm : With respect to OCC, can you update us on the portion of the value that, that makes up in your recycling revenues? And has that changed at all with your new recycling facility upgrades? Tara Hemmer : So it represents about 55% to 60% of our overall blended value. And what has changed over time with our automated investment is we're able to capture a bit more OCC through some of the quality improvements that we've made in our plans and move really more of our mixed paper to a higher-value product. So that's been a real bright spot for us when you think about our automation investments. James Schumm : Thank you, Tara. And just to clarify. So OCC and mixed paper sort of office paper that all sort of -- are you saying like the fiber base is 55% to 60% of the value or just OCC. Tara Hemmer : Yes. James Schumm : All together. Tara Hemmer : Yes. James Schumm : Just OCC specifically. Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. If the normalization process for fleet supply chain and employee retention has normally played out. Do you think there's an incremental opportunity for retention to improve further into next year? And I was hoping you could contrast the company's experience with what you're seeing in fleet, supply chain and employee retention and sort of labor expense in the potential acquisition targets that you look at. John Morris : Yes, it's a good point. I think, as I mentioned earlier, the fact that we frankly have a stability in our fleet delivery schedule we haven't had in a number of years is really paying dividends, not just on total M&R as percentage or CPU, but also in our ability to really manage our asset base better and make sure that we're optimizing the number of assets we have in this case vehicles. I mentioned the one area of pressure, we still see specific to M&R and really across labor is still wage pressure. That's probably in the 4.5% to 5.5%, maybe 6% in some markets. So we continue to obviously make the necessary adjustments there. And I think the punch line is our retention for drivers and technicians is around 19%. It's a little lower for drivers, little higher for technicians. But even in that environment, we're still bringing the defection of our employees down, which is obviously having a big benefit. And then lastly, with respect to the -- some of the operations we've purchased, I mentioned a few that we've done this year. While they've been really, really well-run companies, I think one of the places we get leverage out of is what you've heard Jim and Devina I referenced, which is sort of our WM Way playbook. And we see that as a way to capture additional value when we go into even a well-run operation. But we put the strength of our supply chain, our operating team and all the tools and technology they come with. That's one of the areas we continue to see upside. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. And with -- what are your thoughts about incremental investments into harvesting the remaining MMBtus in the company's portfolio, understanding that near-term, you've got cash uses related to acquisition-led growth that may mean it's not sort of a near-term choice. Tara Hemmer : So we've actively looked at and we have a beat on how much landfill gas that we have that we could really convert into R&D through new investments. And it's important to note the first 20 that we built, they tend to be larger plants where we had more landfill gas. So we're taking a much more prescriptive approach on the next tranche and really evaluating whether or not we should be developing them ourselves or perhaps leveraging a partner for those. That's something we'll likely make a decision on in 2025. Devina Rankin : I think it's really important to make a statement about the cash flow generation power of this business. While we're going to see a step change in our leverage with the closing of the Stericycle acquisition, we expect to return to target leverage ratios within 18 to 24 months of closing the transaction. And really, when you step back and look at the fact that before adding Stericycle to WM and before the step change that we're talking about coming in 2027 in free cash flow associated with the sustainability businesses, we're generating over $3 billion annually in free cash flow. And so that indicates our ability to use, call it, $6 billion over a 2-year period in order to meet the dividend and then have substantial free cash flow for the benefit of growth, for the benefit of balance sheet rationalization, it just speaks to the strong fundamentals of this business and our ability to have strategic runway in the sustainability business if we continue to see the return profile of those opportunities present themselves at the highest and best use of our funds. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks and good morning. Just a quick question on the investment tax credits related to a lot of these investments. Our understanding is these are sort of being accrued. Is there any risk to those with the change in administration? Or just kind of if you can highlight the process to getting those paid or just guaranteed? Thanks. Devina Rankin : Yes. So we're not thinking about there being risk associated with the change in administration. But that certainly is something that could be on the table, but it's very difficult for us to be able to project. But with regard to what we've been accruing, there's $145 million in 2024, and that's showing up both as a reduction in cash taxes and a reduction in our provision on the income statement. We see the downside risk associated with really two things. One is solely timing. And if we saw one of our projects slip into 2025 in the first quarter. We wouldn't get that [technical difficulty] the complexity of the IRA and specifically, the applicability of the domestic content rules. We've evaluated those, and we think that the team is doing all of the right work, but the devils in the details when it comes to tax legislation. And so while we think we've done the right thing, it will come down to interpretation. We've taken that that into account as well in providing our guidance, but won't be finalized within a year. That will be something that continues as we have the IRS review our findings. Tara Hemmer : And just as a reminder, that last part that Devina mentioned, it's the difference between 30% and 40%. And so we're confident we would get the 30%. It's really just the difference between 30% and 40% on ITC. Sabahat Khan : Great. I appreciate that color. And then just a question as a follow-up to the earlier discussion around base business margin improvement and the offsetting impact from Stericycle. I guess as you get a closer look at the business, would you come back maybe after it closes potentially Q4 reporting and maybe give a path towards how long it may take to get consolidated margins sort of back in positive territory? Or is that something may evolve over a few years? Just trying to get an understanding of how you think about consolidated margins and the journey over the next couple of two to three years or however you look at it? Thanks. Jim Fish : Yes. I think what we'll do is -- I mean there -- I believe the last I looked, their margins are kind of in the 16%, 17% range, something like that. So -- and when you start looking at the opportunities we have with synergies. We have not, as Devina said earlier, had a chance to look at their customer base at all. So we don't know what that means in terms of cross-selling or any of the top line. But we do think that we can improve it from where it is today, their margins are today because of those things. I think it will take us at least until February to be able to assess what Stericycle we think will look like for -- obviously, for 2025, but into 2026, 2027. When we'll be able to get back to kind of 30% on a combined basis is a little hard to say. As Devina said, you do have something working in our favor, which is the sustainability businesses and then our own improvement through the use of technology, and John has gone through a lot of the operating improvements. So you've got things working in both directions. I think it's very hard to say what the margin will be right now. But I think when we get to February and we give guidance, we can give you a better idea of that. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks very much for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. One maybe high-level strategic question for me. I appreciate maybe the incremental commentary provided about the updated productivity at your new recycling facilities, whether it's productivity or throughput or the like. Is there any way you could then frame what some of these facilities are doing from a margin standpoint? Obviously, it wouldn't be completely apples-to-apples given allocating corporate costs, but just so we can think about truly what the margin differential is kind of pre and post upgrades? Thank you. Devina Rankin : So rather than give you specific margins on the business, what I think is important is that we bring it all together and say from a return on invested capital perspective and a margin expansion perspective, we've effectively seen a 10 percentage point increase in the margin of the business post automation, and that's a really strong indication of the power of the technology. And whether that be top line growth or middle of the P&L management cost reduction, we're seeing the benefits on each part of the model, and that's about a 10 percentage point lift in margin. Stephanie Moore : Great. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. On OCC pricing expectations for the fourth quarter, what are your underlying assumptions embedded in those? Tara Hemmer : Our underlying assumptions for our blended commodity basket in Q4 is $85 a ton. Stephanie Moore : Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Last question is coming from the line of Brian Butler with Stifel. Your line is open. Brian Butler : Hi. Good morning, Waste Management. Thanks for fitting me in. Tara Hemmer : Good morning. Brian Butler : Just one last quick one, I guess, on the commodity side. Now that you've kind of improved the facilities in automation, do you have a sensitivity to commodity price? So if that $85 changes, how should we think about the impact on maybe an annualized EBITDA? Tara Hemmer : Well, the way to think about it, and we've said this previously, is about 60% of the benefit related to our automation plans is really independent of commodity prices, and that's the labor cost. That's the uplift that we get on blended values because we're producing a higher-quality product. And we're definitely seeing those flow through when we bring these automated plants online. So there's less of a sensitivity to commodity prices, but there still is a sensitivity that exists in the business. Brian Butler : Okay. And then I guess on the automation side, on the automated routes, you talked about 800 routes over the last couple of years being automated. Can you put that in perspective, how many more routes could be automated and how long would something like that take? John Morris : I think we've got about 11 more 100 routes that are eligible to be automated. And I would tell you, it's at least two years and probably into the third year before we cycle through all of them. But as I mentioned, I mean, from an efficiency margin safety standpoint, go down the list, we're even though we're trading off a little bit of volume, it's obviously from an investment perspective, been a fantastic effort by the team. Jim Fish : Some of it, John, is a function of the contract itself. It's not necessarily getting the truck, but it's the contract expiration. If you've got a contract that is a three-year contract that is pick up everything contract and you're going to transition to an ASL contract that has to be negotiated by the public sector team and at the end of the existing good project. Operator : Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Fish, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. Jim Fish : Okay. Well, thank you so much for your great questions today. We feel very good about the quarter. We feel very optimistic about the remainder of the year and into 2025, 2026, 2027. We're excited to be in this business at this point. But thank you very much. We will talk to you soon, and talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to WM\u2019s President and CEO, Jim Fish. Jim Fish : All right. Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report another year of outsized operational and financial performance driven by our team\u2019s focus on topline growth and cost discipline. This combination, along with our ongoing investments in technology, automation and sustainability, have positioned WM to continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders. In 2024, we remained dedicated to optimizing the cost structure, expanding our sustainability platform and enhancing shareholder returns. This focus led us to achieve operating EBITDA growth of more than 10% in our Legacy Business for the year and achieving 30% full year operating EBITDA margin for the first time in our history. Our Collection and Disposal business led the way, driven by consistent organic revenue growth, disciplined cost initiatives and a continued focus on business mix optimization. 2024 marked a year of significant milestones in progressing sustainability growth investments. We brought five renewable natural gas facilities online, expanding our renewable energy platform and further positioning WM as a leader in environmental sustainability. And we\u2019re confident in the demand for renewable natural gas, especially from sources like our landfills and in our overall investment thesis for these transformative assets. Additionally, in 2024, we advanced automation upgrades at 10 recycling facilities, improving throughput and lowering operating costs across our recycling network, and added recycling facilities in two new markets. These investments are unlocking opportunities with customers and delivering positive environmental outcomes while also putting us on a path to broader long-term financial growth. We\u2019re progressing well on the remaining renewable natural gas and recycling projects and expect our growth investments to contribute operating EBITDA approaching $800 million in 2027. We have a great deal of confidence in the value of these projects that are underway, and we\u2019re enthusiastic about the strong complement they provide to our existing business. In addition to achieving strong organic growth across our business in 2024, it was a sizable year for acquisitions, including the successful completion of the Stericycle acquisition in November. Adding Stericycle\u2019s leading platform in medical waste management and secure information destruction to WM broadens our suite of solutions, allowing us to more comprehensively serve our customers across a wider range of environmental services. Our integration efforts are underway, and in a short three months, we\u2019ve integrated the commercial operations support and back office functions into WM\u2019s structures, led by our season\u2019s disciplined leaders. One of our new employees summed up our excitement for this acquisition saying, it really feels good to be working for a management team that\u2019s looking to grow and optimize the business. We have a well-resourced, experienced WM team engaged in making the necessary operational and cultural changes, and we\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made so far. With respect to synergy capture, we now expect $250 million of synergies over a three-year period and we\u2019re confident we can deliver up to $100 million in 2025. The WM Healthcare Solutions business is expected to grow about 9% before synergies, driven by organic revenue growth and operations initiatives. Overall, we remain confident and focused on ensuring a smooth transition for both employees and customers, while driving synergies and unlocking value. This acquisition exemplifies our disciplined approach to capital allocation and strategic growth, and we\u2019re excited about the long-term benefits it will bring to WM. Looking ahead to 2025, we\u2019re confident that the momentum we\u2019ve built will lead to another year of outpaced growth. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect our Collection and Disposal business to produce more than 7% operating EBITDA growth in the year ahead, even as we face a headwind from the expiration of alternative fuel tax credits. Our disciplined focus on pricing and cost management will ensure that we maintain healthy margins with a positive price-to-cost spread. Our renewable energy and recycling platforms will continue to scale, with additional projects coming online and incremental contributions from sustainability investments expected to accelerate this year, adding $150 million to operating EBITDA growth in our sustainability segments. Combining all of this, we expect to deliver total company operating EBITDA growth of 15% at the midpoint of our range or nearly $1 billion of growth in 2025 compared to 2024. Before I turn the call over to John to cover operating results, I want to express my gratitude to the entire WM team, including our new team members from Stericycle. Their commitment to our mission and values continues to be the foundation of our success. As we look forward, we\u2019re excited about the opportunities ahead and remain steadfast in our goal of creating long-term value for all of our stakeholders. I\u2019ll now hand it over to John to provide more detail on our operational performance. John Morris : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Before discussing our performance, I want to thank our team for their dedication during the devastating California wildfires. These fires have impacted our employees and the communities we serve, and we\u2019re committed to supporting recovery efforts and restoring normalcy for everyone affected. Turning to our results, WM delivered another fantastic quarter to close 2024, reflecting our focus on operational discipline and price execution. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 60.3%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter below 61%. Our full year result of 60.7% was below 61% for the first time in WM\u2019s history and improved 100 basis points from 2023. This improvement was driven by strong execution by our team, as well as automation and technology adoption. Labor efficiency continued to improve during 2024, with labor costs as a percentage of revenue declining by 60 basis points for the full year compared to 2023, which is particularly notable considering the dilutive impacts from the Winters Brothers and Stericycle acquisitions. Our labor cost improvements stem from our commitment to human-centered leadership, process discipline, and importantly, the introduction of technology that allows our operational leaders to spend more time in the field. Our annualized driver turnover as of December was the lowest ever at 15%, marking an improvement of over 300 basis points from 2023. Additionally, advances in route automation and resource planning tools have driven labor savings. Since we started our residential optimization effort in 2022, we have automated over 500 residential routes and exited an additional 400 routes where conversion was not an option or profit margins were challenged. The outcome has been reduced labor dependency while greatly enhanced safety performance and improved customer service. Combining these efforts have translated in our residential line of business operating EBITDA margin, growing more than 400 basis points and approaching 20% for the full year. We\u2019re pleased with the considerable progress we made in 2024 on automating routes, shedding lower margin business and improving driver turnover, and will be focused in the year ahead on maintaining the value we\u2019ve captured from these efforts. Repair and maintenance costs also declined as a percentage of revenue thanks to increased truck deliveries, fleet optimization, and a streamlined maintenance approach that increased technician productivity and reduced reliance on rental units and third-party services. We remain focused on optimizing our business using data, technology and process discipline to enhance our customers\u2019 experience while reducing our cost to serve. Our operational achievements combined with discipline pricing led to a 10.4% growth in operating EBITDA in our Collection and Disposal business in 2024, achieving a 37.2% margin for the year, our highest ever. These results exceeded our original growth projections with margins expanding 200 basis points and delivering nearly $700 million in operating EBITDA growth in our Collection and Disposal business. This is impressive performance and -- this impressive performance underscores our team\u2019s focused execution of strategic priorities. Our revenue grew across all lines of business supported by a Collection and Disposal yield of 4.5% and core price of 6.7% with churn remaining at about 9%. We continue to refine the use of data and analytics to maximize customer lifetime value to deliver pricing performance in line with our cost to serve our customers while meeting our margin objectives. Throughout the year, volume grew consistently in our key lines of business, commercial and MSW landfill. Our workday adjusted volume finished the year as expected and net service increases remained positive. For the year, MSW volumes grew steadily with an observed acceleration in the second half of the year. The 4.4% annual increase in MSW volumes demonstrate the value of expand -- our expanding network and logistical capabilities as evidenced by our expanded rail operations serving the Midwest. Special waste also showed positive momentum indicating growth potential for 2025 as our pipelines remain strong. While our industrial business remains soft, we are rolling out disciplined growth programs to enhance volume capture at appropriate pricing levels which gives us confidence in our outlook for 2025. As we look ahead to 2025, our focus is on building upon our success in 2024. Our priorities include further improving operational efficiency in our core Collection and Disposal business and maximizing growth opportunities from acquisitions and sustainability investments. Additionally, our core fleet, business optimization, and revenue management leadership are now embedded into the WM Healthcare Solutions organization, driving a disciplined integration process. With these efforts, we are confident in our ability to drive continued revenue and operating EBITDA growth while delivering value to our shareholders and customers. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect sustained momentum in our disciplined pricing programs resulting in a core price increase of between 5.8% and 6.2% and yielded between 4% and 4.2% with Collection and Disposal volume between 0.25% and 0.75% compared to 2024. We remain committed to maximizing customer lifetime value, securing pricing that exceeds our cost inflation, and driving disciplined volume growth. In closing, I extend my gratitude to our dedicated team members whose hard work and commitment have been instrumental in our success. Together, we\u2019ll continue to build on this year\u2019s achievements, striving for excellence in all that we do. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2024 financial results and 2025 financial outlook in further detail. Devina Rankin : Thanks, John, and good morning. We\u2019re proud of our 2024 results, building on our commitment to operational excellence, sustainability leadership and shareholder value creation through targeted growth. We improved operating EBITDA margin by 80 basis points for the year. This strong result was driven by margin expansion of 200 basis points in the Collection and Disposal business with about 180 basis points from the benefits of price, cost optimization and intentional shedding of low margin residential business. The remaining improvement in Collection and Disposal margin was from lower fuel costs. The record growth from Collection and Disposal business -- our Collection and Disposal business was partially offset by the impact of higher commodity pricing in the recycling brokerage business, increased incentive compensation costs, higher employee health and welfare costs, and the addition of Stericycle, each affecting the margin measure by about 30 basis points. Cost efficiency remained a central theme in 2024. Our SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 9.6% for the full year, including a 30-basis-point headwind from the addition of WM Healthcare Solutions. Compared to 2023, we achieved a 10-basis-point improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue for our Legacy Business, largely through discipline and discretionary spending and targeted optimization of customer engagement costs. Our strong operating performance translated into robust cash flow generation in 2024. Cash flow from operations grew more than 14% to $5.39 billion, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments reached $3.27 billion, marking a 22.5% increase over 2023. These outcomes highlight our focuses on margin expansion, working capital optimization and disciplined capital expenditure investment. In 2024, we returned $1.47 billion to shareholders, including more than $1.2 billion in dividends. Additionally, we acquired Stericycle and invested about $800 million in tech and acquisitions to expand our traditional solid waste and recycling footprint, all while funding $950 million in sustainability growth initiatives. Our disciplined approach to allocating capital prioritizes growing shareholder returns by identifying investment opportunities that will drive long-term growth at attractive returns. The strategic growth of our sustainability business and a targeted investment in healthcare demonstrate this focus, and we expect 2025 to be a year of outsized operating EBITDA growth as a result. As Jim outlined, we expect to grow operating EBITDA by 15% in a year, which we anticipate translating into robust cash from operations and free cash flow. Capital expenditures for 2025 are targeted at between $3.175 billion and $3.275 billion, with about $625 million directed toward high-return sustainability growth projects and about $225 million for our WM Healthcare Solutions business. We expect free cash flow to grow more than 17% to $2.725 billion at the midpoint of our outlook. This outlook includes an anticipated benefit from investment tax credits of about $220 million. WM\u2019s strong balance sheet and our cash flow growth outlook position us to continue our commitment to sound capital allocation. Our outlook includes $100 million to $200 million of investment in solid waste acquisitions and estimated dividend payments of about $1.3 billion. We\u2019ve paused share buyback as we expect to focus on getting the balance sheet back to targeted leverage levels with a combination of earnings growth and debt reduction. By the end of 2025, we expect leverage to be approximately 3.1 times. In summary, 2024 showcased the strength and resilience of WM\u2019s people and our business model, driven by our commitment to operational excellence, disciplined capital management and sustainability leadership. I\u2019d like to extend my gratitude to our dedicated team members whose hard work make these achievements possible. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities ahead and confident in our ability to deliver strong results for 2025 and in future years. With that, Olivia, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Tyler Brown : Hey. Good morning. Jim Fish : Good morning. John Morris : Good morning. Devina Rankin : Good morning. Tyler Brown : Hey. I promised to ask a question on the business, but Devina, can you help me with a couple of bridge items? So, first, I think, I heard it, but you are assuming a C&D tax credit headwind. Is that correct and is that like $60 million? Devina Rankin : Yes. That\u2019s correct. It\u2019s a $63 million headwind in dollars and a 30-basis-point headwind in margin. Tyler Brown : Excellent. Okay. And then on Stericycle, I think, you\u2019re including $400 million of incremental EBITDA, which means you\u2019re going to do something like $460 million, if I take the Q4 number. Devina Rankin : That\u2019s correct. Tyler Brown : Is that -- okay. So, number one, is that including $100 million of realized synergies or is that a run rate? And then two, was there a definitional change in how you calculate EBITDA for Stericycle versus their convention, because it feels like the base EBITDA is just lower than what they were reporting or am I off on that? Devina Rankin : Yeah. Those are great questions, Tyler, and thanks for pointing them out. So, I\u2019ll take the second one first. And yes, there was a definitional change in EBITDA between the two companies. We have, I would say, I guess, a more conventional approach to what we adjust out of earnings and we found that they adjusted things that look more like normal course of business costs and so we\u2019ve recast that. And so, the 2024 run rate number that we had for the business exiting the year was representative of that $61 million, with about $4 million of realized synergies in the fourth quarter for us. And so, I would recommend using that as the starting point for 2025. We\u2019re optimistic about synergy capture in the year ahead and we think up to $100 million will be realized in the year. Our midpoint assumes $85 million to $90 million of realization. Tyler Brown : Excellent. Okay. Great. Okay. I don\u2019t know if Tara\u2019s there, and I apologize, but I just kind of can\u2019t get the Waste Management sustainability contribution to foot, because I think last quarter you said sustainability was $92 million benefit year-to-date, but then in the release today, you said, again, $92 million for 2024. So, was there no incremental sustainability contribution in Q4 or am I missing something, which I probably am, but if I look at your table and allocate the recycling fees and the royalties, it looks more like EBITDA was up $110 million. I hate to throw that many numbers out, but maybe you\u2019re following what I\u2019m saying. Tara Hemmer : I am in the room. Hi, Tyler, and\u2026 Tyler Brown : Hi, Tara. Tara Hemmer : Yes. You\u2019re following the right math. There\u2019s a couple things that are going on between the segments and what we report, and of course, on the recycling side of the business, a piece of it ends up in Collection and Disposal, and then you have the 15% royalty that flows to the Collection and Disposal business. What we really want to emphasize for 2025 is there\u2019s a lot of tailwinds in both of these businesses that gives us a lot of optimism about what we\u2019re going to contribute in 2025, $190 million coming from those growth investments and\u2026 Tyler Brown : Okay. Tara Hemmer : \u2026 like Jim said, if you look at how much we\u2019ve delivered at the end of 2024, that\u2019s going to roll into 2025 with the new R&G plants and the 12 recycling facilities, plus we have another eight on the R&G side in 2025. There\u2019s a lot of positive impact that\u2019s going to roll through the P&L. Tyler Brown : Okay. That is helpful. Last question. This is for Jim or John, because it sounds like Collection and Disposal organic EBITDA is expected to be up something like 7% despite the C&D tax credit headwind. Obviously, that is super solid. You guys said back at your last Analyst Day, you\u2019re a 5% to 7% organic grower, and quite frankly, you\u2019ve got pretty tough comps, so that\u2019s really good. Can you talk about the core dynamics, maybe the outlook for pricing, maybe more importantly, cost inflation and productivity, because it just feels like there\u2019s a very solid price-to-cost spread in Collection and Disposal? Thank you. Jim Fish : Yeah. So it\u2019s Jim. I think you\u2019ve highlighted probably the area that maybe we\u2019re most proud of, which is the core business itself. We talk a lot about Stericycle and the sustainability businesses, which are exciting. But the core business, if you think about it, from 2022 to 2023 grew 7%, grew 10% last year, just the core and then we\u2019re looking at another over 7% this year on the core. So well ahead of that 5% to 7% number that we gave way back in 2019. And that is coming, as you point out, really from several areas. We talk a lot about pricing, and our pricing team does a great job, but look, that cost-to-price spread is not just price. It is cost, and John mentioned it in his script, and John\u2019s kind of a modest guy, but I mean, his team has done a spectacular job of taking that cost number. If you think about that OpEx as a percent of revenue coming under 61%, years ago, we kind of aspirationally talked about a 60% number and then kind of laughed in the room about that and said, yeah, well, that\u2019ll never happen. We\u2019re kind of scratching at that right now. We\u2019re close. So a lot of the cost-to-price spread and a lot of the margin growth that you\u2019ve seen in the business over the last few years and ultimately those growth -- EBITDA growth numbers that I just cited are coming on the cost side at the same time as we\u2019re doing well on price. And I think once you start to see volume pick up, because volume has been pretty muted over the last couple of years, you really can see the core business taking off at the same time as the old Stericycle business, the new WM Healthcare Solutions takes off, and at the same time as the sustainability investments really start to add EBITDA and free cash flow. John Morris : The only thing I would add, Tyler or Jim, to cover it all is I think a lot of the benefits you\u2019re seeing play out in the middle of the P&L for WM. I think Rafa and the team are really excited to do the same with the WM Healthcare businesses. A lot of the processes and practices and technology advantages we\u2019ve developed that we can lay right over the top of that business and start to drive some meaningful results, and Rafa can comment on that, but you saw in the press release our confidence around this synergy capture over the next handful of years. Tyler Brown : Yeah. Perfect. So it feels like, call it, 4% yield in Collection and Disposal and maybe a couple percent unit cost inflation net of productivity, something like that. John Morris : Yeah. I think what you saw from a spread perspective and it showed up in our OpEx and our EBITDA margins and our labor ratios, you\u2019re going to see that. You\u2019re going to see continued benefits into 2025. Tyler Brown : Okay. Excellent. Thank you for the time, guys. Devina Rankin : Thank you, Tyler. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye : All right. Thanks. I\u2019ll pick up on Tyler\u2019s line of questioning. Just the 2025 yield guide, 4% to 4.2%, obviously we\u2019ve seen CPI come down a little bit. So just help us understand maybe the different components of core price and yield assumptions that you\u2019re factoring in open market versus the sort of restricted index part of the business? Devina Rankin : Sure. So at a high level, I think what\u2019s really important on the core price to yield conversion, that\u2019s something that we talk a lot about. And the commentary in John\u2019s prepared remarks about what\u2019s happening in the landfill part of the business is a really important example of that conversion. And what you see is it really comes down to business mix and that\u2019s very good profitable business for us, but it does come at a lower yield because it\u2019s a lower average unit rate than some of the rest of the network. And so the core price guide is 5.8% to 6.2%, a little lower conversion this year at 4% to 4.2% with business mix being one of the things that\u2019s leading that. John Morris : Yeah. I guess the only thing I would add is on the resi side, I mean, we\u2019ve done such a great job on resi, but I was maybe a little surprised to even see this number myself. But Noah, when we look at, we\u2019ve been going through this, call it a business improvement process with residential improve margins significantly in that line of business. And the number that surprised me was that 25% of our residential customers still have an even margin of zero or less. And sometimes we ask, what inning are we in in terms of this residential, I don\u2019t know what to call it, cleanup, I guess. But if it\u2019s 25%, then I was assuming we were kind of in the eighth inning. We\u2019re probably more like in the sixth inning to use a baseball analogy and that all helps us on the price front. Noah Kaye : Yeah. Helpful. Thank you. Stericycle, now WMHS, you previously, I think, did a nice job of bucketing the different areas where you were going to see those synergies. Can you maybe give us an updated breakdown now, obviously, between sort of going from $50 million to now maybe $100 million this year and going to $250 million overall, just kind of how does that break down? Where do the cost synergies come from? Rafa Carrasco : Yeah. I think I can take a stab at that, Noah. This is Rafa Carrasco. I\u2019m now leading the WM Healthcare Solutions business. So what I\u2019ll tell you is the doubling of the synergy estimates is centered essentially around the same three buckets that we offered at the time of the acquisition. That was internalization, SG&A and OpEx, which we said at the time was about 33% each. Internalization is about the same value now, but we now see meaningfully larger SG&A opportunities and higher OpEx opportunities. Examples I\u2019ll give you up on the SG&A side, optimization of the sales coverage, which we\u2019ve already embarked on, on the shredded business. And on the OpEx side, we\u2019ve uncovered new opportunities for consolidating recycling capacity in the network and then reducing fleet number while working on bringing the maintenance and repair in-house. Noah Kaye : Yeah. Very helpful. Just one last one, maybe for Devina. You gave us some nice pieces around what provides free cash flow this year in the guide, but I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any other moving pieces we could consider to bridge from EBITDA to at least operating cash flow. Maybe you can touch on interest expense, tax and some of the other items we would normally look at? Devina Rankin : Yeah. So it\u2019s going to be another great year of free cash flow growth. There\u2019s a couple of points that I\u2019d like to make. One is we always talk about EBITDA being the long pole in the tent with regard to free cash flow conversion and with almost a $1 billion of EBITDA growth expected in the year ahead, we\u2019re going to have another great conversion to more cash flow from operations. The two things that will offset that are increased cash interest and we expect that to be $350 million to $400 million higher in 2025. And about $300 million of that is related to the Stericycle acquisition. The remainder is just timing related and so we had more of that pulled in, or we had more help from that in 2024, and you\u2019ll have more of a run rate for a full year in the year ahead. And then on the cash tax side, it\u2019s an interesting story because this growth in pre-tax income is fantastic and usually comes at a pretty high incremental cost from a cash tax perspective, but we\u2019re seeing some offsets of that because we have a higher expectation for ITC in 2025. So total cash taxes will go up about $75 million to $100 million, and that\u2019s the plus from higher ITC slightly offsetting the higher pre-tax income impact. And then the only other thing I would point to is working capital was a fantastic result in 2024, and we do think that some of the strong execution by the team on improving our key steps like DSO and DPO is what\u2019s contributing to that, but some of it is also timing related, and we think we got some of that timing benefit in Q4 that\u2019s impacting rollover into the first part of 2025, which is why 2025 may look a little muted in terms of the level of growth. Noah Kaye : Well, thank you for all this, and I just want to say thanks as well for providing all the additional details in the release that the businesses obviously continue to transform and grow, and you\u2019ve given us a lot of information. So appreciate it. Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you, Noah. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jerry Revich : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Jim Fish : Good morning, Jerry. John Morris : Good morning, Jerry. Devina Rankin : Good morning, Jerry. Jerry Revich : I\u2019m wondering, Rafa, I wonder if we could just talk about the commercial opportunity. Really interesting to hear about the synergy target moving higher without the commercial piece even kicking in yet. Can you just talk about how that looks to you given your route economics work on the core business? It sounds like there\u2019s really significant runway there. Just can you talk about what ending of that process we\u2019re at and what sort of contribution can you get by getting the right pricing on the right routes as you internalize the business? Rafa Carrasco : Yeah. Jerry, hi. How are you? Look, what I\u2019ll tell you is with respect to cross-selling, we virtually have nothing built into our existing 2025 contribution right now. That is something that the team, the joint team is engaged in evaluating and we see some of that actually coming in 2026, I should say. I can also tell you that with respect to kind of the routing, one of the important things we\u2019re working on is driving P&L accountability down all the way into the business units. That\u2019s something that didn\u2019t exist at Stericycle before. When we do that, we\u2019re actually going to also generate P&Ls by customer. That\u2019s going to allow us to implement a discipline growth, discipline that we actually have already built into our WM facilities and that\u2019s going to inform quality of revenue. Jerry Revich : And Rafa the timeframe on that? Jim Fish : Sorry, this is Jim. Just I want to kind of put an exclamation point on what Rafa said about cross-selling. He said we don\u2019t really have anything in there in 2025 and it starts to ramp up in 2026. I would say that might be the single biggest opportunity we have over the long-term for this business. I\u2019ll give a couple of examples. I\u2019ve been in a couple of doctor\u2019s offices recently, not for any health problems, but just for my physical, but in both cases, in one case, we were present, meaning WM Legacy Business was there, and Stericycle was not, and in the other office, Stericycle was there, and we were not. So both of those would be opportunities for cross-selling that we really haven\u2019t fully baked into anything at this point, but we feel like is a big opportunity for us. Jerry Revich : I\u2019m glad you got the green light, Jim. In terms of the base business performance, I think we were all holding our breath this quarter for the group heading earnings because the last time commodity prices took a hit, we had a bit of a recalibration to go through across the sector. Now we\u2019re looking at really attractive margin expansion, 2025 versus 2024. Can you just talk about how you folks are maybe taking a more aggressive approach to make sure you\u2019re pushing pricing in the base business to compensate for potential downside risk and recycling feels like that\u2019s part of what\u2019s playing out here, but I want to make sure I have that right. Jim Fish : Well, look, this is probably something everybody at the table could answer. We\u2019re looking around going, do you want to take it? Should I take it? But I think the point here is such a good point, which is the base business and I made this point earlier, the base business is really the superstar in this report, and I think, as we look at pricing, we like the fact that our price team has developed a level of sophistication to be able to really price on a much more granular basis, so where you have customers, for example, that have had missed pickups or whatever, we\u2019re able to say we\u2019re not going to give those customers the same level of price increase. I mean, that level of granularity didn\u2019t exist within the company several years ago. So I think the sophistication within the pricing group is palpable, and to Rafa\u2019s point about pricing within Stericycle, I mean, I think we can take that same level of sophistication to the Stericycle business, but really in that 250 million that Rafa talks about, the large, large majority of that is really cost-related or internalization, and so there isn\u2019t a whole lot. There is some, but not a whole lot in there with respect to price, so we feel good about price not only in the core business, but also with Stericycle, and I think I\u2019ve talked a lot about cost. I will say one thing about cost, and that is that we talked about not replacing a certain number of positions several years ago, and we\u2019ve been chipping away at that. I think through the end of last year, we\u2019re up to about 2,500 positions that we\u2019ve chosen not to replace. That spans different functional areas, but I think, John, it\u2019s right. We have about another 1,000\u2026 John Morris : Yeah. Jim Fish : \u2026 coming. We\u2019ve got two primary areas. One is recycling as we upgrade these facilities, but the other is these conversions from rear-load to ASL. Jerry Revich : Got it. And can I ask, Tara, the landfill gas, really good to see the production coming online on schedule that you laid out last quarter. It looks like maybe the OpEx for MMBtu is higher in 2025 as you ramp that up. Is that right? Can you talk about that given the EBITDA ramp 2026 versus 2025 feels like that might be happening or maybe we\u2019re not getting the full environmental credits? Can you just comment on if that\u2019s what\u2019s playing out on the numbers? Tara Hemmer : It\u2019s a great point, Jerry. And if you also look at our 2027 update and that updated range, it is driven by OpEx. If you think about our highest cost category within our renewable natural gas plants, it\u2019s electricity. So, we are working very closely to figure out ways to reduce our power consumption and lock in on rates. So, that\u2019s one item. We\u2019re very confident in our gas curve. The team that John leads on the landfill side has done a fantastic job in optimizing flows. And we feel really good about the eight plants we\u2019re going to bring online in 2025. But a really important note is that by the end of 2025, we will have all but two of our plants that have completed construction. We won\u2019t necessarily see the revenue on that into 2026 because of timing on commissioning, but most of these plants are going to be done and completed. We have solid momentum there. Jerry Revich : Super. I appreciate the discussion, everyone. Thank you. Jim Fish : Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Trevor Romeo with William Blair. Your line is now open. Trevor Romeo : Hi. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. First, just going back to Stericycle, maybe more on the organic side, I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about the Q4 like-for-like performance from a revenue and margin perspective for Stericycle and then the 9% organic growth you expect for 2025 pre-synergies. Just to clarify, is that a revenue or an EBITDA growth number? And either way, could you kind of just talk about some of the drivers of that organic performance in 2025, especially if it doesn\u2019t include any cross-sell benefits? Devina Rankin : Sure. So when we look at the Stericycle performance in the fourth quarter, I think, like I said earlier, about $4 million of that was synergy capture and so the rest of it, you can look at being the performance of the business. And when we look forward to the growth that we will generate in the year ahead in the Healthcare Solutions business, 9% is a step change from what they\u2019ve generated the last several years. And we see that step change as possible for two primary reasons, one being the asset network expansion with the McCarran facility coming online and the other being fleet optimization. They were underway with regard to some re-characterization of their fleet. They historically have used operating leases in order to fund their fleet. And they knew and had started to execute upon some opportunities to recapitalize that at a better cost and we accelerated some of that into the fourth quarter. And so we see the ability to reduce those costs by up to 30% in some instances by being able to have a better cost of capital for the organization and a more intentional approach to funding our fleet. Rafa Carrasco : Yeah. And Trevor, this is Rafa. Devina covered it very well. The one thing I would add outside of OpEx and more on the revenue side is that we have now the ability to add, and in a couple of weeks, we\u2019ll have every single one of the Stericycle contracts over $50,000 in annual revenue in our data mart. And then it\u2019s going to allow us to better capture earned PIs that in the past had been overlooked and that it\u2019ll prevent revenue leakage. So that gives us some confidence going into 2025 as well. Trevor Romeo : Great. So it sounds like, just to clarify, the 9% is an EBITDA number, but the revenue outlook, you expect a little bit of an uptick there as well. Devina Rankin : That\u2019s correct. 9% EBITDA revenues in the range of 2.5% to 5%, depending on price execution and that revenue leakage that Rafa mentioned, with some offset on volume expected in the SIB business. Trevor Romeo : Okay. Great. That\u2019s good to hear. And maybe for my follow-up, I guess, on the -- going back to the Collection and Disposal business, maybe specifically the volumes, 0.25% to 0.75% expected for this year, I guess, what are some of the puts and takes in that outlook? And maybe specifically, how are you thinking about the more cyclical portions of that volume and how likely they could be to rebound? John Morris : So I think Jim made it in his statement, his opening comments. I mean, with the administration change, we have some optimism there from a business perspective. If you start to break it down, though, Trevor, if you look at our landfill volume, specifically MSW and C&D, we had some good momentum there. Our special waste pipeline is strong. Our special waste results were solid through the year and we\u2019re optimistic about that for 2025. The one I would highlight, Jim made a comment about, is our residential, the intentional shedding of 3.5%-ish of residential volume is part of that number and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re getting close to 20% there on that business. We\u2019re up 400 basis points. We\u2019re down 900 routes. There\u2019s a lot of benefits to us doing that and that\u2019s part of what the volume calculation is. But if you kind of strip out that residential piece and look at the Disposal volumes and the commercial business, we\u2019ve got good momentum there. And I think on the industrial side, we\u2019ve seen some softness there. But as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019ve got a team rallied around trying to look for opportunities where we have some capacity to bring some of that volume back at margins that are acceptable. Trevor Romeo : All right. Great. Thank you all very much. Devina Rankin : Thanks. Jim Fish : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Thank you so much. So, I wanted to first ask about the sustainability EBITDA. What I\u2019m understanding is that some of that is in the Collection -- goes in the Collection and Disposal business, as opposed to the renewable energy and recycling business. So, I just wanted to get a sense of how much of the 7% increase in EBITDA out of $500 million is related to the sustainability project? Tara Hemmer : So, first and foremost, for 2025, we\u2019re going to deliver $190 million in EBITDA -- incremental EBITDA from our growth investments. And you\u2019ll see when you look at the segments, we\u2019re showing $150 million. What happens is with our renewable energy business, there\u2019s roughly a 15% royalty that\u2019s paid to the Collection and Disposal business. That\u2019s really about the use of their landfill gas. And then there are certain fees that go into the Collection business related to recycling. Those are the key elements. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Okay. Understood. And then I was hoping if you could help us with some of the quarterly cadence as it relates to various items. And what I\u2019m thinking of is the buildup of synergies on Stericycle, and maybe your assumptions around some of the commodity costs that you laid out, whether it\u2019s the natural gas and the OTC pricing. Devina Rankin : Sure. I can take this. And what I would say is you can think about it in the three pieces and it\u2019s the traditional solid waste business. We actually expect some margin pressure in the first half of the year, because if you look at 2024, Q1 is our toughest comp on a year-over-year basis, as we saw some of the momentum with regard to automation in particular take hold. And so, we would say from an earnings growth and margin perspective, Collection and Disposal may look a little more muted in Q1 in particular, but first half. And then in the Stericycle business, you will expect that the ramp of synergy capture will be more significantly weighted towards the second half of the year. So, I would say that the earnings growth, you\u2019ll start to see more of that momentum as we get into Q3. And then on the sustainability businesses, because of the impact of recycling commodity prices, we actually see more of the pressure -- downside pressure, associated with recycling commodity prices being in the first half of 2025, because of the year-over-year comparison. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you. If I could just sneak one more in. I wondered you mentioned the ITCs. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re anticipating a change in that, just given the new administration and the changes around the IRA and funding related to that. Should we anticipate any changes there? Devina Rankin : We certainly do not expect any changes. We are watching everything closely, but based on our interpretation of where those decisions will get made, we think that those ITC benefits are secure. That being said, I think it\u2019s really important to remind everyone that we made our capital investment decisions for our renewable natural gas business before the IRA was in place, and the payback period of three years excludes the incremental benefit that we get from that ITC. So, it really speaks to the significant return profile of this business, irrespective of that incremental benefit. Jim Fish : We also, as Devina said earlier, there\u2019s that $60-plus million, $63 million, I think, is the exact number, on the alternative fuel tax credits that we did not put in. Similarly, if bonus appreciation came back, that would be something that we have not put in, and that would be an even bigger number, something north of $100 million. So, we\u2019re not sure what to expect there. It\u2019s a bit of TBD, but we did put in the investment tax credits, we feel strongly that those will remain. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Your line is now open. Kevin Chiang : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and I echo the thanks on the disclosure here. It\u2019s very helpful. Maybe I missed this earlier. You talked about, as you look past 2025, some of the revenue synergy opportunities, that\u2019s a significant long-term opportunity. Did you disclose the percentage or note the percentage of, I guess, healthcare clients that might use WM today, but not Stericycle or vice versa, just to get a sense of maybe how big that cross-selling opportunity could be? John Morris : Yeah. We\u2019re still kind of assessing that. I don\u2019t know, Rafa, if you... Rafa Carrasco : Yeah. I was just going to say, no, we\u2019re still in the process of assessing that. I mean, we see the opportunity looms large, and we were concentrating, frankly, on making sure that we merge the right commercial teams. We\u2019ve actually placed a number of our WM sales and commercial leaders atop some of those functions now, and we\u2019re particularly excited, because we see a lot of parallels between what we can accomplish in cross-selling with Stericycle and their customers and what we\u2019ve been able to do with national accounts, which, as you know, has grown at a double-digit pace over the last five years for us. Kevin Chiang : That\u2019s helpful. Sounds like an exciting opportunity. And maybe just, I know you touched on this a little bit, just the, I guess, the residential volume trend and some of the intentional shedding. When I look at the growth rate, it did take a bit of a step down in Q4 versus the previous quarter trends. Just wondering, can we attribute that incremental delta to that intentional shedding? Are you kind of accelerating that, given the inning you find yourself in, in terms of the opportunity? And I guess in terms of what that volume trend looks like more specifically in 2025, does it kind of look like the down 3% we\u2019ve seen on an annual basis or maybe more like what we saw in Q4 with maybe a four-handle in front of it there? John Morris : I would tell you, Kevin, that business can be a little lumpy, if you lose a\u2026 Kevin Chiang : Okay. John Morris : \u2026 contract and I could certainly follow up on Q4. But no, I think, what you heard from Jim and I both is that we think that 3% to 3.5% range through 2025 and probably through 2026 is probably what we can expect. But again, I think what we would highlight here is, when you look at it, we\u2019ve reduced 900 routes over the period. We\u2019ve improved margins this year by 400 basis points. It\u2019s been a shining star, which we haven\u2019t been able to say in a long time in our Collection business. So I think from a return standpoint, from a margin standpoint and from -- I mean, all the other benefits we get from safety and service and whatnot, we\u2019re going to continue on that path for the time being. Jim Fish : Well, just so we\u2019re clear on how this actually happens with these residential customers, we don\u2019t go fire anybody. But what we do is when a contract comes up, if the margins aren\u2019t acceptable, if they\u2019re at flat or whatever, we just bid it at a price that would be acceptable to us and in many cases, we end up losing it and that\u2019s okay if we lose that business. Kevin Chiang : That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much and congrats on a good quarter there. Jim Fish : Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Konark Gupta with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Konark Gupta : Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on doubling the synergies. You\u2019re good to see that. I just want to get back to the Stericycle or Healthcare business. Your guidance is, I guess, directionally suggesting about $2.6 billion revenue and $460 million in EBITDA in 2025. If we use that as a baseline, how do you guys envision the growth in that business, obviously, including synergies over the next two years, three years, especially when you compare that to what Stericycle was looking at pre-acquisition at about 13% to 17% CAGR in EBITDA? Devina Rankin : So I would tell you it\u2019s difficult for us to specifically indicate the long-term growth rate and that 13% to 17%. We certainly always had our eye on when we were going through diligence processes, but also weren\u2019t seeing the prior team create strong traction on delivering that consistently at this point. Though we do see that we\u2019re on the doorstep of a step change in the growth profile of this business. It\u2019s too early to indicate a specific growth rate. 2026 will be a big year for us, though, in terms of synergy capture and ensuring that we take the customer-centric approach that WM has and leveraging that for topline growth. You can see that 2025 is a year of still pretty moderate topline growth for this business. We expect to see a step change in that beginning in 2026. Jim Fish : And one thing to add here, we hope to be able to give you some additional color on this on Investor Day in June. We\u2019re really a little bit less than three months into this, having ownership of it. So I think Rafa and team have done a great job of identifying these opportunities, being able to bump the synergies from $125 million to $250 million. But by the time we get to June, I think we\u2019ll have even a little bit better insight into what 2026 looks like, what the remainder of 2025 looks like, if there\u2019s any revisions to synergies, than what those might look like. But for now, we\u2019re super excited about how this thing is really starting to take shape. Rafa Carrasco : Hey, Konark, maybe I\u2019ll add one more thing, because I mentioned earlier that we saw a significant amount of incremental value coming from SG&A on the synergy side. And when we first started talking about this post-acquisition, we were talking about aiming initially to take this business down to SG&A as a percent of revenue in that sort of 19% range, which was already a significant improvement over the 24%, 25% that the business has historically showed. I think right now, what we have line of sight on, we\u2019re already going to eclipse that number and we have our target set on 15% and beyond. I mean, as you know, we\u2019re hovering our own SG&A as a percent of revenue under 10%, and ultimately, we would like to get there. Now, that\u2019s going to take some time. But if you think about the question you asked about growth, that\u2019s an important element as well. Konark Gupta : That\u2019s great. I appreciate the color on that. And I didn\u2019t want to front-run the ambassador here for sure. So I look forward to that. Just getting on the Stericycle team here, they had some ERP challenges or transition they were going through last year in 2024. Can you help us understand how are you kind of tackling that situation and how much of that ERP cutover is baked into your expectations? Devina Rankin : Sure. So what\u2019s really important for us is using technology to optimize our processes and our people. And what we see in the first three months of being part of this -- having the Stericycle team part of Team WM, is that they focus more on the technology itself and not so much on the change management and operational connectivity that needs to exist with new systems. And so, our team is laser-focused on bringing together the total of the impact of technology on how you run a business. And so, we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s focused on data quality, focused on process redefinition and bringing all of that together. We expect 2025 to be another year of investment in the ERP and while that\u2019s not specifically provided for in the earnings, we currently expect that we would spend around $35 million to $40 million on incremental spend for this initiative in the year ahead. We don\u2019t know the split between capital and expense for that, so that\u2019s a TBD. But that\u2019s another reason that the step change going into 2026 is something that we\u2019re so bullish about. Konark Gupta : That\u2019s great. Thank you, Devina. And one last one for me just on the leverage side. It seems like you\u2019re expecting 3.1 times at the end of this year. That\u2019s down from, I guess, 3.5 times or 6 times last year. Is that a good sort of run rate you expect in terms of deleveraging? And so, you might be closer to 2.5 times, perhaps, by the end of 2026, maybe? Devina Rankin : It\u2019s a great question. And what I would tell you is our long-term target is 2.5 times to 3 times. We think that that\u2019s optimal for our business in order to provide plenty of dry powder for strategic opportunities like acquisitions when we see them. With the cash flow generating power of the business, we expect to use some of our free cash flow to reduce debt in 2025. That said, if we see outsized tech and acquisition opportunities relative to the $100 million to $200 million that we included in our guidance, you could see some moderation in that level of debt reduction. While I\u2019m not prepared to specifically tell you where we finish in 2026, I think that what you hear is the momentum in earnings growth, both from the core sustainability and our Healthcare Solutions business, will provide an organic approach to deleveraging that really is fundamental to how we get back to that target range. Jim Fish : Maybe one last point on the ERP. The team that we have working on it, which is a fantastic team, has identified something in the neighborhood of $150 million in cash improvement. That probably doesn\u2019t happen until early 2026, but that\u2019s an opportunity for us that we haven\u2019t baked in anywhere as you reduce these receivables that are outstanding. So, it\u2019s really a DSO improvement, but it could be as high as $150 million, maybe even more that we think is out there for us. Konark Gupta : Great. I wish the guys all the best. Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of James Schumm with TD Cowen. Your line is open. James Schumm : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jim Fish : Good morning. James Schumm : Most of my questions have been answered, but regarding R&G, can you update us on what are the most significant delays you\u2019re facing at the moment? Any change there? Tara Hemmer : We haven\u2019t updated any of our projections since our last call. Like I said before, by the end of 2025, we\u2019ll have all but two of our plans completely constructed and then the other -- the remaining two in early 2026, in the first half of 2026. So, we\u2019re on track. James Schumm : But presumably, right, what are the delays? In the past, I think you had some delays getting an interconnect with. Is that still an issue or what\u2019s happening there? Tara Hemmer : Yeah. So, in the past, we had mentioned that two of our biggest issues were interconnects with utilities and then some final permits. We\u2019ve worked really closely on utility interconnects and we have line of sight into when those will complete. So, we feel more confident today than we did in the past. James Schumm : And then on the ITC, you gave guidance there. Did you get shovels in the ground for all 20 projects by the end of 2024, such that you believe you will receive the ITC in 2026 as well? Tara Hemmer : Yes. Yes. All 20 projects, other than the two in Canada, will be eligible for the ITC. So, we feel confident that we\u2026 James Schumm : Okay. Great. And then just lastly -- sorry, Devina. Go ahead. Devina Rankin : Well, super quickly, we\u2019ve also focused extensively on domestic content in building the facilities so that we maximize the amount of the ITC. So, our long-range target had been $250 million to $350 million for ITC benefit and when you look at the $220 million in 2025, plus the $135 million that we captured in 2024, you can see that we\u2019re actually going to exceed the previous range that we had committed. James Schumm : Right. Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, so, I guess, you still have a lot of work to do on the remaining projects, but do you have a lot of incremental R&G opportunities beyond the 13 or so that you\u2019re working on right now? And I know it\u2019s a bit off into the future, but as it stands now, do you think you\u2019d own and operate these additional projects or is that something you\u2019d look to engage in a joint venture for those? Tara Hemmer : So, we are tracking a whole host of opportunities beyond these first 20 plants and we have more landfill gas that we could put to use, whether it\u2019s power projects, R&G projects and the team is actively looking at what the future could look like. We haven\u2019t made any decisions yet on where we had and that\u2019s to come. We could look at partnerships with others or doing them ourselves. I think the most important thing to remember is we\u2019ve maintained control of these assets and we\u2019ve maintained optionality and that\u2019s a good thing. James Schumm : Right. Okay. Great. Thank you guys for the help. Appreciate it. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital. Your line is now open. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks and good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. Just to start off, I guess when we look at the volume assumption here for 2025, I guess, what\u2019s the underlying view on the macro for the rest of the year and maybe more specifically on some of the more industrial or cyclical volumes that have been a bit challenging for the sector over the last few years? Thanks. Jim Fish : Yeah. I think you\u2019ve highlighted the industrial side, which has been the slowest segment overall for us. And I mean, if you look at industrial production in the U.S., you could argue that we\u2019ve been kind of in somewhat of an industrial recession over the last few quarters and our numbers have reflected that. We\u2019ve been soft on that front. I mean, the two areas where our volume has been softest are the one that John\u2019s talked a lot about this morning, which is residential, and that\u2019s really intentional. And then the one that\u2019s not intentional is our industrial halls and those have been soft. And I would tell you, honestly, we\u2019re not expecting a big rebound in those in 2025. Love to see it. And as John mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic about what the new administration brings with respect to business growth, but we haven\u2019t baked anything in along those lines. I will say that the landfill line of business has been kind of the superstar here for us with respect to volume. John mentioned MSW has been strong. He talked about our special waste pipeline is good as well and that\u2019s starting to pick up. So we just had our quarterly reviews with all of our area vice presidents and they were speaking pretty optimistically about special waste. So I would tell you that volume is -- we\u2019re being, I think, fairly cautious at that kind of 0.25% to 0.75%. But should things start to pick up on the industrial side, I think you could see that number exceed. Sabahat Khan : Great. And then there\u2019s a bit of discussion earlier about the commodity prices. Just apparently there\u2019s been some clogging at the port, some evolution in the demand environment. Just a bit more color on what\u2019s baked into your 2025 commodity price assumption, if you just put a finer point on that, and how cautious or how much of a recovery is built into that assumption for the rest of this year? Devina Rankin : So our assumption for recycled commodity prices is $85 a ton, which is down slightly from 2024 at $92 a ton. Here\u2019s what\u2019s important to note. Exiting December, commodity prices were around $80 a ton and that has been the bottom of the trough. If you look at January, we\u2019ve already seen an uptick. And the good news is we were tracking very closely the January potential for a port strike and that did not happen. So we\u2019re seeing great movement on commodities. Also, now that we\u2019re seeing generations slow down post the holidays, should provide some good structure for prices to improve. So the way that we\u2019ve modeled it is moderate increases throughout the year. Sabahat Khan : Great. Thanks very much for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Your line is now open. Bryan Burgmeier : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I just have two very quick ones. One, I appreciate the updated earning sensitivity in the press release to recycled commodity prices. I was just wondering as recycling earnings really step up over the next couple of years, do you think the earning sensitivity will kind of scale with earnings growth or do you think the new earnings will rely maybe more on processing fees as opposed to the commodity prices? Just overall thoughts on your sensitivity to commodities as recycling maybe steps up a lot in the next couple of years? Devina Rankin : Absolutely great question. And I think what\u2019s important to remember when we\u2019ve made these investments in these automation facilities is much of the benefit comes outside of commodity prices. If you look at the automation benefit through 2024, we\u2019ve automated over 850 rolls out of the system and that really has nothing to do with commodity prices. So that\u2019s the benefit that\u2019s going to run straight to EBITDA independent of revenue. And then we\u2019re getting a price premium on what we produce. I was at our Westside MRF a couple of months ago. And how clean our cardboard is coming out of those plants, we\u2019re able to get a price premium. So those are two aspects that are really independent of commodity prices. The other thing that I think is really important to note, and we were looking at this week, is we spent a lot of time making sure that we evolve our fee-for-service model and that we get paid first for processing. So we\u2019ve created sort of a floor when you think about it when commodity prices decline. So the range here is not going to scale as we grow our volumes in the same way. It certainly will go up a little bit, but not at the same level that you would expect. Bryan Burgmeier : Got it. Got it. That makes sense. Thanks for the detail. And last question for me, and then I can turn it over, is just your solid waste internalization, I think, exceeded 70% this quarter. I think that\u2019s like an all-time high. I was just curious if that\u2019s maybe higher than what WM was originally expecting or did you always see potential for 70% plus maybe after the advanced Disposal acquisition? Do you consider yourself maybe fully optimized or penetrated at 70%? Just broader thoughts on internalization moving forward? Thank you. Jim Fish : That\u2019s a good question, Bryan. I mean, I would tell you that we\u2019re constantly focused on trying to find ways from a cash-on-cash basis to put the volume in the right facilities. You\u2019ve heard me and the rest of the team talk a lot over the last handful of quarters at least about the value of our network, not just the landfills. Our logistical capabilities, I mentioned in my prepared comments, that we opened up another rail operation in the Midwest. We continue to look for intermodal opportunities and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it. We\u2019ve got great positioned assets and part of the group, our network planning team, has been doing a great job of building out those capabilities, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in our internalization rates. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist. Your line is now open. Tobey Sommer : Thank you. If you look at the margins and returns on your existing R&G and recycling, how do those compare with your April Investor Day from almost two years ago? What if you could kind of discreetly isolate the drivers of the delta, should there be one? Tara Hemmer : So, our returns are tracking pretty closely to the Investor Day. The biggest thing when you look at EBITDA flow through on our R&G business, it really is about 75% and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing. The biggest change really has been our capital has increased and we\u2019ve been pretty transparent about that, but still within that three-year range that Devina had mentioned. On the recycling side, we\u2019re right there on what we modeled, not a whole lot to say there other than these investments have really helped us with new customers. We\u2019ve done that in Canada where we\u2019ve been able to leverage these investments to build new facilities there and we\u2019ve gotten new contracts as a result of these investments. So, we\u2019re seeing opportunities for more volume to come into these plans. Tobey Sommer : Thanks. And as my follow-up, I was wondering if you could talk about immigration and whether that matters to the company in the industry, because there\u2019s been some discussion that smaller local players may employ some illegal immigrants at subpar compensation. Is that a sort of relevant change for your business? Jim Fish : I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s relevant to us and I can\u2019t really comment on anybody else, but I mean, all of our employees are documented and we pride ourselves on paying a good wage for all of our employees. So, I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t say much else about others. Tobey Sommer : Thank you very much. Jim Fish : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Brian Butler with Stifel. Your line is now open. Brian Butler : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. Jim Fish : Go ahead. Brian Butler : Quick one, just on the incremental sustainability, that $190 million you talked about, how should we think about that flowing through on the quarters? Is that going to be more backend weighted or pretty even? Devina Rankin : So, the way to think about it on the R&G side, we\u2019re going to have the rollover impact of the plants that completed at the end of 2024, those four plants, because we had minimal impact of those in 2024. Then we have three of the eight that would really show earnings in the first half of the year, and the other five in the second half, which are really more back loaded, I would say, into Q4. On the recycling side, what we\u2019ve seen, again, the rollover impact of those automation investments in 2024 and we also have some benefits. We\u2019re going to have less shutdown costs in 2025 than we did in 2024. So, it\u2019s a bit more of an even distribution. Brian Butler : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the RIN pricing, you gave your sensitivity, which is super helpful, but from a strategic perspective, how are you thinking about locking in those contracts kind of longer term, especially considering the potential for the volatility here under the new administration? Maybe just kind of your thoughts on where you\u2019re kind of doing the strategy on dealing with what could be some volatility in RIN prices? Devina Rankin : Sure. So, first, the team did a fantastic job of locking up about 50% of our projected sales for 2025 and that is a mix of the voluntary market, and they had pre-sold some 2025 RINs at $2.70. So, they were very opportunistic in being able to do that and we feel confident that for 20 -- the balance that we have to sell, if you look at where the market is today at about $2.40, that we should be able to do that. We\u2019ve always talked about taking a proactive approach at getting more towards that 80-40-20 split, where a year out, we would have 40% locked up and a year from there 20%. Right now, we have about 15% of our future years locked in and we have some, I would say, pretty robust activity on the voluntary market side. There are players out there who are really looking to decarbonize and we\u2019re going to balance that against the fact that we have a fleet of CNG trucks where we can generate RINs and make sure that we\u2019re monetizing the whole portfolio in the right way. Brian Butler : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the resi shedding. I\u2019m just wondering, were these contracts that were inherited from acquisitions or were they just signed a long time ago and something changed in the markets? I just wanted to understand the rationale for why these contracts are not that profitable anymore? Jim Fish : I think, Toni, it\u2019s a few things. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily acquisitions, although I\u2019m sure we acquired a few that were underperforming, but I think it\u2019s a few things. I think it\u2019s, one, you\u2019ve seen inflation, you\u2019ve seen labor inflation and that was always most prevalent in our residential line of business. So I think we\u2019ve seen more cost pressure because of the labor intensity in that business and we\u2019re offsetting that by changing the model and automating that, driving out a lot of labor, a lot of risk. And it\u2019s a portfolio approach. It\u2019s not in any one particular segment of business. In terms of its contracts that are one year to three years in duration, three years to five years, five years to seven years, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s any particular length. I would tell you we\u2019re a lot more cautious when it comes to anything over three years to five years when we are making our assumptions on what that\u2019s going to look like. The saying I have is I don\u2019t want the best day to be the first day of any of those contracts. Toni Kaplan : Great. Got it. And then, just -- I know it\u2019s still early, but could you talk about the potential impacts from the California wildfire cleanup on your volumes and just wanted to confirm that there\u2019s nothing in the volume guidance from that at this point, and that would be upside? Thanks. Jim Fish : Yeah, Toni. I mean, first and foremost, I was actually out in California with our team over the weekend. The good news is that our folks are all safe, and as of the other day, nobody had been displaced, which we\u2019re thrilled about. Our operations are safe. In terms of any benefit, the folks in Southern California are assessing that right now. There may be a little bit of upside they\u2019ve put in there, but when you look at our guidance for the $500 million for the solid waste business, there\u2019s really nothing meaningful in there at this point. Devina Rankin : We have included about a 0.5 point of volume in our revenue guide for the year and there is the flow through of that, both included in EBITDA dollars and margin. John Morris : I think it\u2019s also important. It\u2019s such a good question about these natural disasters, but we -- in looking back over the last decade, probably three years out of every five years, we see something. The difficulty is you can\u2019t predict it, so whether it\u2019s tornadoes in the Midwest or hurricanes in Florida or fires in Northern or Southern California, whatever it is, probably 60% of the time, something is happening. 2024 was an example of a year where not that there weren\u2019t any natural disasters, but we really just didn\u2019t see a whole lot of volume from those disasters and so had we put something in initially, we would have been running uphill. 2025, we likely will see some impact, but again, it\u2019s very difficult. It\u2019s impossible to predict any of these, and therefore, we don\u2019t factor it in initially and it ends up being either upside for us in the year that it happens or something we have to recapture and work against in the years where we don\u2019t have it. John Morris : Yeah. The last point I make, Toni, is I think our folks and our assets are very well positioned to help all those communities get back on their feet when they\u2019re ready to reach out for that help. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds. Your line is now open. Tony Bancroft : Thanks so much, Jim and team. Congratulations on all your success. Great quarter. Just want to ask, and I was on another call, so just please stop me if it\u2019s already asked, but just with regards to the Healthcare Solutions business, obviously, you\u2019re highlighting that. It seems like there\u2019s a lot of potential growth going on there. Could you maybe remind us again or just sort of walk through what sort of competitors, are there other large regional competitors? I know there\u2019s a lot of ones and twos out there like you were sort of talking about, but maybe sort of define that market a little bit since it seems like that\u2019s somewhere that you could have some more transformational growth? Rafa Carrasco : Yeah. Tony, this is Rafa. What I can tell you about that is, I mean, obviously, when we set our sights on Stericycle s because they had the most comprehensive network of assets out there and the largest portfolio of customers. Really we didn\u2019t look around to see who we were going to competing with necessarily. That comes with the territory, as we kind of assess the ability to cross-sell and all that, but we\u2019re focused on really maximizing what we acquired and making sure we synergize properly and introduce a lot of customer centricity to something that maybe was lacking, a discipline that was lacking back with Stericycle s. Tony Bancroft : Thanks. Great job. Devina Rankin : Thanks. Jim Fish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Harold Antor with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Jim Fish : Yeah. Harold. Operator : Please check your mute button. Harold Antor : Hello. Sorry. Double muted. I apologize. Yeah. Just is labor turnover has been -- labor has been something that\u2019s been talked about on several of these calls, so just getting an update on what labor turnover is now, when inflation isn\u2019t running in the business, and I think, you said, you have another 1000 jobs expected to be made redundant over the period of time, so just wanted to get an update on what those stats are turning out now and then. What\u2019s implied in the guide in 2025? Devina Rankin : I\u2019ll take this quickly, and then John can add some color. Basically, from a frontline labor perspective, we\u2019re exiting 2024 with a 300-basis-point improvement in frontline turnover. It\u2019s the best in our history. So frontline turnover had actually achieved about a run rate of 15%, which is fantastic. And then when we look at wage inflation, while we are seeing top CPI inflation abate, generally speaking, we do think wage pressure continues to be above CPI and we expect wage pressure to be in the 4% to 5% range for the year ahead. John Morris : Harold, I think the only thing I\u2019d emphasize, Devina gave you a good answer, is the, and that\u2019s why you hear us talk about automation and our investments in technology are going to make us less labor dependent. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important in the short-term and candidly over the long-term, because I don\u2019t think we see anything on the horizon that would suggest that the labor pool that we\u2019re searching for is going to be that much more plentiful in the next year or the years after that. So it reinforces our commitment to those investments. Harold Antor : Thank you. Thank you for the call. That\u2019s all for me. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Your line is now open. David Manthey : All right. Thank you. Just quickly on the Stericycle math here, if you did $61 million in EBITDA in the fourth quarter, that implies a $90 million run rate, which I guess implies roughly a $360 million run rate for 2024. You\u2019re guiding to $460 million by the -- by backing into the math there in 2025, including the $100 million in synergy. So question, are you defining all Stericycle improvement as synergy? And maybe a better way to ask is just what, what\u2019s the 2024 pro forma EBITDA you\u2019re assuming for that the Health Solutions business based on the WM definition of EBITDA? Devina Rankin : Sure. So basically the $61 million in Q4 included $4 million of synergy capture. When you adjust for that, it implies a full year EBITDA number on a WM measured basis of around $350 million for the business. We\u2019re implying a 9% growth rate that\u2019s expected on the base business and then $85 million to $90 million of synergy capture. All of that together brings you to the $460-ish million of EBITDA that we\u2019re projecting in the year ahead. David Manthey : Very clear. Thank you. Devina Rankin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Fish, President and CEO for any closing remarks. Jim Fish : Okay. Well, thank you for your excellent questions this morning. We hope you\u2019ll take in our WM Phoenix Open next week. You can catch us on the Golf Channel and CBS. There\u2019s my plug for that and we look forward to talking to all of you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
