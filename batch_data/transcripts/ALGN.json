Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. On the call today, I\u2019ll provide some highlights from our first quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Invisalign clear aligner, and iTero scanner and services. I\u2019ll also provide some color on our orthodontist and GP dentist customers as well as progress in our geographies around the world. David will then share more detail on our first quarter financials and discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that I\u2019ll come back and summarize a few key points and then open the call to your questions. We\u2019re pleased with our overall first quarter results with better than expected revenue and earnings. Record first quarter revenue increased nearly 18% year-over-year, driven by strong Invisalign volume. This solid growth reflects continued expansion of our customer base as well as increased adoption and utilization as doctors treat more patients with Invisalign. Despite numerous global economic challenges, our business remains strong with growth driven by continued progress in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. Our performance in Q1 reflects continued focused execution of our strategic plan including three key growth drivers which are; market expansion, product innovation and brand strength. I will provide a brief update on each of these before discussing our results. First, market expansion, this strategic growth driver encompasses the many ways we are working to grow the adult treatment category, increase our share of teen treatment and in parallel open up new geographies. In Q1, we continued targeted investments into our existing markets including North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region through a combination of sales coverage and support along with professional marketing in the clinical education programs. As mentioned during our January call, we are further expanding our directly covered markets in Europe by converting some of these countries previously managed by our EMEA distributor back to direct sales geographies. In Q1, we began this process by brining Scandinavia, Portugal and Greece back in-house. While we don\u2019t expect to see immediate material impact from these markets, we are excited about their longer term potential and the opportunity to connect more directly with our customer base in those countries. Our second growth driver is product innovation, which aims to create greater doctor preference through an intense focus on innovation and deliver increased adoption in utilization for our products. In Q1, we launched Invisalign G5 innovations for deep bite treatment worldwide. Deep bite is a very pervasive, functional orthodontic problem that presents in almost half of existing ortho case starts in North America and approximately a third of the case starts in Asia. And while experienced doctors have been using Invisalign to treat deep bite for years. Invisalign G5 is designed to make treatment with Invisalign easier for our doctors and help them achieve even better clinical outcomes. Early indicators show a high level of enthusiasm around Invisalign G5. We saw a record attendance at our Invisalign G5 launch event, with more than 4,000 doctors attending Invisalign G5 webinars in North America. And more than 1,800 doctors in the series of launch events in Europe and Asia. And in the first couple of months post launch, we have seen both an initial increase in a number of doctors submitting deep bite cases, as well as in a number of deep bite cases started worldwide, with the greatest incremental growth coming from international orthos, which is not too surprising, as the doctors outside North America typically treat more complex cases. We also began the phase launch of ClinCheck Pro with 3D controls in Q1. ClinCheck Pro is our latest software innovation that provides doctors with more precise control over final tooth position during treatment planning Just 8 weeks into the launch, 83% of targeted doctors are using ClinCheck Pro. These early metrics for both Invisalign G5 and ClinCheck Pro thrown adoption give us confidence that we are delivering meaningful innovations to our customers. And finally brand strength is our third key growth driver. Invisalign is the most recognizable brand in our industry and we continue to build equity in this valuable brand through a very integrated consumer marketing platform that includes TV, media, social networking and event marketing. After what is typically a lighter Q4 in terms of media investment, Q1 saw an increase in North America media activity and delivered more than 1.2 million unique visitors to invisalign.com and year-over-year increases in all related activities on our consumer website. Extensive usage of social media and traditional PR continued to help enable meaningful discussions around Invisalign treatment leading to 53 million impressions from social media platforms just in Q1 alone. While on a smaller scale in Europe, we continue to invest steadily in integrated consumer marketing campaigns in all major direct markets and are taking initial steps towards more significant PR and consumer programs in our Asia Pacific region. We have included more details on our consumer activities in our webcast slides. In combination, these three proven strategic growth drivers are helping to extend growth in our strongest geographies while starting to tap into other meaningful growth opportunities around the world. So now let\u2019s talk about how we did in Q1 by showing some customer and geographic highlights starting with North America. For Q1, North America Invisalign was up sequentially from Q4 and up 9% year-over-year despite reduced patient traffic and fewer effective days in office as reported by a significant number of our customers who are affected by severe winter storms across the U.S. and Canada. The sequential increase in Q1 primarily reflects growth from our North American orthodontists, while North American GP dentists were relatively unchanged from Q4. The year-over-year increase reflects expansion of our customer base as well as increased adoption and utilization among North American orthodontists. In the teen market, which makes up the majority of the orthodontic treatments globally, we had a solid quarter and over 26,000 teenagers worldwide began treatment with Invisalign, up slightly from Q4 and consistent with fewer teen case starts that occurred during the winter months. The teen market remains one of the largest growth opportunities for Invisalign over the mid to long term and we continue to invest in enhancing product applicability to increase doctor confidence in teen treatment along with go to market initiatives and sales coverage and consumer programs to drive adoption. For Q1 as anticipated, Invisalign case volume from international doctors in our EMEA Asia Pacific Regions decreased slightly on a sequential basis due to fewer days in the office from winter holidays in Europe, as well as the Lunar New Year period in Asia Pacific. On a year-over-year basis, international volume increased 31%, reflecting strong growth in both EMEA and Asia Pacific driven by go-to-market and sales coverage investments, ever improving clinical education and support, and excitement around new products like Invisalign G5. Taken together, these important steps increase doctor confidence in Invisalign treatment and lead the increased adoption. In the EMEA region, Q1 Invisalign case volume was unchanged from Q4 and increased 24% year-over-year. Growth was driven by strong demand from orthodontists in our core country markets where we saw significant increases in France, Spain and Germany and in the UK where we are seeing continuing signs of recovery. In Q1, Asia Pacific Invisalign case volume decreased slightly sequentially but increased 51% year-over-year with significant growth across all markets. Q1 was another good quarter for our scanner and services segment which was up both sequentially and year-over-year. Momentum we had exiting last year continued into Q1 which resulted in better than expected scanner revenue. Our scanner and services segment continues to benefit from leveraging our combined sales and marketing resources and taking full advantage of Invisalign and industry events such as the Chicago Midwinter Meeting in February. We also further enhanced the functionality and flexibility of our iTero scanner for restorative procedures by announcing connectivity with ENTSPLY Implants Atlantis Custom Abutments which will help deliver a more optimal dental implant patient experience and outcome. In a separate release today, we announced our new iTero 5.2 software upgrade. The iTero 5.2 upgrade is designed to increase practice efficiency and significantly expand the extensive array of iTero features currently available. These enhancements will reduce total Invisalign scan time and a new Vivera pre-bonding feature will allow simulated digital removal of traditional wire and brackets for retention fitting prior to completion of orthodontic treatment. Commercial availability of the iTero 5.2 upgrade will begin in May of 2014. We have included some more details in the iTero software upgrade in our webcast slides alongside this. A continued trend of digital dentistry leads to better back office integration, improved clinical workflows and greater use of intraoral scanning, setting up significant growth opportunities for our scanner business. The iTero scanners proven to be the best intraoral scanner with the greatest utility for customers and Align is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. As of Q1 the percentage of Invisalign cases submitted in North America rose to 30.2% compared to 26.6% in Q4 and 19.4% in Q1 a year ago. We continue to support an open systems approach to digital impressions remain committed to working with other intraoral scanning companies, specifically by a way of enabling interoperability for use with Invisalign treatment. Our ultimate goal is to further build and strengthen the Invisalign franchise and while we\u2019re pleased to have one of the best scanners in the market with the most utility for our customers, that we\u2019re also continuing to do everything we can to create additional leverage for our Invisalign business. It\u2019s in our strategic best interest to validate and qualify other third-party scanners and while have more news to report to you we\u2019ll be happy to update you. With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David for review of our Q1 financial results. David? David White : Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the details, I'd like to note that unless stated otherwise, all the financial information I'll discuss will be presented on a GAAP basis. Also beginning this fiscal year we\u2019re consolidating some of the additional product and geographic breakdowns that we provide. We will continue to explain the performance of our products and geographies and include commentaries appropriate, however we believe the consolidated view of our quarterly financials is more consistent with disclosures from our respective peer group. With that, let's review our first quarter financial results. Revenue for the first quarter was a record $180.6 million, up 1.3% from the prior quarter and up 17.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. First quarter clear aligner revenue was a $168.2 million, was up 1.2% sequentially and up 18.8% year-over-year. Our year-over-year growth reflected higher Invisalign volumes led by our international doctors as well as higher international ASPs. For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 112,200 cases were up approximately 1,000 cases largely due to the factors Tom described earlier. Year-over-year growth of 14.3% was driven by volume growth of our international doctors\u2019 case shipments as well as continued expansion of our customer base. For North American orthodontists Q1 Invisalign case volume increased 3.9% sequentially and 10.5% year-over-year. For North American GP Dentists Q1 Invisalign case volume decreased 1% sequentially and increased 7.4% year-over-year. For international doctors Invisalign case volume decreased 1% sequentially for seasonal factors however increased 31.2% year-over-year. We continue to focus on training new Invisalign providers worldwide and in Q1, we added 630 new North American doctors and 1,255 new international doctors for a total of 1,885 new Invisalign doctors. While the number of Invisalign doctors trained in Q1 was down sequentially because of fewer training courses offered in Q1 it was up 9% year-over-year. Total Invisalign utilization for Q1 was 4.3 cases per doctor flat with the same period last year and slightly down from 4.4 cases per doctor in Q4. First quarter revenue for our scanner and services segment was $12.4 million, a 2.8% sequential increase over the fourth quarter reflecting continued penetration in market share gains. On a year-over-year basis, our scanner and services segment increased 3.3%, reflecting a 46.5% increase in scanner volume which was offset somewhat by price and the affect of an iTero scanner upgrade program which benefited last year's first quarter results by $1.4 million. Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall, gross margin was 76%, down sequentially half a point and up 2.5% points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 79.1%, down slightly sequentially and up 1.9 points year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher ASPs and lower inventory reserves as we transitioned to our new SmartTrack material in Q1 a year ago. Q1 gross margin for our scanner segment was 33.6%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.3 points year-over-year. Q1, operating expenses were $95.4 million. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $11.9 million due primarily to increased employee compensation expense related to our annual employee performance review process which includes salary increases and promotions as well as annual stock [ramps]. Q1 also includes the benefit of approximately $600,000 from discontinuing the accrual for our medical device excise tax, which I'll explain shortly when I discuss our outlook for Q2. On a year-over-year basis, Q1, operating expenses were up $11.5 million year-over-year, when compared to our non-GAAP operating expenses a year ago, primarily [into dental] growth of the business as well as headcount additions. Our first quarter operating margin was 23.1% down 6.6 points sequentially and up 4.3 points when compared to non-GAAP operating margins reported last year and direct related to our higher volumes and gross margins as I just described. With regards to our first quarter tax provision our tax rate was 23.5%. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.39 compared to $0.51 reported in Q4 and compared to a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.26 reported in the same quarter last year. Moving onto the balance sheet. The first quarter accounts receivable balance is $126.2 million up approximately 11.4% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 63 days, a six day increase sequentially mainly due to a slower start for the quarter, and was down one day over the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $5 million. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $18 million and free cash flow for the first quarter defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $13 million. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities including both short and long term investments were $505 million this compared $472 million at the end of 2013 an increase of $33 million. We also announce today our commitment to return $300 million to shareholders over the next three years through a share repurchase program. As part of this plan we intend to purchase approximately $100 million of shares over the next 12 months. Our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow position affords us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers, while simultaneously returning cash to our shareholders through a share repurchase program, this program will also help offset dilution from our employee equity plans. Our management team and Board of Directors believe that our business represents an attractive investment opportunity for both current and potential investors and the repurchase programs demonstrates the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. Before I comment on the outlook for the second quarter, let me come back to the earlier comment I made with regards to medical device excise taxes. Well in advance of the implementation of the medical device tax in January of last year and on an ongoing basis since then we have consulted with advisers and held extensive discussions with the IRS on the subject of the medical device tax and its application at Align. In March of this year the IRS informed us that it was now their position that our clear aligner business qualifies for a full tax exemption. As a result we stop paying and accruing medical device taxes in our clear aligner business in March. As I indicated previously this benefited the quarter by approximately $600,000. On an ongoing basis it will amount to a savings of approximately $1.8 million per quarter based on our current clear aligner revenue levels. Our second quarter guidance which I will get to momentarily reflects this. While we didn\u2019t have the benefit of this news in January when we gave directional comments for 2014 we had anticipated some incremental benefit from the medical device tax. Accordingly we continue to believe our operating margin for 2014 should be consistent with 2013 actual results and not view this new information as an update to those aspirations. Let\u2019s now turn to our business outlook for the second quarter and the factors that inform our view. Q2 is seasonally a busier quarter for our international doctors and we anticipate Invisalign case shipments to increase sequentially from Q1. Our North American doctors report improving patient traffic flow in their office and an increase in new patients consults. Therefore we expect Invisalign case shipments in North America to be up from Q1 as well. For our scanner business, we had a good start for the year and we anticipate building on this momentum in Q2. With this is a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 116.500 to 119.500 cases. We expect net revenue to be in the range of $181.7 million to $186.5 million. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 74.6% to 75.2%. The sequential decrease from Q1 primarily reflects higher training cost revenues and costs which carry lower gross margins. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $96.8 to $98.7 million. This sequential increase reflects greater TV media spend as we get in front of the teenage summer rush, continued international investment and our participation in a number of customer events including the upcoming AAO meeting in May and our first ever Asia Pacific Summit in June, offset by lower medical device taxes as previously discussed. Our operating margin should be in the range of 21.3% to 22.4%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 23.0%. And diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $83.6 million excluding any stock repurchases during the quarter. Taking together, we expect EPS to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.39. With that I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments. Tom Prescott : Thanks David. We\u2019re pleased to have 2014 started off with these solid results. The Align team continues to execute well against both strategic and financial objectives as we work to extend the growth of our Invisalign franchise and begin to create greater leverage from our scanner business. Based on continued solid operating results and progress towards our long-term strategic objectives, our Board of Directors has authorized a $300 million share repurchase program, which David described earlier. We believe returning excess cash to shareholders, beyond what we need to invest in the business is the right thing to do. Over the next month or two, much of the Align management team will be with customers at the AAO meeting in New Orleans later this week to see thousands of orthodontists from North America and across the world. And we're also going to be in Singapore in June for our first ever APAC Summit, which will be a sold out event with over 400 key customers from Asia Pacific. In addition, we are very much looking forward to spending time with our investors during upcoming conferences including our Analysts meeting on May 29th in New York. I will provide a more comprehensive view of our strategy and why we believe Align\u2019s best days are still ahead. With that I\u2019ll say thank you for your time today and turn the call back to the operator for some questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Fadah - William Blair :  Hi, good afternoon guys. It\u2019s actually Ravi Fadah in for John. Tom Prescott :  Hey Ravi. Ravi Fadah - William Blair : Congrats on the great quarter. And just wanted to start with the question on the second quarter guidance, it looks like that first quarter came in a little bit better than expected weather didn\u2019t seem to be an issue and the slow start that you had talked about last quarter, you seem to be able to push through those pretty well. Yet the second quarter guidance seems like it\u2019s a little bit more conservative relative to our expectations than, at least relative to our expectations. What is driving your thought process that would prevent it from being a significant step up from Q1? Tom Prescott : Ravi, I'll start maybe from a qualitative perspective and let David come back and comment more quantitatively. In this case, we think is the net activity level, the patient traffic that did have some impact in North America. And while I think most of those appointments probably got reschedule, they took a little time to do that. That showed up a little bit more on the GP side and the ortho side. And some of that softness will play into Q2 shipments, especially with the earlier part of March that those would normally that volume growth would have seen is differed a bit. As we certainly ended the quarter, we had very strong robust pipeline and doctors are reporting, patients are in and offices are full and all those dynamics are good. But clearly, there is a month or two hit them is through the quarter that was tough. So, qualitatively that's the biggest part of the shift into the first part of Q2. I'll let David add to it, if he wants to add some color. David White : Yes. The only thing I guess I would add is, when we put our guidance together we look at seasonality trends over the last three or four years the company has experienced. We look at information that we get from the field in terms of demand we're seeing from individual doctors and so forth. And we use all that to try and form our guidance. If you look at our historical seasonality and you look at how much we're projecting -- if you look at our guidance today and how much has the percentage increase our growth year-over-year. It is slightly down from where our three, four year average has been, but it\u2019s not significantly. And so those factors that Tom just inferred, planning to cause to be tempered a little bit for the second quarter than what might historically been otherwise. Ravi Fadah - William Blair : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And what you see the patient traffic trends right now looking like and do you see them improving, did you see them in March and April structure get a little bit better? Tom Prescott : Well, in certainly March, we\u2019ll stop with March. Definitely a significant rebound and I think the cascade of what weather caused surprise our customers a little bit and they went to an offline reschedule churn. Our customers pretty much across the board are reporting full offices and busy practices and if anything that\u2019s sharpen their appetite to get back to growing their practice I think chunk of the industry had a softer start, which for our customers means lower cash received months and they don\u2019t like that. So, in general we think things are healthy, but I will come back with comment earlier. With all that happening, we are seeing a pretty big sequential increase Q1 and Q2 and that\u2019s implied in our guidance. So, we are pretty comfortable direction of business is going, but it\u2019s still pretty big step up for Q2. Ravi Fadah - William Blair : Great, thanks very much, guys. Tom Prescott : Sure Ravi. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jon Block - Stifel: Great and good afternoon guys. The first question is actually just on the Express cases. If I look at full versus express I think you are giving us, David as you mentioned a little less granularity than in the past, but Express cases were up roughly 5% year-over-year. In 2013 express was up 35%, so clearly you had a more difficult comp. Can you sort of talk to what might be going on specific to the Express cases? is it just a tough comp thing and now Express 5 is two years removed or are some of these wires and brackets guys we have heard the environment there is \u201cstreet fight.\u201d Are they starting to throw some clear aligners into try to get some of the wire and bracket share? Thanks. Tom Prescott :  Let me take this in a couple of ways. One, probably the biggest factor that makes the comp issue tougher is we were really driving for initial trial with Express 5 you go back a year even two years and we were trying to go as wide as we could to get initial trial, we aren\u2019t doing those promos anymore. We got trial, it actually has been pretty sticky in the practices. We targeted for Express 5 with a more experienced customer that knew what they could move in five stages. I think there is noise and I think at the low-end more on the GP side there is a lot of labs providing these we spoke about this in the context of thinking about the realigned product and working out through a new channel with Henry Schein. And so I think there is some noise out there. The competitive environment is I think roughly the same and we don\u2019t see what I would call really incredible technology base products at the low-end or at the high-end other than what you are aware of. So, the bigger factor is with Express are two; one, that comp issue from prior promotions driven kind of volumes which worked we got a good test and trial and adoption although it came to stay just lower? And then secondly and in some ways better than our original expectations for growth unfold cases as our applicability gets wider both in North America and especially outside North America with the greater complexity cases they are treating. And with 51% growth in volume in Asia year-over-year those are just about all full cases. So I think in some ways it\u2019s a wonderful problem. On a percentage basis, Express is certainly growing lower but high quality problem. Jon Block - Stifel: Okay. That was very helpful, Tom. And maybe just two more quick ones. David, it\u2019s hard to do the implied math on the ASP that you\u2019re laying out for 2Q because you\u2019re giving us a little less on non-case and scanner. But just looking at your case volumes at the low end and your revenues at the low end and thinking like $22 million comes from other and scanner. It seems like you\u2019re walking down the implied ASP from 1,400 to 1,405 this quarter to maybe like 1,360, 1,370, can you talk to that? Because again as Tom just mentioned, a lot of the growth is coming from these four cases. So, why would we see a step down in ASP that dramatically sequentially? David White : Well, good question. I think a lot of that, John, has to do with our estimations as to the effects of mix in the next quarter. And when we think about mix, Tom is talking about geographically Asia Pac being strong and so forth. So, when we think about Q2, we\u2019re anticipating a bigger rebound on North America, given the softness it started out with. And that\u2019s why we do some of the simpler cases. And actually when you think about it, that\u2019s where we do a large percentage of the Express types of cases. So as North America rebounds, it tends to lower that ASP quarter-over-quarter as a result. Tom Prescott : And I\u2019ll jump in on top of that. The second part that North America trend, we see the pipeline activity goes directly to Advantage program for top doctors. Because of the softer market environment and dynamics in Q1, number of doctors, even big orthos fell short of what their expectations were, and maybe I think it\u2019s a pricing. We had a lot of GPs that didn\u2019t deliver volume and didn\u2019t get the kind of pricing. It\u2019s not the way we want to higher ASP when our customers don\u2019t do the volume they or we expected but it\u2019s a fact. So as we project greater activity, greater volumes from these committed customers, that\u2019s a direct relationship to ASP. Those two factors together kind of make up the difference. Jon Block - Stifel:  Okay. And last one if I could just quickly ask. You clearly brought on a lot of sales reps in North America last year and I think it was maybe about this time last year, yet we\u2019re seeing a decel in North American cases. It\u2019s a messy quarter from a weather perspective et cetera, but can you just talk at a high level, are these guys taking longer to get ramped up, are we seeing a little bit of the law of diminishing returns in the last 40 reps you brought on, how are those sales reps performing in the field over the past 9 months? Thanks guys. Tom Prescott :  Sure, it\u2019s an easy one. We think actually the team is performing very, very well. And we\u2019re certainly one of the first to go out in our space of dentistry but I think the market is going to, at least the direct sell-through, not through distribution where there is a buffering effect for timing, I think the direct sale companies in general are all going to be looking at little bit softer period in North America, offset to some extent by Europe or Asia growing. Our team is doing great, we still believe we\u2019re very -- we know we\u2019re very underpenetrated. We believe there is still opportunities to feather in more sales coverage and we will do that over time. If it\u2019s significant enough to talk about in numbers, we\u2019ll do as we\u2019ve done before and describe that. But I think the deceleration you are describing, once we normalized for all the factors in our business including the APAC distributor, I think our core growth rates continue to be about 16%. And that\u2019s even off of a very big base. That\u2019s not across the world equivalently, but our biggest market coverage is still North America. The team is doing very, very well there. So this is not a perfectly linear business and certainly isn\u2019t perfect. But I think we\u2019re on the right track here and we got a lot of confidence in the team. Jon Block - Stifel:  Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse : Yes, thanks and good evening. Tom, I just wanted to kind of follow up, and David I just want to follow up on the guidance for 2Q. It kind of sounds like you are assuming that patient traffic is picking and you are sort of model the case shipment and you model the revenues that way. But David if I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks, you are suggesting that gross margins would be down sequentially as well as operating profit margins would be down sequentially. And I guess maybe I understand the gross margins a little bit, if it\u2019s a mix or ASP issue but could you elaborate a little bit more on why the margins step down so much in 2Q? David White : Well, couple of things. When we think about Q2 and I thought initially, you were going to talk about Q1. But if you look at the quarter, Q1 was 76%, it was gross margin for the total company. And our guidance, the middle of our guidance is somewhere around 75% or so. So, it\u2019s down about a point. Some of that is due to the fact that Q2, we typically see a pickup in revenues and costs associated with training activities and those training activities typically we price and so forth at very, very de minimis margin. And so the effect of that increase of -- in the non-case revenue associated with training that picking up quarter over quarter, it tends to bring the overall gross margins down. And that\u2019s the principal reason between Q1 and Q2. On the operating margin side, our operating expenses, we did guide up a little bit quarter over quarter. Some of that is due to the fact that our Q2 is typically a heavy promotional period for us, particularly as we get ready for the summer season for teens and so forth. We have a number of promotions that we typically begin in the second quarter and a number of media campaigns that get kicked off in the second quarter in advance of that summer season. And so you see a little bit of pick up in our expenses associated with that. And as we have also talked about throughout this year, we are investing in what we call the number of global strategic imperatives which Tom talked about in his prepared remarks and so forth. The largest component of that has to do with market expansion. And some of that\u2019s geographic coverage expansions, some of that is territory coverage increases and so forth, so that also tends to be a little bit of the reason for the pick-up in operating expenses. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. And Tom, maybe if I could just sort of follow up, obviously we got the news from the ITC into quarter here and obviously that was good news for you guys. Could you maybe elaborate, maybe a little bit more on kind of where the company goes from here, where that situation stands? And as you kind of give the situation in ClearCorrect, I mean do you think it\u2019s an opportunity for your sales force to go after and start to try to sign those doctors up and start to take that market share, and how do you think about the competitive landscape at this point, is there anything else beyond ClearCorrect that\u2019s kind of on your periphery that you\u2019re paying attention to? Tom Prescott : Well, if there is a place where we can be both confident in our strategy and (inaudible) get out, that\u2019s kind of where we live. We assume everybody wants into this market and are working very hard to do so. There is no other competitive dynamics other than what I commented on a moment ago. And our best strategy forward to deal with that is to innovate like crazy, keep bringing better value to our customers and make the product work better and better. Our goal long term is standard of care. So, I would really not comment specifically, I think the process is still kind of in final stages of working out. I do have Roger George here with us and whatever he wants to comment on from a practical perspective next steps ClearCorrect ITC specific, Roger please maybe do so. Roger George :  Sure. Well why don\u2019t I do it this way, with Tom\u2019s comments to your question, would you like to refine the question at all that I might respond to? Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse : I am not sure how I\u2019d refine. I mean basically, I mean is there any sort of injunctions placed against ClearCorrect I mean will they be out of the market soon, and I am guessing really just trying to understand if you all believe that it\u2019s an opportunity to ultimately take that market share at some point in the foreseeable future. Roger George :  So, let me start with that point, our sales force has been pretty aware for quite some time that we don\u2019t really share any customers ClearCorrect, we don\u2019t really have any customers who are Invisalign providers who are also doing cases with ClearCorrect. And in a lot of cases or in a lot of the instances, doctors who are doing cases with ClearCorrect are those who are not invited to do cases with us any more for various reasons. The order that was issued by the International Trade Commission is a cease-and-desist order saying that ClearCorrect has to stop importing goods meaning their software digital treatment plans that infringe our patents and that they have got to stop producing aligners with that stuff. Now you know that they have responded that the cease-and-desist order doesn\u2019t their change their life and that it\u2019s still business for usual as them. I don\u2019t how know how you can read a very long detailed order saying cease-and-desist from the federal government that they have got to stop. But that\u2019s the position they are taking. So, they intend to appeal various parts of that order and we intend to move forward based on what the order says and we will be going back to patent litigation in Texas to take up the damages part of our case. Tom Prescott : Hey Glen if I could just maybe finish the thought off here. We have said before we didn\u2019t feel that much of the headwind from them and we don\u2019t think there is a much of a tailwind. We obviously love to grow our customer base with doctors that believe in clear aligner treatment and over time we\u2019ll work on doing that. But in terms of a shared customer base or big opportunity, that\u2019s not the way we\u2019re thinking about this one. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thanks so much. Tom Prescott : Sure. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs : Thanks for the questions. Just looking at the ASPs and specifically the international ASPs, again expanded significantly year-over-year but I imagine that obviously is related to the switch in 2013 to direct distribution. If I look at that international ASP sequentially it seems like a little bit more of a steady state forming there. And Tom I know you mentioned bringing a few other countries or if I should say going direct in a few other countries. How should we think about the ASP on international? Is what we\u2019ve seen in the last two quarters a starting to solidify into a more normalized run rate? Tom Prescott : Short answer is yes, notwithstanding FX, notwithstanding some other things we might do. I think there is a clearer mix shift in Europe, in Asia towards full cases because of the greater complexity in (inaudible). And then secondly there is a bit of a price premium in each of those markets over North American pricing that is persisted. With that said, once we get passed May 1, the comp will be cleaner, the read-through will be cleaner relative to ASP versus volume, but I mean even with Asia volume up 51% what that\u2019s done for our net ASPs there. So I think it is stabilizing, but I would say given that growth outside North America has been significantly faster than in, I think to the extent ASP holds to the extent that we're able to get more complex cases with widening applicability things like deep bite and more then I think it does buffer us against some mix shift, the low end here in North America, it does buffer us a little against the negative effects of FX if and when that comes, but the trend in general is just as you described. Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs :  Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Now I guess just on, iTero, if I could sneak some in on the scanner side, [news was] they have been pretty positive, but if I look at unit growth for 46.5% year-over-year versus sales growth, just I guess any inside you can give us on discounts and promotions, trade ups and then is there a different way we should be thinking about unit versus revenue growth going forward? Tom Prescott : May be David and I can tag team a little bit. I\u2019ll just say in general, the market\u2019s gotten more competitive. We have met that competitive we have a very premium scanner and we are not the lowest priced unit, but just about a year ago, we basically made a decision to simplify pricing and reduce pricing and that\u2019s been rewarded. So in general volume has grown faster than revenue if you look at a year-over-year basis, but we're confident overtime, we could make this a profitable and increasingly valuable part of franchise. David if you want to add color there please. David White : Yes. Once again when you kind of drill down a little bit, certainly volumes are up I think in my prepared comments of something north of 40% year-over-year in volumes, there are two things from a revenue standpoint, when you look at it year-over-year, one of which is the fact that a year ago we had a special promotion going on for iTero, for upgrades, as we released the new version. And when you normalize for that, you see well that was a -- that had the effect of increasing revenues last year. Tom Prescott : In the volume of scanners. David White : And the volume of scanners is I said up about 46% or so. So, ASPs are at this point a pretty stable. We took some pricing actions when we announced the new iTero scanner about a year ago, pricing has been pretty stable over the past year. And I think going forward, I think we'll see a pretty normalized rate of business as it continues to grow and we continue to see adoption of the product. Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs : That makes a lot of sense. And then just the other one on the scanner, obviously looking at impressive chart hereof digitally submitted Invisalign cases and I think you probably get this question every quarter Tom. But any progress other than the current scanners out there in the market that can submit Invisalign cases digitally, any progress on some of the other larger installed bases and any ability to work with them? Tom Prescott : Well, I was as clear [in a word] as I could be in my comment and they stand for themselves. But the reality is it's not to reveal and every scanner is different. And in effect we're releasing a new factory floor technology as a front end of a process. And any other party would have to be very certain there to work well. And that's what we're after. So when there is news there, we'll be happy to report it. And we expect it would make our customers even happier and overtime build greater strategic advance for the Invisalign franchise. So, it is a priority, I think it's in our interest to do so and I'll stop there. Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks for the questions. Tom Prescott : Sure. Thank you. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Bob. Next question please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom Prescott : Hi Steve. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley : Hey everybody. One is for David and one for Tom. David, I wonder if you could even qualitatively walk us through the margin profile over the balance of the year. There has been a lot of focus on the first quarter and the guide for the second quarter, but you\u2019ve given us a perspective on 2014 in totality. Can you remind us what the key levers we should be thinking about over the balance of the year; any perspective if you have it on how operating expense growth might trend will be very helpful? And then Tom for you, I wonder if you could without stealing all the thunder comment on the Analyst Day that\u2019s coming up. It\u2019s not something you do every year, this is the first, I want to say in about four years. So, why now and what should be we focusing on? Thanks everyone? Tom Prescott : I\u2019ll let David go first (inaudible) happy to comment. David White : Okay. So Steve, on our gross margin profile, I am going to focus my comments primarily on Invisalign side of our business since that pretty much dominates our overall margin profile as a company. When you look at Invisalign and you look at our margin profile and so forth, it\u2019s perhaps most heavily influenced by really a couple of factors. One is, is product mix, which drives ASP. And when I talk about product mix, I probably should drill down a little bit more, really more from the standpoint of geographic mix. And so as we seen our international business continue to grow at faster rates in North America that is have the effective lifting ASPs overall for the company and as we lift those ASPs that has the effect of lifting our gross margins overall at the same time. On the cost side, our cost model is largely today benefits from high utilization in the factory, high volumes. And as we continue to grow the business, we continue to benefit from better absorption of fixed overhead in the factories which drive down cost on a per case basis. So, as we think about going out over the next year or so with those trends continue, our business continues to grow as we would expect and as our international business continues to increase as a percentage of the total mix with the company than our expectation would be that our margin should see some uplift, our gross margin see some uplift to them. Now I temper that a little bit from the standpoint that when you look at our business model that we\u2019ve guided overall from a long-term standpoint, we\u2019ve set our overall gross margin business model somewhere in the 73% to 78% range and we are consistently operating well within that if not at the high side of that. So, I wouldn\u2019t want you to get too far over we\u2019ve already guided from that perspective, but those are the drivers that have perhaps the most influence on gross margin. From an OpEx standpoint, in January we talked a lot about some of the investments that we are making as a company and how those investments were a part of a consorted effort on our part to balance our growth profile for the year and for the long-term relative to and the investments it would take to drive that relative to what our operating margins as a company might be. And the direction we have given really for this year is our aspirations would be to achieve the same type of operating margin performance in 2014 as what we did in 2013. Tom Prescott :  If I can pile on just to finish that one off a little bit with a hammer, this year is a little bit like last year in some ways where our investment framework is more front-end loaded for the year, headcount expansions, key initiatives, some step up in consumer spend versus a year ago we were still developing new adds, we launched in May, we\u2019re out in market within Q1, Q2 with a little more consumer, fully loaded headcount in place versus maybe partial year last year. So, and in parallel with that in Q1 we had a little bit of volume challenge. We had some headwinds in terms of certainly North America market. All those things add up and a little less momentum going into Q2 for volume all those things add up to say little more pressure on operating margin what David described is getting back towards an operating margin profile roughly compared to last year, which means a pretty big lift in the second half, but we believe the pieces are in place to go do that. And as much as we\u2019ve showed last year, we believe when those come together we can demonstrate that progress. And then quarter-to-quarter hope to over perform the kind of numbers David was pointing to. So, hopefully that takes care of the model and you want to shift briefly to the Analyst Day? Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley : Absolutely. Tom Prescott : Perfect. All right, so yes it has been a while, I think 3, 3.5 years. And there is a reason for that; we\u2019ve kind of had our heads down for a couple of years executing like crazy. We believe we\u2019ve really changed the state of the enterprise in many, many ways. One of those is visible in product and market impact in growth in the financial progress we\u2019re making. And there is other ways that most of our owners having a chance to meet the number of the senior management team. We\u2019ve got incredibly talented group of folks here and I think this provides and affords our owners an opportunity to get them know them to hear from them about our markets, our geographies, our technology evolving and how we\u2019re going to scale the business. And so, I\u2019d say I believe Thursday the 29th of May we\u2019re looking forward to spend the better part of the half a day together. And hopefully you\u2019ll take away what we believe which is great excitement about where we are today, but even more about what the future looks like and that\u2019s we\u2019ll focus lot on strategy evolution there. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley : Thanks so much everyone. Tom Prescott : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies: Thanks. Good afternoon. Tom Prescott :  Hey Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies:  Tom or David, I think if you could quantify the mix of Asian Invisalign cases as a percent of total or is the percent of the international business? And then could you give us an update around uptake in China and that\u2019s performing relative to your internal plan? Tom Prescott : So without giving numbers because we haven\u2019t broken out that detailed level, the very substantial majority of all of our volume outside North America is full of cases. There are fewer teen cases treated as many of the countries in Europe where we have a little more maturity have state plants basically free for brackets and wires. We are getting teen cases, that\u2019s going nicely but it\u2019s on a pretty small base. The bulk of what gets treated are full and mostly adult cases today. And so I\u2019ll leave that there. China is going game busters as is Japan, as our some other geographies. And the team has big ideas about how we can make that a very big business. And you\u2019ll start to see that showing up just year-over-year in volume, which then you can tell there is leverage on the revenue side. So, we're right on track with our very aggressive game plans and the team is working like the [dickens] to continue that. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies: Thanks. And one more Tom, with respect to the new ClinCheck software, the enhanced functionality seems pretty significant in terms of what the practitioners are able to do themselves. Do you perceive that as a case volume driver? And if you could elaborate on what some of the early feedback has been that would be helpful? Tom Prescott :  Well, and again our highest volume customers who treat the most cases and a lot of most complex cases, sometimes do the most ClinCheck cycle just to get it perfect before they press go. And this really reduces those cycles when they are getting close, but instead of sending it back to their, even a treat technician that knows their human approach very well and describing a little lateral movement or a little rotation of two or three teeth. They can actually move that and it's a virtual model that actually moves and shows collisions and then they can send it in and teeth that goes Ah, I got it. It might as some of our doctors tell us, it might cut through one, two or three treatment cycles and communication while they are close. And so we think yes, the output is greater adoption and getting a bigger share of their practice. But it starts with having the customer get what they want more quickly and having that customer experience to be better. More precision, it gives them more confidence in the treatment and it reduces absolute factor of it. So, all those things are in the side of good and we're getting a lot of positive feedback from our doctors, most of them are more experienced, many of them are orthodontists about, boy this is just what I wanted, I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time. Thank you. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies: Perfect. Thank you. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Brandon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: Thanks guys. A lot of my questions have been answered, but let me just through a couple of more out there. One Tom on the international ASP and kind of following up on Jon's question and I think another one we had as well. I think last quarter you talked about kind of the shift going away from i7, away from Express 5 and then up to Express 10 and i14 and that being one of the drivers along with just playing the international mix of kind of slow steady rise in ASPs going forward. Yet to Jon's point on one of your earlier questions, it looks like your implied guidance is for ASP is to be down sequentially, at least in the second quarter. So, I'm just trying to reconcile those two. Should I think about kind of that slow steady ASP rise being more of a long-term guidance, but there is going to be some volatility from quarter-to-quarter just based on mix or how should I think about that? David White : Yes. This is David. I think you just hit it right there. I mean from quarter-to-quarter, there is seasonality in our business, different seasonality in Asia versus Europe versus North America and that tends to influence geographic mix, which will affect ASPs. I think when we talk about our ASP trend overtime and a mixed shift towards international business where there is a much heavier concentration on complex cases and that is driving ASPs, that\u2019s more of a long-term type of trend as we see it today. And so you shouldn\u2019t take our guidance as necessarily being anything that would be indicative of a change in that trend and our expectations. Tom Prescott : Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: No, please Tom, go ahead. Tom Prescott : I was just going to say reiterating, our expectations are that our North American doctors will be busier, many of that, much of that volume comes through our advantaged customers and we want them to deliver that volume and get that discount that will directly relate to ASP in North America, which tends to skew that down a little bit. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: Yes. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then David just two quick follow-ups; one, in the absence of share repurchases this year, what would you expect, the share count has been fairly stable here over the last couple of years, but stock price is up quite a bit. Would you expect absent share repurchases share count to trend up this year? And then a second one just technically can you tell me why you are not subject to the MedTech tax any longer, I\u2019m trying to figure out if there is any derivative recruiting in my other companies? David White : So, the way I would look at it as it relates to share count is I think that the guidance we gave for Q2 is 83.6 million shares. One of the things that obviously increases that is going to be stock options as they vest, which we pretty much don\u2019t grab into longer, but we still have a tail of those that are still cycling through the final vesting on those. And then we have employee RSUs. So, if I was modeling and I would just simply look at what our historical uptick has been quarter-over-quarter and assume that and apply that to basically the guidance we gave is that related to Q2 for shares outstanding. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: Okay. David White : As it relates to the medical device tax, it\u2019s a little bit more complex but let me see if I can make it really simple. Our business is a little bit unique relative to many other companies in our space. We sell directly to doctors, we don\u2019t sell through wholesale channels and so forth. And so, a year or plus ago when we were evaluating the applicability of the medical device tax to the company and so forth with the advice of outside consultants and so forth and given that this is a very new law that was still subject to some interpretation, our assessment at that time was that our company would most likely be fall under the ruling and we would have to pay medical device taxes. Now, we -- during that course of that year that evaluation was on a number of subjective criteria that is outlined in the law. So over the course of the last year, we have had a number of dialogs with the IRS. And in the course of that and in the course re-reviewing our case and how those subjective guidelines apply to us, the IRS informed us in March that they believe that we should be exempt from the medical device tax and based on that subjective criteria and how they apply to our business. And so that effectively we have stopped accruing for the taxes effective in March. Tom Prescott :  And I just want to say here, we don\u2019t think this is a cookie cutter. I would urge you not to make assumptions that another business or model might apply. I\u2019ll say our team has done good work, it\u2019s not quite finished yet in terms of an overall process. But as we finish this off and have more to disclose under this, there will be a little more information. But again, this is -- you\u2019re hearing it at real time, there are [timing] implications and accrual implications which is why we\u2019re dealing with it as a Q1 issue and a Q2 guidance matter. David White : Yes. And just to pile on to Tom\u2019s comment, it is a case-by-case assessment and so our case facts are going to be different from almost any other company you would look at. And so, I don\u2019t think you can rinse and repeat necessarily what we\u2019ve applied here. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then just two quick follow-ups I guess on that there is no catch up provision or anything where you can go back and capture device tax you paid over the last 4.5 quarters, anything like that? David White : So a good question. I think the answer to that is yes. We\u2019ve historically paid about $8.3 million between 2013 and the first two months of this calendar year. We\u2019ve applied for refund for that. The refund however though is processed through a separate division of the IRS, obviously they talk to one another but that separate division has to go through audit and approve it. That audit has not been completed. When it does, we would expect the answer to come back that we would get a full refund. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: And lastly, yes. Tom Prescott : Just to be really clear, we can\u2019t project that, it is in process and there is nothing more than what you just heard, can we do anything with so. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: No, understood. And just so I am doing the math right that\u2019s about 100 basis points per quarter going forward here of margin benefit I guess relative to how we had set our model up? David White : It\u2019s about $1.5 million to $2 million of expense a quarter. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: It comes out of cost\u2026 Tom Prescott : At our current revenue run rates. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: Yes, right. Understood. Thanks guys. Tom Prescott : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lewis at the Roth Capital Partners. Please proceed with your question. Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom Prescott :  Hey Chris. Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners : I just wanted to go back on the volume guidance for the second quarter at 11% year-over-year. That\u2019s still healthy double-digit growth but a slight pull back versus I guess the 14% this quarter and kind of that high teen to low 20% range in the second half of last year. So understand weather played a factor there with delaying some cases and possibly pushing out some of those shipments and time the revenue is recognized, but I guess Tom beyond the weather, are there any other factors or some of the market challenges that you would mention that\u2019s contributing to that volume outlook in the second quarter? Tom Prescott : Chris, I think it\u2019s, the look at the business it\u2019s actually pretty clean. I think if I take a rough -- if I norm for a lot of factors that have impacted revenue and volume, our growth as a company is somewhere in the neighborhood of 16% through all the different factors that have been puts and takes over last year two volume, revenue, et cetera. Q2 guidance is impacted by an improving March receipts, which means improving April shipments, but we weren\u2019t at the rate we wanted to be. If we had be running for all of March out of receipts level, we would be a little bit more bullish in our guidance and so figure that 30-day lapse. The business has responded -- we\u2019re really comfortable with our pipeline but all that is factored into our Q2. So yes, we\u2019re -- it\u2019s a little underwhelming, but it\u2019s going the right direction. And we believe we\u2019re still getting get to a place for the year where we\u2019re going to have another really terrific year and putting us in broader context, the orthodontic market is probably growing in mid single-digits maybe in a good year 6%, in a bad year 3% to 5%. We\u2019re growing in almost every market 2 to 3 to 4x that rate. And so, our view is as long as we\u2019re doing that, whatever the absolute number quarter to quarter is, we\u2019re less worried about it. The contrary would be true if we thought there are some new fundamental competitive dynamic or something going on in the market, we don\u2019t see any of those factors. The business is actually doing great. We\u2019re going to AAO this week to see thousands of our orthodontics customers. And I think we\u2019re very bullish about the business, both I\u2019d say near and mid-term as well as the long-term. Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners : Great, thanks for the color there. On the deep bite G5, I know it\u2019s still relatively early, but it sounds like you saw lot of excitement with the G5 launch events you talked about. Maybe you can just provide some more feedback you have seen from those customers and the reception so far in the field? Tom Prescott : Sure. I think, the first thing is we\u2019ve seen the use of the deep bit features go up significantly, it\u2019s very early where we have doctors that were already treating some deep bite, they are jumping right on it. Because bite ramps and some other features make it easier for them to actually do those treatments. Where we have doctors that hadn\u2019t done deep bite before, it\u2019s a more, let me try 2 or 3 cases and see how it evolves. And we\u2019re 7 weeks since release, and you would have had to have deep bite case kind of in process. So, we\u2019re very early in terms of those doctors that were not doing deep bite with clear aligners. But we\u2019re getting very good feedback from them. And we\u2019re approaching a point at quarter end 3, 6, 9 months in, we\u2019re really going to see the acceleration of those cases. And then we believe that\u2019s what really impacts utilization growth in that area. a lot of the doctors in Europe that were treating deep bite are really excited about this. And we\u2019re seeing same thing happen there, a little bit of a lag in Asia, as they really are more -- they are treating extraction cases more in general. But again seven weeks in since release, since launch, we have a whole bunch of internal metric use, they are all green, and we got a lot to learn in the months and quarters ahead, but some of these hard deep bite cases are a year and a half to sometimes two years long. And so we are going to be learning as we go through the next 6 to 12 months about how the product is evolving and we will make improvements as we go long, but all good so far. Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners : If I could just kick take one more in. On R&D line, it looks like expense jumped out quite a bit there over the fourth quarter and first quarter of last year, so maybe just walk us through the reasons behind that increase? Tom Prescott : We have some headcount expansions, we have programs spending in a couple of important areas. What I would say in general when we come back at analyst day and start talking about IP, we are inventing more things, we are writing more disclosures, we are filing for more patents, all those factors were being, were very active in terms of technology with large R&D specifically and clinical research and some other areas that are going on. So I think you\u2019ll have a chance to meet our Head of R&D at the analyst day Zelko Relic and as well as our marketing leader and talk about how we see the pipeline evolving, what is possible in the future state, and this is the money we are investing to do those things. David White : Yes. Chris, I would just add to that reinforce I guess the comments I made earlier a bit. As you look at broadly speaking, our expenses went up from Q4 to Q1 for a number of things. Q4 was artificially lower because of some core features we had of stock, which gave us a credit for stock compensation expense. And then Q1 as we start on security taxes and we have our annual [focal] process for employee compensation et cetera. And so generally speaking those are the largest drivers quarter-over-quarter and coupled with the comment Tom just made as it relates to some of our strategic growth drivers that we are also investing in. Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners : Okay, congrats on the quarter. Tom Prescott :  Thanks very much Chris. Shirley Stacy :  Well thank you everyone. This concludes our conference call today. We look forward to seeing at upcoming financial conferences, industry meetings of course our Analyst Meeting in New York on May 29. If you haven\u2019t already, please register for the Analyst Meeting. The link to the registration is on our earnings press release that we issued today or if you need any more information, please contract Investor Relations. Have a great day. Bye, bye. Operator :  Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us. On the call today, I'll provide some highlights from our second quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Invisalign clear aligner and scanner and services. I'll also provide some color on our orthodontist and GP Dentist customers, as well as progress in our geographies around the world. David will then share more detail on our second quarter financials and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and open the call up to your questions. Q2 was a good quarter and we're pleased with our results. Record revenues, which increased 17.5% year-over-year, were driven by increased Invisalign volume across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, as well as higher Invisalign ASPs. We also had a record quarter for scanner and services revenues with unit volumes up over 50% year-over-year. Our performance in Q2 reflects continued focused execution of our strategic plan, including our 3 key growth drivers, which are : market expansion, product innovation and brand strength. I'll provide a brief update on each of these before discussing our results further. First, market expansion. This strategic growth driver encompasses the way -- the many ways we are working to grow the adult treatment category, increase our share of teen treatment and, in parallel, open up new geographies. In the teen patient segment, which is still primarily a North America focus today, we had a very good start to the summer season. In Q2, a total of 28,300 teenagers began treatment with Invisalign worldwide, up 8.6% sequentially and up 20.4% year-over-year. The summer months of June, July and August are typically the time that most teenagers start orthodontic treatment and so far, this summer looks to be solid. We're pleased with our continued progress in this, the largest and most important segment of the orthodontic market. During Q2, we ran teen promotions intended to address potential barriers to teen adoption, including for mom acceptance. The goal of these promotions was to increase utilization among high-volume North American orthodontists who infrequently use Invisalign for their teen patients. Results were favorable as targeted doctors that participated grew their teen volume for Invisalign significantly higher than non-targeted high-volume orthos. We're continuing these promotions into Q3, which historically been our largest teen quarter. While I'll touch on our performance by region in a moment, this is a good time to talk about driving growth in new geographies. Today, we're announcing further expansion in the EMEA region with 14 additional European countries moving from distributor coverage to our direct sales organization. As with the previous countries we added in Q1, we do not expect a material impact for some time. In the near term, we will leverage the existing infrastructure in adjacent country markets as we build local sales organizations to drive long-term market penetration. While individually small today, taken together, these new country markets will complement our growing base and increase critical mass across Europe. We continue to be excited about the longer-term growth potential in this important region, both in our existing country markets and these new ones. Our second growth driver is product innovation, which aims to create greater doctor preference through an intense focus on innovation with a goal of supporting increased adoption and utilization for our products. In Q2, we continued successful programs to commercialize Invisalign G5, our latest innovation specifically designed for deep bite treatment. Deep bite is a very pervasive functional orthodontic problem that presents in almost 1/2 of the existing ortho case starts in North America and EMEA with approximately 1/3 of the case starts in Asia. And while experienced doctors have been using Invisalign to treat deep bites for years, Invisalign G5 is designed to make treatment with Invisalign easier for our doctors and help them achieve even better, more predictable clinical outcomes. During the quarter, we saw a good initial use of G5, especially in the EMEA and APAC regions where doctors are routinely treating more complex cases. And finally, brand strength, our third key growth driver. We are working to build and leverage the strength of the Invisalign brand to create consumer demand and drive purchase intent among consumers in more and more countries worldwide. We continue to make great progress here. So let's start with North America, our largest market for consumer marketing. In Q2, we created more than 331 million consumer impressions through 426 media placements. Q2 also saw the launch of new teen-focused programs to leverage the busy teen treatment season, including new social media platforms specifically designed to engage with the teen audience on Tumblr and Instagram. To further support that strategy, we sponsored 4 DigiTour 2014 events that brought the Invisalign Teen brand directly to more than 17,000 teen consumers. Our efforts to influence the teen market will continue in Q3 as we leverage the DigiTour program and its popular YouTube channel to bring original content featuring Invisalign to millions of teens. In September, which has been designated as self-improvement month, a variety of PR and social media will provide a relevant connection to the Invisalign brand and our outreach to teens, moms and adult patients. Switching to EMEA, our new, more localized consumer initiatives targeted at high-potential and under-penetrated cities in Europe are proving to be successful. In particular, we're seeing strong impact in growth from these campaigns on our social media platforms with social media engagement up more than 150% over last year. We believe this has helped support our continued progress in this region. Continuing our strategy of using real patients to tell the Invisalign story to consumers, we launched a competition in the U.K. called Invisalign Changed My Life. Past Invisalign patients can share their story of how their life has been transformed by their new smile and the 2 winning smiles and their stories will be featured in our marketing materials, on Invisalign websites and in press and social media. Winners will be announced at a VIP event at the National Portrait Gallery in London later this year. And in Asia Pacific, we participated recently in the PR launch of 2 new Invisalign-dedicated practices in Singapore. Just 2 examples of how doctors in the APAC region are leveraging the strength of the Invisalign brand to reach consumers in their respective markets. In combination, these 3 proven strategic growth drivers, market expansion, product innovation and brand strength, are helping to extend growth in our most important country markets, while opening up new ones. Let's now touch on the progress we're making in these regions starting with North America. For Q2, North America Invisalign volume was up 4.2% sequentially and up 7.6% year-over-year. The sequential increase in Q2 reflects growth from both North American orthodontists and GP dentists. The year-over-year increase reflects continued expansion of our customer base, as well as increased utilization from our North American ortho customers, including teenager cases. For our international business, comprised of EMEA and APAC, for Q2, we continued to see strong growth of Invisalign case volume from international doctors with total case volume up 12% sequentially and 26.3% year-over-year, reflecting momentum across these markets. In EMEA, growth was strong across all core countries and up 20.8% year-over-year, with France and Spain leading the way. Progress was driven by incremental investment in sales coverage, continued enhancements in clinical education programs and growing doctor confidence as innovation in Invisalign product continues. In the APAC region, Invisalign case volume increased 42.3% year-over-year. China continued to deliver above our expectations, more than doubling case volume compared to the same quarter last year. We also saw strong growth from Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Southeast Asia countries. Doctors across this region routinely treat more complex cases and continue to more rapidly try and adopt product innovations like Invisalign G5. In addition, given we're still in the early days of growth in this region, our doctors are realizing significant benefits from our clinical education programs. In June, we held our first ever Invisalign Asia Pacific Summit in Singapore with more than 450 Invisalign doctors attending from across the region. We are very pleased by the participation and the great post-Summit feedback. The Summit program included presentations on the development and advancement of the Invisalign system, with particular focus on Invisalign G5. Some of the most valuable elements of our Invisalign Summit program are peer-to-peer lead clinical sessions, case sharing roundtable sessions and practice development workshops. All were attended with standing-room only. We continue to learn a great deal from our customers in this region as they deliver outstanding clinical outcomes on the most challenging orthodontic cases we see in the world today. Turning to our scanner business. Q2 was another great quarter for our scanner and services segment, which is up both sequentially and year-over-year, with scanner units up over 50% year-over-year. During Q2, we launched the new iTero 5.2 software upgrade, designed to increase practice efficiency and significantly expand the extensive array of iTero features currently available. This upgrade enhanced the customer experience, by adding a new orthodontic laboratory workflow, Vivera Scan, Vivera Pre Debonding and new algorithms for faster Invisalign scanning. With this new upgrade, our customers have seen Invisalign scan time reductions of more than 25%, even while preserving the high-quality data required to ensure a great fit for the Invisalign system. Vivera Pre Debonding allows the doctors to scan their patients before they debond or remove the patient's brackets and wires. This important capability allows them to order Vivera Retainers, while the patient is still in treatment, eliminating the need for temporary retention. This iTero feature is now in limited market release and expected to move to full release in mid-Q3. We also launched new iTero's monthly subscription packages and multiple scanner subscription discount programs that have been well received by new and existing customers. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our scanner business, and the positive impact that this is having on our Invisalign business. For Q2, the percentage of Invisalign cases submitted digitally from a scanner in North America rose to 32.7% compared to 30.2% in Q1 and 25.3% in Q2 a year ago. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to David for a review of our Q2 financial results. David? David L. White: Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the details, I'd like to note that unless stated otherwise, all the financial information I'll discuss will be presented on a GAAP basis. With that, let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was a record $192.5 million, up 6.6% from the prior quarter and up 17.5% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Second quarter clear aligner revenue of $179.7 million was up 6.8% sequentially and up 17.2% year-over-year. Sequential growth reflected increased case volume by both North American and international regions. ASPs were essentially flat. Our year-over-year growth reflected case volume growth across all channels, as well as favorable ASPs from a higher mix of full Invisalign products, a higher mix of international business, as well as the favorable impact of our acquisition of our APAC distributor in May 2013. For the second quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 119,300 cases were up 6.3% sequentially, rebounding nicely from a slow start in Q1, but offset by some softness in June in North America. Year-over-year growth of 12.4% was driven by increased utilization from our international and North American customers, as well as continued expansion of our customer base. For North American orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign case volume increased 3.7% sequentially and 10.1% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, case volume increased 4.7% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume increased 12% sequentially and 26.3% year-over-year. In Q2, we added 920 new North American doctors and 1,380 new international doctors for a total of 2,300 new Invisalign doctors. Together, this represented a 22% sequential increase as a result of a higher number of planned training events. Total Invisalign utilization for Q2 was 4.4 cases per doctor, up slightly from 4.3 last quarter. North American ortho utilization was 8.4, up from 8.1 last quarter. North America GP utilization was 2.9, flat from last quarter. And international doctor utilization was 4.5, up from 4.3 last quarter. Second quarter revenue for our scanner and services segment was a record $12.8 million, a 3.1% sequential increase, reflecting continued penetration and market share gains. On a year-over-year basis, our scanner and services segment increased 21.6%, driven by a 50.7% increase in scanner volume. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 75.6%, down sequentially 0.4 points and up 0.1 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 78.8%, down 0.3 points sequentially and up 0.4 points year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily the result of increased training events, which are only marginally profitable. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher ASPs. Q2 gross margin for our scanner segment was 29.5%, down 4.1 points sequentially and down 4.4 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily the result of increased service and warranty costs. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of lower ASPs as we reduced our scanner pricing last year. Q2 operating expenses were $96.7 million. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $1.3 million, due primarily to increased marketing programs and headcount. This was partially offset by a benefit from a refund of medical device excise taxes we paid previously in Q1. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 operating expenses were up $11 million, incidental to the growth of the business, which primarily relates to headcount additions. This increase was also partially offset by the aforementioned medical device excise refund and elimination of the tax altogether. Our second quarter operating margin was 25.3%, up 2.2 points sequentially and year-over-year. Our quarter-over-quarter improvement was primarily driven by higher Invisalign volume. With regards to our second quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 26.8%. Our Q2 rate was negatively impacted by a one-time discrete item of $2.1 million, primarily related to prior years. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.43, compared to $0.39 reported in Q1 and $0.36 reported in the same quarter last year. Moving on to the balance sheet. For the second quarter, our accounts receivable balance was $131 million, up approximately 3.8% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 61 days, a 2-day improvement sequentially and was down 1 day over the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $5 million, primarily relating to manufacturing capacity additions. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $69.7 million. And free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $64.8 million. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $502.7 million. This compares to $472 million at the end of 2013, an increase of $30.7 million. During Q2, we paid $70 million under an accelerated stock repurchase plan, or ASR, for an initial delivery of approximately 997,000 shares of Align common stock. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined at completion of the ASR based on the company's volume-weighted average stock price during the term of the ASR, less an agreed upon discount. The ASR is expected to be completed by July 29, 2014. There remains approximately $230 million available for repurchases under the existing stock repurchase authorization, of which $30 million is expected to be used for repurchases over the next 9 months. Let's now turn to our business outlook for the third quarter and the factors that inform our view. We're pleased with the business, and remain confident in our ability to continue to drive growth of Invisalign globally. While customers reported stable overall patient traffic, our June case receipts in North America were a little softer than our expectations. Most teen case starts occur in the summer months, and we expect the positive impact we saw in Q2 from teenagers to continue in Q3. Consistent with previous summers, busy teen ortho practices typically have fewer consultations in order to accommodate the summer rush for kids before school starts. Q3 is typically a seasonally slower quarter for North American GPs and international doctors who spend fewer days in the office due to summer vacations and extended holidays. As such, we anticipate Invisalign case shipments to be down to flat sequentially from Q2 for North American GPs and international doctors. This is a more pronounced effect in Europe. For our scanner business, we expect it to be down sequentially in line with lower capital equipment sales in the summer. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows : Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 118,100 to 120,500 cases, roughly flat with our Q2 results, but consistent with our historical Q2 to Q3 3-year average. We expect net revenues to be in the range of $186.3 million to $190.2 million, slightly down relative to our case volume outlook due to lower scanner revenues, higher promotional activity and other factors impacting ASPs. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 75.1% to 75.6%, flat to slightly down sequentially from Q2, primarily reflecting lower ASPs as just mentioned. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $96.7 million to $97.4 million. This is flat to slightly up when compared to Q2 reflecting continued investment in our strategic growth drivers. Our operating margin should be in the range of 23.2% to 24.3%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 23%. And diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 82.1 million, net of any stock repurchases. Taken together, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.44. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments. Thomas M. Prescott: Thanks, David. We are pleased to deliver these financial results, along with continued progress on key strategic initiatives. Our long-term goal is that someday, clear aligner treatment will replace brackets and wires as the standard of care in orthodontics. When we see solid adoption of key new product innovations like Invisalign G5 and are able to grow our penetration of the teen market, which is always the hardest share to gain, we know we're on the right track. Over the next few months, the entire Align team will be committed to ensuring our customers and their practices are thriving with patients that are overjoyed, not just with their new smile, but also with the Invisalign journey that helped them get there. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move forward. And with that, I'll say thank you for your time today and I'll turn the call back over to the operator for some questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Allen Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This is Nathan Rich on for Bob today. I wanted to start with your comments around June being a little bit softer. Your case volume guidance for the third quarter, I think, was pretty good given that you -- like you said, it is a seasonally slower quarter. Could you just maybe go into a little bit more detail on specifically what you saw in June, and kind of how that informed your outlook for the third quarter? David L. White: Sure, Nathan. This is David. So I think you understand that when we put our guidance together, it's informed by a number of factors and so this is really just one data point of many. And the comment, specifically in the call related to a softness in June relative to our expectations, what I mean by that, we had expected a certain amount of lift from May to June. And while we saw the lift, we didn't see the lift that we had hoped for. And on the basis of that, that had some bearing on our guidance and had that not been the case, we might have guided Q3 a little bit differently. That said, also, one of the other data points are the fact that our teen business was very strong in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year, up 9% quarter-over-quarter. Another good factor, Tom mentioned that we got off to a good start. I think that's certainly one of those factors that contributes to it. June, July and August are typically weaker in North America GP practices. So it's not entirely surprising. We've certainly seen this in the past. And I think when we look at our guidance overall and we look at it relative to history, particularly from Q2 to Q3, our guidance from a volume standpoint and so forth is pretty consistent with historical Q2 to Q3 transitions. And even at that, it's up at the midpoint of guidance, it's up 14 -- 14.5% year-over-year, which we think is great relative to any peers in the industry. Nathan Allen Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great, no, that makes a lot of sense. And I also wanted to shift quickly to ASP growth. It seemed like in North America, I think ASPs are up about 1.5%. You've seen a couple of quarters of nice growth year-over-year. I was just wondering if you could kind of help us understand what might be driving that. And as one of the factors, maybe growth from new dentists who might not be doing the volume needed to get to the discount and that might be helping North America ASPs. David L. White: So ASPs are influenced by a number of things. When you kind of unpack it, it's dependent upon product mix. It's dependent upon geographic mix. It's dependent upon channel mix between ortho and typical GPs and how they participate in our advantage program and so forth. So if you look at it over the last year and as we look at it going forward, we continue to believe that as we treat more and more complex cases and as our international business grows, that those 2 factors will have an effect of, over a long-term, of raising ASPs. And that is fairly -- we've seen that certainly over the last year. As it relates to North America, I think the one variable there in North America that also has a bearing on ASPs in North America, primarily relates to the product mix. And that product mix is counterbalanced, you might say, by two things. One is the complex cases that our orthos are handling and as their utilization grows, and their practices grows, that tends to influence ASPs in one direction, and dependent also on which orthos that's coming from. On the GP side, where they're typically handling more simple cases that tends to be the other end of the barbell, you might say. We've not typically given breakouts or an outlook on those, but we think the trends on ASPs across all regions will be influenced by those same factors. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Tom, just want to take sort of your long-term growth guidance of 15% to 25% in perspective. If I look over the last 18 months or so, I mean, you've been sort of trending at the bottom end of that range and if you kind of look next quarter, obviously, you're guiding below that range and I understand the issues in June may be impacting the third quarter guidance, but as I look at North America more broadly, that will be the third quarter in a row of sort of single-digit growth. And I'm just kind of curious, is there anything to talk about with respect to maturation of the market or it getting more difficult to compete for market share against brackets and wires? I mean, how should we think about the growth from a longer-term perspective? Thomas M. Prescott: Great question and a simple statement is that we're very committed to our long-term model. We have a great deal of confidence. And then we go and test ourselves maybe against a number of measures. One is our own expectations, which we don't talk about externally. Another is industry peers, and then finally, what are we -- how much headroom do we have left? And in every direction we look, we are -- we can't even see the ceiling. Our relative penetration into -- just part of the market in North America, for example, where there has been a little deceleration is something like 9% or 10% -- 10%, 11%. So every time we evolve the product and we can better compete for complex cases like deep bite across a wider number of orthodontists or dentists that do orthodontics, we then have an opportunity to go compete for that case, but it takes time. The more complex the case, the longer that time. We get them to try 2 or 3 cases. It might take 6 to 9 to 12 months for them to see that case really progressing and then build confidence that they can deliver the results they want. So with every more significant evolution that projects to us competing for more complex cases, at least in North America and to a certain extent, Europe, the longer it takes us to do that. The exception probably for that is in Asia. What we're seeing much faster uptake on new features just because the cases they treat every day are all so much more difficult. The average case that presents is so much more complex. So they're looking for any tools that can work to solve that problem and there's less, I'd say maybe, ingrained legacy behavior among the clinicians. Brackets and wires have been here for 100 years. So for us, it's really about market adoption, clinical proof, clinical excellence to demonstrate that we can actually help them deliver those great results and an understanding. Practice by practice, we're starting a process of increasing confidence, slow steady adoption and I'll point you back to our teen share gain, which is the hardest share and most of that gain is in North America. That's the hardest case for us to win because mom, dad and the doctor are all targeted to be perfect. And if they believe there's any clinical tradeoff, they're just not going to put that kid into teen. Finally, you've raised competition and I think, look, more competition is good for everybody. Everybody's sword gets sharper, right? So what I'd say is brackets-and-wires companies, their games have all improved. That's a good thing for the industry. It's a good thing for our customers and their patients. There's more clear aligner players, but for the most part, they're at the low end and it's more noise than anything else. What's going on for us is really delivering 2 to 3x growth in a segment pointing towards mainstream, but not there yet, especially for ortho, in a segment that's growing maybe low single digits. And so we're going to compete like the Dickens and take what we can, but it is not an issue of limited headroom or maturation of market opportunity. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I appreciate those comments and maybe I can just follow up on the competition perspective. As I think about ASP, David, I appreciate your comments that the ASP is rising due to the mix and the slant towards international and more complex cases. Is there anything to say about organic pricing trends? If we were to take mix out of the equation? Thomas M. Prescott: If you -- I think we actually try -- the couple of last slides in the webcast slide package, we try to break out what we'll call kind of full type cases and limited treatments, non-comprehensive treatments and what you can see from both of those, when we adjust, when we normalize for factors like FX and the like, we're pretty stable to up a little bit. What I would say, using North America as an example, when there's a little less volume than we expected, and you could make that as the case for June, since we had a little deceleration, both in GP and ortho, we get a little less participation from it among the advantaged doctors and that translates to them not achieving maybe the same level for advantage or getting as much total discount. We would rather have ASP go down for that reason and have them fill up their practice with Invisalign. So in our minds, that's the one element of ASP that we're not thrilled with being up a little bit. We're happy with mix shift driving that, we're happy with the rest of it. But this is an area where we continue to have opportunities to compete and it means some of our advantage doctors didn't participate as fully as we thought in Q2, but stable pricing is the message underneath all that. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Last question and then I'll jump off. David, the cash is sort of piling up on the balance sheet. You've obviously started to buy back a little bit of stock here. How should we think about the plans for capital deployment going forward? Should we think about it as more share repo down the road? Or Tom, I don't know if there's a strategic message that you want to try to deliver. David L. White: Yes, I'll just add, when we announced in April our accelerated stock repurchase plan, we announced at the same time that we were committed to a $300 million purchase over the 3 years that are ahead of us, with the first $100 million of that being expected to occur in the first year. And so we will close that ASR completely out and -- next week. And we'll then repurchase the remaining amount under that $100 million initial tranche, you might say, over the balance of the year. And I think the only guidance we've given is that there's another -- there'll then be another $200 million to follow over the next couple of years. And I don't think we've got anything more to add to that then -- at this point. Thomas M. Prescott: I'll finish your comment. We're -- to the extent we were going to do anything, it would probably more in the area of technology versus -- we don't feel like the money is burning a hole in our pocket. We're funding -- we have a great free cash flow machine. We're funding our research and development, our expansion around the globe, our building of brand, our development of a better company that is more scalable and those -- most of those show up on income statement, not the balance sheet. With that said, we continue to have dialogue with the board, but we're not going to run around and start looking at everything that's for sale. The idea is to build a great organic business and build out our scanner install base and bring digital tools and capabilities to our customers. That reduces friction them and leads to some benefit for us. You see that showing up in Invisalign. And we're going to pour the coal on the fire as we build out the Invisalign franchise as well. So I think at this point in time, we're not -- we're trying to stay very focused in executing the strategy we laid out at the analyst meeting a month or so ago. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jon Block with Stifel, Nicolaus. Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Maybe my first question builds on Glen's a little bit in North America, a little bit more specifically to North American GP volume. I believe that was up, obviously, a lot of numbers, but I believe that was up 5% year-over-year and then I'm looking through and it seems like Express was actually down year-over-year. And so can you, Tom, maybe speak specifically to North American GP growth because I'm being pulled in 2 directions. One, I would think the scanners and that should help drive utilization maybe within the GP channel, but then on the other side, is it possible sort of the growth in '12 and part of '13 was inflated a bit through sort of an Invisalign 5 and some of the promos there. So maybe if you can talk to those dynamics, that'd be very helpful. Thomas M. Prescott: Sure. I guess, GP, first of all is -- building out a GP channel in the biggest GP dental market, which is North America, is a strategic priority. There are very few companies that have successfully built out with a specialty product that requires some missionary work, build out a high preference doctor product to this very fragmented base of customers that cover a huge range of procedures day-to-day in their office. We're still early in that journey, so I -- we don't think that's linear, and -- but it's very, very important to us, and we're going to get it right over time. And we still grow faster than all of our peers with consumable products and everything else that are calling on this channel, whether that's direct or whether that's the distribution. The second part of your question maybe is both mix and channel and that's Express 5 or 10, and a little more specific to GP, correct? Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Yes. Thomas M. Prescott: And so what I'd say is two things. One, it's not a lack of emphasis by us and when we do promotions as we did maybe 1 year, 1.5 years ago on Express 5 and 10 is to get trial. Our positioning for the Express products, from the very beginning, both 5 and 10, were for the more experienced customers, not just orthos but GPs that had experience doing Invisalign treatment and could comfortably look at a malocclusion and set expectations for that patient and know what they could deliver in 5 stages or 10. It's hard and there's a limited degree of malocclusion treatment that's predictable with those shorter treatments. So I think what's happened over time, first, the good news is we're winning on the high end. We're taking share on more complex cases. We're winning in teen, which is wonderful. Our strategy at the other end was to make sure we're competing up and down the line and we're doing fine there. It's just that relative, there's more -- doctors have said, \"I'd rather just go to an assist case. I'd rather do a full case if I have to worry about doing it in 10 stages. If it's 17 stages on full, I'm fine with that.\" If they're an advantage doctor, and they're a significant advantage doctor, the difference in price isn't even that great between Express 10 and a full case. So I think the reality is, let's just call it settling in. Now I would say, and there was a question earlier, there is more noise in competition with both bracket players with specialty brackets for 6-month treatments, as well as there has been for a while a lot of players offering simple treatments, but none of them seem to work that well and what we're going to do is stay committed to delivering treatments we can stand behind, so that what we show in the ClinCheck is what gets delivered to the patient. And there's very few companies out there that can make that statement, so more of a mix shift, still in love with the channel, it's a long-term journey and I just say it's settling it. But there's a lot more movie to be seen here, I think : a, for the GP channel; and b, for the different offerings that will evolve over time. Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great, I've got one more question and maybe one clarification. Just you mentioned the promotions on the teen side of things. And you've certainly run promos there before, I think with Vivera and other stuff like that. But I think, Tom, you were sort of alluding to a specialized promotion for high-volume orthos that had not really used Invisalign for teens before. So is this the start of something new here, very targeted promotions to try to get some guys on board for teen and we're sort of in the first inning of that? Thomas M. Prescott: Short answer is yes. Attractive practices with great businesses that haven't been confident enough to use Invisalign Teen yet. I think coming on the heels of SmartTrack and G5, seeing a lot of clinical evidence and hearing from colleagues how well it's working, and then us trying to compete for the toughest case to steal from brackets and wires in that office and having some success in a targeted way. Call it increased support and focus by the team and a little better financial proposition for that practice. And I think it is very early, but so far so good. I hope we have more good news to report to you at the end of Q3, but that's a very targeted approach. Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great. And then last one, just a clarification, David, I think this is for you. You mentioned some of the year-over-year margin expansion from the elimination of med device tax. But did you actually also recognize a credit in the quarter and was that a credit to the OpEx numbers that you reported? David L. White: Yes, Jon. So there was -- there were basically 3, you might say, moving parts in the quarter. We did receive a medical device tax refund from payments we had made in early Q1 prior to our engagement with the IRS at that point in time, so those were refunded to us in the quarter. They amounted to about $1.2 million and contributed about $0.015 to EPS. On the... Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, and we're done -- I'm sorry, go ahead. David L. White: And then I was going to say the other moving parts were the ASR was about $0.005 accretion. And then we had some discrete items -- a discrete item, I guess, that relates to taxes that had a one-time, nonrecurring impact of about $0.03 unfavorable. So net-net, about $0.01 unfavorable across those 3 moving parts. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : One question as a bit of a retrospective on the first half of the year. Thinking back to comments that you made in January and then gave us a bit more clarity on in April, given everything that was going on with the weather. You commented that there were patients who were having some difficulty scheduling, especially of course here in the Northeast and the Midwest. I wonder at this point, do you have a sense for, number one, whether all that volume has come back through the system? And number two, how much of an impact it might have had in terms of dynamics in 2Q relative to Q1 where you might have had a few folks come back through the system that couldn't get there in the first quarter? Thomas M. Prescott: Steve, it's a good question and it's very, very difficult to pin down. We tried to survey our customers and kind of help interrogate their schedules and calendars to get a sense of what that rescheduling shuffle looked like, and there were 2 or 3 or 4 cycles of this in January and February and later in March and each one of those periods of prolonged bad weather sent everybody scurrying and I think at the point when we talked about it before is when that happens in an ortho office, they kind of reschedule everybody as they can. When it happens in a GP's office, where we're already a smaller part of the relative practice, a lot of people coming in are in pain. They have a serious problem. They're in the middle of a restoration. The Invisalign case reschedules in that office are going to get pushed pretty far down the path to priority. They're going to deal with people with endodontic problems and that need to get in there very quickly. So what we heard from our customers as we were getting into April was things were finally settling down. We have -- short answer is we have no quantitative view. Wish we could, but we have no quantitative view if there were ultimately people that never came back, nor do our customers know what happened. What they do know is their patient volumes, procedure volumes and patient traffic was reduced through those periods. And in general, I think most of our practices feel it's returned to normalized levels. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, that's really helpful. And then one on Europe, if we think back to 2013 and the acquisition of the distributor in Asia, it was a bit of a tailwind. It sounds like you're not expecting a proportional tailwind with the change to distribution in Europe. So I guess, question one is, why is that? Is it as simple as you're just not bringing on reps from the distribution network? And then two, how could we see the contribution from the direct selling effort there ramp over time? Thomas M. Prescott: Sure, a couple of things. First, I think we've -- first of all, this is very important and it's strategic for us. It is different because in Asia Pacific, we had a going business with 50 employees and significant volume. In fact, their volume was growing faster than any other finite geography in the country. And then we also gave -- and it was -- so that was meaningful volume and it was growing 40% a year, something more than that, we -- 30% to 40%. We actually were giving that distributor 50% discount to do all of the clinical education, training, support, promotion, consumer, everything. And so we got all that volume, actually increased that volume overnight -- increased that volume, but overnight, doubled the revenue per case coming in. We would have the same scenario with this, I'll call it a steady process, that we're going at in Europe, where we've rethought -- with our distribution partner that had a very large geography in many countries, seems that our -- the distribution partner's focus was on a number of other countries and geographies, the Middle East, Turkey, Russia and not as much on former Eastern European countries, the Nordic countries, et cetera, where we had either presence close to being direct or directly adjacent to where we had meaningful mass. The idea was that rather than acquisition, we would just bring those back. We would invest in those geographies in a thoughtful, organized way. And that's what's happening. But instead of bringing in a going business, we're bringing in geography, and in a few cases, very small volumes. In the short term, we'll pivot to put small level of incremental resources, leaning on our adjacent country sales forces and management teams. And over time, we'll start slowly to build some direct teams in those -- in the more important country geographies. But it's much more of a long-term complement to the excellent growth we're seeing in Europe and EMEA. And over time, it'll be able to leverage the critical mass we've already got building into these countries in northern and southern and former Eastern Europe. Again, very different story, very important to us, but won't be meaningful in revenue terms in the near term. Shirley Stacy : Steve, next question please? Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : I wanted to start in some of the marketing initiatives o U.S. I appreciate the color you gave on that, Tom. I'm wondering if you could provide maybe in qualitative details, so piggybacking on some of the comments you guys made at your analyst day on some of the progress you're making in China, I guess, beyond the KOLs. Talk about maybe some of the barriers, I know these events you describe tend to be well attended and -- but how is it translating into volumes, again, qualitatively? And what kind of barriers are you running into, if any? Thomas M. Prescott: Well, certainly, first of all, we are doing business in all of the major institutions. The delivery of care is organized into kind of what look like hospitals. And there are a series of specialists and generalists that deliver care both to private and, I'll call it, public. And in many of these, more public hospitals, we are on -- we're in the programs to be included with those systems. It takes a long time. It doesn't mean it's every one. In parallel with that, we are -- there's clinic operators opening daily, weekly, almost. There's 20 million to 50 million reasonably wealthy Chinese to which basic health care services and oral -- access to oral care is a new thing, very, very attractive and they're very drawn to our brand. And so the third thing is we've built our business in China starting 6 years ago or something like that from developing clinical relationships and research relationships. And so we have excellent relationships and have earned respect from some of the most influential KOLs and they're actually helping us educate as part of their role, we have advisory boards over there. And in our minds, this is an incredibly valuable thing because they're treating the most complex cases we see in the world. It's stunning, the complexity they're dealing with, and we're learning more about what the appliance can do, what Invisalign can do and how we should modify our protocols. So we're actually doing clinical research over there with them. That has significantly impacted many of the hospitals and teaching institutions around China. And over time, as we talked about during the analyst day, we're going to be moving out of just the major cities to the smaller second-tier cities, that are only 10 million to 15 million population, right? So -- but we're getting good traction both on a purely private side with clinic operators, as well as the big hospitals. Not everybody, and -- but the barriers for us are really around clinical excellence, clinical education and support and we're not trying to go fast per se, we're trying to do it right. And yet, I think we said doubling, I'll just give you the number, our increase in volume, our China business was up 178% versus the same quarter a year ago. I mean, so even though we're trying to take a thoughtful approach to this, it's growing very, very rapidly. So we're pleased and the barriers are really around competition, traditional brackets and wires and there are some local players, but we're doing just fine, and we're staying humble and hungry. Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Okay, I appreciate that color. And just one other -- on iTero, obviously, nice progress this quarter. Where -- I guess, what type of sort of long-term run rate -- I know not -- you're not going to give longer-term guidance on iTero, specifically, but sort of maybe conceptually, what kind of growth can that segment, I mean, as you expand its sort of capabilities and as dentists -- more dentists embrace the concept of digital dentistry, what kind of growth can that segment really generate? And obviously, as it sort of ties in with Invisalign case growth, like, how big can that segment get? Thomas M. Prescott: Sure, let me give you a future state description. This is not guidance, to be clear. And we've talked about this a little bit at the analyst day. We believe that high-quality intra oral scanners will be ubiquitous over time at chair side. And busy practices will have multiple units. It may segment to where there's higher performance scanners and very low more quadrant or individual tooth to support just specific restorative procedures. But with that said, we believe they're going to be ubiquitous. And seeing that trend and believing that and being committed to supporting that with improving value proposition, better performance and having the best scanner, we -- our goal is to build the biggest standalone scanner install base in the industry. And if not #1, then a very close #2. Now can we do that against the big players? We'll see. So far, we're doing all right. We are the fastest-growing and the largest standalone install base out there of anybody. Sirona has got a huge start on everybody, most of their scanners are not standalone, they're with integrated systems. So in our mind, that's how big it is. And when we help our customers' offices, whether that be an orthodontist or a GP Dentist, become fully digital, we can help them remove friction from so many of their procedures and processes. It's better for the patient; it's better for the practice; everything happens faster, smoother, quicker; cycle times get compressed, quality goes up; we think costs will go down for everything. And we intend to be in the middle of that. So we think that's a very big market. And when we're ready, we'll start thinking globally. Again, we've -- we're building this model out in North America and at some point in time, I think, as both Raphael Pascaud and Tim Mack spoke about, there are opportunities to revisit thinking about a number of countries and regions globally, but it's a little too early for that. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Tom, this is the second quarter in a row that looks like where North American doc trainings were down almost 20% year-over-year, is there something seasonal going on there? What do you -- what would -- should we look for in the second half of the year? And do you think that's a direct factor in terms of the moderating North American case volume trends? Thomas M. Prescott: No. Let me start in reverse order here. No to the last, for sure. There is enormous interest in Invisalign in practice and we're training more orthodontists again now. We're training more GPs, we have -- and we're training a lot of doctors internationally. For a long time, there was very little training going on outside the U.S. The global rate of training for us has actually gone substantially up, but I think you're asking a question more about North America. And there are 2 or 3 factors going on. One, we're still ramping up a very new entry-level course called Invisalign Fundamentals. We're still ramping it up. We got behind in Q1 given weather and then even into Q2 where offices were in a scramble mode to reschedule patients and generate stronger cash flows and all that, and so I'd still think we're building up capability to do a more intensive Invisalign Fundamentals class, which is the new one. And we're very satisfied we're on the right track. We think there are tens of thousands more GPs that want and would like to have a procedure like Invisalign in practices -- in their practice. And so again, we don't think there's any headroom issues there. But with that said, I think this is a ramp up for us with a very new program that's a bit more intensive and more time on the front end committed by sales force. And on the back end, immediately after the training program, with a few more members of the staff, not just the doctor attending. At a time when the doctors are scrambling with weaker cash flow months and schedule in the office that were tough, so April was one of the places that showed up. But I think going forward, our clinical education programs continue to get better. We're going to see more impact and we continue to see good results in general from better entry-point training. And what you don't see, because we don't really report, we do a lot of next-level training. We don't report those because they're not new doctors trained, and that whole process is getting better as well, as we have -- we continue to be able to tell the clinical innovation story and demonstrate how they can use these new features. Those things continue to be well-attended by both experienced orthos and GPs. So no issues from our perspective, just part of the journey. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And in terms of the EMEA expansions. Just curious, why now? Why make those pushes in those markets? And is there a rate-limiting factor terms of the amount of capacity you have as a management team to focus and execute those well? Thomas M. Prescott: Sure. What I -- I'll step back a little bit for a moment and what I'd say is this is not so much -- if it appears happenstance, it's not. This is really a series of -- coming out of a series of thoughtful discussions over the last 1.5 years or 2 with our partner and a realistic check-in about where their priority was going to be and the opportunity that was being missed over time with some of these countries and geographies that were being underserved. And interest by clinicians in those countries in getting trained, in getting started, et cetera. So rather than pivot back a huge number of countries overnight and hit the problem you describe, which is what we do with 25 countries overnight we've, in a thoughtful, organized way, done this in a couple of phases and you're seeing a second phase here of this and that's purposely for the reason you just described as the outcome we don't want. We want, first of all, to be able to be responsive to the customers in those regions. We want this to be a good news story. And we also just don't intend to step up and have a visible sign of what I'll say in the shorter term, fairly low productive headcount expansion in this geography. So this is a phasing process. It's being done in a thoughtful way and we're really leveraging the adjacent country, solid mature leadership teams, take advantage of that. So that's what you're seeing. And over time, we'll incrementally look for those opportunities. Shirley Stacy : Great, next question please. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Let me just ask 2 very quick ones here, if I could, Tom. Most of my questions have been answered. But on the European distributors there, I guess, still trying to feel out maybe the size of that. I hear what you're saying that it's small relative to AsiaPac. Anything you can give us on maybe the base of volumes there, is it 10% what was in AsiaPac? Is it 50% what was in AsiaPac? Or maybe give us employees, we know there were the 50 employees in AsiaPac or 15 sales reps in AsiaPac, anything to help us kind of size these 25 countries versus the AsiaPac efforts? Thomas M. Prescott: Sure, I'll make it very simple. 0 employees we're picking up, very little book of business, many interested customers, but consider these start-up geographies, which is the -- to the earlier question, it's a very significant -- very important to us to do, makes a great deal of sense and it's a wonderful complement to the base we're building with critical mass in these other countries. But we're basically picking up opportunity, we're not picking up volume. It's not even a volume to talk about. And so I'm not even going to put a percent on it. It's very small. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then only other question then, if I look at the second to last slide in your slide deck, the -- one of the ASP slides. I'm struck by two things. I guess, one, the big uptick we saw 3 quarters ago and the stability we've now seen in those ASPs over the last 3 quarters. So one, is it just the lack of some of the Express 5, Express 10 trialing in that, that maybe drove some of the earlier volatility around those prices that you see in that chart? Is that mainly what's been driving the stability there the last 3 quarters? And then once we get -- if I back into kind of your third quarter ASP guidance, it looks like it's somewhere right around there maybe a little bit below where it's been the last 3 quarters here on a worldwide basis, but what happens after the next quarter, I guess? Are we kind of stable at this trend line or what takes it up the next tranche from here? Thomas M. Prescott: Sure. Let me just point to something you said, which is basically, yes. We had promotion -- the thing that was moving Express -- we had 2 or 3 things going on. It happened over a more extended period of time because we had both a promotion in trial and expiration of promotions that lasted a couple of quarters in North America. We also had some things going on with i7 and i14 in Europe, which wasn't as visible because there's not as much volume among GPs and they're generally treating harder cases, so there was a little less interest there. Over time, we've got a decent base built now. I think we've sorted out with experienced doctors where an Express 5 or 10 offering fits. And they use it for a patient that is not ready for comprehensive treatment, wants to spend a bit less money, but just wants to deal with a small degree of crowding or close a small space. So I'd say that's pretty steady in volume and it's -- while there's a little bit of volume growth, it's being swamped by the significant growth we're getting in teen, generally a little more complex cases and what's going on as well in Europe and in Asia. Both of those things on the full product are really moving -- geographic mix, are really, on full cases, are really moving that ASP number. And the last point, I'll let David talk a little bit about our guidance for Q3. You were asking a question about maybe why is that pointing down a little bit and I'll let David speak to that. David L. White: Well, Jeff, you're talking a little bit about volatility. Like I said earlier, there's a lot of factors that influence ASP, and as it specifically relates to Q3, to use that as a case in point, as our business shifts a little bit more predominantly to teen business in the summer quarter, and as we see some softening seasonally in the international region, which typically has more complex cases, the higher ASPs and so forth, the net effect of that is that we see lower ASPs in Q3. Now notwithstanding the fact that may add a little bit of volatility, you might say, into the ASPs on a quarter-to-quarter basis. The comment I made earlier about the long-term trend, we still believe. We believe the trend will continue to be favorable from an ASP standpoint primarily for many other reasons, as I previously indicated. Since this is the last question, I'm just going to add one thing in there since it didn't get asked during the call and we didn't make comment on it in our prepared remarks. Last -- you'll recall in our Q1 conference call, we talked about some overall expectations for 2014 as it related to where we stand against -- relative to our operating model. Given some of the issues we had in Q1, we reaffirmed that in the second quarter -- excuse me, end of the first quarter call. And if you look at where we are today, the first 2 quarters with the Q3 guide we've given, we continue to believe, as we did when we entered -- as when we entered into 2014, that the second half of 2014 would be stronger than the first half. And a large piece of our belief was the fact that we were investing heavily in a number of our strategic growth initiatives and that the gestation period of those investments would not begin manifesting themselves until the second half of the year or later. So as we sit here at this call and as we look at the second half of the year, we continue to believe that and believe that we can deliver revenue within that operating model and we believe that our operating margin should somewhat -- should still be consistent with 2013 as we indicated the beginning of the year. So I just wanted to add that since it didn't get brought up in our formal remarks and the opportunity didn't really come up during our Q&A session. Shirley? Shirley Stacy : We have room for one last question, I believe. Operator : Our final question will be coming from the line of Mr. John Kreger with William Blair. Roberto Fatta : This is Robbie Fatta in for John. Just one quick one on the scanner side. As you've seen increased competition in ortho offices from a couple of other guys who have launched scanners and concentrated on that space recently, how has that impacted adoption rates by orthos? Has it accelerated them or has it taken longer as they evaluate new products? Thomas M. Prescott: I think that's a big help. 1 year or 2 years ago, orthos were kind of scratching their heads thinking, \"I think I need to own a cone beam scanner, but I hadn't put much thought into intra oral scanners.\" They all had digital x-ray, cone beam CT, every other gadget you can imagine. Now you see orthos saying, \"I'm going to own at least one busy office.\" Now one of the drivers for that happens to be Invisalign, because we're very digitally enabled as a treatment and a customized treatment. I think over time, there -- you may see an evolution in brackets and wires with -- and other kinds of appliances that are enabled and improved by digital planning and everything else. So I think it's just going to accelerate that and as they see value, they'll do it. Now as to competition, again, everybody gets better when there's more players in it and while you -- you're not going to win every one, market adoption is a bigger force, I think, than competitive share battles. So I would rather have the tide coming in with everybody thinking, \"I've got to buy one.\" And then the opportunity to make the case that we have the best one, rather than the former. So I think while it does mean they're going to try a few different scanners and play with them -- we've actually had some people that bought a different scanner and sent it back saying, \"It doesn't do what I need, can you bring an iTero in?\" So again, we're doing very, very well and we're pleased with our progress. There's a lot of installed base sockets open and up for competition over the next few years out there. Shirley Stacy : Actually, operator, we've got one more question, please. Operator : Our final question will be coming from the line of Mr. Chris Lewis with Roth Capital Partners. Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Tom, at the analyst day, you talked quite a bit about the product evolution of Invisalign in terms of the efficacy and applicability. So I understand you're still in the early days of rolling out G5 deep bite, but can you give us any sense of when we can expect to hear more details around new product enhancements and potential new treatment indication announcements? Thomas M. Prescott: That's a great question. Amazingly, our customers are asking us the same thing. We just -- we try to have a discipline. We were out of our comfort zone. At the analyst day, we probably showed a little more than we were normally comfortable doing because it was very important for us to frame our strategic intent and you understood why we were confident that we could actually argue long term to think about standard of care. We'd rather not kind of sell futures either to our customers or to our owners and just would rather them know that we're working on all the major indications and our goal is to make Invisalign easier to use and more predictable than brackets and wires to get great results. So I think we showed things like extraction where there's an interest, but in terms of putting a timeframe on it and what and how we'll do it, I'd rather not do it. There are rich opportunities ahead for us either around an indication-specific solution or around a lot of other things we can do to make Invisalign more mainstream, and we're working on all those. Sorry. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. This concludes our call today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you, and have a wonderful afternoon.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. On the call today, I\u2019ll provide some highlights from our third quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments; Invisalign clear aligner, and scanner and services. I\u2019ll also provide some color on our customers as well as progress in our geographies around the world. David will then share more detail on our third quarter financials and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that I\u2019ll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to your questions. Q3 revenues have $189.9 million increase, 15.4% year-over-year driven by higher Invisalign volume across all customer channels and geographies with continued strong growth from our international doctors. Scanner and Services revenues of $11.7 million were up over 7.1% year-over-year. As a result of better than expected gross margin and management of operating expenses, EPS was $0.03 above the high end range of our outlook. Our Q3 results reflects continued execution of our strategic plan including our three key growth drivers which are; market expansion, product innovation, and brand strength. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on each of these before discussing our results further. First, market expansion, this strategic growth driver encompasses the many ways we are working to open up new geographies such as the additional countries in the EMEA region or that were recently added to our direct sales coverage area, expanding the adult treatment category for those consumers unwilling to seek orthodontic treatment with brackets and wires, and increasing our share of teenage market, the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide. Our months of June, July, and August are typically a seasonally strong period for Teenage Orthodontic Case Starts in 20.4% year-over-year growth of Invisalign teenage cases in Q2 marked a very good start to the summer. This continued into Q3 and resulted in a sequential increase of 17.4% for a total of 33.2000 [ph] teenagers starting treatment with Invisalign worldwide. On a year-over-year basis the total number of teenagers in Q3 starting treatment with Invisalign increased 14.8% reflecting slightly less effectiveness of our teen promotions set in the prior year. On a combined basis, teen volumes for Q2 and Q3 were up 17.3% year-over-year which may suggest there was an earlier start to the teen season than we previously experienced. Our second growth driver is product innovation, which aims to create greater doctor preference for Invisalign through a focus on innovation, by delivering new features and functionality that increases our doctor\u2019s confidence to treat patients with Invisalign more often and on more complex cases. Earlier this year, we launched Invisalign G5 for deep bite. We continue to receive positive feedback from our customers, specifically North American orthodontist on their overall awareness of Invisalign G5 and their intentions to increase their use of Invisalign for those types of cases. We expect this trend to increase overtime as we continue to reach out to train and support our customers, and are confident that Invisalign G5 will help drive further adoption of G5 cases. We also continue to receive positive feedback on ClinCheck Pro with 3D controls which was launched in North America in Q1. ClinCheck Pro provides the doctor with more precise control over the final tooth position helping them better achieve their treatment goals. ClinCheck Pro becomes even more valuable offering even greater utility for our doctors as we further broaden our clinical applicability by delivering new solutions for more complex cases like Invisalign G5. Our customers also find that ClinCheck Pro serves as an efficient means of communicating their treatment goals for final tooth position. Since launch we have seen strong adoption across North America and expect a similar response from our international doctors when ClinCheck Pro is launched outside the US in Q1 of next year. And finally brand strength, our third key growth driver. We continue to make progress in building and leveraging the strength of the Invisalign brand, to create consumer demand and drive purchase intent among consumers in more and more countries worldwide. This is most obvious here in North America, our largest market for consumer marketing, we\u2019ll start there. In Q3 we created more than 850 million consumer impressions through paid media reaching women, moms and teens across the country. Much of our Q3 traditional media, PR and social media activity focused on reaching teens and moms during the busy son, during the busy teen summer treatment season. Whenever possible, we encourage our customers and their patients to share their personal stories on how their Invisalign treatment helped transform their lives. As consumers we all benefit from real people sharing their experience, and this summer that included partnering with YouTube personality, Amanda Steel, to share her Invisalign treatment joining with other teens. Her initial Invisalign post have garnered more than 1.5 million video views and impressive Instagram following as she documents her experience with Invisalign. In addition, an extensive media tour with popular technology journalist, Jennifer Jolie, reached more than 100 million consumers through 36 media placements, including national placement in Jennifer\u2019s USA J column. Our transition to back to school messaging for moms helped them cope with their kids being back in the classroom included our first efforts on a new teen confident study we commissioned to examine the impact of braces on teen self-esteem and confidence. Key takeaways from the study revealed that teens with Invisalign treatment are more confident and teased less often than teens that are in metal braces; point is this really matters to teens and their parents and is one less thing for them to worry about. Switching to EMEA, our new, more localized consumers initiatives and continued integrated media activities created over 51 million impressions throughout key markets in Europe in Q3. These targeted social media advertising and media engagement activities have led over 100,000 people to search for Invisalign provider during Q3, and we have seen the European Invisalign social media community continue to grow. We now have a fan base of over 100,000 consumers with highest engagement scores we have seen this year. Introduction of our real patient campaigns continue to be effective and we have recently partnered with UK Olympian Cyclist, Laura Trott and Jason Kenny, to share their Invisalign journey. This partnership has resulted in over 60 million opportunities for consumers to see the Invisalign message across the UK. In combination these three key strategic growth drivers; market expansion, product innovation, and brand strength are proving overtime to support growth in our most important country markets or helping us open up new ones. Let\u2019s now touch on the progress we\u2019re making in these regions, starting with North America. Our Q3 North America Invisalign volume was up a little less than 1% sequentially and 6.6% year-over-year reflecting a softer market environment that we originally expected, especially for North America GPs. On a sequential basis Q3 reflects growth from North American orthodontists offset by an expected decline among North American GPs who typically have fewer days in office during the summer. On a year-over-year basis, both customer channels were up and growth was driven primarily by increased utilization of North American orthos, as well as by continued expansion of our GP customer base. Despite solid progress in North America in a number of areas, Invisalign growth based on some of the initiatives that were expected to accelerated option has not occurred the pace we expected. While we continue to build upon our strong base of GP customers, we are not making enough progress in growing GP utilization. We will continue to work on overcoming the challenges we see in keeping these practices which provide a wide range of dental services, fully engaged in treating modern orthodontic cases with Invisalign. We have a number of opportunities to improve our effectiveness with these extremely important customers and expect to make progress overtime. You may recall between our Analyst Day presentation commentary on the GP market, we discussed the emergence of corporate owned multi-office Dental Service Organizations or DSOs and their long term potential as partners. While we\u2019re still early in our engagement in many of these players, the training and program rollout for this initiative is now in progress. We are working to establish the systems and processes, the best training implement clinical and practice development programs in the DSO environment. In Q3 part of the significant year-over-year growth in new Invisalign doctors included the number of DSO clinicians we trained. It will take some time to help these organizations ramp their volume given the need to engage doctors and practices across a wide geographic and Invisalign experience range for the systematic approach. We see a tremendous potential to provide practice building impact to these groups and are deploying the resources to do so. Q3 was another strong quarter for our international business, especially in the Asia Pacific region. Total international Invisalign case volume for Q3 was essentially flat sequentially despite the typical slowdown in Europe follow up 27.8% year-over-year. In EMEA, Invisalign case volume increased 20% year-over-year. Our strong performance was driven by a combination of increased utilization by orthodontists in all countries made a continuous effort to add new Invisalign trained doctors. For the significant number of training and education events planned for delivery through November, we expect the trend to continue through the year end as doctors continue to increase their confidence in Invisalign treatment outcomes. In the APAC region Invisalign case volume increased 43.3% year-over-year and all country markets achieved record shipments. China continues to deliver above our high expectations doubling case volumes when compared to the same quarter last year, is now roughly equivalent size to our business in Japan. We also continue to see strong growth from Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Southeast Asia countries. This is driven by an expanding customer base coupled with higher utilization which reaffirms the value investing in the right coverage, as well as the importance of product evolution to treat higher complexity cases. Over 502 first-time submitters from the APAC region in the quarter, an all-time high as our training programs continue to evolve. Turning now to our scanner business, for Q3 our scanner and services business revenues were down 8.3% sequentially, consistent with our expectations for lower capital equipment sales in the summer, and yet were up 7.1% year-over-year. As part of our commitment to providing the greatest utility to our restorative dentist customers, in Q3 we expanded the workflow options for our iTero intra-oral scanner with DENTSPLY Implants Atlantis Custom Abutments and Atlantis Custom Abutments. iTero certified kind of activity for customer implant abutments help simplify the treatment process for clinicians by reducing number of required patient visits, saving valuable time for the practice, and ensuring an improved patient experience. Intra-oral scanning also helps improve the treatment workflow offering process efficiency for dental laboratory that practices working with. Our scanner business continues to have a positive impact on our Invisalign franchise helping to drive utilization, especially among our North American orthodontist customers. For Q3 the percentage of Invisalign cases submitted digitally from scanner North America rose to 34% compared to 32.7% in Q2 and 25.3% in Q3 a year ago. To take advantage of the increasing trend towards digital dentistry we will continue to do everything we can to grow our iTero installed base with a goal of creating additional leverage for the Invisalign business. This improves the working with other intra-oral scanning companies to enable interoperability for use with Invisalign treatment. This line of interoperability is good for our customers, their patients, and for extending the Invisalign franchise. And with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David for review of our Q3 financial results. David? David White : Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the details, I\u2019d like to note that unless stated otherwise, all of the financial information I will discuss will be presented on a GAAP basis. With that lets review our third quarter financial results. Revenue for the third quarter was $189.9 million, down 1.4% from the prior quarter, consistent with normal Q3 seasonality, and up 15.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Third quarter clear aligner revenue of $178.1 million was down 0.9% sequentially, and up 16.0% year-over-year. Q3 ASPs were down sequentially $11, primarily due to foreign exchange losses related to the weakening euro which primarily impacts in September. I\u2019ll make further comments about the impact of currency later. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels as well as favorable ASPs from higher mix of Invisalign full products and a higher mix of international business. For the third quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 119.6000 cases were flat sequentially reflecting increases from North America ortho case volume and Asia Pacific growth offset by expected seasonal decreases from North America GPs and EMEA. Year-over-year growth of 11.9% reflects continued strong international growth, increased utilization from international doctors, and North American orthos, as well as expansion of our customer base. For North American orthodontists Q3 Invisalign case volume increased 5.6% sequentially and 10.6% year-over-year. For North American GP Dentists case volume decreased 4.6% sequentially and increased 2.3% year-over-year. For international doctors Invisalign case volume decreased 0.7% sequentially and increased 27.8% year-over-year. In Q3, we added 1125 new North American doctors and 1400 new international doctors, a year-over-year increase of roughly 42% and 60% respectively. In Q3 Asia Pacific trained total of 745 new doctors, the most ever in a single quarter, with 50% coming from China. In total for Q3, we added 2525 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, a year-over-year increase of 51%. While the number of doctors trained was relatively flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we normally experience less training events in the summer quarter. In Q3 total Invisalign utilization of 4.4 cases per doctor increased slightly from 4.3 in Q3 2013. North American ortho utilization of 8.8 was a record, an increase from 8.4 in the prior quarter. North America GP utilization of 2.8 decreased slightly from 2.9 in the prior year, and international doctor utilization of 4.3 increased from 4.1 in Q3 2013. Third quarter revenue for our scanner and services segment was $11.7 million, an 8.3% sequential decrease as expected due to lower capital equipment purchasing during the summer months. On a year-over-year basis, our scanner and services revenue increased 7.1%, reflecting increased ortho care services offset by slight decrease in scanner volume. Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 76.4%, up sequentially 0.8 points and up 0.4 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 79.2%, up 0.4 point sequentially and down 0.7 points year-over-year. This sequential increase was primarily the result of fewer training events in Q3 and lower freight expense. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of the benefit recorded in the prior year relating to the change we made in our mid-course correction policy in June 2013, this was partially offset by higher ASPs in the current quarter. Q3 gross margin for our scanner segment was 33.5%, up 4.0 point sequentially, and up 11.3 points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily the result of favorable product and service cost. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of more favorable product cost and the prior year\u2019s results being unfavorably impacted by the sale of older and of light products. Q3 operating expenses were $93.5 million. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $3.2 million, due primarily to lower sales and marketing spend. Also recall that operating expenses in the prior quarter, Q2 2014, benefited from a $1.2 million refund of medical device excise taxes that we paid earlier this year in Q1. On a year-over-year basis Q3 operating expenses were up $9.9 million, incidental for the growth of the business which primarily relates to continued market expansion and new and existing markets and geographies. Our third quarter operating margin was 27.1%, up 1.8 points sequentially, and 1.9 points year-over-year. Our quarter-over-quarter improvement was primarily driven by higher Invisalign gross margin and lower operating expenses as just described. Other income and expense for the quarter included a charge of approximately $2.1 million associated with foreign exchange losses which primarily relate to the decline of the euro to the US dollar. Including this impact, and the euros impact on revenue, net of operating expenses and taxes that amounted to approximately $0.02 per share. With regards to our third quarter tax provision our tax rate was 22.8%. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.47 compared to $0.43 reported in Q2 and $0.42 reported in the same quarter last year. Moving onto the balance sheet. For the third quarter our accounts receivable balance was $130.0 million, down approximately 0.7% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 62 days, up one day sequentially and up two days over the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $7 million, primarily relating to manufacturing capacity additions. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $67.6 million, and free cash flow for the third quarter defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditure amounted to $60.6 million. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long term investments were $561.5 million, this compares to $472 million at the end of 2013, an increase of $89.5 million. During Q3 2014, the company repurchased 500,000 shares of stock including 364,000 shares relating to the completion of the company\u2019s previously announced $70 million accelerated stock repurchase and 136,000 shares amounting to $7.4 million in open market repurchases. Repurchases are part of Align\u2019s three-year $300 million stock repurchase program announced on April 23, 2014 with $100 million of that amount authorized to be purchased through April 2015. Year-to-date, the company repurchased 1.5 million shares for $77.4 million. The company anticipates repurchasing the remaining $22.6 million of the first $100 million of the authorization over the next six months. Let\u2019s now turn to our business outlook for the fourth quarter and the factors that inform our view. Fourth quarter is typically a seasonally slower period for North America orthos as fewer teenagers start orthodontic treatment after the school year started. This was typically offset by North American GPs as they recover from a slower summer season to the vacations. In aggregate we expect Invisalign volume for North America to be up sequentially in Q4. Our Q4 \u2013 our fourth quarter has historically been a stronger quarter for our international doctors as they rebound from a seasonally slower summer. We expect Invisalign volume for international to be up sequentially in Q4. Our scanner business performed very well this past quarter despite it being a seasonally slower period and similarly, we expect our scanner volumes to be up sequentially on a stronger Q4. With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows; Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 125.1000 to 127.6000 cases, an increase of 4.6% to 6.7% from Q3. We expect net revenues to be in the range of $194.9 million to $199.1 million, an increase of 2.6% to 4.9% from Q3 reflecting lower ASPs primarily as a result of a weaker euro. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 74.2% to 74.6%, down sequentially from Q3 primarily reflecting slightly lower ASPs as just mentioned. Increased rate cost for higher international mix and increased training expense for Q4 which is seasonally a stronger training quarter. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $94.7 to $95.5 million. This is higher when compared to Q3 reflecting continued investment in our strategic growth drivers. These increased investments are partially offset by the translation of our international SG&A expenses at weaker exchange rates. Our operating margin should be in the range of 25.6% to 26.6%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 23%. And diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $81.9 million, net of anticipated stock repurchases. Taken together, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.50. With that I\u2019ll now turn the time back over to Tom for closing comments. Tom Prescott : Thanks, David. We are pleased to have delivered another good quarter with progress across the business paced by the strong growth in our EMEA and APAC regions. North America delivered a solid result in a softer market and yet we know we can do better. Despite of challenging global environment we are confident we can continue to deliver growth rates at multiples above market growth in every geography we serve. Our confidence is based on continued strong execution of product innovation combined with continued investments in the right sales coverage and go to market initiatives each of which become far more effective when we add in high impact that\u2019s why our marketing campaign. The Align team is excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We look forward to a very busy fourth quarter with important trade shows, major customer events like our North America orthodontic summit and a full calendar of new customer training events. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor conferences and to sharing our continued progress when we discussed our UN results in late January. That\u2019s it for now, and we can move to take your question. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed. Jon Block \u2013 Stifel: Great, thanks. Excuse me guys, good afternoon. I think the first one, David just for you, maybe a two point question. One, if you can comment at all on trends throughout the quarter, maybe what you saw. And then to the guide, can we have some more detail there. It just seems to be like a big sequential step up, you called out North America being up 4Q versus 3Q, but when I look back in 2012 you were down 3% sequentially, 3Q to 4Q last year you were flat in North America sequentially, and you\u2019re still positioning this is a tough environment here with a slower return on some of your investments. So what gives you the confidence North American cases will be up 3Q to 4Q? Thanks, guys. David White : Okay Jon, back to the first question on trends on Q3. I don\u2019t know if there is anything peculiar in terms of trends versus any other Q3 we\u2019ve experienced. I think one \u2013 perhaps one anomaly that Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks had to do with our team season potentially being a little bit earlier in the year than what we saw last year since we got a very good uplift in the second quarter but the uplift in the third quarter is a little bit soft than what we have anticipated. But other than that I think the case \u2013 our business is fairly linear to the quarter, and in summer months typically we see a soft August, particularly in the international area, particularly EMEA as people are taking vacations and closing their offices and so forth. And then we hold our breadth for a little bit, you might say for September waiting for things to kind of pick back up as people wake up from vacation to get back engage. But other than those trends there I\u2019d say fairly consistent with third quarter at least a year ago and other quarters that we\u2019ve seen. As it relates to Q4 North America, couple of things; if we look at our three-year average, sequential average it\u2019s typically been up \u2013 just a little bit under 1% quarter-over-quarter. And as we look at North America and our guidance, I\u2019m sorry, it has typically been up around \u2013 roughly flat quarter-over-quarter from Q3 to Q4 and our guide is up, I think want to say about 5% or so. One of the things that influences that is, we\u2019ve \u2013 Tom talking about DSOs and so as we engage with more of those selling organizations and so forth, we expect to see uplift as those doctors are trained and as they become engaged with the Invisalign product, so that\u2019s part of the uplift works that can be seen in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re continuing also with some of the promotions we ran in Q3, expecting them to receive some protraction in Q4. And we\u2019ll also see some more immediate spend in Q4 as well. So those things tend to give us a little bit more of a seasonal uptick in Q4 from Q3. Jon Block \u2013 Stifel: Okay. Tom Prescott : Jon, if I pile on for just a second? Jon Block \u2013 Stifel: Absolutely. Tom Prescott : I mean, the couple of year\u2019s you called out were really non-linear for us and the reason why we were sequentially down going into \u2013 in twelve, especially and there were couple of other ones because volume disappears late in the quarter and we went into the quarter with a little less flow of business. So when David speaks to some reasonable linearity, not as strong as we like in North America, that\u2019s actually a good thing. And we\u2019ve been \u2013 linearity means it\u2019s building so that we\u2019ve got solid progress going in the quarter which means for the first months of that quarter, the pipes reasonably fall. With all that said, the second thing is we continue to build in Asia and is that becoming more meaningful in total volume, that has a bigger contribution totally. And all this time so far in Europe that they continue their trajectory, our doctors are back to work and building and despite more challenging economy in the new G here there solid. So I think when you put all of building blocks together with the same methodology we always use, reasonably confident that we can go deliver that guidance. Jon Block \u2013 Stifel: Okay, that was very helpful. And Tom just as a follow up, maybe at a high level, you can just speak to return on investment in sales reps, I guess where I\u2019m going with this is, the North America GP market is just proven to be challenging and you guys have thrown more bodies at it over the past 18 to 24 months. Of course four five years ago I got to bring up the pay worthy proficiency program, where I\u2019m going with this is, is there an opportunity to redeploy investments elsewhere, you\u2019re doing so well in teen, international is crushing it. You sort to say, you know what, GPs will get some growth there as we add and train new docs but let\u2019s throw bodies and investments elsewhere that seems more ripe for accelerating growth. Thanks guys. Tom Prescott : Sounds like you\u2019ve been sitting in some of our meetings as we do resource allocation, hard choices. Let me start with your very last point around DSOs, that is the place we\u2019ve deploy more resources in terms of program and approach and training, and we are getting some early traction there. It takes time since they have anywhere from dozens to hundreds of offices scattered across the country in some cases, and as we activate we want them to have high quality capability when that patient comes in even if this is a new line of practice for them. So these are all very different the way they work but we are deploying a way to do that. So that\u2019s one example of deploying additional resources there. Secondly we are deploying more resources and our really fast growing geographies like China, we don\u2019t have an annual resources allocation discussion with an annual plan, we look at that every quarter literally, and if they can keep delivering on their plan we give them more resources against a game plan. So that\u2019s going on as a consistent theme. To some extent the same is true in EMEA with that more frequent relook at resource allocation; they earn the right to get more headcount, a little more for consumer, and in some cases acceleration of a key product initiative. When you come back to North America, we actually are making progress in GP utilization; it\u2019s just that it\u2019s hard to see against the 20,000 or more GPs that we do business with at some level of frequency. And if I go back to late last year when we rolled out in pilot our new fundamentals training course, we had hopes that would help and in fact, in general these are smaller attended groups, more intensely supported by coordinated marketing and sales, and we can look back and see in virtually every case the doctors, the GPs that go to those classes start their cases, their first case is much sooner and they adopt more quickly, kind of the angle of attack is better. So that\u2019s really where we already have redirected some of the selling time and effort, away from the mass towards those GP practices that want to make it some more of a priority, and that\u2019s one reason why the tail is on utilization down. But again, I\u2019ll step back that \u2013 the strategic importance of the GP market is high for us, we do know that it\u2019s going to take a while and it\u2019s going to take all three of our leverage to do it but your point is well taken, our job is to thread the needle between all the investment choices we\u2019ve got and managing the combination of short or tactical investments to drive the business in the very near term against things that are very, very important to our owners for the long term, and that\u2019s the line we\u2019re trying to walk. Jon Block \u2013 Stifel: Sure. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great, thanks for the questions. Just looking out of the 4Q and the guidance, the cases certainly there seem stronger than what we\u2019re looking for. I know you guys just commented on that but I guess I would say at those levels I think we would have been looking for sales range to be a touch higher than what the guidance is. I was wondering if you guys should maybe just spend a little bit of time talking about your expectations for ASP growth from both a product level, and then also from a geographic standpoint just given some of the trends we saw in the quarter. Tom Prescott : Bob, I\u2019ll start it with few broad strokes and then I\u2019ll let David fill in behind that with some of the facts that we laid out in the framework for guidance. First would be we expect a little bit of mix shift, we\u2019ve already got a little bit of FX headwind, I\u2019m not going to speak to it, everything is captured in guidance. So that believes a little bit right off the top but we expect a little more mix shift as the team is going a little more aggressively after i7 and i14 in EMEA and Express 5 and Express 10 in North America, and part of that is promotions, part of that is little bit of increasing interest from our GPs and some orthos. So whether we never quite get that right it has been pretty stable, if that stays where it is the mix will be a little higher and we\u2019ll have little more revenue lift out of that but as we see it today going in, our internal outlook which informs us says there is a little mix shift and there is some promos with that. Other than that those are the two big factors and I\u2019ll let David build on that just a little. David White : Yes, just to add to the foreign exchange piece of it. Most of our international business in EMEA is built in euro, and if you\u2019ve tracked currency trends, I\u2019m sure you have, we\u2019ve seen some big moves in that just in the last couple of months but principally beginning in the early September and that\u2019s really influenced our third quarter in amounts that we\u2019ve not seen historically or in the company for a long time at least. And so as we look about that going forward certainly that does have some impact on ASPs going forward when you translate those back into dollars and that has put a little bit of you might say headwind into the revenue guide for Q4 but it is included in the guidance, I\u2019ll make that clear. But one point I think to make a note of is the fact that when you look at the countries that we\u2019re selling internationally, most of those revenues are denominated in local currency and we incur our selling, marketing and to some extent some G&A expense locally in those markets as well. So while it puts a little bit of headroom you might say or headwind into the top line, we have somewhat of a natural hedge to some extent given that the expenses will translate back at a lower amount as well, and then when you net that of a tax it mitigates a little further. So if you look at our Q4 guidance so forth, about $0.01 a share roughly is the impact of currency relative to where it was earlier in Q3. Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs : That\u2019s helpful and that might actually partially answer my follow up question which was if I look at SG&A it was actually little lighter than what we were looking for and yet you seem to be rolling out a lot of new initiatives to reach the consumer. I guess I was wondering kind of outside of FX, is there any level of efficiency that you guys are realizing and getting the word out or should we be thinking about investment in sales and marketing, kind of reaccelerate it back to more normal levels from this point forward? Tom Prescott : We\u2019re always looking at new investments and we\u2019re constantly evaluating new opportunities to invest in the business whether it\u2019s on the product side or whether it\u2019s on the sales or marketing side. So I don\u2019t think there is anything new there. Clearly, one of our objectives is to \u2013 as we penetrate further and further into the market one of our objective is obviously is to get with better adoption to get better field efficiency you might say with the people we have out in the field that are in that selling position. But if you look at the Q3 expenses as you looked at \u2013 some of that is just some seasonality, lower media spend in Q3 is very typical for us and the fact that payroll tax is being enrolling off for some of the employees here in the US, and so those are some of the contributing factors why Q3 was little bit lower. David White : Bob, before we may finish beating this one to death, there are a couple of examples, explicitly on marketing spend that we do get efficiency out of, and I\u2019ll give you a small example but it\u2019s big dollars. We can lock in especially when the markets will softer for media, we can lock in traditional media out multiple quarters, sometimes it\u2019s far as a year to get placement rates in the programs that fit with our brand, and we can get literally millions of dollars of improvement or leverage out of those working media dollars. And then in addition one of the things that comes with a little bit of math now that in this line it\u2019s becoming a well-known brand at least in North America and we\u2019re taking first steps in Europe is that we call paid media, traditional media, unpaid media is people doing their own videos on YouTube and talking about on their blogging how it changed their lives. So we get that, that all goes into the impact in search and impressions that people form in total and in many cases that has greater weight than paid media, so we tend to tune off ads and listen more carefully to what I'll call honest conversation. And that is the place that efficiency shows up for us and we see some of that in North America for sure, starting to see a little bit on the digital side in Europe, again, we\u2019re still earlier days there but that\u2019s very specific example of some leverage. Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs : That\u2019s helpful, thanks so much. Tom Prescott : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse : Yes, thanks. Tom, I just want to follow up on this North American GP issue just one more time. I mean it\u2019s clear this seems to be sort of the onetime the ointment for you guys in terms of achieving higher growth and I\u2019m just kind of want to get your perspective, I mean do you feel at all concerned that maybe the North American GP market is becoming maybe a little bit saturated with your product? Do you feel like you\u2019re choking on large numbers in this market or you just really feel that the company hasn\u2019t really executed that well in this customer class and you just \u2013 you don\u2019t need to do a better job? Tom Prescott : I\u2019ll start with that last part and say yes, we can do \u2013 I think we\u2019ve executed well, there aren\u2019t that many companies that have built a great standalone business with the North American GP given the enormous amount of fragmentation. But I\u2019ll go to your fetch, so I\u2019m saying yes, we can do better, we have lots of ideas how to do that, we\u2019ve got experiments going on all over the place to make that happen. The saturation point, it\u2019s actually the opposite, we are so far from saturation, in fact even our \u2013 even routine customers do Invisalign almost as a hobby in GP, even our biggest customers on the GP side have multiple practices and Invisalign is still a very small fraction of the 3000 to 5000 to 7000 procedures they do a year even if there are multispecialty office. And so our job is becoming more relevant and meaningful and making Invisalign which is orthodontics which isn\u2019t as typical a part of a GP practice worked towards mainstream. We know what success looks like Glen, I mean you\u2019ve been an observer here, not just us but others for a long time and we know how to replicate that success, we have to do it office-by-office across the country and I think we know how to do that, it just takes time. I\u2019ll point back to a comment I made earlier, we\u2019ve completely overhauled our clinical education frontend and it\u2019s working much better, that\u2019s the foundation. We wind up with the rep meeting the doctor literally within a week or when they were in class where they meet them, and they were out there working together to get the staff and everybody else onboard, in many cases they bring the staff with them to training. So the goal is to get the whole team organized and involved versus the doctor coming back from a weekend program on their own and it\u2019s working better. Second color maybe for the long term is building our core prices to be with DSOs that are growing fairly rapidly, very business focused and increasingly upscale and where we can bring the same brand leverage for individual practice, we can leverage that much more broadly on a regional basis with a partner, a significant partner who understands compliance with programs. So there are a whole lot of things we\u2019re working on, it will take time to move the needle to where you will see an utilization number but we do know what success looks like. I\u2019ll go back, we can do better. Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse : Tom, just maybe one more point that I want to make. Obviously everyone is focused on the uptake in the case volume in Q4 guidance and I think in your remarks you sort of said that Europe has continued its trajectory so far here in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. Is there any comment to make in North America that regard? Have you seen an uptake post this summer long in the North American GP market? Tom Prescott : Yes, I think as David said it\u2019s for the framework for thinking about guidance was \u2013 was that these are GPs returning, in fact orthos maybe two minute down a little bit, start treating more adults after the summer rush for teens. GPs offices get busy again after Labor Day and that\u2019s in our thinking, we expect GPs offices to pick up, we expect EMEA to get busy, they came screaming back in September and that push is on until the end of the year, and again, APAC is still running like the dickens. So all those factors go together and are reflected in the guidance that David spoke. Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse : And maybe just one\u2026 Tom Prescott : I was just going to say APAC, APAC just kind of pile on a guess, we saw a very strong September in APAC which is very encouraging for us as we think about Q4. Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, maybe if I just ask my last question on the margin side. Shirley Stacy : This is your last one Glen. Tom Prescott : This is number two. Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse : I\u2019ll jump off; I\u2019ll give others a chance. Shirley Stacy : No, no, no. It\u2019s okay, go ahead. Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse : I just going to ask on the margin side, I mean basically this is the second best operating margin we\u2019ve seen in the company\u2019s history, at least as long as my history with it, obviously you\u2019ve got a benefit on your gross margin line and you control the expenses, I mean should we think about maybe pushing higher into that 25% to 30% operating profit range, I mean do you think you can finally push into the higher end of that range given the groundwork you\u2019ve laid this quarter? David White : Let\u2019s not getting into a discussion between the CEO and CFO here so I will take that one. Look, what we\u2019ve said consistently as we\u2019ve got a long term model out there, we\u2019re trying to thread the needle quarter-to-quarter through that. We want you to think about a whole year of performance and we have a lot of investments, we always dropped against the wall to make and where we\u2019re confident we can continue to generate leverage in the business we\u2019ll make more but we\u2019re not ready yet to think about the long term financial model, I\u2019d like to put that aside for the moment. Tom Prescott : Yes, I\u2019ll just add to that. I think we\u2019ve said consistently that as it relates to our long term model our objective has been and continues to be to deliver a full year within that model, we\u2019re yet to do that, we hope we\u2019re on track to do that this year but at the end of the year we can talk more about what that model looks like if we change it or otherwise. Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thank you. Tom Prescott : Thanks, Glen. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Glen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Thank you, good evening guys. David I wanted to start with you on ASPs, I want to go to backup point there. It looks your ASPs have been running up, about 4% or 5% on average over the last four quarters or so. If I back into your ASP guidance for fourth quarter it looks to me down a point or two year-over-year and maybe that\u2019s a little aggressive but that\u2019s where my math has taken me. Is that all currency because if I do the math on that, that\u2019s about an $8 million swing and in the past your currency swings when they\u2019ve been bad, has been maybe a $1 million or $2 million, so this seem like it\u2019s bigger than that. So I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s all currency in that swing or if there is something else in there that might be swing in the ASPs even more than currency. David White : Currency is probably the largest component of it. Mix as we talked about a few minutes ago is also a component of it because we\u2019re expecting to see some traction on the express side of our business in the fourth quarter with some promotions we\u2019re running, particularly internationally, so those two are the biggest contributing factors to it. Long term however I guess I would still emphasize the point that we believe that our ASPs long term are going to continue to grow as our international business treats more complex cases and is growing at a rate faster than North America, and in particularly APAC where they treat the most complex cases. So while we might see some \u2013 little bit of volatility in ASP from quarter-over-quarter basis and that reflect in our Q4 guidance, I think long term we still accept \u2013 it would expect the ASPs to be stable to modestly up. Tom Prescott : Jeff, if I just pile on for a moment. We would look at a mix shift ASP because the mix shift would be a positive effect because it\u2019s something we\u2019re actually trying to engineer, even though in our fall through in terms of operating margin is as good as or better than a full case. So for us that\u2019s a good thing, it\u2019s a case we might not have participated in in a growing area. And then secondly, I think as David said, if you think about our business in Europe specifically, almost all of our volume shifts in September and that\u2019s exactly when the big \u2013 it was the biggest step we\u2019ve ever seen in the percentage basis in the company, and because of virtually all of our shipments \u2013 because our doctors ask us to hold their cases until they are back from holiday, shift in September, it all got \u2013 it was all based on revenue based on a completely different euro and literally I think September 2nd or something it took a dive. So I think that\u2019s the rational for via change FX will give and take but I think on the mix side we\u2019re actually trying to do this, we want to separate those two factors. Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Alright, that\u2019s helpful. An interesting September point there let me just \u2013 I guess my follow up Tom, on the i7, i14 and the mix shift there I understand kind of trying to engineer some volumes you might not have had in the past. But I know it\u2019s been two or three quarters in a row here when you and I have had conversations where \u2013 when the mix has been going the other way to the fall and some of the team cases in that, especially in the international markets, your explanation to me has been that docs really don\u2019t see in advantage from a price standpoint, they just assume to pay a little bit more to get all the flexibility of 30 Aligners instead of 7 or 14 or something and you\u2019ve made it sound like docs just don\u2019t even see a reason to use i7, i14, does the forward in teen are a much better product for lot of the guys in the international markets and now it seems like that argument is kind of shifting here and I\u2019m just trying to understand why you would promote the i7, i14 if you\u2019ve been seeing this kind of shift towards the fall in the higher revenue cases? Tom Prescott : The short answer is we will continue to see in very unpenetrated markets around the world, a bias towards comprehensive treatment because the bulk of adults never got treatment as kids. Because we\u2019re making progress, because the brand is getting out there and because there were children that were treated as kids by the National Health System in the UK, by the German Health Program in Germany etcetera, and never had retainers and relapsed, they are starting to see some cases with people that just want \u2013 they basically have a good bite and a solid occlusion but they are wanting to be strained up in front and so they are open minded about doing something for themselves, this is actually a wonderful thing because it means the idea of oral health and a better smile is slowly starting to catch on in Europe and it has not been at the top of their list ever. So it\u2019s really \u2013 I think a good positive dynamic of market growth and this is feedback from some of our customers, and we\u2019re trying to be responsive of that and give them incentives to try the product more. Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird: That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Tom Prescott : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies: Good afternoon. Tom Prescott : Hey, Brandon. Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies: David just on the 4Q gross margin guidance, can you quantify those moving parts between ASPs, freight, and training cost and in terms of magnitude of effect because this will be the lowest gross margin I think in quite some time, if you could just give us some color there it would be helpful. David White : Well some of that is \u2013 there is probably three pieces to it; ASP which we\u2019ve talked about, freight and higher training, and as you listen to calls in the past right because we\u2019ve talked about training. Training ebbs and flows with some amount of seasonality in it, it\u2019s relatively a breakeven proposition for us financially and so as training increases in one particular quarter it\u2019s going to tend to be a drag on margins, it won\u2019t be a drag on dollars but it winds up being a little bit of a drag on percent. The other piece to it is, our scanner business, we\u2019re anticipating that to be a little bit down from a gross margin standpoint. So probably those three things together, I don\u2019t have a waiting here to give you between them if I was to put them in order, a rank order, high ASP is the first item and primarily as a result of FX. And then training and freight and this kind of business. Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies: Tom, one for you. As we look at the North American business, I know you don\u2019t usually talk about it this way but in terms of the growth rates we\u2019ve seen and case volumes over the last couple of quarters, can you speak to the trend between teen and non-teen markets and if you\u2019ve seen I guess in the deceleration in the non-teen segment over the past in terms of the trajectory in recent periods. Tom Prescott : Let me answer this way, the numbers show a deceleration in volumes or in rate of growth, we\u2019re growing steadily but the rate of growth it\u2019s slowing over a number of quarters, this is mostly the case in GP space. And I think going back to an earlier question, we have not generated leverage there yet, it\u2019s something that\u2019s highly, highly important to us and we\u2019re working hard on it. If I strip all those parts away, there is still this huge laid demand in North America, 20 million to 25 million adults that want a better smile, that do not want brackets and wires, that know that the treatment cost is about $5000 and what they need is to become more important on their list of 20 or 30 things they would like to do. And we know because we talk to thousands of consumers. So I think our job is, when they are ready to make sure they go after Invisalign and then when they are after Invisalign they get to a practice that says we\u2019re thrilled to put you into Invisalign. All those things don\u2019t happen perfectly each time but we\u2019re working on fixing that. So we have lots of opportunity, we can do a better and better job of creating demand, of activating that at a doctor\u2019s office and make use of the doctor\u2019s office is ready to rock. It just takes some time, I would saw finally we don\u2019t pat ourselves in the back but one of the things I said purposely is we expect to grow multiples above market growth and competitive growth in every market we serve and we still do that even though we\u2019re a little frustrated with our pace in North America right now. So I think our view is it was a softer orthodontic market and a softer dental procedures market during the quarter and we take no comfort there because our expectations were higher. But now we see all the opportunity, it drives us crazy sometimes but it\u2019s there to be had. Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies: Thank you. Tom Prescott : Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And next question comes from Jeffrey Matthews with Ram Partners. Please proceed. Jeffrey Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners : Thank you, can you hear me? Tom Prescott : Yes Jeff, we can. Good afternoon. Jeffrey Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners : Hi, good afternoon. Two things. One is, the progress you're making with DSOs seems more significant at this point than I would've expected. And I wonder if there is something about what you offer that is attractive to that organization, as opposed to an individual GP? Is it an easier sell for you for some reason? And then my second question is about China. I'm sort of gob smacked by the growth there. And I wonder really what your outlook is for the next couple of years in China, and why you seem to be kind of hitting this inflection point? Tom Prescott : Let me start with the second, wouldn\u2019t want you to be hanging there gob smacked. If you\u2019re observer, you\u2019ve spent real time over there and I think you told me at one point when you were in Shanghai you saw Invisalign signs or something. The receptivity \u2013 I think we\u2019ve got the formulae right, we tried a multiple different ways in countries in Europe and in Asia, and when we went into China we decided that it was more important to build the right foundation than it was to go for volume, and part of that was based on launching with G4 several years ago in May and we waited till G4 was available because it was our first real opportunity to really treat the most complex cases. And then we brought in SmartTrack, shortly behind that one we got approval in China. So I think the second thing we did was we worked three or four year\u2019s building relationships with universities and clinical leaders and try to do it in a very Chinese way as they would describe it, and we were very patient about starting to train doctors, it was only until we felt we had clinical supporters that it treated and finished cases there that can teach to other Chinese doctors with those Chinese cases and demonstrated great results where we really ready to step on the gas which we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years. So we\u2019re pleased, we think long term, I won\u2019t put guidance kind of language around this, and I think we talked about this a little bit, Raphael Pascaud, our VP of International spoke about it in our Analyst Day. We think China is probably the one country in the world that offers that kind of rough sized opportunity of the US and so we\u2019re approaching it with that kind of potential. I wouldn\u2019t want to put a finer point on it for the next few years but it\u2019s one of our biggest investment opportunities and we continue to work hard to scale it. I\u2019ll stop in there and give it over to DSOs if I can. Jeffrey Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners : Thanks. Tom Prescott : Sure. I don\u2019t want to let you think that the business results are screaming with DSOs yet, I\u2019m reflecting on it because; A, it showed up significantly in training new doctors, and we\u2019ve been on this for about a year and a half, two years working on this. And I think we\u2019ve got the formula down pretty well even though the different DSOs have different approaches. We\u2019re attractive to them and they are attractive to us, they bring regional breadth, cross country breadth in some cases, they bring very operational mindset where they are used to driving for efficiency in cost yet still delivering great results clinically for patients. They are used to developing their own brand and series of treatment centers, and so we come in and they work hard to develop demand for each of their offices and each of their areas. We come out and alongside that we\u2019re one of the best practice building opportunities in dentistry today with the Invisalign brand. And so what they can bring is a mindset with clinical leadership and a compliance mentality that this is one of the three things we\u2019re going to focus on this year and everybody is going to get trained, we\u2019re all going to do it, we\u2019re going to measure it, and the company is going to line up behind us to help us. And I would say we\u2019re in the early days there but we think this is a more focused approach to move the GP market. We\u2019re not at all giving up on office-by-office, we have great customers out there doing incredible things, it\u2019s just that 90 plus percent of all dental procedures in North America happen in individual provider offices and fragmentations, the operative term. So we have to do it from both directions and make sure our value proposition, our coverage, our product and our support model fit every side. But DSO early days it will turn into business results in the coming years. Jeffrey Matthews \u2013 Ram Partners : Got it, thanks very much. Tom Prescott : Sure, take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Shirley Stacy : Steve, how are you? Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Very well, thank you. Just trying to turn attention on the GP channel, I wonder if Tom you could look at it from a different angle, maybe reflect back on your experience, one year into the realign initiative and I wonder if you have any updated views on how it may or may not make sense to push the gas pedal a little bit on the distribution channel in that way. And then my second question which is also actually about distribution, it relates to Europe. That business is growing quite nicely, I wondered if you could give us a sense for how much in your runway you think you have there? And more specifically, how your view on execution and the growth opportunity in Europe is changing, now that you have a more direct line of sight into how that channel is evolving. Thanks so much. Tom Prescott : Let\u2019s see the first one here, realign is still not meaningful, we are learning a lot and as we think about our long term evolution of our business model and customers, many GP customers that want to respond to a patients request but maybe don\u2019t want to do a weekend course, don\u2019t want to go deep, there is something there to be had and I\u2019d say the Shine organization and our team are both working on how to make that scale. And I would say good success in a handful of regions but it is not been replicated across the Shine team or across our team. I think the second piece goes back to something I\u2019d said in my prepared comments which is about \u2013 we\u2019re still not relevant enough to the average GP, I guess there is an earlier question. We\u2019re still not relevant enough to get them to link towards orthodontics, well it\u2019s not something to do routinely, in fact they\u2019ve got very little of it in most of their dental programs and they spent much more time on drilling fill and anesthetic and cosmetic and veneers and all that. So that\u2019s what they normally do at where most of their business is, preventive and restorative. So where we come along, we try to get them do something different. I think when this really comes visible which realign where it\u2019s hard to assess what you can treat in five stages with a realign case and don\u2019t even have the benefit of scaling it up to an Express 10 if you\u2019re a direct customer or a full case, automatically when our systems in stuff.  And so I think a couple of things will happen to changes overtime Steve; one is that as scanners become ubiquitous and share side applications that provide utility and value, we with iTero and other high quality scanner manufacturers are going to be helping to reduce friction, support clinical decision making, ride at share side and they will be able to look at patients dentition and it won\u2019t just be malocclusion but it will be other things, there could be other problems they are having, whether it\u2019s brushes them grinding or whether they are trying to surely sign the paradontal decay and decline. There will be tool surrounding that dentist the clinical practice that will help them look to a solution, and at that point in time there will be a whole series of products we believe digitally informed, like realigned or into a direct \u2013 through distribution or to a direct customer of ours that can use a range of things. So in our minds this is a very early step, it\u2019s great learning, we\u2019re learning a lot from the Shine team, they are learning from us, we can do a lot more but I\u2019d say it will be easier when we get scanners in there. And I think that\u2019s coming. I\u2019m going to flip the second thing mindful at time here and you talked about growth rates are seeing in EMEA be persistent and we believe so.  The degree of penetration of orthodontic treatment is an order of magnitude lower than in North America which is already under penetrated against the insertion and widespread nature of malocclusion here and it tends to be more acute, in other words, the malocclusion is worse, and people lose teeth more frequently because of that malocclusion as they age. So with all that they have a great opportunity, adults are more conscious of it now, they are more conscious, you have some countries in Europe that are very fashion conscious, so there is a reason why they care about their esthetic, feel and look, and you look at countries like Spain and Italy that on paper look like economic basket cases and our businesses are very, very strong there and that\u2019s being driven by adults that want to look and feel better, and in many cases adults that are 50, 60, 70.  So we look at this as we\u2019ve now earned the opportunity to build a bigger business, we\u2019re in the process of doing that. The more we can feed that with the evolving clinical products, scanners that surround the orthodontist, make it easier, reduce friction all around that process; it just gets better and better. And I think the biggest test I\u2019d show you is in Asia where they treat the hardest case in the world right now and we\u2019re growing like crazy because we finally have as a critical math and more coming around that clinical product experience where the doctor can deliver that great results with confidence. So two very different extremes here, the examples you just asked but hopefully that answers your question. Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley : No, it\u2019s perfect. Thanks so much Tom. Tom Prescott : Thanks, Steve. Shirley Stacy : Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question please. Operator : Sure. Our next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed. John Kreger \u2013 William Blair : Great, thanks. Not until time, I\u2019ll just ask maybe two quick ones. Tom you just mentioned a minute ago that key is getting more scanners out there, any progress you can give us on your efforts to get more interoperability with other scanner operators? That would be helpful. And then the second, you talked a fair amount about DSOs on the call, as that ramps do you think that will have any impact on your ASP or on your margins? Thanks. Tom Prescott : I will take that one first. As we look at programs we look at contribution margin more than we look at ASP and as long as we hear that contribution margins that will drop through to operating margins based on the entire support model, we are comfortable with different price points and a good example of that is our elite or super elite customers that we support with different resources and try to teach them how to use the product we work with them and business planning for what their years are going to look like, and with the company resources look at helping them do great local campaigns to get word of mouth and all that. So while we trade higher discount or lower ASP with those elite customers we also don\u2019t put all the resources in the training and support that we do for a low volume customer that ultimately pays list. And the same can be said for DSO, they have clinical leaders that on a regional basis and national basis that will own programs and support, and these DSOs working alongside us, we pay training for those groups in language they use and then they go working support in challenge in a positive way, the local offices and the regional teams and they put experts out there in the field right alongside, and in many cases they don\u2019t want our reps even calling on their accounts. They say look, let you have a corporate rep calling me, pull your reps out of those accounts and you don\u2019t have to put that energy and effort in.  So we can then take that rep and deploy them to another account that\u2019s not owned by the DSO. So in our mind although you would see maybe some more ASPs going down, imagine that\u2019s like an advantage effect but operating margins, contribution margins still very, very attractive and worth doing. And I completely forgot the second one you asked, I\u2019m sorry. John Kreger \u2013 William Blair : Yes, just a follow up on any interoperability progress. Tom Prescott : I wasn\u2019t trying to shine in the topic, no. We continue to work with leading players on if we could and how we could validate and confirm interoperability as I have been saying clearly, it\u2019s in our best interest to do so and while it will cost us some installed base sockets, iTero scanners, not everybody is going to buy an iTero scanner even though we believe it\u2019s the best scanner in the world. So the upside is when there is more news we\u2019ll let you know and until then you should assume it\u2019s in our interest to do so. John Kreger \u2013 William Blair : Great, thanks. Shirley Stacy : Thank you, everyone. That concludes our conference call today. We look forward to speaking with you at upcoming conferences and meetings. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. On the call today, I'll provide some highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results and then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments : Invisalign Clear Aligner, and Scanner and Services. I'll also provide some color on our customer performance, as well as progress in our geographies around the world. David will provide more detail on our financials, discuss our outlook for the first quarter, provide some commentary on our overall business for 2015. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. We are pleased to have delivered a good quarter and finish to the year, driven by continued strong growth in our EMEA and APAC regions, along with solid results in North America. Q4 revenues of $198.6 million increased 11.4% year-over-year, and Invisalign case volume growth of 14.2%. For the full year, revenues of $761.7 million increased 15.4% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all customer channels and geographies, as well as expansion of our customer base and increased utilization by existing doctors. I'm also very pleased to report that shortly after the New Year, we shipped our 3 millionth Invisalign case destined for an Invisalign teen patient in the New Jersey area. This is a significant milestone for Align, for our doctors and for our employees. It took us 10 years to reach our 1 millionth case, another 3 years to the next million and only 2 more years to reach 3 million patients now and counting. On an overall basis, 2014 was another great year for Align. Our results reflect continued execution of our strategic plan, including our 3 key strategic growth drivers, which are market expansion, product innovation and brand strength. I'll provide a brief update on each of these before discussing our results further. First, market expansion. It comprises the many ways we are working to expand the adult orthodontic treatment category with clear aligner therapy, increase our share of the largest segment of orthodontics, the Teenage market, and open up new and existing markets and geographies around the world. Over the past year, we have continued to invest in sales coverage, professional marketing and education programs, along with consumer marketing in selected country markets. We've also made targeted investments in opening up new geographic markets. For example, we further expanded our directly covered country markets in Europe by converting 23 countries previously managed by our EMEA distributor back into direct sales geographies. Today, we are announcing further expansion in the EMEA region with 3 additional European countries, which are Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg or Benelux, which are moving from distributor coverage to our direct sales organization this quarter. As with the previous countries added, we will leverage our existing infrastructure from the adjacent country teams to build local sales coverage, drive long-term market penetration and create a much stronger consumer brand for Invisalign. In the near term, we do not expect the material impact from these new countries, but over the longer term, we believe these smaller individual country markets will support and extend a strong growth in the EMEA region. In a very important Teen segment, which accounts for approximately 3/4 of total orthodontic case starts each year, we continue to gain share against traditional brackets and wires. This past year, over 117,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign, up 16.1% in an orthodontic market that is growing a low to mid-single digits, overall. While we're pleased with our continued progress, we have yet to realize our full potential in our Teenage segment in North America, not to mention in EMEA or APAC, where we are just getting started. We intend to more -- we intend to achieve more meaningful share gains for Invisalign among teen patients through expanded coverage and support, as well as consumer demand creation programs, to speak directly to teens and their moms to address common misconceptions about Invisalign treatment, letting them know the reality, about how great teen compliance is, the fact that Invisalign costs about the same as braces and the excellent treatment outcomes doctors consistently achieve on teen patients. The second strategic growth driver, product innovation, aims to create greater doctors preference for Invisalign by delivering new features and functionality to increase our doctors' confidence in treating patients with Invisalign more often and on more complex cases. As the science, technology and clinical capability behind Invisalign evolves and expands, our ability to gain incremental share of orthodontic case starts expands with it. In 2014, we announced multiple innovations designed to improve clinical applicability and predictability of treatment outcomes. In March, we launched Invisalign G5 for deep bite, which includes comprehensive features that make it far easier for our customers to treat this large segment of the market. We estimate that almost half of the orthodontic case starts in North America and Europe and almost 1/3 of malocclusions that present to doctors in Asia are deep bite cases. Feedback from doctors on deep bite continues to be positive with some of our most experienced customers calling us a significant enhancement in predictability and sighting increased confidence in Invisalign treatment of deep bite cases. Not only are doctors treating deep bite cases with Invisalign more often compared to previous years, they also report increased confidence using Invisalign on more complex cases over all, and we expect this trend to continue. In March, we also launched ClinCheck Pro in North America. ClinCheck Pro is the next generation Invisalign treatment software tool. It gives doctors more precise control over the final tooth position to better achieve their treatment goals. ClinCheck Pro will be available in EMEA and APAC this quarter, and we expect to see continued positive effects in treatment outcomes by enabling our doctors to show us rather than just tell us how they want their final set up. In November, we announced the upcoming release of the Invisalign G6 for treatment of severe crowding and bimaxillary protrusion or first premolar extraction, a common type of malocclusion that affects more than 50% of patients in Asia; along with 20% in Europe; and 12% in North America. We're excited to offer our customers a set of features designed to deliver greater predictability in severe crowding cases that require tooth extraction. Invisalign G6 clinical innovations will be available in a limited release to Invisalign trained providers in North America during Q1, with broader commercialization efforts in our APAC, EMEA and Latin America geographies throughout 2015. We expect to release Invisalign G6 more widely in North America in early 2016. Given the high relative complexity of cases Invisalign G6 we'll be addressing and a greater time required for treatment in these cases, we expect a gradual adoption much like we are seeing for Invisalign G5, as our doctors try the extraction solution, be comfortable with the increased predictability Invisalign G6 provides and overtime, begin to start more Invisalign cases for this important indication. Both the Invisalign G5 for deep bite and now Invisalign G6 build on our commitment to systematically address the types of cases our customers are routinely treating in their practices. Our third strategic growth driver is brand strength, which we use to build category and drive demand. Align is building a superior brand through a very integrated consumer marketing platform that includes TV, media, social network and eEvent marketing. Our goals are to make Invisalign a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment. In North America, we continue to speak directly to adults, moms and teens utilizing combined media programs across TV, social media, PR and digital media. In selected markets across Europe and Asia, we are driving the Invisalign message through social media engagement and PR programs. We are pleased with the progress we're seeing with programs like our EMEA regional city initiative, which has been launched successfully in 10 target cities. In these markets, we have been able to raise awareness of the Invisalign brand and continue to reposition the attractiveness of orthodontic treatment with Invisalign. There are plenty of highlights to share here, but since we included some details on our consumer activities in our webcast slides, I'll skip those details and let you revisit yourself. Taken together, these 3 key strategic growth drivers, market expansion, product innovation and brand strength provide us with a set of levers to build the business, giving us confidence in our plans for continued long-term growth. With these strategic growth drivers in mind, let's talk about how we did in Q4, by sharing some customer and geographic highlights, starting with our fastest- growing business : International. Q4 was another strong quarter for our international business across the EMEA and APAC regions. On a combined basis, total international Invisalign case volume for Q4 was over 30% of our business for the first time ever, reflecting an increase of 17.1% sequentially and up 29.2% year-over-year. Our strong performance was driven by a combination of increased utilization by orthodontists in all countries, as well as our continued effort to add new Invisalign trained doctors. On a full year basis, international case shipments increased 28.6%. This progress was driven by a combination of all 3 strategic growth drivers, market expansion as we continue to grow in new markets and achieve better penetration in existing markets through investments and coverage, product innovation as our doctors confidence in clinical results continue to improve from important evolutions in our products, and brand strength as we begin to more effectively reach consumers and help them get the smile they've always wanted. In the EMEA region, Q4 Invisalign case volume increased 27.5% year-over-year, reflecting record quarter results across all major countries. In the APAC region, Invisalign case volume increased 32.7% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong growth across all countries, with Q4 being a record quarter for Invisalign volume in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. In China, despite Q4 seasonality due to multiple industry trade shows, conferences and lengthy national holidays across the region, year-over-year growth continues to outstrip the rest of the region and more than doubled again. The Asia-Pacific region is leading the growth story across the line by execution on the same integrated use of the strategic growth drivers as in EMEA, combined with an extremely strong focus on excellence in clinical education. We are proud of our teams there and expect this good execution to continue. For Q4, North America saw solid progress with Invisalign volume up 1.7% sequentially and 8.4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Q4 growth for North America GP exceeded historical Q4 over Q3 trends, which is offset by an expected slight decline from North American orthos, who typically have slower growth coming off the summer teen season. On a year-over-year basis, both customer channels were up and growth was driven primarily by continued expansion of our customer base and increased utilization from North American orthos. Now turning to our Scanner business. Intraoral scanning in general, and with iTero in particular, represents a key future trend in dentistry and a means of connecting all areas of a practice. We are continuing to build a great digital footprint through a growing installed base of iTero scanners. In Q4, our Scanner and Services business revenues were up 3.6 sequentially and up slightly year-over-year. Our Scanner business continues to benefit from leveraging our combined Invisalign and iTero sales and marketing resources and taking full advantage of Invisalign and industry events. We generated a lot of interest and sales of iTero scanners at the ADA during New York Dental Meetings, as well as our North American Ortho Summit in November. Our customers have recognized that having an iTero scanner at chair side is a great way to improve the orthodontic experience for their patients and overall practice attractiveness with Invisalign. This underscores the reason why we continue to see substantial growth in utilization among customers with an iTero scanner. As of Q4, the percentage of Invisalign cases submitted with the digital scan in North America rose to 37.8% compared to 34% in Q3 and 26.6% in Q4 a year ago. Overall, the progress we're seeing in North America is encouraging, but does not yet reflect the benefits we expect from optimizing our go-to-market approach and sales force structure, deployment and coverage model, some of which we referenced at our analyst's meeting last May, as well as highlighted briefly in my presentation at J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference a few weeks ago. More than a year ago, we began a comprehensive assessment of the need for a significant evolution of our strategic and tactical approach in North America business to drive real change and accelerate growth. As a result, we developed and are currently implementing an updated go-to-market strategy with an expanded team and new structure to provide more comprehensive sales and service coverage. Our intent is to provide better support and engage with our doctors and their staff members, owning a much bigger place in our doctors practices. Better understanding of customer insights is essential for improved segmentation of our customer base to ensure more effective sales coverage, delivery of products and services that are tailored to specific needs and targeted selection of practices for recruitment. Our diverse customer base varies widely from the specialist to general dentist, and their needs are quite different from practice to practice. And bringing more analytical rigor to segmentation of our customer base, we are able to derive more holistic effective measures of practice potential rather than simply relying on the current run rate of the business. Accordingly, we can organize and deploy sales coverage and customer support far more effectively, while reducing sales territory size and significantly increasing the face-time our field team has with these high-value partners. In order to ensure North America sales and marketing team can increase time in-office and help each practice become more successful, they're in the process of adding a significant headcount to a North America field team that is also evolving a bit in structure. While creating some new roles, the primary changes is an addition of another 50 sales heads, most of which is in place as of today. While smaller in scope than the percentage increases in sales coverage still going on in our APAC region, this infusion of additional talent and expansion of coverage will ensure we can accelerate growth in our North America business. This approach is similar in some ways to how we restage growth in EMEA and accelerated growth in APAC a few years back. We developed solid plans for each of those regions and invested appropriately in sales coverage, marketing capabilities and acceleration of product development to address more complex cases. International teams have executed well against our plans, delivering very strong growth that we expect will continue, partly based up on our intent to continue investing into these attractive growth opportunities. In retrospect, while we were busy increasing investment and building the teams in APAC and EMEA, we under invested in North America business, especially relative to the size of the opportunity. A combination of greater analytical rigor, improved segmentation and a more effective deployment model makes us confident that North America team will also be successful in reaccelerating growth rates. Additionally, these increased investments in the North America go-to-market strategy and sales force expansion dovetail very well with other key infrastructure projects underway. These projects will ensure expanded capacity to handle additional growth with another manufacturing plant in Juarez, as well as implementation of improved enterprise systems, which will allow for more cost-effective scaling of the business, while enabling better ways of exceeding customer needs. Combined with new product and technology initiatives, these investments will ensure Align's market leadership for a long time to come. It's an exciting time to be here at Align. We are accelerating progress in market expansion, product innovation and brand. While we continue to see even more opportunities ahead. We have a robust pipeline of new product initiatives and a long list of high NPV projects in virtually every area of the company. Even with all of that, we still see significant potential to further leverage our unique core competencies, which include digital treatment planning at significant scale, the ability to create software and algorithms clinically informed by more than 5 million Invisalign iTero cases and computerizing precision control manufacturing for customized appliances. For some time, we've been considering a few opportunities adjacent to orthodontics and restorative dentistry, which could potentially leverage the core competencies that I just mentioned. One of those is a large market for a serious and growing medical condition, obstructive sleep apnea or OSA. Increasingly, dentists are becoming involved in the treatment of, and management of patients with mild to moderate OSA conditions, principally through the use of devices called mandibular advancement or mandibular repositioning devices. We believe our core competencies line up very well with this therapeutic approach and have been working with several players in the dental treatment of OSA. While still a bit in stealth mode, we are now ready to share a little more about our plans, including a relationship with an innovator in the OSA market that is working with us to develop new products for dentists to treat mild to moderate OSA, with Oral Appliance Therapy. This investment, in addition to other potential high-impact projects, fits extremely well within our overall strategy and can form the base for a new set of OSA therapeutic offerings at Align. These new products will benefit from continued evolution in our world class manufacturing technology base and over time, help make us far more relevant to our dental customers as they begin to treat a wider definition of oral health. We are very interested in this new adjacent market opportunity and the potential for commercial entry in the next year or so. As I said a moment ago, these are exciting times at Align. We're in a period of substantial investment in a series of initiatives that give us even greater confidence we can accelerate top line growth, generate incremental operating income, and extend our market leadership in clear aligner therapy and digital restorative dentistry. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to David for a review of our Q4 financial results. David? David L. White: Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the details, I'd like to note that unless stated otherwise, all of the financial information I'll discuss will be presented on a GAAP basis. With that, let's review our Fourth Quarter and Full Year financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter was a record $198.6 million, up 4.6% from the prior quarter and up 11.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $186.4 million was up 4.7% sequentially and up 12.2% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth reflected strong volume from our international doctors, offset somewhat by a decrease in ASPs. Q4 ASPs were down sequentially $22, of which approximately $18 or $2.3 million in aggregate, was primarily related to the weakening euro. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels, offset by lower ASPs, again, primarily related to foreign exchange rates and higher discounts. For the fourth quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 126,900 cases were up 6.1% sequentially, reflecting continued strong international growth, which was up 17.1% sequentially, whereas North America was only up slightly. Year-over-year, case volume growth was 14.2% reflected in increased utilization, primarily from North America orthodontic customers, as well as expansion of both our North American GP customer base and international doctors. North American orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was seasonally down 1% sequentially and up 12.6% year-over-year. For North American GP Dentist, case volume increased 4.9% sequentially and 4.1% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume increased 17.1% sequentially and 29.2% year-over-year. Worldwide, Invisalign utilization in Q4 was 4.4 cases per doctor, unchanged from 4.4 in Q4 2013. North American, ortho utilization of 8.6, increased from 8.0 in the prior year. North America GP utilization of 2.9 was slightly down from 3.0 of the prior year. In international, doctor utilization of 4.5 was essentially flat with the prior year. In Q4, we added 1,170 new North American doctors and 1,255 new international doctors. In total, we added 2,425 new Invisalign doctors in Q4. Fourth quarter revenue of our Scanner and Services segment was $12.2 million, a 3.6% increase sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our Scanner and Services revenue was slightly higher by 0.8%. Moving onto gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 75.9%, down sequentially 0.5 points and 0.6. year-over-year, primarily as a result of the impact of FX on ASPs. Recall that the prior years, fourth quarter gross margins also benefited from onetime items, of which, warranty costs were one, that amounted to approximately 1.5 points. Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 78.8%, down 0.4 point sequentially and 1 point year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year decreases were primarily the result of lower ASPs, substantially attributable to a weaker euro and onetime benefit as previously discussed. Q4 gross margin for our Scanner segment was 30.2%, down 3.3 points sequentially and 0.9 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily the results of higher product costs, and to a lesser extent, lower ASPs due to year-end promotions. Year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of lower ASPs, due to higher promotional programs, partially offset by more favorable product mix. Prior year results were unfavorably impacted by the sale of older, end-of-life products. Q4 operating expenses were $99.2 million. This represented a sequential increase of $6 million, due primarily to higher sales and marketing spend, attributable to key customer events, legal and related expenses, and to a lesser extent our first investment in the obstructive sleep apnea market. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 operating expenses were up $16 million, reflecting continued investment in new and existing markets and geographies, as well as new products and technology. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 25.9%, down 1.2 points sequentially and 3.8 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease was principally related to higher operating expenses, and to a lesser extent, lower gross margins as just described. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin reflects higher operating expenses. And as previously mentioned, the prior year's operating margin included onetime gross margin benefits, as well as approximately a $2.5 million benefit for stock compensation expense as a result of executive departures. These results increased last year's operating margin by 3 points. Other income and expense included $2 million of charges, or approximately $0.02 per share, primarily related to FX losses due to the weakening of the euro to the U.S. dollar. Further, the quarter-over-quarter impact of currency on revenue, net of the benefit we get on the translation of expenses at a lower rate was $0.01 per share. With regards to our fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 20.6%. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.48 compared to $0.47 reported in Q3 and $0.51 reported in the same quarter last year. Moving on to the balance sheet. For the fourth quarter, our accounts receivable balance was $129.8 million, down approximately 0.2% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 58 days, down 4 days sequentially and up 1 day over the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $7.1 million, primarily relating to manufacturing capacity additions. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $69.4 million. And free cash flow for the fourth quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $62.3 million. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $602.6 million. This compares to $472 million at the end of 2013, an increase of approximately $131 million. The company repurchased approximately 470 -- 417,000 shares of stock for $20.8 million during the quarter. These repurchases were part of the 3-year $300 million stock repurchase program we announced on April 23, 2014. Before we move to the Q1 outlook, I'd like to make a few comments on our full year 2014 results. Revenue was a record $761.7 million, up 15.4% year-over-year. In 2014, we shipped 478,000 Invisalign cases, up 13.2% and reflecting 28.6% volume growth from our international doctors. Full year operating income was $193.6 million, or 25.4% of revenue. While this was better than the 2014 outlook we described at the beginning of the year, more importantly, it marked the first-time our operating margin has been within the range of our long-term financial model target for the full year, albeit at the low end of that range. We generated $224.7 million of cash flow from operations in 2014 and had free cash flow of $200.6 million. In addition, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $98.2 million. 2014 diluted EPS was $1.77. With that, let's now turn our attention to the outlook for Q1 and provide some commentary on 2015. Part of doing so, however, I'd like to start by reviewing the framework under which we operate and drive the business. We've consistently talked about 3 pillars of investments, that together work in tandem to drive top line growth and deliver bottom line results. Tom talked about them in his remarks. Market expansion, product innovation and brand strength. At the start of 2014, our plans anticipated significant incremental investments in new programs, most of which focused on market expansion and product innovation. We largely executed on that plan as evidenced by the exceptional 2014 growth of our international business and the release of various new product offerings, which Tom mentioned. It was the largest year-over-year incremental investment in new programs we'd ever made. As Tom just described, our plans for 2015 are no less ambitious. This year, we expect to invest substantially more year-over-year in more programs. While much of that will again focus on growth drivers, particularly market expansion, there will be some new areas of concentrated focus, like obstructive sleep apnea and enterprise systems. Together, we believe these investments will position us to increase our top line growth, deliver earnings leverage and produce operating results that will further penetrate our long-term operating model range, as we demonstrated in 2014 with outstanding International growth and operating margin performance. We're already executing on many of these investments, recognizing that there'll be some lag between investment and returns. Consequently, our outlook reflects that impact. With that backdrop, let's now turn to our business outlook for the first quarter and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook. Consistent with historical trends, we expect demand in North America to be up slightly in Q1, driven primarily by demand from orthodontists. Turning to our international business, our first quarter has historically been a slower period for doctors and fewer days in the office due to the winter holidays in Europe and the Lunar New Year in Asia, so while we expect continued double digit growth year-over-year, we expect International volume to be down slightly on a sequential basis. As for our Scanner business, Q1 has historically been a slower period for equipment sales, following strong tax incentives driven demand at year end, and accordingly, we expect this segment to be down in Q1. We expect gross margin to be slightly down in Q1, primarily as a result of foreign exchange, additional aligners per case as we treat more complex cases, as well as increased manufacturing costs, that I'll talk about momentarily as a part of OpEx. Operating expenses will increase quarter-over-quarter, consistent with historical first quarters, based on several factors. First of all, employee compensation-related costs will increase in Q1 for 2 reasons. As a company, we operate on an annual cycle for all worldwide employee compensation reviews, including salary increases and promotions, as well as annual stock grants. These increases are effective in the first quarter. Further, employer paid payroll taxes, such as social security taxes in the U.S., reset at the start of the new calendar year. Second, incremental investments in market expansion, particularly North America, but also internationally, will increase operating expenses as we add additional coverage resources. And finally, investments outside of our historical core business, like obstructive sleep apnea and enterprise systems will also be incremental to our baseline spending coming out of Q4. With this as a backdrop, we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows : Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 124,400 to 127,400 cases, flat to a slight decrease from Q4. We expect net revenues to be in the range of $187.3 million to $192.4 million, a sequential decrease from Q4, primarily as result of lower ASPs driven by a weaker euro. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 73.5% to 74%, down sequentially from Q4 as mentioned above. We expect the operating expenses to be in the range of $105.2 million to $106.5 million. The sequential increase from Q4 also reflecting the aforementioned investments. Our operating margin should be in the range of 17.4% to 18.6%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 23%, and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $82.1 million, excluding repurchases as mentioned earlier. Taken together, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.32. And based on today's exchange rates, Q1 earnings would be impacted by about $0.04. With that, let me now provide some additional comments with respect to 2015. We believe our investment plans will continue to drive long-term sustainable growth that will far outpace the industry and further perpetuate our market share gains. While 2014 marked the first time we delivered full year operating margin results, within our long-term model, albeit at the low end of that range. FX and our new investment will make that more challenging in 2015. While we haven't had a practice of providing full year guidance, let me see if I can put these into context with respect to our actual 2014 results and our long-term model. First of all, from a revenue standpoint, we see year-over-year growth in both Invisalign case demand and revenue, when measured on a constant currency basis, to be in the high teens and within our long-term operating model. Based on today's exchange rates, however, the euro has fallen approximately 16% from the 2014 average. As a result, 2015 revenue growth will face headwinds in the range of 6 to 7 points. If this rate prevails through the year, this will put our growth somewhere in the low double-digit range and below the bottom end of our long-term model. From an operating margin standpoint, if we exclude investment and obstructive sleep apnea, which is outside of our core business, and investment in enterprise systems, which will have a limited duration, we believe 2015 operating margins, at constant currency, would be very consistent with our 2014 results and would again fall within our long-term model. To be clear, this does include all of the other incremental investments for market expansion and product technology that Tom referred to in his remarks. Including these 2 investments, along with the weaker euro, however, will impact 2015 operating margins on the order of 4 to 5 points. This figure is net of the benefit we realized from lower OpEx as a result of the weaker euro. All said, this would place us below the low-end of our operating model. We believe these investments present high-quality opportunities important for driving customer adoption, accelerating our growth in North America, continuing to expand and grow internationally and together, building a foundation for long-term sustainable growth. While many of these investments will take time before they realize meaningful returns, others should begin showing returns in the second half of 2015. Hence, we see our earnings fall [ph] in the second half of the year as stronger than the front half of the year. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments. Thomas M. Prescott: Thanks, David. On an overall basis, 2014 was a year of solid financial results and excellent strategic progress. Our teams continue to deliver in virtually every area and a few where we're not satisfied, like our North America business, we are taking important steps to accelerate growth to become even more relevant to our customers. We believe the evolution in the go-to-market strategy for the North American business, including the strategic deployment of more optimal coverage and the right technology tools and support for our combined marketing and sales teams is the right thing to do. I'm confident these investments will deliver a great return for our customers, our shareholders and our employees, and result in getting Align back to the midrange of our long-term target growth rate. Given the number of attractive investments to grow the top line, drive improved customer outcomes and satisfaction, and better profitability, we are making the choice to manage the business carefully through this cycle of heavier investment, with the commitment to restage growth towards that middle of our long-term model range and deliver improved operating margins. The entire Align team is committed to making this happen. I'm extremely excited about our progress, and I look forward to discussing this with many of you as we get out to dental trade shows and investor events over the next few months. And with that, we will move to take some questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I do see the first question is coming from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I've got a handful, but I'll try to keep it to 2 and then I'll try to follow-up with you guys off line. I think I'll keep it big picture, Tom, I'm looking at 3- to 5-year models that say, Op [ph] margins of 25% to 30%. And it looks like because of the investment in OSA, you're thinking about going down in the near-term and some currency, but maybe down to around 20% or 21%. How quickly are these accretive? I mean, I'm just trying to think of if you were to even get to 25% Op [ph] margin in 3 or 4 years, your leverage would have to go something like 20%, 24%, 26%, 29%, to even get to the bottom end of the range. So can you just help us with your confidence that you can get to 25% plus Op margins in 3 to 5? And why you think they're going to be that accretive that quickly? That's the first question. Thomas M. Prescott: Sure. Thanks -- or maybe 1a. I'll start and then ask David to come in behind me. The biggest thing here is FX as everybody adjusts to it. We've got plenty of company. That's the biggest single move pushing us down. Secondly, we have some transitory investments like initiation into sleep apnea that is more development-focused that is a little bit of a deferral for revenues streams, and I'd say that I think within the next year or so, we'll have at least some initial commercialization. From that point on, it should start to be closer to accretive. Third, we've got investments in the factory and some other places in infrastructure that are kind of period investments and then amortized over time, so it's a little lumpy here. If I come back to maybe the most predictable returns, they are on the go-to-market side. And with some exhibits we put out, some slides, I think we tried to -- given the size of the investments and the intensity of what we're trying to do, we want our owners to understand where that money was going as we provide a lot of information this quarter. If we look at what's going on in Asia, in EMEA and what we believe will play out now in North America, we believe those will start to return within 2 or 3 quarters, increments of coverage, doing better things in the right places, better programs for customer and all that. So if I started to go to market side, reasonably good track record there of demonstrating. And even in North America where we haven't been where we wanted to, we have delivered incremental results in the back half of the year, virtually every year, where we put incremental results in, maybe, in Q4, Q1. We expect that to accelerate a bit more with a bigger investment and going about it in a different way than we have done for years. Peeling that down to product and those -- well, we've got a series of new product releases coming out that we expect will have impact. And again, our cadence is invest in coverage, support, marketing programs and consumer earlier on in the year. Bring product releases right in behind them and then build that through the year. And virtually, every year -- I think David talked about more normalizing for FX and a few other things that are different this year, we've been able to show that operating leverage in the model every single year. 2014 was a great example. We wound up, speaking about some bigger investments, especially outside the U.S -- we grew into that as the year progressed -- we had a good operating margin at year-end, and for the first time, lived with a net model for the full year, so confident, comfortable. FX is a bit of a wildcard for everybody. We're not apologizing, but we're trying to be very clear about the relative impact, and I'll let David pile on a few things if I missed anything. David L. White: Yes, I guess I would -- I'm not sure there's much to add there, actually, Jon. But we -- as we said in our remarks, if you look at 2014, we delivered within the operating model, and we continue to believe -- holding aside FX, our business will continue to grow year-over-year within that operating model, and so that's an incremental leverage that we should get off of the growth we expect to see this year with under almost all other circumstances fully cover the incremental investments we're making this year. The only carve-out we made was those 2 carve-outs: one for OSA, which is outside our core business; and then the other, which was enterprise computing, which is -- or enterprise systems, which is certainly inside our core business but is more of a limited duration in terms of how long that investment would be ongoing, more on the order a year or a year-plus, and so we feel like we're already getting leverage off of the scale as the business grows from the fact we believe we can absorb all those investments with those 2 carve outs only, so... Thomas M. Prescott: FX aside, yes. David L. White: Yes, FX certainly aside. Thomas M. Prescott: Let's go to 1b. Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, and then I guess 1b, and again, I'll follow-up with you guys on some more. But just, Tom, you didn't discuss your exact plans long-term with OSA and selling. But why now? I mean, you've been slugging it out and trying to reaccelerate growth here in North America, and I think it's been, in your words, a little bit tougher than maybe you had assumed 12 months ago. Why deter management focus, sales focus by going after OSA now instead of continuing to try to reaccelerate growth in a market where you, say, 25 million to 30 million people are looking for a solution to straighten their teeth? Thomas M. Prescott: Sure. They're not mutually exclusive. These are different resources going to development cycles and upstream marketing, not -- and clinical development, clinical trial, et cetera -- not to sales, downstream marketing, anything. Secondly, as we dig a lot deeper into North America GP, and we really come back, and one of our clinical objectives for a long time, has been how do we become even more relevant with our average customer doing 10 cases a year doing against 3,000 dental procedures they do a year or more in a bigger office. So increasingly, they're interested by, and working with, new opportunities as patients think about expanding how oral health fits with their dentists and with physical health, and this is a very fast growing area, and we think it's an opportunity that directly leverages our strength. The other part of this is, globally, we probably now, I believe, have the largest specialty sales force in the world. And the reality is here that we're going to have an opportunity over time to put more high-value products into that team, covering the right GPs, doing the right things. That's not today. There's 0 distraction for this team. They're off and running, but over time, we'll have an opportunity to add more to the basket. In an area that is not a bolt-on just to have something, it's an area where we think we'd add real value to and can leverage our core competencies to the better, so there's never a perfect time. We have said for a long time that we don't have the money burning our hole in our pocket. It's more that can we find opportunities that fit our strategic direction that would leverage our core competencies and would extend our ability to add value to customers, and in this case, it's all 3. So that's why now, and obviously, FX is a lousy time for everybody, but we're not apologizing or complaining. We do believe these are the right investments to push through for the business. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : David, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the stats you gave. I think if I heard you correctly, you seem to suggest that the euro -- the exchange rate has fallen 16% from the average level in 2014? And you thought that, that would impact your revenue run rate by 6% to 7% and your operating margin by 4 to 5 points? Did I hear that correctly, number one? David L. White: Pretty close. All except for the last part of the 4 to 5 points. The 4 to 5 points included not only the impact of foreign exchange rates but also included the 2 investments that I talked about earlier, which was OSA and enterprise systems, so that's also in that 4% to 5% bucket. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And if I look at your Q1 ASP levels, I think your revenues and K shipments kind of implying something in the low 1,300. This -- it seems to be down about 6% year-over-year and maybe down about $50 on a sequential basis. You did a good job in sort of quantifying how much of that was FX this quarter. How much of that do you think is FX-driven next quarter, because I'm trying to assess whether there's any sort of mix and -- or mix changes in that number? David L. White: Well, I have no idea what foreign currency rates are going to be for second quarter, so... Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I'm guessing you're making some assumption, right, when you're kind of giving these revenue numbers, right? So I'm kind of curious about maybe what -- I'm trying to back in to maybe what you're assuming from a currency perspective in this quarter. David L. White: Yes, fair enough. Fair enough. So right now, the best indication we have for currency rates for 2015 are the current rates that prevail today. We're not in the habit or we're not experts on projecting foreign exchange rates, and I would guess there's probably any one that is, so all of the assumptions we talked about for 2015 assume that the rates that prevail today prevail throughout the entire year. And so to the extent those rates change in either direction, that will have some bearing on how 2015 ultimately shapes up as we talked about here. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : That's perfect. Tom, maybe can I just squeeze one more in on some of these investments you're making in North America? Could you give us a sense for how many bodies you have on the ground right now? How many you think you need to hire? Because I think we're all trying to assess what -- how much of these -- or how big the incremental investments are going to be and then how we should think about them as a percentage of ongoing cost versus maybe onetime in nature, and then I'll hop off. Thomas M. Prescott: I'll answer the question consistently with what we've previously discussed. Given that we're going to continue investing the growth in market expansion, which is a fairly reasonably predictable lever for us, you should expect us to invest into each of our geographies each year to a greater or lesser extent. Over the past few years in North America, even with some meaningful bodies on a percentage basis, it was less and less as we were really throwing more percentage increases into EMEA and APAC. Secondly, I think when I talked about -- in addition to just getting behind the curve a little bit in North America, our game didn't evolve as well as it should have in terms of what we were doing, who we were doing it with and how effective we could measure and deliver. And so over the last year or 2, we've been looking at overhauling a lot of that. So besides just headcount, there are a lot of positive changes about how we're doing it. With that said, we threw a slide in there somewhere. I don't have a number, but it's -- we basically showed in North America, EMEA and APAC with a bar at the left. I'm not going to give you absolute numbers, you can get yourself pretty close, showing what our total headcount is and then also showing what our incremental increases are over prior -- over 14 in each of those geographies, so we give you most of what you need there. This is a bigger number of heads in North America, and at a fully-loaded cost, a little bigger of a load, but it's not as big as a percentage increase, which is more than doubling what's going on in, say, APAC, so I -- we tried to size that. I knew you'd ask that question. The second part of your question is, \"Do I need to pop this into my model each year?\" The answer is probably not. We're going to be tighter on our North America business in terms of managing that, our approach, and tweaking that model. As I said, we've said for a couple of quarters, we've not been satisfied with the progression of that business, the team's on it. We believe this is moving in the right direction. We believe this puts us in the right range. That said, we trained over 4,000 doctors in North America last year, and we got to the point where territory sizes were just increasing to be too big. And when we went out and sat down with a lot of our customers, doing a lot of very detailed work, consistent input from customers that really wanted to elevate their practice, they couldn't get enough face-time with a rep. They didn't have enough time to work on the tools and routinize procedures. Our goal is to get a number of accounts down per territory, substantially, and then manage that in a relative way over time, so this is a bit of a surge this year in North America, continuing significant investment in APAC and EMEA where we're seeing the growth, and our belief is we can restage growth in North America, but don't expect you'd have to see this kind of a lump every year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Actually, Tom, can you just expand on what you were just saying? If you think about, specifically, your North American GP business where growth has slowed a bit, can you just talk a bit more about what your strategy is to reinvigorate that? It seems like that's a customer base that's going to be a bit more fragmented, probably lower volume ortho customers in general. Do you think you can really reach them efficiently with a direct sales model? Thomas M. Prescott: Sure, the answer is yes, John. It's hard, but it's worth doing, and there's 2 or 3 things that intersect here for us. The first here are the 20-plus thousand active GP customers in North America. There are quite a few that would like to do more. Whether they're 10 and they want to go to 30, whether they're 30 and they want to go 50 or whether they're 5, they just got trained but they're really ready to go. We have been -- we found it very, very difficult over the last year, 1.5 year to cover all of them, and we've got some great success stories where we were able to work with the practice the right way and they've really built a terrific business, delivering great customer results, patient results, et cetera, but that's -- not enough of those. Part of this is a very detailed segmentation that we can help our reps, our region managers, our teams recruit better, the practices that are -- that really do want in that really are -- the wrong word is fit but I'll use it for the moment. And then also, the customer base we've got work with those customers that really want to elevate their game, that really want to make Invisalign and some straightforward ortho a part of their practice to fit in with their restorative. And there's thousands of such customers who want more access, time and energy from us and are more than willing to partner. We know who they are by address, by name. Many of them have declared so, and so our job is to give them the right coverage, the right tools and support to make that happen, and so we're not going to move the whole -- the needle on the whole base. Fragment is exactly the right word, John. You're a good observer of the dental market, and we're going to move the needle on those practices that can and will. The second intersection here is scanners. As we continue to evolve the Scanner business and grow our installed base and over time work with other partners, that will help make that Invisalign experience plus other products we have work better. And then third, new offerings over time, like very high value oral appliance therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, which is more and more top-of-mind for some doctors. If it's easy to do, which today is not, generally, hard on the patient, hard on the doctor, a lot of visits, our view would be that ought to be able to be simplified, customized dramatically. And that, again, increases our relevance with those practices. It gives us an opportunity to earn more share of mind and share of practice. So collectively, it's a bit of a long journey within the GP side, but as I said before, it is very much worth doing strategically. John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Great. Just one quick follow-up, David, for you. The 4 to 5 points that you'd sort of signaled that EBIT margin could be down in '15. Would you be willing to break that into how much is FX-driven given current rates versus how much are coming from some of these new investment areas? David L. White: Yes, roughly 2/3 of it is FX and then the balance is the 2 investments we talked about. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Let me just focus on the -- those 2 incremental projects here that we're talking about. On the ERP side, I still consider you guys a fairly young company, you're not a serial acquirer. What's wrong with ERP systems now? Or why do you need a new ERP system, especially in a period where maybe you're investing heavily in the sales force? Currency is going to hit margins and things like that. I mean, why now on ERP? David L. White: Yes, Jeff, this is David. So first of all, the company -- every year, as we go through our strategic planning process and annual operating plan and so forth, we review long list of projects that are worthy of investing in and helping focus on to grow the business, et cetera, and ERP's actually been on that list for a long time. But when you look at the ROI we've been able to get out of product innovation and ROI out of market expansion and so forth, it has just never gotten to a point where it's raised itself to a hurdle rate that made it -- make the cut, you might say. But as we've grown and as our businesses have gotten more complex, it's become more clear to us that we have opportunities to streamline our business, to become more agile, to service our customers better, and one of the things that we believe is standing in the way of that is having a unified platform as a company under which we can present our business to the doctor, under which we can execute the workings of the company. And so it's gotten to that point where it's made the cut, and so we're biting the bullet to make it happen, and we think it's going to be something that ultimately will give us not only better agility but better scaling ability. But perhaps even more importantly, it's going to give us some capabilities with our doctors that today we presently don't have or can't fully take advantage of. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : All right. And you think those are about 1 year of investment, David? David L. White: Yes, 1, 1-plus typically is the horizon. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then my second question is just on the sleep apnea. As I think about that treatment area in dentistry, most of the companies I'm talking to in that area look at full airway analysis that needs a larger imaging device, whether it's 3D imaging or something like that as opposed to just your scanner technology. So what I'm trying to figure out what your competitive advantage might be. And two, when I think about that competitive advantage, typically, I believe it's just you order a mouthpiece. And then while you guys are good at maybe 3D printing that mouthpiece or generating that mouthpiece with your manufacturing technology, again, I think of your core competencies in kind of high throughput multi-aligner manufacturing, not manufacturing a single mouthpiece for patients. But I'm just trying to figure out why you guys might be the company to do sleep apnea as opposed to a company that has bigger imaging technologies or isn't -- doesn't have your core competencies that seem stronger to me elsewhere. Thomas M. Prescott: That's a very fair question, and what I'd say is that we don't expect to replace all the other players. Oral appliance therapy is -- today is still a very small part of a pretty big market, and it's a profoundly tough disease for people that have it. And for people that have OSA, having BiPAP or CPAP therapy is the standard of care. We don't expect that changes anytime soon. But a, there are people that are refractive to that treatment, just do not want to do it; or b, they are very mild to moderate, and this is a rapidly growing area. The second part of this is if you look at the intersection of treatment planning and algorithms to be very predictive, today, the titration process for figuring out how much advancement is necessary to keep that airway open, how comfortable that is for the patient, how many visits to the dentist office and the patient have to have, it's just -- it's very difficult. We believe there are opportunities that dramatically streamline that, building on all the diagnostic data that's out there, from the sleep doctor to lab and perhaps an MD, who's also in the loop. But dentists are in this business. They're increasingly -- and they're the right ones to think about how much mandibular advancement can you do without impacting TMG [ph] or anything else, so our job is to help them with clinical algorithms that make sense. And whether we're making -- we make part numbers of one. Every part number that goes through our factory is a part of one. It's not a series, and whether that's part of a case or one broke along the way, we can have a part of one go catch up with that case further on in the process, so this is about mass customization, very, very precise computer-controlled treatment planning and clinical algorithms. And I think, again, I'm not going to go any further, this is complementary with what other people are doing, but we believe better, cheaper, faster and far more effective. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Can we just simplify the discussion around ASPs? The comment, David, that you made was you were looking for revenues and volumes both in the high-teens, excluding currency. Is that right? And does that imply that ASPs are flat ex currency? David L. White: So number one, currencies don't affect volumes. We think volume growth like -- will be within our long-term model, number one. Currencies does affect revenue, but if we neutralize that effect and we just simply look at constant currency, if the current -- the exchange rates in 2015 were roughly equivalent to 2014, our revenue, we believe, would grow within our long-term model and be relatively consistent with what we delivered in 2014. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then the commentary around the addition of manufacturing capacity in Juarez, could you give us a sense of what the impact is on the P&L from that capacity expansion just in terms of incremental spend? David L. White: It's relatively small this quarter. We're in the process -- I think we've talked previously about -- at some point, we would need to add additional brick-and-mortar in addition to just simply buying additional pieces of capital equipment that actually operate in the factory. Well, we've gotten to that point. That factory will come online sometime later this year, and we will expect to bring up that capacity gradually over time as it's called upon, and so we'll try to make sure that the -- make sure those capital additions of equipment, so forth, are staged, commensurate with how our business is growing. As it relates to the impact for the year, I think there's a modest impact, a little bit, on gross margin for the year, particularly the second half of the year. But as I gave guidance for 2015, we've ultimately believed that our revenue growth and everything else, holding currency aside, would absorb that and still deliver our business within our long-term model, including gross margins. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. Great. And then -- and Tom, you made mentioned again the possibility of working with additional partners in intra-oral scanning. Any updated thoughts on the right time lines for that kind of move? Thomas M. Prescott: Just that it continues to be significant activity for the enterprise. We've indicated as clearly as we could that this is strategically valuable for the enterprise to do, and that you ought to assume we're out working with logical players that have interest in the same. This is one of these where until it's ready, we don't want to talk about it, and that's about as far as I'd like to go. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : David, you mentioned hurdle rates in deciding on some of these investments. Any more you can share on how you decided whether these investments were the best return on capital? I'm curious just as far as the decision-making process and how you contemplated the timing of doing all these investments at the same time if we're thinking about the sales force investment, ERP, sleep apnea, et cetera. David L. White: Well, first of all, when we -- we have an ongoing process for evaluating projects that are currently underway as well as -- and early in the funnel in terms of our execution on them as well as projects there at the top of the funnel or just kind of circulating around in the way of ideas. Somewhere between those 2 points, a business case gets put together, a feasibility analysis gets put together. And as those things come together, we're presented with an opportunity to decide whether or not we've got capacity to add resources to it and pursue that project or not, whether or not we can constrain it within our operating plan or not, et cetera, and so I wouldn't say there's a single litmus test that we applied to all these because there are certain -- many of these projects have intangibles associated with them that are not easily measured in a highly quantifiable way, but as we look at those intangibles and we look at the tangible things that we can measure and we look at how they'll -- our available resources and we look at how it fits in our envelope and so forth, those things all come together to make, you might say, an informed decision. Now as we go through our strategic plan, our annual operating plan process, there's a process we go through that based on that criteria, we begin winnowing some of that down. And as it related to the projects that we're looking at doing for 2015, we felt like we had a significant number of projects that had high return opportunities on them. We felt that we could basically fit them, you might say, within our operating model as our business grew and so forth, and we decided to execute on those, and we approved them, and we're staffing for them accordingly. The only 2 that I carved out were OSA, which is outside of our core business but yet we feel, over a longer term, is a little bit longer horizon, is going to be accretive as well; and then, as we talked -- as I mentioned in the prior question, enterprise systems as well at the same time. Thomas M. Prescott: Hey, Bob, if I could pile on just for a second. In addition to a standalone business case or investment choice, there is significant interdependence between some of these investments. There are things we want to do as a company. I spoke briefly at the recent conference about this thing we're calling our little, in a small way, not grand, digital ecosystem, and that's a way of surrounding customers in a very different way with our scanner and others bringing in much higher value set of work streams and new applications; physical and digital. And in that direction, becoming a heck of a lot more relevant. This is where you start getting to adjacent therapeutic opportunities that would trade well on our core competencies like sleep apnea, and it became very compelling. And now then you come back to ERP, and if ERP can enable acceleration in some of these things, the payback for an ERP project, we might have waited a year or 2, starts looking more attractive because it enables acceleration in other areas. And then finally, you come back to number one, we were -- I will speak critically of ourselves here. In the last couple of quarters, we've not been satisfied with the deceleration in growth rate in North America, especially in the GP side, and we're bound and determined to fix it. So as we look at that, and we look at what we could put into that team with evolving products we haven't spoken about yet, with other things in the pipeline, we want to get a team in place, surround the customer properly with a whole lot of new capability and then we can really start to leverage the top line for whole streams of other kinds of revenue as we're looking out here. Again, we're trying to make the organic machine even better, and so there is significant interdependence. These aren't always so easily standalone. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's fair. And I guess just the related question to that would be around other uses of cash, and you guys had, had a 3-year repo program out there. I'm just curious as, I guess, twofold as you evaluated these investments on a return basis, how did they stack up relative to just a larger buyback? And then any update on how we should think about the repo in light of these investments would be helpful. Thomas M. Prescott: I'll start and let David answer your direct question. The simple fact is everything we're talking about has high NPV. We're trying to be very good stewards here, and yet we see this opportunity to accelerate impact and progress in the business, certainly to the midterm. We believe we can restage growth more closer to the middle of our range where it had been hanging around the low end, and let's put FX aside just a moment. We look at all that first and then we would come back and evaluate our capital allocation strategy in the context of our long-term strategy and then have thoughtful discussions with our Board about it. I'll let David comment specifically on our progress on the buyback and how we go from here. David L. White: Yes, I guess I would add one thing to it and that is as we think about our investments each -- almost each and every day around here, most of them are P&L investments. They're not significant capital investments on the balance sheet like plant and equipment. Certainly, we talked a little bit about that on the call today about adding capacity on the manufacturing side and so forth, but when you look holistically across all the investments we make, most of them are P&L-related, and so we do feel some -- there is a balance between how much we put into the P&L, how long it's going to take for us to recognize returns from that because as we grow top line, as we grow leverage with scale and so forth, that brings more to the bottom line that either gets flows into cash and ultimately back to the shareholders through repurchases or flows into new opportunities for us to invest -- reinvest back into the business, and so that's kind of the way we look at it, and when we -- last spring, when we had our, I think, our Q1 call and we talked about a definitive program for stock repurchases is in light of those trade-offs. And at that point in time, as we looked at our long-term model and our long-term cash-generating capability, we recognized that those P&L investment opportunities are only going to take -- are going to -- only require some percentage of our cash flow generation over that time period. And that excess, above and beyond what we thought those needs would be, either for those projects or, strategically, for longer-term things, we should be able to return to shareholders. And that's how we came up with number one, the $300 million stock repurchase plan, number one. And number two, it's also what informed us as we expanded our business models to include free cash flow generation. And it's that free cash flow generation that the excess of which we would expect which we would expect to use for stock repurchases. So you should expect that sometime over this year, we'll commence repurchasing the second $100 million out of that $300 million, and I think you should also expect that in line with that long-term cash flow model we're talking about, at some point, we'll revaluate that. We just haven't gotten to that point where it make sense to do that, but that's certainly how we would see it playing out. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Chris Lewis with Roth Capital Partners. Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Tom, I guess, I was hoping you could elaborate just on the revamped go-to-market approach in North America, specifically beyond just adding the 50 heads. Can you elaborate on the types of changes that are being made within the actual structure of the sales organization there whether it's changing the territory size or level of support service or the compensation structure? Thomas M. Prescott: Yes to all of the above and more. I mean, it starts, Chris, with making sure you've got the right people in the field and then doing the right things and, importantly, at the right customers. We've thrown a lot of heads out in the field over the last 3 to 5 years, and we've trained a lot of doctors. And I'm overstating for affect, but in some cases, we left the region managers and the reps to figure out who to call on. And while we tried to drive a more systematic, I'll call it, scripted approach, we were only partially successful with that. The evolving go-to-market game plan is a bigger team, organized a bit differently, smaller regions, more line of sight, expecting longer calls in the office more, fewer customers and calling on the customers that are -- that fit, that are committed, that really want to elevate and spend more time, not as -- an earlier question said they're fragmented, not every dentist even wants to do ortho, and so -- and by the way, along the way, we're finding ways we can support low-volume customers that are very valuable to us, but really don't want to put more time and energy now. 15 cases a year is just fine for them, and we'll find ways to support them. We are struggling to do that. One of these evolutions is we're finding a support model that can do that. The important thing is here is we're already getting some very good feedback. This actually started fairly early in Q4 in a small way, and we pretty much had everybody on board before the end of the year. So as we did kick off meetings. We typically do that each year all around the geographies. Everybody's up and running, and they're on the same page. Finally, we've got better tools. I mean, it seems basic, but the right people in the right account doing the right things in a very systematic way and then measuring progress literally day-by-day, account-by-account. So far more prescriptive about our approach, far more consistent about how we block and tackle, very specific learning from segmentation about where we're spending our time and energy and then finding more cost-effective ways to support lower volume customers that today don't want to do more, but they're still very valuable to us, and they're great customers, and someday, they may. And then behind all of that, our goal is to build a bigger installed base of scanners, ours and others, and leverage those with more applications, like the outcome simulator for Invisalign and clinical applications at chair-side. It should make everything easier for that doctor. So that's -- I called it earlier days there, but the team is managing through the churn very well so far, and they're off and running. So a lot of changes, as I said, comp, structure, et cetera. Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Great. I appreciate the color there. And then David, maybe a question for you on ASPs, maybe 2 parts first. Are there any other levers beyond FX that's driving the implied sequential decrease from the fourth quarter to the first quarter internationally? And then secondly, how should we think about ASPs in North America as we progress into 2015 versus 4Q levels? David L. White: So primarily, if you look at it year-over-year and you look at it quarter-over-quarter, FX basically drove 80%, 90% of the decline that we see in both those comparatives, and the same would hold true, Q4 to Q1. There are other effects. You asked about international, and I think the same would apply somewhat to North America. We do have periods of running various kinds of promotions, which yield different kinds of discount and so forth, and those sometimes have different seasonalities associated with them. So for example, we'll run specific promos and discounts heading into the Q3 for the teen season for the orthodontic channel -- orthodontist channel. So there was some of that in the fourth quarter as it relates to some of those kind of discounting programs running in Q4, but the vast majority of it is all FX. Thomas M. Prescott: Chris, maybe another way to jump on, pile on, was mix is not so much the issue right. It's mostly FX. Mix is pretty stable around the globe, and we more or less expect that to be the case. It's mostly FX, and occasionally, some promotion, but I'd say FX is going to overwhelm those other effects. David L. White: Yes, I was just going to say over a -- well we may see a little bit of observations quarter-over-quarter on ASPs. We talked -- I talked previously about the long-term trend in ASPs continuing to be up, and I still believe that to the point that Tom make. If you look at the percentage of our cases that are full cases versus the express cases, that percentage has been relatively consistent over time, fluctuating on a quarter-by-quarter basis by less than a point. When you look at the mix, however, though, between international and North America with the higher growth rates international and the higher ASPs they have there, they just naturally are going to become a more significant piece of the total geographic mix of our business, and that is over the long term, holding FX rates aside, should continue to drive a ASPs up. Thomas M. Prescott: That was -- speaking of a product mix, not geographic mix. David is exactly right. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Tom, just wanted to get your perspective on how you're feeling about the U.S. market. You have -- coming into the fourth quarter, it feels like it were off to a pretty good start. Would be curious if you could give us some color on how it exited. And then in terms of the 1Q case volume guidance of flat to down, weaker than history would otherwise suggest, can you parse out some of the dynamics there? Thomas M. Prescott: Sure. I'll start, and David can pile on if he chooses. First of all, we're not out of January yet. I think the year, in general, we're getting off to a start we'd expect, and that's captured in our guidance. We've got a lot of moving parts here, and all those factors are kind of caught. I mean, we -- I guess, we've got a clear line of sight to rolling out G6 in some of these other geographies. You come back North America, that will really be more limited in the near term. But in general, the team is off and running. I feel pretty comfortable about our general direction. I think if we look back to last year, it seemed like we were getting you guys -- I shouldn't say we, we're out here : Sun's out. But the Northeast, the Midwest especially, we're getting slammed by storm after storm. We were kind of looking at it last week or this week going, \"Geez!\" But I think notwithstanding that, and all in last year, that was not a very big effect for us over all over time. So in our minds, we don't exactly track dental visits. Maybe there's a lag effect or something, but I think the market is reasonably solid, healthy. I don't know what else to say other than that. David L. White: I'll just add a little bit of color because you're looking at historical trends possibly. In my comments, basically what we said was the growth in North America quarter-over-quarter primarily in the orthodontists channel. And if you look at historically, let's say over the last 3 years and so forth, I think our quarter-over-quarter growth in North America has typically been in the low-single digits to mid-single digits from Q4 to Q1, and so I think our -- the guidance we gave for this quarter is not materially different from what we've seen over the last 3 years. Thomas M. Prescott: For North America. David L. White: For North America. Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And on the new awarded facility, could you quantify the aggregate amount of CapEx that will be needed to complete that facility? David L. White: The total amount for the year of all in, not just the plant, but fitting it and stuff? Chris Lewis - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Yes, I suppose. And I guess in that context, like when it normalizes, do we go back to the maintenance level? Thomas M. Prescott: Yes, yes. About $15 million, I think, for 2015, all in. Okay. David L. White: It's about right -- I think it might be a little more than that, Tom, but it's not materially different. There is brick-and-mortar in there as well as equipment. We're certainly not going to fit up the entire building by the end of this year, so probably not too different for 2015, but certainly over a longer time -- time horizon as we build that factory completely out, you'll probably be looking at more CapEx on top of that figure. Thomas M. Prescott: But that would be feathering in capacity. David L. White: Would be feathering in capacity. Thomas M. Prescott: Modules of capacity versus the lump you have to go through when you put -- bring a new plan on. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

He doesn\u2019t officially start until June 1st, so we won\u2019t make him answer any questions about the business, but he will be happy to take a couple of your questions during Q&A about why he is so excited of joining Align. Let me turn now to our first quarter results. On our call today I\u2019ll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments Invisalign Clear Aligner, and Scanner and Services. I\u2019ll also include some commentary on our performance with customers as well as progress in our geographies around the world. David will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that I\u2019ll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call up to questions. Our first quarter was a bit stronger than we expected getting us off to a good start to the year. This progress was driven by continued strong year-over-year growth by international team and solid improvement in our North America business as well. We are pleased to have delivered better than expected results, with strong revenues, margins and EPS driven primarily by higher Invisalign volume from our North American orthodontists. Our Q1 results reflect continued execution of our strategic plan including our three key strategic growth drivers which are market expansion, product innovation and brand strength. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on each of these before discussing our results further. Market expansion comprises in many ways. We are working to expand the adult orthodontic treatment category with clear aligner therapy, increase our share of the Teenage orthodontic market and open up new and existing markets and geographies around the world. In Q1 we brought back the Benelux countries and converted them into direct sales geographies for our EMEA region and in May we will further expand our directly covered country markets in Asia-Pacific by adding Taiwan. As with the previous countries added, we will leverage our existing infrastructure from the adjacent country teams to build local sales coverage, drive long-term market penetration and begin to create a much stronger consumer brand for Invisalign. The very important key segment, which today in still mostly North American market represent approximately three quarters of worldwide orthodontic case starts each year. Execution of our strategy is enabling us to continue to gain share against other brackets and wires players. As of Q1 more than 121,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign over the past 12 months of 16.3% from the prior year in orthodontic market that is growing in a low to mid single-digits overall. With all our progress we are far from realizing our full potential in Teenage segment now really just getting started in EMEA and APAC regions where we are implementing focused initiatives to drive awareness and preference for Invisalign for teens. Q2 marks the start of the busy summer teen orthodontic season and we have new team sales programs and an orchestrated marketing effort designed to increase our doctors confidence in Invisalign or overcoming key barriers which may keep them from recommending Invisalign more often for the teenage patients. These new programs include case studies detailing how to drive increase practice growth and profitability by integrating teen Invisalign cases how to better utilize practice referrals and leverage Invisalign marketing and the team confidence study. Product innovation aims to create greater doctor preference for Invisalign by delivering new features and functionality to increase our doctor\u2019s confidence in treating patients with Invisalign more often and on more complex cases. As the science, technology and clinical capability behind Invisalign continues to evolve and expand, our ability to gain incremental share of orthodontic case starts expands with it. During Q1 we began initial commercialization activities for Invisalign G6 our solution for first pre-molar extraction cases including speaker training and lounge workshops. The initial feedback from targeted Invisalign providers shows excitement about the potential for more effective treatment of these extraction cases, this is especially true in our Asian markets where extraction cases represent over 70% of the cases presenting to the doctor. Feedback has also been very positive across Europe for orthodontists Invisalign G6 as a significant step towards the expansion of Invisalign applicability to a broad range of increasingly complex malocclusion. While still very early in our launch process over 220 doctors have already submitted Invisalign G6 cases. In Q2 we will begin full launch activities for Invisalign G6 including expanded training for Invisalign doctors and our sales and customer support teams. Over 3,000 customers are expected to attend Invisalign G6 live lab event across the EMEA and APAC region. During Q1 we also launched ClinCheck Pro in EMEA and APAC. The significant ClinCheck software evolution has been extremely well received and already nearly half of our customers in EMEA and APAC have now switched to the new platform attracted by enhancements on 3D control and efficiency. And finally brand strength, the brand strength of Invisalign remains one of Align's key differentiators for both doctors and their patients. Align has built a superior brand through a very integrated consumer marketing platform that includes TV, media, social networking and event marketing. Our goals are to make Invisalign a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to insist on Invisalign for getting the healthier more beautiful smile they've always wanted. In North America we saw positive growth in virtually all key consumer demand metrics as a result of cross general marketing, efforts across TV, digital, social media, and PR channels. As a result the numbers of consumers searching for the Invisalign brand grew significantly. We also had good growth in unique visitors to invisalign.com as well as a step up in the number of dark locator searches. Our focus on social media has enabled a substantial increase in followers across Invisalign social media properties like Facebook, Twitter and more. As a key element in social media we continue to see user generated content from patients describing their Invisalign journey as the top performing content on Invisalign social channels. And in preparation for the upcoming Teen orthodontic season we will kick off one of our largest efforts of the year targeting to the mom audience promoting Invisalign Teen through our un-braced teen confidence campaign which leverages our Teen confidence study published last year. Results of the study highlight the struggle teens have with their self confidence during the teenage years and the teens wearing Invisalign aligners had a 2x boost in self esteem when compared to teens wearing metal braces. In EMEA while our overall consumer programs are on a smaller scale we have made good use of digital media to effectively reach our target audience while accelerating social media, experiential events and PR activities. We continue to drive significant increases and awareness of Invisalign year-over-year. The Invisalign EU social media community continues to grow with double the number of fans from the same period last year. Globally as a brand we recently celebrated a milestone of 3 million Invisalign smiles by inviting our customers, patients, consumers and employees to help spread even more smiles by providing a large donation to Operation Smile. We did this by asking everyone to do something very simple, to post a picture of their smile with the hashtag, hashtag 3 million smiles, and for every smile shared in this way we would donate a dollar to Operation Smile up to a million dollars over the campaign. If you're not familiar with this very worthy cause, I'd like you to look into the profound impact they have on children and adults born with cleft lip and cleft palate, especially in countries with little to no access to care. Amazing things are doing at operation smile and needs financial support to reach even more children for this life changing procedure. You may have seen our full page ad in New York Times earlier to kick this effort off to-date this has been a very successful way to engage with our community generating thousands of posts that we're seeing over 9 million times across the globe. There are plenty of highlights to share here and since we included some details on our consumer activities in our webcast slides I'll skip the details and let you review it by yourself. Taken together these three key strategic growth drivers market expansion, product innovation and brand strength provide us with a great set of levers to build the business giving us confidence in our plans for continued long-term growth. With these growth drivers in mind let's talk about how we did in Q1 by sharing a few customer and geographic highlights. In Q1 the North America business demonstrated continued progress, during the quarter our practices reported solid patient traffic and procedure volumes across the board including for Invisalign. On a sequential basis Q1 growth was driven primarily from North American orthodontists with the utilization going to 9 cases per doctor for the first time ever. This utilization increase reflects continued traction from our cycle of product innovations including Invisalign G5 or D5 launched early last year, additionally we believe the evolution in our go to market strategy discussed in our Q4 call is creating some positive impact a little earlier than expected. We're pleased to see some initial traction and expect more meaningful contribution from these changes in the back half of the year and beyond. Moving to our international business, Q1 Invisalign volume was down slightly on a sequential basis as expected, reflecting a seasonally slower period in the EMEA region, mostly offset by higher than expected volume from Asia Pacific. This was especially the case in China with continued growth, despite the Lunar New Year in mid-February. On a year-over-year international basis growth remains strong, driven by continued momentum from product innovation and Go-To-Market expansion. Our Q1 results reflect increased adoption from our existing customer base and accelerated option from new trained doctors across all international geographies and channels.  In the EMEA region Q1 Invisalign case volume increased 25.1% year-over-year reflecting growth across all country markets, especially in Spain. We are also very pleased with improved performance in Italy and the UK. Our new direct markets in Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and now Benelux, are also generating initially high growth levels albeit on a small base, as our renewed focus on sales and clinical education was trying pay-off. In the APAC region Invisalign case volume increased 37.5% year-over-year reflecting continued strong growth across all countries, while China and Japan continue to deliver the fastest growth. We\u2019re also seeing solid growth in Southeast Asia, in Australia and, New Zealand. Now turning to our scanner business, in Q1 our scanner and services business revenues were down sequentially as we expected. The decrease in revenue also reflected reduced pricing offering for the current iTero scanner to bridge commercial availability for the new iTero Element scanner announced last month at International Dental Show, IDS in Germany. The iTero Element is engineered to deliver everything that doctors appreciate about iTero Scanner except in a more complex footprint with even great capabilities. The smaller design with enhanced wand, multi-touch display and new image sensor is engineered to enable 20 times faster scan speed with color scanning for more precise clinical evaluation. We were excited to have the opportunity to preview the new scanner at IDS and we\u2019re pleased to be receiving very positive responses from existing iTero users, as well as from potential new customers. Both our very interested in Element\u2019s new, and smaller form-factor, faster scans, and expanded capabilities. IDS also marked the beginning of our expanding Go-To-Market resources in the EMEA and APAC regions for the iTero platform. We expect initial shipments of the iTero Element intraoral scanner to begin in the second half of 2015.  Well we are proud to have the best scanner on the market with the greatest utility for our customers. We also believe there is even greater opportunity for customers to benefit from our Align Technology\u2019s Open Systems approach, both for our iTero scanners, as well as for the Invisalign system. We have worked hard to qualify other leading intraoral scanners that have the potential capability to deliver high quality interoperability with the Invisalign case submission process. To that end, at IDS last month, we announced interoperability for Invisalign case submission with Sirona CEREC Omnicam. This qualification enables Invisalign providers with a CEREC Omnicam and the new CEREC Ortho Software 1.1 to submit a digital impression in place of a traditional PVS impression. We look forward to working with the Sirona team to ensure their customers and patients have a great Invisalign experience. And with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David for review of our Q1 financial results. David? David White : Thanks, Tom. Note that this fiscal year, we are consolidating some of the supplementary product and geographic breakdowns that we provide for volumes and revenue as well as combining sales and marketing expense with general and administrative. We will continue to explain the performance of our products in geographies and include commentaries appropriate. However, we believe the consolidated view of our quarterly financials is more consistent with disclosures respect to peer group. Let\u2019s review our first quarter financial results. Revenue for the first quarter was $198.1 million, down 0.3% from the prior quarter and up 9.7% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. First quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $187 million was up 0.3% sequentially and up 11.2% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth reflected higher volume from our North American ortho doctors, offset slightly by lower volume from our international doctors as well as lower worldwide ASPs. Q1 ASPs were down sequentially $35, of which approximately $32 or $4.2 million in aggregate, was related to foreign exchange rates. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels, partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily related to foreign exchange rates. For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 138,000 cases were up 3.1% sequentially, reflecting growth from our North American orthodontists and to a less extend North American GP customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 16.6% reflecting continued strength in international as well as strong demand from our North American orthodontists. Our North American orthodontists Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 7.9% sequentially and up 17% year-over-year. For North American GP Dentist, case volume was up 1.6% sequentially and 6.5% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was seasonally down 0.9% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. Q1 marks the sixth consecutive quarter of greater than 25% growth for our international region. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q1 was 4.5 cases per doctor up slightly from 4.3 in Q1 last year. North American ortho utilization of 9.0 was a new record increasing from 8.1 in the prior year. North America GP utilization of 2.9 was flat compared with the prior year and international doctor utilization of 4.4 was up slightly from 4.3 in the prior year. In Q1 we added 2410 new Invisalign doctors worldwide 870 of which were new North American doctors and 1,540 of which were new international doctors. First quarter revenue for our scanner and services segment was $11.1 million a decrease of 9.1% sequentially and 10.9% year-over-year while unit sales of our scanner were slightly down relative to each period most of the revenue decline was the result of reduced pricing for the current iTero scanner which Tom previously commented on. Moving on to gross margin, first quarter gross margin was 76.3% overall up sequentially 0.4 points and 0.3 points year-over-over. The Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 79.1% up 0.3 point sequentially and flat year-over-year. The sequential increase is primarily the result of higher volumes and seasonally lower training costs offset by lower ASPs as mentioned. Q1 gross margin for the scanner segment was 28.3% down 1.9 point sequentially and 5.3 points year-over-year both as a result of lower ASPs as previously mentioned. Q1 operating expenses were a $102.2 million up sequentially by $3 million from $99.2 million reported in Q4. In aggregate overall operating expenses were up by $9.8 million primarily related to increased employee headcount and compensation expense related to our annual employee performance reprocess, increased legal fees and investments in OSA product development which was offset in part by a benefit of $6.8 million associated with a medical device excise tax refund for a net sequential increase of $3 million. You'll recall a year ago that we had extensive discussions with the IRS in which they informed that our clear aligners are not subject to this tax, accordingly we stopped accruing and paying this tax in March 2014, however a refund of our 2013 payments would require separate application, review and approval. That approval was received this quarter. The after tax benefit of this refund on EPS in the quarter was $0.06. On a year-over-year basis Q1 operating expenses were up $6.7 million which includes the benefit of the medical excise tax refund just mentioned reflecting increased headcount and continued investment in our go-to-market activities as well as product and technology development as we talked about at length in our Q4 year-end earnings call in January. Our first quarter operating margin was 24.7% down 1.2 points sequentially and up 1.6 points year-over-year. First quarter results included the aforementioned medical excise tax refund of $6.8 million which benefited operating margins by 3.4 points. Excluding the margin benefit from this refund operating margins were down both sequentially and year-over-year relating to new investments in our three strategic growth drivers as we previously discussed. Other income and expense included $1.7 million of charges primarily related to foreign currency losses related to customer payments with the continued weakening of the euro to the U.S. dollar comprising most of that. Altogether the quarter-over-quarter impact for foreign exchange as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar including the decline on revenues, the benefits on our non U.S. dollar operating expenses together with currency exchange losses was reported in other income and expense was $0.03 per share. While currency has certainly dampened to some extent our business results, we believe continued investment in our strategic growth initiatives will accelerate current year and long-term growth with a leverage of our business model will ultimately overcome the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In tandem with those investments however we do intend to begin commencing some of our current hedging, some of our currency exposures to mitigate some of the inter quarter volatility we've been experiencing commencing in Q2. With regards to our first quarter tax provision our tax rate was 23.8%, slightly up from our 2014 tax rate due to higher permanent tax differences on certain expenses that are not deductible. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.44 compared to $0.48 reported in Q4, and $0.39 reported in the same quarter last year. Moving on to the balance sheet, for the first quarter our accounts receivable balance was $138.2 million up approximately 6.5% sequentially, our overall DSO was 63 days up five days sequentially and flat over the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $15.6 million, primarily relating to a second facility purchased in Lars, Mexico for aligner fabrication as well as manufacturing equipment and set up costs for that facility as we add additional capacity as well as additional cost capitalized on our enterprise system project. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $35.6 million. And free cash flow for the first quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $20 million. The company repurchased approximately 31,000 shares of stock of $1.8 million during the quarter on the open market. This repurchase mark the completion of the first $100 million of the $300 million stock repurchase program we announced the year ago at this time. We expect to announce our plans for our second $100 million shortly. In this regard I\u2019d like to mention the fact that when we file our first quarter 10-Q that our cash flow statement will indicate cash outlays of $14.6 million the payment of employee taxes. This figure relates to the company\u2019s practice of issuing vested employees restricted stock, or views on a net basis, which we recently adopted for all employee stock awards. This means that instead of employees having to sell some of their vested shares to pay their payroll related taxes. The company issues the net amount of the shares to employees and pays the payroll taxes on their behalf.  So in an indirect manner this $14.6 million should be reviewed as additional stock repurchases by the company offsetting to some extent the dilution that will otherwise have resulted from the issuance of the shares. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $613 million. This compares to $602.6 million at the end of 2014, an increase of approximately $10.4 million. With that let\u2019s now turn to our business outlook for the second quarter and the factors that are inform our view.  Starting with the demand outlook, the second quarter is typically seasonally stronger period for our North American doctors and we\u2019re seeing the strength of our first quarter volume trends continuing early into the second quarter and aggregate we expect Invisalign for North America to be up sequentially in Q2. Q2 is seasonally a busier quarter for our international doctors and we\u2019re anticipating Invisalign shipments to increase sequentially from Q1. With the recent announcement of the new iTero Element scanner which available in the second half of the year and reduce pricing we\u2019ve implemented on our current scanner we anticipate some of our customers may delay purchase decisions as they evaluate choices. Therefore we expect Q2 scanner and services revenues to be down sequentially from Q1. This is a backdrop we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 139.5 to 142,000 cases up approximately 18% over the same period a year ago at the midpoint of the range and above our three year average. We expect net revenues to be in the range of $206.6 million to $210.4 million a sequential increase from Q1 primarily driven by the higher volume just mentioned and a small price increase in North America affective April 1st, each of which are partially offset again by lower ASPs assuming a weaker euro. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 75% to 75.7% down slightly quarter-over-quarter primarily result of lower ASPs and a higher number of new doctor training events. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $117.3 million to $118.3 million a sequential increase compared to Q1 largely as result of benefit we\u2019ve recognized in Q1 for the medical excise tax refund as well as higher expenses associated with our strategic investments. Our operating margin should be in the range of 18.3% to 19.5%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 82 million excluding any stock repurchases as mentioned earlier. Taken together we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.38. On a constant currency basis our Q1 average -- using Q1 average exchange rates the Q2 outlook would have been approximately $0.02 higher. With that I\u2019ll now turn the time back over to Tom for closing comments. Tom Prescott : Thanks David. We\u2019re extremely pleased that we\u2019ve seen strong performance in all regions getting us off to a good start to the year. In every direction we look, our strategy is working well. In market expansion as our continued investments in go-to-market initiatives delivered volume growth from better coverage and support. In product innovation the adoption growth continue to be driven by our innovation cycle for both Invisalign and our scanner technology. In brand strength as we reached more and more consumers hoping them connect with the right practice ensuring they get a great Invisalign treatment experience. The significant growth initiatives we discussed during our year-end call including our expectations from most of the impact showing up in our second half results. While we\u2019re pleased to see some of the positive impact early in the we do expect to see continued progress throughout 2015 as more of Align\u2019s key initiatives begin a great leverage in the business. There is never an ideal time for our company to have change in the CEO but there are better times to make this important transition in new leadership. As figure today there is clear evidence of our solid execution of Align\u2019s winning strategy demonstrating continued and sustainable progress for the business. We have a strong leadership team and great talent across the Align organization. The Company has outstanding prospects for continues growth in revenue and earnings and expect to be a market leader for the long-term, so while there's never an ideal time this is certainly not a bad time to make this change. After 13 years of leading this company and following a well executed succession plan this is a good time for me to step aside effective June 1. I'm extremely pleased to welcome Joe Hogan as the new President of Align Technology. Joe is a rare leader with a talent for building great teams and winning the race with a passion for customers and their patients, with the intellectual curiosity to challenge and accelerate our pace of innovation and the leadership experience to ensure this company is a market leader for the long term. We are lucky to land him as our new CEO and he is even more excited about the opportunity to roll up his sleeves and get to work at this unique business. As for me I'm very pleased to remain on Align's board where I will do my best to help Align flourish for many years to come. I thank you for your commitment to the company as shareholders. For your own sense of vision about what this one struggling Silicon Valley startup could become. I've enjoyed getting to know many of you and I've done my best in leading our team as we build substantial shareholder value. And on a happy note when I'll be signing off as your CEO in a month or so, before you let me out of here I guess have a few questions for David and me and the quarter and for Joe at what he saw to attract him here to Align. Let's get that started, operator. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] our first question is coming from the line of John Kreger with William Blair, please proceed with your question. John Kreger : Could you maybe give us, as Tom suggested, a little bit of what drove your decision to join this company? It's obviously a pretty different profile from where you've been. And if you've formed them, perhaps what your first year priorities might be? Joe Hogan : Hi John appreciate the question, look I'm really happy to be here, I mean Align is a great company, is a great history and good leadership and team here. I think your question to I know it's smaller than what I've done in the last maybe 10 years or 12 years of my career, but honestly gentlemen I've always have always been close to customers, I love technology, growth in markets and customers always have been terrific for me too and so I look at this a chance from a career standpoint to join a winning team, a company that has a lot of growth and also to do more of the things I really enjoy which is technology piece and the customer piece too, so I'm really looking forward to joining the company, I think the last part of our question is, look I see a terrific trajectory here and a strong team, I don't see any reason to change that. So I come on board, I'll take over the plant here and work diligently with the team to keep the momentum that Align's had over the last couple of years. John Kreger : And then Tom, maybe coming back to you, now that you've got the Sirona interoperability deal in place, can you give us a sense about what does your sales force -- what are they able to do now that they've got that? Can they work collaboratively with Sirona or Patterson? Can they be knocking on the doors of existing CEREC users? How much might their approach change now that that deal is in place? Tom Prescott : Great question and I think the right touchstone is to remember that's the Omnicam starting with a pretty darn small install base to begin with and mostly all GP dentists and most of which do not do Invisalign today, so it does give us an opportunity to recruit, great attractive practices or if they're small Invisalign customers you need to grow them but we're talking small number of thousands of units not the bigger part of the Sirona install base. Longer term Sirona is a terrific company they're doing a great job and I think they intentionally turned their install base over to Omnicam\u2019s more and that will make that opportunity bigger but let\u2019s just say start small and do the same things we\u2019ve done with 3M True Definition, ensure that the customer has the best utility possible and we can make sure we deliver our great Invisalign experience help the practice grow, help the patients benefit, so same approach, we'll just keep moving forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs, please bear with your questions. Robert Jones : Thanks for the questions and welcome, Joe. I look forward to working with you. Tom, I guess, on the strong growth in cases in the quarter, clearly really strong in both the GPs and Orthos in North America. I think third and fourth quarters have accelerating growth consecutively respectively. Can you maybe just share with us how much of that in your mind is the improving underlying market versus you said some early traction in the go-to-market strategy changes? Tom Prescott : I'd say yes. I don't mean to be flip but I wish we could be very clear about exactly what the quantitative drivers were, we know that when practice flow is steady and perhaps growing a little bit and procedures, procedure mix is positive for higher value procedures we do better than most and we certainly I would say steady to improving conditions as we exited '14 and went into '15. Secondly and I'll reach back to our call at the end of year, we were already in motion on most of these initiatives both on the consumer side and the product side and on a go to market side so while we think of this model generally as more backend loaded for impact in leverage we were already seeing some positive feedback from customer in Q3 and Q4 as we started to making these changes. A better coverage, more effective coverage, better support for the practices generally means could things happen. So it\u2019s early and it\u2019s way too early to call victory here. But we think our improving capabilities and better coverage alongside solid market is good news. We still project continued impact throughout the year as we normally see. Robert Jones : So it sounds like a combination of improving markets and some of your efforts then. Tom Prescott : I think that\u2019s fair. Robert Jones : And then I guess just sticking with North America but moving over to pricing, ASPs were down a little more than we had expected at least. I\u2019m just curious how much leeway are you giving out there to the reps in the marketplace to drive some volume through pricing or through promotions? Tom Prescott : Well, put this clearly I\u2019ll let David come to ASPs specifics. We have series of program the reps have no attitude at deals or anything else. We have a very organized system of promotions we put in place usually a quarter or two in advance and those are fairly consistent and we have the advantage program which is the way we basically manage price. So there is no kind of field based management of this per say, I\u2019ll let David maybe talk about some mix and few other issues that contributed to some of that ASP, none of which in our mind is negative. David White : Rob, ASPs on a worldwide basis for the quarter were primarily influenced by foreign exchange so we continue to believe that as we treat more complex cases as our international business continues to grow we believe that our worldwide ASP should trend slightly up over the foreseeing future. Periodically we are going to see little volatility in that from quarter-to-quarter basis just depend upon how that mix land. This last quarter our international business is pretty flat quarter-to-quarter seasonally and so as a result our ASPs that we typically sell under here in North America influence that worldwide number a little bit more in what they would have otherwise. Robert Jones : Okay, so the North American then was orchestrated through some of the specific targeted promotional activity it sounds like. David White : We only disclose what the North America ASPs were so I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re backing into that. But we didn\u2019t do anything fundamentally to change ASPs here in North America during the quarter. Tom Prescott : If I can pile on for a second, if you think about that for minute we had great expansion in ortho and some kind of say new improving traction with GP. When we get more high volume doctors do more volume through the Advantage program, you\u2019re going to see a little that in ASP. There was also a little bit of mix on the Express side, Express shift, Express mix stayed steady but little more in Express 5. But in general nothing unusual going on and all the directions are good. Operator : Next question is from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Steve Beuchaw : First off, Joe, welcome to the call and thanks for taking the time to join. Joe Hogan : Thanks Steve. Steve Beuchaw : And Tom, in case this is my last opportunity, thanks for everything that you have done. Tom Prescott : Great, Steve it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you I\u2019m sure see you around. Steve Beuchaw : Hopefully in San Francisco in a few weeks? Tom Prescott : Absolutely, there you go. Steve Beuchaw : I guess I\u2019ll start with Tom and a question following up to the question on the Sirona relationship as we think about how that rolls out over the next year or so. I wonder what you are hearing thus far, whether it\u2019s from your planning team or from the field, about how customers might take advantage of the scanner. We know in the orthodontics channel that people who have iTero, they tend to do more cases. So how are you thinking about the impact on GP customers who might have an Omnicam but not an iTero? How could their utilization evolve and how does that play out over time? Tom Prescott : Well, it goes right to the point of why we are pursuing this open systems approach within our operability. One is channel have to be capable, each of our partners have had to go into investing into software and tuning their systems to work with what the very prescribed for Invisalign and the Omnicam has met that standard and they rollout their 1.1 software we\u2019ll be able to get cases. What we would expect is whether there are low volume Invisalign user today having to do impressions PBS impressions to sent it in, that are to be a positive. Very few GPs and especially a bigger office using CEREC for example is doing a huge amount of Invisalign because they\u2019ve got such busy practice already. So we\u2019re in addition to their practice we are not mean the main street part of their practice. This gives them an opportunity to me way more efficient to lower their cost and for the patient to be a whole lot happier. All of those things point to increase utilization. The result is never is significant as when you have a very high volume ortho that nearly switches over the scanners where it really removes friction, it\u2019s very visible. So it does give us a great hunting license to go earn a bigger share of mine and share of practice being in more relevant and that\u2019s the case whether it\u2019s iTero or that\u2019s the case whether it\u2019s definition 3M\u2019s True Definition, and it will be the case for Omnicam. So I think overtime our commitment is to work with each of these other players to ensure that we can deliver that great customers experience where patients are happy, docs are happy, we do that right we're going to get increased adoption growth in each of these accounts overtime. Steve Beuchaw : And then one for Joe, I don't think anyone can expect you to have much in the way of specifics for how you want to operate at Align at this point. But I wonder if you can reflect on your past experience with regard to building a business, a combination of organic growth and acquisitive growth, and maybe give us a sense for how you at least philosophically think about the balance there. If you have any preferences or criteria that you use to think about for capital allocation by M&A and how you think about share buybacks for a company like Align that is such a strong generator of cash? Thanks. Joe Hogan : I see that can read through your question and I've done a lot of M&A in my life and I'm sometimes labeled as an M&A person but I can tell you that I've only done that in the sense of looking at what organic growth is in different businesses I've been in and 10 to 1 I\u2019d rather grow organically than look at acquisitions. But every role that I've been in whether it was running businesses within GE or most recently ABB, I don't really come in with a playbook, I come in and just see what the company does well and where it might need help, assess the team and understand the team and the strength of that team and then figure out how to grow and how to operate well and so I don't really have a playbook in that sense I think that if you go back to my history and I know several people out there contacted some of my friends and different people which I appreciate you get an idea from them rather directly from me but indirectly from them how they felt about working with me or for me and hopefully you'll hear that. So honestly I come in here I see a team that has an incredible track record a tremendous leadership like Tom, a business that has incredible potential in a lot of ways, whether it's scale or through additional technology and some of the things that David and Tom just talked about and I look to see how we can enhance that and obviously as I start and look at the company I'll get out and see customers, meet as much the company as I can and then from there we'll figure out what we need to do to grow more and what makes more sense. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Lewis of ROTH Capital. Please proceed with your question. Chris Lewis : I just wanted to start on the gross margins. And I may have missed it but it looks like it came in about 300 basis points above your outlook. So can you elaborate on what drove the upside for gross margin during the quarter in the face of FX headwinds? And then as you look into the second quarter, what are the factors that are leading to your expectation for a sequential decline in gross margin in the second quarter? Tom Prescott : So one of the phenomena about our business has to do with the training events that go on from period-to-period and in periods when we have more training events than other periods our margins tend to fluctuate in the down direction or in the up direction, depends on whether those training events are increasing or decreasing. And so when you look from Q4 to Q1 the training events were down in Q1 and we\u2019re anticipating they're going to back up in Q2. And that certainly has some influence on it, when you look at the Q2 guidance part of it is foreign exchange rates have moved another five points on us since the last, well since Q1 average and so that has obviously some bearing on the margin guidance with we gave for Q2. David White : But Chris if I could add that we had increased volumes in the business, we had good performance of management of direct cost by the team, so we've seen where we put volume in this business it shows up in a variety of ways. Chris Lewis : And then in terms of the high teen volume growth outlook you provided on the last call, 17% year-over-year volume growth this quarter, 18% guided to the midpoint next quarter, can you just talk about how you're feeling you're tracking towards that high teen volume growth outlook at this point, given your already kind of there in the first and second quarter and you talked about further impact from the North American go to market approach on the back half of this year. Tom Prescott : David's the one providing the guidance I'll turn it over to him but I'll start by saying that all the elements we talked about that we tested during fiscal year '14 and pretty much had in place. We were getting good feedback and we said it was very early in the year at the end of January to see but we\u2019re getting good feedback from customers that they felt that coverage had improved, our responsiveness was improving, we were in better position to help them be successful in their practices I'd say the maturation of things like deep bite and some of the initiatives we've been working on for a while, all those things kind of start to come together with a great consumer program so pleased that there are innovation cycle, coverage and go-to-market adjustments around the world and now in North America a little more, and consumer programs kind of work together and again actually the back drop is reasonably healthy market but we've been reasonably comfortable that we're on the right track, again the tide can go out a little bit but I think we're going to do better than most, I'll David come back and comment specifically on the framework he provided for the year. David White : Yes, so Chris when we gave the framework back in January and so forth we had obviously a lot of lifting to do against the foreign exchange headwinds and so forth we had a lot of investments we were making to hopefully drive top line in not only the long term but certainly in the short term and you may recall in our comments I think we might even have mentioned something that effect here early in the call that we expect to see more of our growth coming in the second half of the year. Some of those investments we can take hold. So as we think about the year in totality we feel like we gotten up to a great start and sitting April feeling good about that but we also know we have a lot of works still got ahead of us to deliver the full year results that we give you the outlook on just couple of months ago. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good evening, guys, and welcome Joe and Tom. Hopefully I\u2019ll catch you in San Francisco in a couple weeks like some of the others. Tom Prescott : Perfect. Jeff Johnson : I wanted to start, Joe, you made a comment that some of us have been out there checking on you and one of the labels that gets put on you is maybe an M&A focus. One of the other labels, if I want to phrase it that way, is that you may be a very cost-conscious or cost-focused kind of guy as well. Maybe that stems obviously from your GE Healthcare days. But just in general, how do you think about costs? And you\u2019re running obviously the growth company a West Coast based growth company. Any comments you could make on that side of the story? Tom Prescott : Jeff, that\u2019s a really good question. In my career I have had to understand the operations and be part of operations or whatever. One of the reason I\u2019m here is because I love growth and I love businesses have potential to grow and obviously investment in growth is really important thing I think when you listen to Tom and David I smile because you can see good input and output ratio in the sense what investments are being made here and the consequential growth you can get in about very shorter period of time. And so it\u2019s hopefully you can see in the sense of the business that works and I like things that work in the business and what leadership pull and how things work. Secondly from a cost standpoint I am a guy who want to understand cost and make sure that we do make investments that they are good investments you just don\u2019t take that for granted and you also need to diligent around cost really understand where it\u2019s going in. And often from a portfolio standpoint you might want to make some move something from part of the business and other part so you actually growing more. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a liability at all that I understand operations and enjoy operations but look at in the sense of just from the standpoint of cost saving cost. It\u2019s just an allocation of capital and resources and where that best goes in the business in the point in time. Jeff Johnson : It does. Very helpful as well, thank you, David, one question for you and I\u2019ll take kind of maybe the opposite side of Bob\u2019s question earlier. On ASPs, the sequential decline of $35 was actually less than we were thinking it was going to be; the decline was less. So ASPs came in a bit above what we were thinking. And you said 90% of that was currency. When I look at the GP number, GP up 6.5% was a decently good number, better than it\u2019s been, but stacked comps still got a little slower. So I guess what I\u2019m trying to figure out is, you had a sizable Express 5 promotion in place this quarter. Has that just not generated the traction yet? Should we think about kind of the acceleration off that promotion kind of coming more in Q2 and I would assume that would then impact the ASPs a little bit more in 2Q over the 1Q as well? Tom Prescott : It\u2019s specifically Jeff regarding the Express promotion we implemented that in the middle of the quarter and then you have to recognize that it\u2019s going to take a while before doctors are going to get engage with that promotion it\u2019s going to take a while for them to get patients in the seat to get them to treatment planning. Get treatment planning approved. Fabricate the aligners et cetera. So we only saw a small impact of Express 5 really during Q1. We are continuing that promotion in the Q2. So to the extent that has some impact on ASPs we think it will be relatively modest and I\u2019d say the other thing is that objective with the Express 5 promotion is to drive adoption and we kind of view the Express 5 promotion as a way to increase the bonds that we would otherwise done as a company in any of that. So we see Express 5 promotion really as incremental. To the extent it was widely successful which we certainly hope for. That would have some impact on ASPs but we\u2019re not expecting it to be that meaningful. Jeff Johnson : Understood. Tom Prescott : If I add to that I\u2019ll point you back to what I said earlier, this is about really getting progress in regular adoption by the course customer group we want Orthos and GPs that have made a big part of their practice and when that happen they get a little better pricing. There is little more of our total volume going to advantage and we would expect the little bit of them move on ASP down. So that\u2019s a really good of that because we\u2019re most efficient covering those customers versus bringing a very low volume customer along with a very low leverage in the go-to market model. So we\u2019ve always been very willing to have that volume impact for fairly modest ASP decline. So that\u2019s in more mindset progress. Jeff Johnson : Yes. I got it. Not a criticism of the program at all. Just wanted to check when the impact would come down. Tom Prescott : Didn\u2019t take it that way just trying to be clear. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jon Block : I\u2019ll preface this by saying, trying to be clear not that I\u2019m complaining, but when the company [indiscernible] when you guys complete those case volumes in conjunction with Tom\u2019s retirement, if I remember correctly, that was at the very end of March. I think like the 25th or the 26th. And sort of the wording in that release would have implied around 127,000, 128,000 1Q cases. You did close t o 131. I mean the way your revenue model works, the quarter was closed back then. So I'm just asking, David, I guess this one's for you. Can you explain that discrepancy? And then Tom, as a function of that, maybe if you can comment on intra-quarter trends that you saw and more specifically how you exited March and April? Tom Prescott : I'm going to get in front of David for one reason, this was not a going away gift for me, this is the way the business evolves in trying to meet customer needs, it's really-really simple and the way the volume flowed through the quarter was pretty linear but it was just -- to meet our kind of, our standard requirements we wanted to get those cases out. We're not trying to micromanage that and again we had some work to do while we were coming out with this news on me, I'll let David talk. David White : I think the press release, I don't know the exact wording in it, Jon but I think it said we expected to be slightly above the high-end of our range and I guess you can define what slightly means but you know the only other alternative would have been to put a number out there and we just didn\u2019t feel that was the right thing to do but you know I think we gave you the best guidance we could in terms of the appropriateness of what we put in the press release before we're ready to close out the financials and talk about it a few weeks later. Jon Block : Fair enough and again, not that I'm complaining. Question two, if I can just have sort of a call it part A and part B. The first one, part A, David, longer-term, that 25% to 30% sort of three- to five-year op margin goal, should we think about that and normalize for FX? And I know you don't want that sort of a moving target and floating daily to currencies, but that should be down maybe 200 to 300 basis points from when you gave that last year at the analyst day. So should we think of that more 22% to 27%, or how should we flow that through our model? And then Tom, the B is I'm sort of trying end our interaction with a difficult question. On the Sirona deal, which still, in my opinion, came two years too late, but to dig deeper, why not make that exclusive and have something where you have a payment flowing from you guys to Sirona so when you fast-forward three years, they can't sign up a DENTSPLY or a Danaher and lock up that volume on Invisalign's platform. Thank you guys. David White : I think that's a four part question Jon, let me start first with the whole logic for being in open systems. Simply stated it's better for our customers. No one wants to have to redesign, start over, buy multiple pieces of equipment if they can have greatest utility from a scanner by the way, with this open systems we still sell more standalone scanner than anybody else, so we're doing pretty well even as we're opening up Invisalign which would be an advantage for our iTero team to sell our own scanner so we believe what we hear from our customers is they don't want to be forced to buy a system from you for the pleasure of offering Invisalign to their patients and other therapies we may have down the road, so we feel actually very strongly. To the point of paying Sirona this is really about value creation right for our customer, most buyers of scanners say they want to make sure the scanner can do a therapy like Invisalign so if anybody was going to pay it ought to be the other way around and to exclusivity we think that if everybody brings a different story to the market you know Sirona has a great product offering with the stored up dentistry, Patterson carries a lot of products, they're focused for that. There's no reason, we don\u2019t really directly compete with them there's no reason for us not to act in complementary ways because it's good for the customer, so in our minds we don't need to own the channel we don\u2019t to have exclusivity in fact we want probably more high quality scanners that can make it easier to do Invisalign and other chair side procedures that we have unique capability to fulfill. So I think, well I'd point to the opposite direction there's more benefit from giving a customer what they want at a lower cost and great utility over time than anything else. Jon Block : Fair enough and David can I get you to comment on the 3-5 year margin guidance? David White : So Jon our operating model that we\u2019ve been targeting and striving to achieve for some time, it's certainly influenced by a lot of variables, FX being just one of them, we still -- and I think we demonstrated the leverage we get out of our business model in the last year 2014 being the first year that we actually landed results inside that model. And so we do get leverage from growth and growth is the best strategy for growing out of the headwinds we're getting from FX. And so while those headwinds may set us back a little bit while we try and readjust our business and so forth, I think the great thing about our business is the fact that it's growing and as we continue to grow particularly on the international side we believe we can grow out of those currency headwinds so we don't see any reason to update our model, I think it's still, it\u2019s a long term model, it's still aspirational in some respects and we still feel pretty strongly about the potential of the business to grow into again even with the headwinds. Operator : Next question is from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Glen Santangelo : Thanks. Tom and David, last quarter, we spent a fair amount of time talking about some of the incremental investments that you plan to make around areas of sleep apnea, the new ERP system, some of the North American sales people. And at that time, you gave some pretty specific details around that and the potential impacts it might have on margin. Maybe could you give us a little bit of an update there, maybe give us a sense for maybe how much you might have spent in those areas this quarter and what you\u2019re forecasting to spend in the second quarter? Tom Prescott : Glen I don\u2019t know I really got an update for your I think when we gave the outlook for the year and as you see our first quarter results and our guidance for Q2 I think you can see the uplift in our operating expenses I think you can assume that most of that uplift has to do with new investments. We talk about sleep apnea in Q1. We talked about the investments in the sales force in go-to-market coverage et cetera. Those investments are all P&L investments. So I think it\u2019s pretty transparent when you look at our Q1 results and our guidance that those investments are proceedings as we indicated and I think they will continue to proceed throughout the balance of the year as we continue to plant seeds for the future direction and the growth of business. Glen Santangelo : Okay. That\u2019s fine. Maybe if I can just ask Joe a question. Joe, it kind of sounds like you\u2019re excited about a bunch of the opportunities that you see, but what one of the issues that\u2019s been on investors\u2019 minds is around intellectual property and the expiration of some of the patents in 2017 and 2018. And so I\u2019m kind of curious. Could you maybe share with us how much due diligence you did around this IP issue, and how maybe you got comfortable with this issue when considering taking the position? Tom Prescott : Glen it\u2019s a good question honestly my due diligence was almost with a huge receive from Top and rest of the team and looking at what\u2019s going on. If you look at the R&D investment the number of patterns and -- if you look at the sequential technology capability that Align is really shown to these investments starting with relatively simple kind of liners through the years becoming more and more capable of doing more difficult cases I think shows that overall the initial exploration was patterns in two years forward, just more through this in just a couple of patterns coming off respect to this success here almost been done. So obviously, in my life, I have been associated with lot IP particularly with GE Medical and GE Healthcare. I understand the impact of customer preference also market channeling, skill, all of those things as it relates to IP2. When I look at Align I see there is much more going on here than just a pattern coming off over the next couple years and this sets the momentum with the opportunities to -- that\u2019s not in the gate what that might need from the competitive standpoint that everyone has competition, competition should make you better and company should be able to respond in that too and I think Align has shown that they can do that. As I take over for Tom and we work as a team. We\u2019ll continue to focus on customers. We\u2019ll continue to invest in R&D. We continue to scale globally and I think that\u2019s going to help that whole equation a lot. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Thanks for the comments. Tom Prescott : Thanks Glen. Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question please. Operator : Yes, that question will be coming from the line of Jeffrey Matthews at Ram Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Jeffrey Matthews : Hi. Can you hear me? Tom Prescott : Hi Jeff, yes. Jeffrey Matthews : Hi. Joe, I just want to say I look forward to meeting you. My old pal Nat Kingman speaks very highly of you. And Tom, I don\u2019t want to offend any of the sports fans on the call, but I feel like I did when Mariano Rivera retired from the Yankees. Very sad, but very appreciative of his track record and I just want to say congratulations and great good luck. You deserve all good things. Tom Prescott : Very nice of you to say, I appreciate it. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you every one for joining us. That concludes our conference call today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and industry meetings. If you have any follow up questions please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure for me to be here today reporting my first quarter with Align. On our call today, I will provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments; Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanner & Services. Dave will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Our second quarter results were good driven by strong Invisalign case volume up 10.5% sequentially and 21% year-over-year with growth across all customer channels and geographies. North America volumes grew 17% year-over-year and our international geographies were up 30% compared to last year. Revenue was near the high-end of our guidance reflecting better than expected volumes offset somewhat by lower ASPs. On a constant currency basis total Q2 revenues were up 14.2% year-over-year and Clear Aligner revenues were up 17.5% year-over-year. In North America, Invisalign volume is driven by growth on both ortho and GP customers. We had another record quarter for North American ortho. Utilization was an increase to 9.5 cases per doctor. North American GP dentist utilization grew slightly to 3 cases per doctor in conjunction with the significant increase in the base of our GP dentist customers. We trained about 1000 doctors during Q2, one of our highest training quarters ever and have more active GPs than ever. I will share a few highlights for North America. We are continuing to implement our sales expansion program and are making progress. Our new approach to customer segmentation and partnering with our customers, practices has been received very positively by our doctors including the addition of our strategic account manager role for a high volume and multi-office customers. The increase in sales reps has increased doctor touch points in both numbers and frequency. Our Invisalign Express 5 promotion was well-received by customers and resulted in a better than expected uptake in volume and mix shift to entry level product this quarter. In Q3, we adjusted the E5 promotions to support the launch of our new single arch Aligners offering. Invisalign volumes for international doctors continue to be strong for both EMEA and Asia Pacific reflecting ongoing adoption and expansion of our customer base. We had record volume in most every major country in Europe as well as China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Taiwan. A few highlights from EMEA, 27% year-over-year shipment growth driven by continued strong growth in Spain, France, U.K. and Italy. Our performance has been driven by a significant increase in utilization up 1.6 cases per doctor following the recent launches of Invisalign G5 and G6 as well as ClinCheck Pro. We continue to benefit strongly from our focus sales approach in each of our markets as well as from our newly integrated markets in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, which are showing very good growth. A few highlights for Asia Pacific, 39% year-over-year shipment growth driven by China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Taiwan, which is now a direct sales country for us. We ran a very successful Invisalign form in China with over 400 doctors from the private sector supporting our drive for broader penetration of the market. China is now our largest Invisalign market in Asia Pacific. In the important teen segment, the total number of Invisalign cases in Q2 increased 18% year-over-year reflecting a good start to the teen orthodontic season. We are looking forward to a busy summer especially in the North American ortho channel where teenage cases were up 22% year-over-year in Q2. Product innovation aims to create greater doctor preference for Invisalign by delivering new features and functionality to help doctors treat more patients and more complex cases with Invisalign. We continue to make progress with the launch of our Invisalign G6 that's our solution for the First Premolar Extraction cases. Early signs are very promising around adoption of Invisalign G6, which is very important for the complex treatment needs in Asia and ClinCheck Pro, which has now been adopted by over 60% of our customers since its launch earlier this year. In Q2, our Scanner & Services business revenues were down sequentially as expected given the launch. Not yet available our next generation iTero Element scanner, interest and demand for our new scanner has been very strong and we expect upcoming availability in shipping of the scanner in Q3 to help resume top-line growth. We first previewed the iTero Element at the IDS show in Germany this past March. Then at the AAO in San Francisco in May and at our recent Invisalign GP summit in Las Vegas earlier this month. I have seen the iTero Element in action and the enthusiasm from our customers piloting is contagious. Let me give you an example of how different the scanner is. At the GP summit, we had a scanning competition among practice stuff where they competed for the fastest scan time. The winning time was 2 minutes and 16 seconds and all finalists were under 3 minutes that's a big game changer in terms of efficiency of a patient appointment in the practice. Immediately after the contest was over doctors placed orders for 35 scanners in total this summer, we took orders from more than 100 new iTero Element scanners all attendees left the summit with a clear vision of what the future of iTero Element can offer and highly motivated about what it can do in their practice. For Q2, total orders for iTero Element were about 700 scanners, 2x higher than total scanner orders a year ago. While this is my first Invisalign summit, our broader team and many of our attendees have remarked that it was the best GP summit ever in terms of doctor participation, energy, excitement and commitment to do more. Many doctors expressed the recognition of our North American go-to-market changes with a number of sales reps and the quality of the call and they also recognized recent improvements to customer experience. Our teen message of Invisalign its everyday dentistry really resonated with them and they are beginning to see beyond just straightening teeth with the continuum of oral care and patient health with us. Consumer interest in Invisalign brand continue to be strong in Q2 with over 1.3 million unique visitors to Invisalign.com doctor locators searches were up 26% year-over-year. And consumer request for more information up 27% year-over-year in North America. We also saw increased awareness with over 534,000 people visiting EMEA Web sites in Q2 and 157,000 of them searching for an Invisalign provider and 3x growth in the Invisalign social media community over the last year and a half. Before I turn it over to David, I would like to share some of my initial observations and areas of focus over the next few months. I expect the past six out of eight weeks visiting our key locations in North America, EMEA and Israel. And I feel like I'm ramping up pretty quickly. The changes in our North American sales organization were absolutely needed. I like to relate that resources have been aligned and how we have sub-segmented the ortho and GP customers. In the second half, we will build out our North American team even further with the addition of an inside sales program to further support customers particularly newly trained and lower volume doctors. Invisalign is not just a simple piece of plastic, I can't stress that enough. Our stereolithography manufacturing process which creates 150,000 aligners each day, each one being unique along with our treatment planning technology represents one of the most automated processes I have ever seen. Together these capabilities deliver very compelling treatment planning and manufacturing process that predictively moves teeth. Align has build a huge amount of accumulated know-how and IP that make me feel very confident of our competitive position going forward. International has experienced more direct competition in certain markets in North America. We have proven, we can be effective in diverse markets and maintain ASPs net of foreign exchange. I'm impressed with our company and the progress we continue to make globally, international growth and expansion has been tremendous and is the biggest opportunity for us as we go forward. For that reason today we're now seeing changes to better support regional growth and priorities and to extend best practices across the company. Raphael Pascaud has done a terrific job leading the international organization and has delivered geographic expansion, adoption and best practice across EMEA and APAC. He is now going to focus his attention and skills on our global marketing and business development efforts. With this change all three sales regions, North America, EMEA and APAC will now report directly to me. My experience tells me that this is the best way to stay in touch with the pulse of the business and to provide the inside direction each region needs to continue to grow. Finally, a focus on customers is not new to Align, or to most global companies, most successful organizations have recognized the strategic value by having a customer centric focus has on growth and value creation. One of the key metrics used for measuring customer experience is Net Promoter Score or NPS. There is a high correlation between NPS and growth, both in terms of revenue and profitability. I introduced NPS in GE Healthcare and also ABB, so I'm pleased to see it at Align. We began our customer experience initiatives several years ago and we are committed delivering a better customer experience for our doctors and their patients. Our goal is to continue to improve how customers experience our products and services. Our businesses, processes and interactions with them in the Invisalign and iTero brands. Over the past two years, we've made improvements in each of these areas and as a result our key customer experience measure for success are Net Promoter Score or NPS has continued to rise. Our promoters do two extra cases of our detractors and we believe that improving our customer experience and NPS will further increase volume over time. To that end I'm pleased to announce that we recently implemented a new policy than we're closely to align to our business with the way our customers manage their practices and treat patients. The new policy is called Additional Aligners at no charge and it addressed our number one complaint from customers. We've historically charged customers for additional aligners ordered to be on both covered by the initial treatment plan. With this policy, Align will no longer distinguish between mid-course corrections and case refinements and will allow doctors to order additional aligners to address either treatment need at no charge. We expect this now policy will result in significant improvement in customer satisfaction and loyalty which we believe will help and increase Invisalign utilization and volume over time. David will walk you through the details of the new policy and the impact on our deferred revenues. And with that I'll now turn it over to David for a review of our Q2 financial results. David White : Thanks Joe. Let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was $209.5 million up 5.8% from the prior quarter and up 8.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis consolidated world wider revenues were up 1.42% year-over-year. Second quarter Clear Aligner revenue up $200.8 million was up 7.4% sequentially and 11.7% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis Clear Aligners revenues were up 17.5% year-over-year. The sequential revenue growth reflected higher volumes across all of our major geographies and channels offset by lower worldwide ASPs. Q2 ASPs were down sequentially about $35 which is primarily due to higher promotional discounts, higher revenue deferrals as we treat more complex cases and foreign exchange. These costs were only partially mitigated by a price increase we implemented in North America, while that price increase took effect April 1, 2015 it only had a partial impact on the quarter as we work through orders placed at the older price. The largest promotional impact on ASP was related to a new staff Aligner promotion launched in North America in February. This promotion allows active Invisalign trained doctors, who met certain criteria to treat one staff member per year at a reduced price. The promotion is intended to increase practice utilization especially among low volume customers as staff members experienced first hand an Invisalign treatment and have opportunity to share their experience with their patients. We ran a similar program across EMEA last year albeit on a much smaller scale. While it's still very early in terms of this promotion that group participating EMEA doctors has grown 10% faster than non-participating doctors. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels partially offset by lower ASPs primarily ready to foreign exchange rates and higher revenue deferrals as just mentioned. For the second quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 144.6000 cases were up 10.6% sequentially reflecting growth from our international and North American customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 21.2% reflecting continued strength in international as well as growth from our North America orthodontists and to a lesser extent our North American GP dentists. For North American orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign cases were up 7.9% sequentially and up 21.6% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists case volume was up 11.1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 13.3% sequentially and 30.4% year-over-year. Q2 marks the 7th consecutive quarter of greater than 25% growth from our international region. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q2 was 4.6 cases per doctor up slightly from 4.4 in Q2 last year. In North America ortho utilization of 9.5 was a new record increasing from 8.4 in the prior year. In North America GP utilization of 3.0 was up slightly from 2.9 in the prior year. And international doctor utilization of 4.6 was up slightly from 4.5 in the prior year. In Q2, we added 2555 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1120 of which were new North American doctors and 1335 of which were new international doctors. Our Scanner & Services segment was down sequentially as expected due primarily to the announcement of our next generation iTero Element Intraoral scanner in March. Second quarter revenue of $8.7 million equates to 21.6% sequentially and 32.2% year-over-year reflecting reduced pricing for the current iTero scanner as well as lower scanner volumes as some customers delayed purchase decisions and many others ordered our new iTero element which is expected to comment shipping in North America in the third quarter. Moving on to gross margin; second quarter overall gross margin was 75.7% down sequentially 0.6 points and up 0.1 point year-over-year. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 78.3% down 0.8 points sequentially and down 0.5 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily the result of lower ASPs as previously discussed and increased training events which are only marginally profitable. Q2 gross margin for our scanner segment was 15% down 13.3 points sequentially and down 14.5 points year-over-year both as a result of lower volumes and pricing on our iTero 2.9 scanner. Q2 operating expenses were $116.3 million up sequentially by $14.1 million. This quarter-over-quarter increase reflects the impact of two items; first, Q1 operating expenses included a $6.8 million benefit for the refund of medical device exercise taxes paid in 2013; and secondly, increased spending of $7.3 million related to sales force expansion and other investments. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 operating expenses were up $19.6 million which relates primarily to similar investments and our ERP implementation project which were partially offset by the benefit from foreign exchange rates. Also recall that Q2 2014 benefited from a medical device excess tax refund \u2013 excise tax refund of $1.2 million. Our second quarter operating margin was 20.2% down 4.5 points sequentially and down 5.1 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to the medical device excise tax benefit recorded in the first quarter which contributed 3.4 points. The balance of the sequential decrease was approximately split equally between lower gross margins and higher operating expenses. The year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of investment in the business related to sales expansion, R&D and ERP as well as foreign exchange rates. With regard to our second quarter tax provision our tax rate was 26.2% up 2.4 points from our Q1 tax rate. This is primarily due to a higher percentage of certain non-deductible expenses, second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.39 compared to $0.44 in Q1 and $0.43 reported in the same quarter last year. Altogether, the year-over-year impact from foreign exchange as resulted in stronger U.S. dollar including the decline on revenues, the benefit on our non-U.S. dollar operating expenses together with currency exchange losses reported in other income and expense was $0.03 per share. Moving on the balance sheet; capital expenditures for the second quarter were $10.5 million primarily relating to manufacturing equipment and fit up cost or a second manufacturing facility in Juarez, Mexico for additional capacity as well as additional cost capitalized on our ERP project. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $52.9 million and free cash flow for the second quarter defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $52.4 million. During the second quarter, we paid out $70 million under an accelerated stock repurchase plan in which we received an initial delivery of approximately 824 shares of our common stock. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long-term investments were $596.7 million. This compared to $602.6 million at the end of 2014 a decrease of approximately $5.9 million. With that, let's now turn to our business outlook for the third quarter and the factors that did form our view. Starting with the demand outlook, we are pleased with our business especially continued growth from our international regions in progress in North America. For North America most teen case starts occur in the summer months and we expect to have a busy teen season with orthos in Q3. And virtually, Q3 is typically a seasonally slower quarter for our North American GPs. While we've made progress in North America with both orthos and GPs and expect to see some benefit from our investments in sales force expansion consistent with historical, seasonal trends we are expecting North America volumes to be down slightly quarter-over-quarter. In our international markets, our European doctors typically spend fewer days in the office due to summer vacations and extended holidays. China which has now become the largest Invisalign market in Asia Pacific region is beginning to offset some of the seasonality we typically experienced in the Southern European countries. Notwithstanding this factor, however, we anticipate Invisalign international Invisalign case shipments to be down to flat sequentially from Q2. We expect our Scanner & Services business to be up sequentially with commercial availability of our new iTero element commencing in Q3. Before I turn to our outlook for Q3, I want to provide you with a financial implications of our new additional Aligner policy beginning in Q3. These changes applied to all new Invisalign whole team and assisted products \u2013 our full product group ship worldwide after July 18, 2015 as well as any open Invisalign whole team or assist cases started prior to this product policy change. As a result, beginning in Q3 2015, our deferrals will increase as will now recognize lower revenue as a result of providing these additional aligners at no charge and the grandfathering of over 1 million open cases. The effect on our future revenues is two-fold. The first is an increase in the amount we defer for each new case we ship. The second impact is that revenue recognized on each additional aligner shipment will be lower than the amount we have historically recognized until these grandfathered cases complete. The revenue recognized for each additional aligner shipment however will not offset the higher deferrals for new cases for at least two years. As a result, we expect Invisalign Clear Aligner net revenues for Q3 2015 and Q4 2015 to be lower as a result of this change by approximately $6 million to $7 million and $7 million to $8 million respectively. One should note that we increased Invisalign prices in North America in Q2 and internationally in Q3 this year. While these price increases largely offset the economic cost of this policy change and you not adequately cover the increase in deferred revenues due to grandfathered cases. While this policy change will slightly impact build revenue because we will no longer charge for the additional aligners the change is immaterial to our cash flows. And as Joe mentioned this new policy is very customer friendly and we believe it will drive further adoption of Invisalign and increased volumes. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 141.8 to 144.3000 cases up approximately 18.5% to 20.6% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q3 net revenues to be in the range of $201.4 million to $205.7 million. On a comparative basis using constant currencies and normalizing for the impact on revenue of our new additional aligner policy our Q3 revenue growth for Clear Aligners would be 13.9% to 16.5% when compared to the same quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 74.5% to 75.1% down only slightly quarter-to-quarter primarily as a result of additional aligner policy change and a higher mix of iTero Scanner business. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $119.5 million to $120.9 million a sequential increase in operating expense reflects further investments to support our continued international growth and expansion. One-time cost of approximately $2 million primarily associated with severance cost for the organizational changes we announced early today. Our operating margin should be in the range of 15.1% to 16.4%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $81.2 million. Taken together we expect diluted EPS to be in a range of $0.28 to $0.31. Recognizing that there a lot of moving parts let me summarize how we see the year shaping up with these impacts included. First of all, from a volume standpoint we see year-over-year Invisalign growth at to slightly above the midpoint of our 15% to 25% long-term model for revenue. Our North America and international businesses are both responding to investments we've made and we believe that will respond to continued investment within our significant under penetration of the market. As for revenue, however, 2015 has been impact by significant currency movement when compared to last year. We've seen further weakening of the euro and other currencies since we first gave our 2015 preview during our Q4 earnings call in January. On top of this impact our new additional aligner policy will impact 2015 revenue by approximately $13 to $15 million. We believe the added volumes we're seeing, however, will largely offset both of these factors. As such on a net all in basis we believe our 2015 revenue growth will still be somewhere in the low double digit range consistent with our comments in January and notwithstanding these impacts. From an operating margin stand point, the incremental impact from FX, the impact from the new additional aligner policy as well as a one-point impact from higher cost with ERP will also be to some extent offset by higher volumes. As a result we believe our 2015 operating margins will be on the order of 4 to 5 points below those reported in 2014. This too is largely consistent with our comments back in January. Not withstanding these moving parts 2015 is shaping up well and our underlying demand for Invisalign remains very good. With that, I'll turn the time back to Joe. Joe Hogan : Thanks, David. Overall, I'm pleased with the Q2 volume growth and continued strength in our international business. We're making progress and we have a lot of positive momentum. On top of my priorities for the first few months is to get direct feedback from our customers and gain insight into their practices and understand how they can better serve their needs. Still coming up to speed on many things after spending the last several weeks on the road, meeting with customers and employees I believe that I have a good understanding of our business and believe that we have many of the key drivers to further our success. As we scale our business, international is key driver of that growth, the best person to create a unified marketing strategy for the company that leverages opportunities, resources and best practices globally is Raphael. He understands our business and customer dynamics and international markets and will quickly get up to speed in North America. He also has a real passion for improving customer experience as inline with the goals of our company. In summary, we're making positive and forward looking changes for the company. We just reported a solid quarter of growth and we're making measurable progress and improving our customer experience worldwide. We talk about our opportunities because we have a lot of them, simplifying and unifying our sales and marketing across all regions is an important part of seeing and seizing these opportunities while delivering the best products and experiences for our customers and their patients. I'm confident that these changes will help accelerate our progress and continued success. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to meeting our shareholders and analysts over the coming month. With that, I'll now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Jones : Thanks for the questions and welcome Joe. Just a couple of questions on the case growth for the year. It looks like you're seeing, we should expect case growth in about 20% range based on what you've done year-to-date as well as the 3Q guide, it looks like for 4Q you're actually planning on quite a bit of acceleration -- by my math well north of 20%. I'm just curious A, is that the right way to think about how you guys are seeing the back half on a case growth basis and then two, is there anything that gives you greater visibility into 4Q relative to where we are in the year today? Joe Hogan : Hi, Robert. First of all, your assessment is correct in a sense we're looking at a pretty big outlook in the second quarter versus the first half. There is positive momentum we talked about in the case growth side you could see that, you could see international is very strong. You could see that the ortho side in the United States has been strong too. As far as the clarity of it, it's based -- on that momentum some historical presence that we have. And also relying on the investments we've made particularly in North American market internationally for increased resources to help you drive that. Robert Jones : That makes sense and then I guess David if I could just follow up on the policy change, anything you can share on what you'd expect the eventual increase to be, I'm just trying to get a sense of how big of a barrier to growth had this been that you guys obviously felt the need to put in place this new policy? David White : Well, see if I can answer a couple of ways here. When we looked and pulled customers as to their Invisalign experience and how we can improve upon that experience this particular policy change has been the number one item they've asked for. When we look at those customers who are promoters and we compare their growth rates against detractors, we know that whenever we can move a customer who is a detractor or even a passive into a position where they are a promoter, we see significant up tick in volumes as a result. So the policy change is related to that and trying to see if we can capture additional opportunities to prove they're growing the company. And the unfortunate consequence of it is that it requires us to change our deferral and the estimates that we use for deferrals. And so when we look, when we kind of measure our results going forward the year-over-year comparisons are going to be a little tough to make year-over-year until that kind of normalizes out and that will take -- that will take at least one year for the year-over-year comps to normalize out and then probably a couple of years before all those grandfathered cases work them out and when we actually get back to a more normalized operating model. Robert Jones : That's helpful. Thanks. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Bob. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, and thanks for taking the questions everyone. First, my first question is actually on the experience you've had Joe as you've been out talking to customers over the last, I don't know if its six months or so. One of the things that I've heard from customers that I thought you might want to touch on here and not necessarily the initial days but within your first 12 to 18 months, how the company things about using data and how about company things about interacting with the consumer and also the patient. I wonder as you look at how in the company has positioned itself with social media and outreach another company has used information that it is obtained from customers let's say visiting the Web site. What do you thinking about how you are going to use that data more powerfully going forward? And then I have a follow-up. JoeHogan: Steve, I have been impressed since I have been here. Look, my experience has always been to be B2B businesses and obviously, we have both here. I call B2B is moving into the ortho or dentistry side and B2C is what we are doing to consumers. If I look at work on consumers, I see it's very well balanced I think in a sense of using social media using print media and there is a lot of experience here over the years in the sense of what's effective and what's not effective in essence and spend. I'm amazed we could see the statistics I referenced in the opening in the sense of the 27% increase overall in Web business the conversation of Web business into actual unit going on the doc locator. So I feel good about that and I hoping answering your question, secondly, when I see customers, I get two comments all the time. One is, I don't like where I am on doc locator, okay? And that means a lot to me, that means they watch that, it means a whole lot they know generating demand for them. And really the best businesses I have ever been in is when we had customers that looked at the business for demand generation and our customers certainly do that and we do that to our consumer efforts. Secondly, the question that I heard about were the issues on Aligners and having mid-course corrections or whatever. I know it's another thing we want to emphasize in a sense of our customer MPS growth that was really the number one reason and I almost never got out of a doctors office without that being mentioned. So we are trying to improve that customer experience both in consumer standpoint and also B2B standpoint and from what I have seen, I think we are making great strides here over the last year. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Then my follow-up is related to volume growth. So you guys are taking the volume growth expectations to essentially 20% or better I think that figure previously was somewhat lower say north of 15% but less than 20%. I mean if you have to pick one thing that you have seen incrementally to get you more comfortable with the outlook what might that be and as a corollary to that, can you comment on not necessarily for 2015, but how you think about let's say over the next year the interoperability arrangement that you have with Sirona contributing to the growth story? Thanks so much. Joe Hogan : Steve, I will let David answer that I think he can be more specific than I can with this point. David White : Yes. Steve, I think as we look at \u2013 we look at our first quarter performance and we look at our second quarter performance and we measure that against historical patterns here in the company, second quarter and particular we began to see a significant divergence between year-over-year case volume growth and what we have experienced historically when we look at Q2 over Q2 and 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, we are seeing a gap widening there. And that gap is partly what is giving us confidence that we are going to see a stronger second half. So that's the analytical side of it. And it's clearly more behind that. But, at the highest level that's probably the analytical side of it. But on the other piece of it, which is more qualitative is the fact that we have been doing this for a long time in terms of making investments in our go to market coverage, geographies we are expanding into and so forth. And what we know is that when we invest in directly and go to market, we see a response. And we made the largest step up in investment, I think in the history of the company starting in January and particularly targeted North America. But not discriminating against the international side of it as well. And we are seeing a response to that. And so we are trying to invest into it and keep the growth of the company moving forward and testing just how we continue to grow the markets and invest and what works and what doesn't. We try different promotions. And all these things play together collectively to tell us that we are seeing some traction. On the Sirona question, while we qualified the scanner, their software updates are still going through testing at this point in time and final qualification. It's supposed to be released later this year, I don't know what the specific date is. You might have to find something on their Web site in that regard from them. But, it's moving forward, but when you look at the up lift, I think we talked about this perhaps in another analyst meeting or earnings call, is the fact when you looked at where most of their install base is particularly on the scanner that we are qualifying most of it is overseas, a lot of it is in GP practice, most of our effort internationally is on the ortho side. So what we think is important and why we think it will play to our strategy of continuing to become more relevant the GP practice, we don't see it creating an immediate type of uplift in our business. And we think it's going to be longer journey before we will actually see a blip in the radar on it. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks for all the color guys. Shirley Stacy : You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel Nicolaus. Jon Block : Great. Thanks. And good afternoon guys. Joe maybe the first one for you. In EMEA you guys have reaccelerated the growth and pretty handling, you caught markets like Spain, France, Italy, I mean not really the strongest collection of economies in. I know slightly lower penetration over there, but can you talk to what's allowed the reacceleration the 25% to 30% growth maybe if you can address the sustainability of that number one? And number two, is there anything you are doing differently over there? I mean any secret sauce and how you are attacking those markets that arguably could be transferable to the North American market. Joe Hogan : Jon good question. I went to Israel in the first couple of weeks I was here to check out the scanner and then up to Amsterdam to really visit some customers and to do some reviews for the team. And I would say, it's funny how Europe is, since individual countries as you know, with different economies and there is different drivers in those industries. And what Ralph and the team have done, they have done a terrific job of being able to figure out in which one of those countries certain formulas actually work for penetration. And even in countries as pressured as Spain which is a great example that drove an incredible amount of penetration in a relatively short amount of time. By actually concentrating resources in a certain ways on those customers to bring them up the speed quickly to make them effective and they can confident in a sense of \u2013 we can move teeth and we can move in predictably. And it also creates a \u2013 that success creates others wanting to have that success too. In the U.K. on the other hand it hasn't the fairly been an orthodontic push as much as GP. And it's a different formula to go after GP in the U.K also. So Jon just in the time that we have here, I would say we have learned a lot there, Raphael and the team have applied it well. And there is some things honestly we can translate back in North America that can help our records here as we target a different market segments. Jon Block : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And just a follow up maybe Joe, if you can touch on why now for the additional Aligners at no charge, I mean, what you are hearing from the field, why is the proper time now. And then David to your earlier remarks, I mean obviously people don't want to pay extra, I get it, but what's interesting here is that the same time you are also hitting them with a list in the increase price yet. You say you are increasing the goodwill. So can you talk about those dynamics I guess? What do they want? They want predictability, they are willing to pay a little bit more unless but sort of be assured that they are not going to have additional out of pocket expenses as the case progresses, if you can talk to those dynamics. Thanks guys. Joe Hogan : Jon let me start off. Then I will turn it over to David because David has more experience than in this two. I think as you get into the business and you look at this again, the customer calls and stuff I have made just initially, you hear about this additional aligner thing, it's incredible [year to our] [ph] customer base. And it's a lot of reason but it creates uncertainty. And I think we are working with doctors; doctors want more certainty and patients want more certainty. And we feel like this \u2013 gives them that kind of control, or feeling what that certainty is. And so I think this is much subjective as it is objective. It's something it's been around a long time. And as I talk to the Align personnel too \u2013 many of them say we should have done this years' ago because we know what the issue is and really haven't addressed it. It wasn't till MPS correcting came in. And we could really weigh what that's meant to our business. But, I think it gave us the determination to take the next steps and to make change. David -- David White : I just had one comment to your question about why now? What's \u2013 it is a decision that we made but obviously but it isn't one that we made over night or made recently. The actual mechanisms and so forth put into motion on this actually started on it few years ago. And as you can imagine, there is a fair amount of infrastructure in the company, it may sound like a simple change. But, there are a number of nuances associated with it that it required IT development efforts and so forth and other changes that have taken us some while to build, to test and to launch. And so it isn't a decision that's been made over night, it's been working for long time. As it relates to the things that customers are trying to avoid and you mentioned about the price increase and so forth we've had a practice of raising prices modestly every couple of years and typically North America and international have been kind of a little bit out of sync on that because we weren't doing necessarily at the same time. But we felt that we were creating value here for the doctors and their patients that you help substantiate the timing for the price increase as well which is roughly two years since our last price increases. And in terms of things we're trying to avoid you hear -- George comments you hear comments from doctors about they have a patient that has gone off to school -- in the middle of treatment and they get behind and they come back at Thanksgiving and doctors start -- use to start worrying on the policy about that them coming to the end of the runway when they wouldn't -- and then they have to start paying for it and so that put urgencies on their part and so lots of things -- lots of different kinds of personal circumstances could come up in the lives of the patients that our policy didn't particularly respond very well to. And the interesting thing about it is the way the doctors treat their patients they quote the patient a price at the beginning of the treatment and their expectation and then the patient's expectation is that's the price and if it take a -- when you look at wires and brackets if it winds up taking a little bit longer to treat, well, it's still one price and yet in our case it will not have taken a little bit longer to treat they ran into the risk that the cost of the doctor would potentially go up and so this just tends to align our -- as Joe commented in his prepared remarks, it just aligns our business practice to the way our doctors practice with the patient. Joe Hogan : And Jon, I had one more thing on the price question too is, we put a lot of technology in the market over the last few years and we think about G4, G5 and now G6, we need a certain amount of payback for that investment also and so there is kind of price increases reporting value in a market place and to emphasize what David said we look at, we're creating value for customers and we feel that we should paid for that also and that's part of the thought process in the price increase. Jon Block : Perfect. Thank you guys. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Jon. Next question. Operator : Our next question is from John Kreger from William Blair. John Kreger : Great, thanks very much. David, may be could you just give us a little bit more numbers on the new strategy around additional alignments -- aligners can you talk about what's the percentage of cases that actually end up ordering it and how many are we talking about and any numbers you could give us there? David White : Well we don't typically disclose what percentage of cases require refinements. It is varied when you actually kind of dig down into it it's varied by geography. We see more case refinements and so forth internationally what we do domestically. Some of that is driven by the fact that they are treating more complex cases in some of those geographies. And particularly when we get to APAC we see that. And so as we've looked at the incidence you might say of refinement and so forth, our trend has been -- it has been going up over time and it seems to correlate very closely with the degree and complexity of the cases that we're beginning to treat. And so those are the kind of the trend lines and this policy will just simply make it easier for the doctors to do that without creating additional friction for doing what's right for the patients. John Kreger : Great, thanks. And then as a follow-up Joe, you said I know you've spent a lot of your initial days talking to customers. Beyond their experience with Invisalign what else are they telling, just curious how are they feeling about their practice, is their business getting better or worse given the economy and are you seeing any interesting changes on the competitive front kind of in the lower complexity end of your market. Joe Hogan : John, I think its right inline with what I think the statistics you see in dental market right now. Most of the people out there are experiencing growth year-over-year and it looks like it's this year looks very strong, the strongest year they've had. So overall, I mean there is difference between the primary care side and the ortho side, but both of them are reporting, it's really a pretty good business environment now is mostly [indiscernible] is going through. As far as what customers are thinking and talking about also from an Align standpoint and how we interface with them is its -- often when you talk to them I am asking a lot of the detailed questions about customers and how the technology works and what's happened over the years. And you see a lot of enthusiasm for the product. I think not being here three or four years ago, I think there is a lot of skepticism in the marketplace if we can move teeth predictably and then finish case as well. You see many of the doctors I talked to, in fact, all of them, none of them doubt that we can do the things we're doing they get excited about new products like G5 and G6 and the complexity cases that David talked about too. So overall, these have been good conversations outside of some areas of that we need to address like we just have from a customer engagement standpoint and customer satisfaction standpoint, but in that a pretty good marketplace and a lot of people feeling good about Align and our technology. John Kreger : Great, thank you. Shirley Stacy : Shawn, next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Joe, just wanted to ask you on the extra aligners or the additional aligners policy. How much of that is may be going after some competitive accounts as well? I know when we go out and talk to some docs we use may be one or two of your other competitors especially one that you've had some legal issues here, what's recently we hear that's one of those things some docs do like about their policy. Does this -- is this done at all the kind of target that?  And then a follow-up there is just you make some personal changes here, you're addressing a primary customer concern is kind of your first two moves that we're seeing publicly anyway anything else I wouldn't expect that you announce a third change here or something on this call, but there are other changes that we should expect to see out of you here in the next three to six months or these kind of the first two big moves that we should expect for the near term? Joe Hogan : I'll just answer your last question first, these are the biggest moves I plan to make any time, I can see, I think these are the ones that kind of obvious in the sense that we have to address. From a competition standpoint is, there is not a competitor out there strong enough right now that really force our hand on the additional aligners play. I mean just like the fact is, there is a lot of different dimensions we compete with them both in the United States and internationally that didn't force our hand. Really it's a relationship with our customers, that's what we felt was the right thing to do to address that. It's not saying that five or six years down the road there might have been a different situation, but that wasn't a drive of our decision. As far as competition goes over all, our competition right now is in the lower end of the segment as you know its in the E5, E10 those kinds of easy cases that are out there. It's not forcing us to make any real competitive moves in the sense of addressing that right now in the marketplace but we -- we're very aware of it, we see it overseas as well in the United States, we know over the next couple of years that will increase, but that's not a specific part of our portfolio, it's the easier part of the portfolio, it's not in the G3, G4, G5 and obviously G6 areas, it's smaller movement of teeth. I think the last thing I mentioned is that kind of fell apart or wasn't accentuated a lot in our announcement was the lower arch that we just came out with and we positioned out with the E5 form a pricing stand point too. This is something customers have asked for years if they just -- want to buy aligner for that particular arch. It's very practical in the sense of what they've asked for and we hadn't responded to it and this is something we think will help our customers and will help our future competitiveness also. Jeff Johnson : Okay, understood. And that was actually going to be my follow-up question on the lower arch, you had mentioned at least in the prepared remarks the single arch so we'll assume that's that lower arch, are you saying that you're going to -- price that kind of the Express 5 level is that what I'm hearing? And then David, I thought the Express 5 promotion was going to end in July, it sounds like may be in your remarks that's going to be extended is that correct in North America that that discounted price that went into effect over the last four or five months? Joe Hogan : Yes. Jeff, first of all, when you look at those product line and all we had to reposition the Express 5 pricing to really -- to allow the single arch to have that price point and then we moved up our E5 price and David you give the specifics of what those numbers were. Jeff Johnson : Okay. David White : Yes. So Jeff, we haven't -- I don't think we've formally announced it but have we, okay -- I have been told, yes. Jeff Johnson : [indiscernible] David. David White : You're right I remember there was an announcement, I know there was -- the promotion that we ran in Q2 actually started in -- towards the end of Q1 and it ran till June 30. Then we had about a three week period before we launch and announce the single arch product and when we announced the single arch product with that we announced a new promotion for E5, one for dual arch and one for single arch. The pricing on the dual arch E5 is higher, the discount is \u2013 they are saying differently, the discount is not as large what was in Q2, but yet we're also offering a nice discount on the single arch as well so that when you actually look at those two together we think it will attract the -- we think it will attract adoption for those patients at a nice price point it only needs one arch treated and we think it will still preserve a good demand for those that need dual arch. But the pricing has gone up a little bit from where it was in Q2. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Yes, thank you. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Jeff. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, you talked a quite a bit about changes in opportunities you're making in the commercial organization. Would be curious to get your view as to the adequacy or efficiency of the R&D budget, in R&D organization and whether you get there -- is room for some further changes or enhancements in that side of the business? Joe Hogan : Look, I think from an R&D standpoint there is a lot to do here because there is still a huge amount of penetration we can do especially as we go up the curve in the sense of both on the aligner itself but also the technology we call the digital ecosystem behind that. So look, I like the way it's placed in the sense of the efficiency of it between Russia and United States what we have in Israel on the scanner side. So right now, I feel good about where we are, we put significant number of resources into R&D and technology over the last couple of years, they look like they've been well placed. I talk about going out and seeing customers but [Joe Cole] [ph] who runs our technology organization has spent significant amount of time with -- he and his people here recently too. And really I'm impressed of what we have here. But this is a technology organization this is some -- we have to put money in technology into these products to continue to advance the science. And given the level of penetration and what we've seen as a result of that investment, I think it's a good thing to do. Brandon Couillard : Excellent, David, the 700 unit iTero orders in the second quarter, were those upgrades or new users and given the new disclosures and the presentation I appreciate that, care to comment on the size of the installed base in North America? David White : Well, as far as the 700 orders, I don't have the break out here in front of me. But part of that is obviously doctors that are upgrading some of that is doctors that are getting a second scanner for their office. And then there is other doctors that are getting their first scanner. And all of those are great facts for us. We like to see the adoption and Joe mentioned some of the excitement we've seen generally about it and some of the shows we featured it. As far as the installed base, I'm not sure we've upgraded that except -- year end was it Shirley? What was that do you remember? Shirley Stacy : An analyst meeting, that was all. David White : About 4,000 I think was the last time we upgraded at the analyst meeting. Brandon Couillard : Super. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse. Glen Santangelo : Yes. Thanks. And good evening. I just want to talk a little bit about ASPs and margins. I mean I think I understand the commentary this quarter ASPs were impacted by some of the promotional activity may be some higher -- the revenue deferral and FX. But if we kind of look at ASPs in terms of what you're implying next quarter based on the revenue guidance, it looks like ASPs tick down again a fair amount sequentially, is that all attributable to the new deferral arrangement or is there some other promotional activity in Q3 that's kind of worth calling out? Joe Hogan : Most of that Glen is related to the \u2013 is related to the additional aligners in fact the vast majority of it is. You can compute back into our ASPs probably half of our guidance. Glen Santangelo : Yes. Joe Hogan : Substantially all of this is additional aligners. There is we talked really about a price increase that we implemented \u2013 we implemented that effective April 1 in North America. We didn't \u2013 we won't see the full effective of that price increase for North America anyway until Q3. We implemented the price increase of \u20ac50 in international and that came into effect on July 1. And we will probably going to see a partial impact of that in Q3 is just we work off all cases and so forth that we submitted the old price. And those \u2013 and so you got that price uplift there and we got some promotions like we are running on \u2013 continue to run on the E5 and so forth and go from there. But not from a quarter-over-quarter standpoint Q2 to Q3 FX is pretty much not in the picture it's really \u2013 it's really the change in policy with some plus having the price increase and then some additional promotions. Glen Santangelo : Okay. That's helpful. And David may if I could expand the conversation into margins, kind of sounds like you are modeling fiscal 2015 without margins down 400 to 500 basis points. But, Joe maybe is a good question for you, on last quarter's call, Tom talked about investment in a new ERP system, he talked about making sleep apnea investment now you kind of have the new sort of deferral arrangement. You got FX kind of playing a role in there. So I'm trying to think about fiscal 2016 margins and I know you don't want to guide on that. But, should I think about or just stay on your margins for the full two years until you sort of work your way or through all the grandfathered cases before we sort of get to a cleaner run rate a couple of years from now. I'm just trying to think about how we should think about the margin progression just kind of knowing the information that you kind of gave us tonight. JoeHogan: I first start off my answer with our goal here to be between 25% and 30% operating margin. This team knows it. I know that. The Board knows it. We want you guys to know that too. This is unusual \u2013 this is an unusual year and quarter because just what you mentioned there is ERP, sleep apnea, you have \u2013 there is foreign exchange really weighs on year-to-year, it's not going to be quarter-to-quarter. But it's year-to-year right now. And so it's a lot of static in this quarter. And obviously, we prepare to try to make this as clean as possible for you to understand what's going on. There is also behind this whole thing is a significant volume left, we are seeing that now. We feel good about that volume piece and I'm not ready to declare anything for 2016, but you want to see that kind of volume that go into 2016. And we have built the particular operating model around 2016. We are not done with that yet that helps us to go for the goals that we are striving for between 25% and 30%. David, do you want to add anything? David White : I think Glen your comment about the change it will take probably a couple of years for that to work its way out. So we are going to have that a little bit of a drag on operating margins for that time period. But, once I think that kind of settles out and so forth like Joe said. We expect to be driving the business towards that long-term model. We have hit that long-term model before. We did in 2014. And we are committed to doing it prospectively going forward. And I will just add \u2013 I will just add one other thing, as you think about 2016, you realize when we gave our guidance for this year and actually even the comments I made in my remarks today, ERP is a drag on margins of a little over a point right now. And that should fall off mid-year next year. And so there is at least that piece of it, it should get better. Glen Santangelo : And could you maybe just give us any color on the sleep apnea investment, how big it is and when that should \u2013 when we should anniversary that; did that roll off? Joe Hogan : Glen, I think the much as I can say about this right now as we are still working that. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Joe Hogan : And determining exactly you know what it means we are still in the beginning phases I would say, we might have been a little bit early and mentioning that to you. And as far as we are working through that in subsequent quarterly reports we will bring up the date. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Thanks for the details. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Glenn. And thank you everyone for joining us today. This completes our conference call. If you have any further questions please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day.",

Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments : Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanner & Services. David will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Q3 was another good quarter with revenue and EPS above the high end of our guidance. Our results were driven by strong Invisalign case volume, up 2% sequentially and 23% year-over-year, with growth across all customer channels and geographies. North America volumes grew 18.6% year-over-year, and our international geographies were up 35% compared to last year. This growth was driven by continued momentum in EMEA, in APAC, progress in North America, expansion in our low-stage product segment, and seasonally strong uptick in teenage patients. In North America, Invisalign volume was up both sequentially and year-over-year with the highest year-over-year growth rate for North America in three years. Sequential growth was better than expected, driven by seasonally strong teenage demand in ortho channel, where we had another record quarter for utilization at 9.9 cases per doctor. This is the third consecutive record quarter. On a year-over-year basis, growth was driven by both orthos and GPs, reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign by existing ortho customers and expansion of our GP dentist base. Our investments in sales force effectiveness are producing good results. We're pleased with the progress we see in North America. Customers are responding positively to our new sales structure, and we expect to continue to make incremental investments in go-to-market, clinical education and customer support in this important market. Invisalign volume for international doctors was up sequentially and year-over-year. Our international volume continues to be very strong across all countries in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific, which increased 31.5% and 41% respectively. The continued strong growth for international was driven by continued adoption of Invisalign in EMEA and expansion of our customer base in APAC. On a sequential basis, Invisalign volume was better than expected and strong growth in APAC help offset the seasonally slower period in EMEA. In EMEA, our year-over-year growth continued across all major regions with strong performance by Spain, Portugal, France and the UK. Increased coverage and sales execution continues to build strong momentum. We have a good balance of growth from newly-trained and existing customers. In September, we hosted our eighth EMEA summit, our largest to date with almost 500 doctors, including 75 from APAC, coming together for an intense clinical education and peer-to-peer networking conference for Invisalign providers. The program focused on building clinical confidence and expanding early adoption of recent innovations like Invisalign G5 and Invisalign G6 and ClinCheck Pro. We were pleased to hear consistent and constant feedback throughout the summit that doctors are more confident using Invisalign for more complex cases. In Asia-Pacific, Q3 was another record quarter in almost every major country, with China and Japan leading the growth. China now represents our sixth largest country market globally. Q3 utilization was consistent with the prior year and growth reflects continued expansion of our customer base in the region. During the quarter, we continued commercialization activities for the Invisalign G6 across the region with numerous clinical education events in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and Thailand. And in cooperation with Sunny Dental, we helped open the first Invisalign-dedicated clinic in Beijing. In the important teen segment, the total number of Invisalign cases in Q3 increased 22.3% year-over-year. This reflects continued adoption across our customer channels. On a 12-month basis, over 134,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign this past year. Product innovation remains core to our long-term growth and ability to accelerate adoption of Invisalign treatment in both the adult and teenage segments. The extensive new features and functionalities we have introduced over the past five years, including Invisalign G5 and Invisalign G6 as well as SmartTrack Material, have raised the bar for simple and comprehensive clear aligner treatments. While Invisalign clear aligners are already recognized as very credible orthodontic appliances, we will increasingly focus our efforts on creating doctor advocacy for Invisalign clinical competencies. In Q3, our Scanner & Services business revenues were up sequentially from higher sales of iTero scanners. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was down as expected and in line with our guidance as a result of the transition to the new iTero Element scanner. Since its introduction in March, interest and demand for the new iTero Element has been overwhelmingly positive. During the quarter, we completed the initial market release of the iTero Element orthodontic scanner with shipments starting in September. To date, over 2,000 Invisalign cases have been initiated with the new iTero Element. Customers tell us that the new design meets the high level of precision they expect from an iTero, with an Invisalign scan acceptance rate of 99.8%. We will expand the market release of our iTero Element to include restorative applications during Q4 this year. For Q3, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in North America was 40.5%, up from 39% last quarter and 34% the same quarter last year. In North America, our integrated consumer marketing approach continues to be highly impactful, with Q3 consumer search interest for Invisalign treatment up 20% year-over-year. In addition, we had more than 1.3 million unique visitors to our invisalign.com website, and more than 112,000 potential patients search for an Invisalign practice on our doc locator. Our multichannel marketing approach leverages national television, search, digital marketing, PR and social media and is designed to engage consumers throughout every point in the consumer purchase journey. During Q3, we focused on reaching moms and teens during the key back-to-school season by continuing the Invisalign teen confidence campaign we launched in May. The campaign generated more than 385 million consumer impressions across 20 key markets and drove moms to the invisalign.com parent page, with unique visits up 102% during the campaign period. In EMEA, our integrated consumer plan relies heavily on social media and online marketing in key markets. Even with the summer holidays across Europe and related seasonality, we saw great engagement with find-a-doctor searches increasing by 250% year-over-year and 200% growth in our EU social media community. Before I turn the call over to David for a review of our financial performance, I want to comment on two recent litigation filings. This week we dismissed a California state lawsuit originally filed against ClearCorrect in 2011. That suit alleged unlawful business practices regarding pricing and has no bearing on our outstanding patent infringement case against ClearCorrect through the International Trade Commission, ITC, who previously found ClearCorrect to infringe on our patents. ClearCorrect also dismissed a related cross-claim against us in California. In the area of litigation, today we announced that we have filed an infringement and false advertising lawsuit against SmileCareClub, Sharper Image, and Brookstone, companies involved in the sale of do-it-yourself at-home clear aligner products sold directly to consumers. The details related to our claims and specific patents in question are noted in the press release we issued. However, it's worth mentioning here that while this is a new lawsuit, we believe ClearCorrect is treatment planning and manufacturing aligners for SmileCareClub using the same methods that the ITC previously found to infringe on Align's valid patents. We anticipate that additional information regarding this relationship will come to light during discovery. SmileCareClub not only markets and sells its aligners directly to consumers, it also supplies aligners to resellers, Sharper Image and Brookstone stores, who are named in the lawsuit as retailers of the SmileCareClub system. This situation is of particular concern in that it not only involves the marketing and sale of a product we believe infringes Align's patents, SmileCareClub also promotes a treatment option that seeks to eliminate the critical role played by the doctor in the patient's treatment. Align has always believed that orthodontists and dentists play a critical role in successful orthodontic treatment using clear aligners, which is why the Invisalign system is so tightly integrated with the treating dental profession. With over 640 patents worldwide, litigation is part of doing business as an innovative growth company and we will continue to assert and defend our intellectual property rights. The ITC has already found that ClearCorrect's product infringes Align's valid patents, and we are confident that the final outcome in both cases will be a win for Align. I'll now turn the call over to David. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Let's review our third quarter financial results. Revenue for the third quarter was $207.6 million, down 0.9% from the prior quarter and up 9.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Third quarter revenues included a non-cash reduction of approximately $7 million related to our new Additional Aligners policy announced last quarter. Third quarter aligner revenue of $198.3 million was down 1.3% sequentially and up 11.3% year-over-year. The sequential revenue decrease was primarily related to our new Additional Aligners policy as just mentioned. Q3 ASPs were down sequentially about $45, which was almost entirely due to higher revenue deferrals from the new Additional Aligners policy. Excluding Additional Aligners, ASPs were otherwise flat quarter-over-quarter. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels, partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily related to foreign exchange rates and the higher revenue deferrals just mentioned. For the third quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 147,500 cases were up 2.0% sequentially, reflecting growth from our North American orthodontic and international customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 23.3%, driven by growth across all regions, with strength in international and continued progress in North America. For North American orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 5.4% sequentially and up 21.4% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, case volume was down 2.6% sequentially and up 15.3% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 2.9% sequentially and 35.1% year-over-year. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q3 was 4.7 cases per doctor, up slightly from 4.4 cases in Q3 last year. North America ortho utilization of 9.9 cases was a new record, increasing from 8.8 cases in the prior year. North America GP utilization was 2.9 cases, was up slightly from 2.8 cases in the prior year. And international doctor utilization of 4.6 cases was up slightly from 4.3 cases in the prior year. In Q3 we added 2,260 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1,060 of which were new North American doctors and 1,200 of which were new international doctors. Q3 is seasonally a slower training quarter due to holidays and summer vacations. So the number of Invisalign doctors trained was down approximately 8% sequentially. Our Scanner & Services revenues were up 7.8% sequentially and down 20.4% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the new iTero Element scanner, which didn't commence shipping until September. Moving on to gross margin, third quarter overall gross margin was 75.9%, up sequentially 0.2 points and down 0.5 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 78.8%, up 0.5 points sequentially and down 0.04 points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by lower freight costs and seasonally lower training activity, which was only partially offset by the impact of the Additional Aligners policy. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower ASPs, primarily attributable to currency exchange rates and the new Additional Aligners policy, which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Q3 gross margin for our Scanner segment was 14.7%, down 0.3 points sequentially and down 18.8 points year-over-year, both as a result of lower ASP due to a closeout incentive pricing program on our older iTero 2.9 scanner and lower production volumes. Q3 operating expenses were $119.5 million, up sequentially by $3.2 million, primarily due to, first, increased investments to support our continued international growth and expansion and higher media spend. Secondly, costs primarily associated with severance costs for organizational changes previously announced. And third, costs related to the termination of an agreement with a third-party company for product development in the obstructive sleep apnea area. On this latter matter, while we continue to believe opportunities in the OSA market are potentially interesting, we've now decided to remain squarely focused on our core business and organic growth opportunities. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 operating expenses were up $26 million, incidental to the growth of the business as well as our ERP implementation project. Our third quarter operating margin was 18.3%, down 1.9 points sequentially and down 8.8 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to the impact on revenue of the new Additional Aligners policy, which amounted to 2.6 points, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. The year-over-year impact relates primarily to these factors as well as foreign currency exchange rates and investments in the business related to sales expansion, R&D and ERP. With regards to our third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 24.3%, down 1.9 points from our Q2 tax rate. This is primarily due to a tax benefit as a result of the filing of our U.S. federal tax return this quarter. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.34 compared to $0.39 reported in Q2 and $0.47 reported in the same quarter last year. Third quarter EPS was impacted by approximately $0.06 related to the company's new Additional Aligners policy. Further, the year-over-year impact from foreign exchange as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar, including the decline on revenues, the benefit on our non-U.S. dollar operating expenses, together with currency exchange losses reported in other income and expense, was $0.04 per share. Moving on to the balance sheet, capital expenditures for the third quarter were $10.5 million, primarily related to added equipment capacity to our second manufacturing facility in Juarez, Mexico as well as additional costs capitalized on our ERP project. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $60.1 million. And free cash flow for the third quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $49.6 million. As a side note, on a trailing 12-month basis our free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 22.7%, consistent with our long-term model target of 20% to 25%. During the third quarter we repurchased 662,000 shares of stock, including 332,000 shares related to the completion of the company's previously announced $70 million accelerated stock repurchase and 330,000 shares, amounting to $18.8 million, in open market repurchases. As another side note, our last 12 months of stock repurchases, together with cash used to pay employee taxes for the net settlement of vesting employee stock that otherwise would've been issued, amounted to 71% of our worldwide free cash flow. We believe our free cash flow generation and these repurchases are consistent with our expressed capital allocation objectives of returning cash flow in excess of that needed to run and grow the business to our shareholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $630 million. This compared to $602.6 million at the end of 2014, an increase of approximately $27.4 million. Of our $630 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $213 million was held by the U.S. and $417 million held by our international entities. With that, let's now turn to our business outlook for the fourth quarter and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For North America, we're encouraged by continued progress in North America, with Q3 volume growth rates above our three-year average. While we continue to gain share in the important teen segment, the fourth quarter has historically been a seasonally slower quarter for ortho teen case starts. Notwithstanding the seasonal pattern, we expect North American Invisalign case volume to be up sequentially from Q3. For international, Q4 has historically been a seasonally stronger quarter for EMEA and a seasonally slower to flat quarter for APAC. In total, we expect international volumes to also be up sequentially from Q3. As a reminder, the changes for the new Additional Aligners policy applied to all new Invisalign Full, Teen and Assist products, our full product group, shipped worldwide after July 18, 2015 as well as any such open cases started prior to this product policy change. As a result, beginning in Q3 our deferrals increased as a result of providing these Additional Aligners at no charge and the grandfathering of over 1 million open cases. The effect on our future revenue is two-fold. The first is an increase in the amount we defer for each new case we ship. The second impact is that revenue recognized on each Additional Aligner shipment will be lower than the amounts we've historically recognized until these grandfathered cases are completed, which we anticipate will take approximately two years. As a result of this policy change, we expect Q4 2015 to be lower than it otherwise would've been by approximately $7 million to $8 million. This is consistent with the guidance we gave in our Q2 earnings call. For 2016, we expect this impact to be between $25 million and $30 million in total. Relative to our historical growth rates, we believe the current-year clear aligner volume growth will more than offset this impact on future revenues. With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 154,900 cases to 157,400 cases, up approximately 22% to 24% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q4 net revenues to be in the range of $223 million to $227.9 million. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 75.7% to 76.2%. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $114.7 million to $116.3 million. Our operating margin should be in the range of 24.3% to 25.1%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24.5%. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.4 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.53. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joe. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, David. I'm pleased with our Q3 results, which reflect stable patient traffic in our customers' offices and their confidence in using Invisalign on more patients and on more complex cases. Our goal is to be the best partner by providing great treatment experiences for our doctors and their patients. Overall, we continue to see good momentum across our customers' channels and believe our investments in sales, marketing and R&D are helping to drive growth. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, we'll open up the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, this is Nathan Rich on for Bob this afternoon. A couple of questions on guidance. First, it looks like guidance implies that ASPs will be up sequentially in the fourth quarter versus the third, if I'm doing that math right. Just wondering if you could give us some more details on your expectations for both North America and international ASPs. I think there are a decent amount of moving pieces just with the revenue recognition change, FX and case mix. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, Nathan, it's David. Thanks for the question. As it relates to ASPs in the fourth quarter and the outlook as it relates there, too, we are expecting a modest increase in ASPs in Q4, not actually that substantial, primarily due to fewer promotions we run in Q4 versus what we typically do in third quarter. The other piece of it is that we implemented a price increase internationally in July and it takes a while for that price increase to work its way through work-in-process and cases that are in various stages of submission. And so ,we only got a partial benefit of that last quarter. We expect to get full benefit of that this quarter. So, those are the two things factoring from a positive standpoint. There is a little bit of FX headwind, but not very much, but a little bit positive on the ASP. Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, makes sense. And then, if I could just ask on the operating margin guidance as well. It looks like for the fourth quarter you are expecting a pretty big step up in EBIT margins. Just wanted to get your sense of how much visibility you feel like you have here? Is it just a factor of sort of leveraging higher sales volumes? And maybe could you talk about the productivity of the sales people that you've brought on and how you feel about that return on investment? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: So, possibly two questions there. As it relates to operating margin, our Q4 visibility, if you kind of drill down a little bit into it, you'll see that our guidance for gross margin is pretty consistent with our actual results in Q3. And where the uplift really in operating margin in Q4 comes from is the fact that our operating expenses are going down slightly quarter-over-quarter on higher revenue. And so that's the principal driver. I think it's about nine points of the operating margin increase quarter-over-quarter is that factor right there. Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Nathan. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So I'll ask two, one for Joe, and then, sorry, is Roger on the call as well? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Yes. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So first for Joe. So, Joe, could you take a step back and just talk about the volumes and maybe rank-order what the drivers are? If you take a step back and say we have growth that's materially above 20%, you listed off quite a few items that the company did well during the quarter. But if you had to look at one or two things and say, look, this is really what has sequentially come on and made the business grow faster here in 2015, what would those one or two things be and how do you see those evolving from here? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I think versus last year is, first of all, you have to look at North America. I mean, it's the strongest comparison that we have year-over-year because they did have a poor 2014 then. And so if you look at, the growth has been there, the orthodontic sector has been terrific for us. You can see we have a penetration rate there that's a record at 9.9. And so that's very significant. We are seeing growth again in the GP area and double-digit growth that we hadn't experienced in North America prior to that in the few previous years. So I think overall that's probably one of the biggest variance I'd say year-to-year. What we had from a continuous standpoint, is you can see the terrific growth we have going on in EMEA right now in Europe and also the continued growth that we have in APAC also, which is very strong. And so, that's continued momentum and it's also on top of some pretty strong numbers from last year. So, I think those four variables I would say, Steve, overall are the big drivers. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: You haven't been, I'd, say wildly optimistic about GP. I mean do you think the double-digit growth in GP is sustainable in North America? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, I think there's an aspect of GP that we don't go deep in GP right now, we go wide. So you can see we have about 2.9 or 3 cases per GP unit versus 9.9 cases on ortho. As we add sales people, we know we get more sales in GP. We have to work on and I think what you said, I haven't talked about that a lot, I'm not enthusiastic about it I think what your words were. I am, it's just we have to do better at penetration in that segment and that's what we really have to work on. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just one for Roger, I think, first of all, welcome back to the call, Roger. Roger E. George - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I know this is your favorite part of the job. The SmileCareClub litigation was, I guess, a little surprising. How big are they right now? Are they even 2% or 3% of the market? And I guess while we're on the legal topic, I mean, what do you think the timelines could be as it relates to some enforcement around ClearCorrect? Roger E. George - Align Technology, Inc.: Sure. So as far as the market size of SmileCareClub, it's negligible. We don't see them that much out there. As far as timing on ClearCorrect, the case at the ITC was appealed up through the federal courts, most recently at the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, and oral arguments were held in August. And we expect a written decision from the court sometime in the first quarter of next year. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much, everyone. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Next question? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Joe, just to follow up on the last question about key growth drivers. What's your assessment about the underlying market growth, particularly for orthodontists? Would you characterize it as stable or are you seeing any improvement there? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: You mean from a market overall, John, you mean outside of us or just the market itself? John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. So in other words, looking at that 23% case growth, how much of that if any do you think is market? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, I think we have a favorable market behind us, John, is the way that I'd answer that question. I mean, we don't have a down market behind us, and that kind of market momentum is really helpful. To tell you how many points of growth that I think have to do with the market itself versus what we're driving from a penetration standpoint, I really don't have that kind of information. And so, I can't give you the specifics like that. But it's beneficial to have a market that's growing behind you. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: And typically, John, as you know, the industry has typically grown in low single-digits. And so nothing substantial has changed in that standpoint. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Okay. And Joe, as you've had a bit more time to kick the tires, so to speak, around the world can you maybe comment on what your priorities are going to be over the next year? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, I mean priority is obviously growth in profitability overall for the company from a growth standpoint, John, staying on your original question. The international part is a big part of our growth and where you're going to see us continue to invest heavily in that area to drive the growth that we think we can get there. But that doesn't mean we'll negate North America. North America is a big market. There is kind of a lot of a law of large number issue in North America, we report lower percentages. But when you look at case volumes, they could be fairly close together. And so you'll see us continue to invest pretty aggressively from a distribution standpoint in all three regions. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then one last one, now that you've had a few months to assess how clients are viewing the new policy about not charging for additional aligner refinements. How is that impacting client behavior if at all, and are there sort of key regions where that has been a bigger driver than others? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I think you can ask that question two ways, John. Is it a negative driver in the sense we see people trying to maybe take advantage of the policy? And then the other side of it is how comfortable does it make our customer base. We haven't seen any variant that would say that this is being abused in some way. And really I've been personally amazed that a number of comments that I get really all over the world on that change. And there is no question it is exactly the way the team represented us before I got here is that this was the number one biggest attractor that we had in the marketplace regarding our product and our policies. I'll give you an example. We talked about in our script about the Spain program that we had this year and that we just got back from. I had several doctors come up to me and just say, you know, Joe, it really increases my clinical confidence to have this policy changed. And they said because we feel like you have our back, if we run into an issue with something. It's a difficult case in some way, we don't feel like we're stranded. And I never thought that that would be one of the side effects or secondary effects of making that kind of a change. So it's been overwhelmingly received in a very positive way. And I think some of the surveys that I know you guys do and that I read, you can see a lot of the dentists that are surveyed on this will tell you that they feel happy about that and they'll be more aggressive about using Invisalign in the future, and that was the purpose of what we did. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay, John. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Unknown Speaker : Hi, good afternoon. This is Robbie actually in for Rich. Thank you for taking the questions. Actually, I had one follow-up on some of the doctor comments that you had made about GP adoption. Just curious in terms of, it sounds like you expect GP year-over-year growth to continue in that double-digit range. In terms of the doctors that you guys trained in the quarter, do you give any breakout in terms of how many of those are GPs versus orthodontics? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: We do have data to tell you how many. I think David will take you through that. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: I think if you look at the website slides, we probably break it out. Unknown Speaker : And is that number like new doctors? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: North America total? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: North America total. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, total. Unknown Speaker : Yeah, but that doesn't break down... Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Most of the doctors we train are GPs, right? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Yes. Correct. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: So if you guys recall historically and you can probably look at some of the historical data that we used to provide, but most of the doctors in North America are GPs. Unknown Speaker : And is that level increasing historically, or is it still \u2013 it's most and that's what we should expect going forward? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: No, you should expect that going forward most of the doctors we train will be GPs. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: In the North America. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Yes, in North America. Unknown Speaker : Great, thanks. And then maybe one on litigation. Is there any read-through on this California dismissal with ITC that both you guys have now dismissed that lawsuit against one another to a potential settlement with the ITC litigation? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Can you repeat that, I didn't hear the first part of that. Unknown Speaker : Should we take the dismissal of the litigation in California by both parties as any sort of indication that there could be a settlement or are you just \u2013 should we just assume that you're willing to hear the ITC case play out? Roger E. George - Align Technology, Inc.: You should not assume there will be a settlement. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Great. And then maybe one more on the Scanners business, this came in a little bit lower than we had expected. Any sort of \u2013 was that just seasonality or are you seeing any sort of capital challenges in that business there? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: So, (sic) Robbie, on the Scanner business it really has little to do I think with seasonality and everything to do with the cycle we're at in terms of transitioning from our historical Scanner, which we called 2.9, to our new scanner called Element. And we began shipping that product in September and up until that point in time we had been winding down the sale of the older 2.9. So it's more a function of that than anything else. Unknown Speaker : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Joe, I wanted to start with you maybe, strong fourth quarter guidance on the case shipments. So I think I know the answer to this already. But are you seeing any fade at all in China from a demand standpoint? In the U.S. a little concern that maybe we started to see some consumer softening kind of in the September time period in that. Are you seeing anything in your kind of month-to-month numbers that would worry you, either China or the U.S., at this point? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: The quick answer, Jeff, is no. China continues to be very strong. We had a good, strong September here in North America, too. I understand the basis of your question; I worry about it, too. What's the economic activity going on in those particular areas? But right now I'm not seeing any effect on the business in that sense. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, that's what your guidance would imply, too, so thanks. And then, David, maybe just a clarifying question for you on the Additional Aligner policy. I'm going back to my notes here, but the guidance you gave for the revenue impact in 2016, the $25 million to $30 million, that's the total revenue drag from that policy in 2016 versus what looks like it's now going to be a $13 million or $14 million drag in 2015. So the incremental drag, if you will, is only about $12 million to $15 million, is that the way to think about it? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: That's correct and that's primarily because it's only a six-month drag on 2015. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, yeah. Fair enough. I just wanted to make sure. And then my last question just I guess with Roger there I'll ask him, but I thought I remembered, guys, that with the ClearCorrect ITC ruling that even in appeals they could be risking some hefty day-to-day fines if they were still digitally treatment planning. So wondering, one, am I right on that? And two, does that mean anything in conjunction with what you said about them potentially treatment planning the SmileCareClub cases, and just wondering if there is any impact to potential risk there from that standpoint for them? Roger E. George - Align Technology, Inc.: I don't remember specifically what the ruling is on damages in the interim, but it's continued infringement from our point of view. And it doesn't affect, I mean it's the same thing, whether they are doing it for themselves or whether they are doing it for SmileCareClub. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. Maybe I'll ask a couple more offline on that later tonight. Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I'll focus on utilization. I guess the year-over-year GP utilization was up for the second straight quarter after being down every quarter in 2014. So, Joe, can you talk about the sustainability here with that increase, with the greater sales rep count, and maybe where you are with the sales initiative in that really long GP tail? And then part two to that would be, in the ortho channel the utilization increases have been huge. And can that continue with the current call it G portfolio or should we expect you'll need another iteration on that front? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, Jon, I think on the ortho channel side \u2013 I'll just start with that question before I back up what GP is. I think you'll see, just getting used to the statistics in this business, but I think you'll see that it normally goes down from third quarter to fourth quarter on the penetration rate. And it has to do with the teen cases that tend to come in in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So I think what you might you see is a little lower penetration rate on the ortho side for North America as we go into the fourth quarter. But that's just statistical and based on year-to-year. There is nothing in a sense of the demand pattern to think that we see any interest that we have in orthos on that. On the GP side, Jon, I'm just \u2013 again, my newness in this business makes me more cautious than I normally am. But what the correlation I see right now on the GP side is you have to make sure that you continue to approach this market in the GP side with sales people, because it's hard for us to have any really meaningful increase when you look at the amount of utilization that's going on in that channel. And so we've proven so far I think in 2015 is if you add sales people to this, there is a marketplace we can continue to get growth. There are some sales models that we're transferring in from \u2013 in Europe from a penetration standpoint \u2013 that we're going to employ in North America next year as a trial to see if we can help with some of that penetration. That will apply both to ortho and GP, too. Secondly is, and we talked to you before about the sales associates that we've added recently, which are basically what I would say back office support that actually make phone calls and all to customers andnot direct. We've seen some success with that model, too, and I think that might help us on the GP sector also in the sense of how do we go about that, how do we really \u2013 I've talked about this before too, Jon \u2013 how do we really segment that marketplace to see where we think we can get further penetration with doctors that are truly interested and taking Invisalign to another level, versus doctors that might just be curious on it and wanting to work with it, not necessarily in the in-depth way that we would want. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Very helpful. And then... Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: And that's a lot... Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: It's a lot, but it's all very helpful. So I appreciate that. And then, David, just to shift gears for a second, you got the question earlier on leverage and your commentary was, well, revenues are up and OpEx is down and that doesn't happen too frequently. And I'm not asking for a 2016 guidance, but I just want to make sure, we've had situations before where your 4Q to 1Q, your leverage is usually down pretty dramatically because you've got some one-time expenses that sort of get re-upped. Can you give any color around leverage as we look out, exiting sort of 2015 into 2016, maybe near-term, long-term? Because again, the move from 3Q to 4Q is just tremendous. Is there anything that comes back into play on the OpEx front once we enter 2016? Thanks, guys. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: So, to the first part of that that you asked as it relates to some of the seasonality you might see in our performance, financially and so forth, you're right to call that Q1 typically is down for us. And largely, for things that are external to the company like the fact that payroll taxes start over. We have a lot of employees here in the U.S. whose payroll taxes start over and our portion of that that we have to pay. At the same time, we have internal items that influence that, such as we have focal salary reviews and increases \u2013 performance reviews and increases at that point in time. So those all put pressure, you might say, on operating expense uplift in Q1. And then, when you add to that the fact that, when we go through our annual operating plan cycle, we go through a process that looks at basically our baseline organic business in terms of what do we think our business can sustain without any additional resources, and then we look at that relative to where do we have investment opportunities and how would those investment opportunities drive both short-term as well as long-term growth of the top line and penetration into the business. And a lot of times, those investments all get made early in the beginning of the year as well, and this last year \u2013 this year that we're currently in is a case in point. We made investments in all three of our regions at the beginning of the year to begin driving further penetration within existing doctors and bringing new doctors into the family, so to speak. So there is that piece of it. I think you should anticipate that we will, as our historical pattern has shown, that we'll be making large investments, incremental investments as we move into 2016 and that that will create some downward pressure on Q1. And hopefully by the time we get to the end of the year, we begin seeing a lot of uplift to our business as we're seeing this year. Longer-term than that, Joe mentioned the fact that we see a pretty good correlation between our investments that we make in the field and investments that we make in products, one driving adoption, the other driving doctor coverage and so forth. I think that will be our business for a while. I think our challenge long-term is finding the right balance between the investments that we believe we can execute on, and at the same time, be good caretakers of being financially responsible for finding that right balance between our short-term performance and our long-term performance. So our long-term model that we've talked about historically, we still believe that's the right model for us, and that's where we'll continue to strive the business. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. All right. Thanks, guys. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, John. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Lewis from ROTH Capital Partners. Mr. Lewis, your line is live. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Chris, are you there? Chris Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hey, guys, can you hear me all right? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, there you are. Yeah, we can hear you fine. Chris Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Sorry about that. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start on the fourth quarter gross margin guidance. When I think about ASPs ticking up sequentially along with the strong implied sequential case volume growth, midpoint of the fourth quarter gross margin guidance implies a flattish level from the third quarter. So can you just walk us through the factors that are layering into that outlook, despite the sequential ASP and volume pick up? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, we do have some ASP uplift. But we also have a higher training volume during this quarter, which typically is with lower gross margin. So that tends to hold some of that uplift back as a result. The other piece of it is that we are shipping our Element product this quarter, and Element, although it is a much better business model, you might say, for our company in many respects and I think also for the doctor and it does have a higher gross margin than the older version, it is still below our clear aligner overall gross margin. And so as that Element business picks up, that also puts some downward pressure, you might say, on the gross margin, just from a mix standpoint. Chris Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Then on the OSA market opportunity, can you talk about that decision and potentially quantify the impact that will have on R&D spend going forward? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I'll let David do the quantification, Chris. I'd say that when you look at that, it's not that we didn't that OSA was a good market. In fact, it might be a good market for some company at some point in time in the sense of how that can compete against other kinds of opportunities out there. But from us, we have I feel much better places in our core market to invest that money right now and that's what we're going to do in the future is just stay focused. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: And back to your question about impact, we gave some guidance at the beginning of the year that we thought OSA would be somewhere around a 1 point cost on revenue. And you'll see in the slides that we've provided on the webcast in the quarter the wind-down cost on that was about $0.02 a share. Chris Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks for the time. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. See you. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up coming from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Rich? Unknown Speaker : Hi, thanks. It's actually Robbie. Thanks for taking the follow-up again. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Oh, sorry. Hi, Robbie. Unknown Speaker : No problem. I have a question maybe on ASPs for sort of by product segment, the Express and Light segment. It looks like it's stepped down a little bit again sequentially. How should we think about that going forward in terms of is this the new normal or should we continue to expect price declines from this area? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: So, Robbie, as we've talked about in the past, there's a lot of variables that make up our ASP. And they come down \u2013 if I summarize them at the highest level, they come down to product mix, doctor mix, and \u2013 let me focus on those two for a second. So when you look at product mix, certainly lower-stage products and so forth are going to drive down \u2013 all other things being equal, a richer mix of lower-stage products will obviously bring ASPs down. And from time to time you're going to see us running promotions and so forth to incent doctors to give those low-stage cases, prize and so forth. But ultimately an objective for many doctors is to treat those and to get them to not only treat the simple cases but get them to build their clinical confidence on those simple cases and begin adopting full cases, where they feel they're capable and confident that they can do so. So you're going to see some ups and downs on product mix. And as we introduce new products in the future and so forth, I think you can anticipate that most of our R&D effort is focused on improving the clinical efficacy in those more complex cases. I think you'll see pressure from a product mix standpoint going in the other direction. So I wouldn't be too fixated I think on the last quarter or so as we ran some promotions on that case. We've said over time that over the long period we think ASPs can be relatively stable, plus or minus. And the other piece that kind of enters into it, the second piece I forgot to mention is when you look at the types of doctors we're bringing in. So as we dabble and penetrate and so forth the GP market, those doctors that are submitting lower cases are typically paying higher prices for those cases. As those doctors get engaged, whether they're GPs or orthos, they have an opportunity to participate in volume discounts. And so as we improve utilization in either the GP channel or in the ortho channel, we basically share, you might say, with those doctors some of the economic benefits of that adoption from the standpoint they get higher discounts and of course we're getting more volume as a result. And depending upon how that mix is from one quarter to the next, you're going to see some volatility, you might say, in ASPs. So for example in Q3 we know it's a heavy quarter for teens, particularly here in North America, and that typically goes to orthos. And when you look at ortho adoption, our ortho doctors are typically the ones that participate more regularly in those advantage pricing tiers and so forth. So I wouldn't get too fixated with some ups and downs that you're going to see quarter-to-quarter. And as I said a minute ago, over the long term we think ASPs will be stable, plus or minus. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thank you for the very detailed response. Appreciate it. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, (sic) Robbie. Well, everyone, I think this concludes our call today. We appreciate your time and look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and industry meetings. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanners. David will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the first quarter, including some commentary on our view for 2016. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. Q4 was a strong finish to another record year for Align. Better than expected revenue and earnings were driven by record Invisalign volume, which is up 26% year-over-year. These results reflect strong growth across our customer base and geographies from both an increase in the number of submitters, as well as cases per doctor. In addition, scanner revenue strong of 33% year-over-year exceeded expectations as shipments of our new iTero Element began ramping up this quarter, resulting in record scanner shipments. For the full year of 2015, over 0.5 million patients started orthodontic treatment with Invisalign, an increase of 22% compared to 13% last year. Our increased growth reflects continued adoption and utilization from international doctors and a solid rebound in North America, both driven by investments in territory coverage and sales and marketing programs, including clinical education. Product and technology innovation is also a key growth driver for the company and as a result in 2015, we continue to see increased clinical confidence in Invisalign treatment for our customers worldwide. For Q4, North America Clear Aligner volume was both sequentially and year-over-year up, reflecting record Invisalign utilization and a record number of submitting doctors. Sequential growth was driven by North American GP dentists with an increase in both the number of submitters and cases per doctor. North American ortho volume also increased sequentially, although less so given Q4 is a seasonally slower for teenage orthodontic case starts. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 North America volume growth was driven by both orthos and GPs, reflecting increased utilization of Invisalign and expansion of our customer base. For the full year, North America volume increased 18% compared to 8% last year and a three-year average of 12% reflecting the positive impact of our sales force expansion and go-to-market changes we announced on our earnings call last January. We're very pleased with the acceleration in growth rate and believe that we will see further progress in North America as we continue to drive greater adoption and utilization, and the ortho channel increased our share of the team market and improved patient conversion. Q4 Invisalign volume for international doctors was up 17% sequentially and 35% year-on-year. Our international business continues to be very strong across all countries, driven by both an increase in the number of submitters and in cases per doctors in EMEA and continued expansion of our customer base in APAC. In EMEA, Q4 volume was up 34% year-over-year and we had a record quarter across all markets. We continue to see strong performance in our five core country markets and are building momentum in our new geographies. For the full year 2015, EMEA volume growth of 30% was balanced across both ortho and GP channels. We also saw strong growth in Spain, the U.K. and the Mediterranean country markets, using our new selling process, which helps accelerate clinical confidence. In addition, newly integrated country markets previously indirect in the Nordics, Eastern Europe and Benelux are showing very good growth in their first full year of our direct focus. In Asia-Pacific, our Q4 volume reflected strong year-over-year growth of 37%, notwithstanding a seasonally slower period coming off a strong summer quarter. During the quarter, we celebrated our 10th anniversary in Japan with a full day customer forum with over 200 Japanese doctors. We also participated in the China Annual Orthodontic Society meeting with nearly 400 doctors, and in December we attended our first Indian orthodontic congress in India where we are beginning to invest in trained orthodontists in a three key cities : Mumbai, New Delhi, and Pune. For the full year, Clear Aligner volume in APAC increased by 39%, reflecting both expansion of our customer base, as well as an increased utilization. In China, Invisalign volumes doubled over the prior year and Japan grew more than 50% for the third consecutive year. In the important teen segment, the total number of Invisalign cases worldwide in Q4 increased 24% year over year. This reflects continued adoption across our customer channels, but more pronounced in North America where we have the greatest sales and marketing focus on teens. For the full year, over 141,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign, reflecting 21% growth compared to 16% growth in 2014. In North America, the growth rate of our teenage cases continues to outpace adult cases. Our integrated consumer marketing campaigns in North America, EMEA and APAC combine traditional paid media, search, digital marketing, PROFITABILITY, and social media to engage customers at every point in the consumer purchasing journey. Consumer interest in demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow as we can see from increases in key program metrics worldwide. For example, social media engagement and lead generation increased across all regions in 2015 and more than 8 million consumers visited one of our Invisalign consumer websites and almost 1.3 million of those visitors searched for an Invisalign provider on our site, up nicely from the prior year. In Q4, our Scanner Sales & Services business revenues were up 74% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year due to the introduction of our new iTero Element scanner, which has been received very enthusiastically by our customers. For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with digital scanners in North America were flat from last quarter at 40%. We believe due in part to fewer scanner sales in Q3 as we transition to our new iTero Element scanner. While we are talking about our Scanner business, I want to mention someone who has been an important part of the iTero's growth and success. Tim Mack, Vice President Scanner & Services, will be retiring in March after 25 years in the medical device industry. Tim joined the management team at Align when we acquired Cadent and he has been instrumental in integrating the Scanner business into the company and bringing new innovations to market like iTero Element scanner. Over the next two months, Tim will transition his responsibility for our Scanner & Services business to Raph Pascaud, the Chief Marketing Portfolio and Business Development Officer, who will assume the role of General Manager for our Scanner business. We're going to miss Tim, but I know he is going to enjoy having a personal life again after some very busy years. Now, I'll turn it over to David. David White : Thanks, Joe. Let's review our fourth quarter financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $230.3 million, up 10.9% from the prior quarter and up 15.9% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a year-over-year comparative basis, our fourth quarter revenue growth rate was lower by approximately eight points related to the Additional Aligner Policy we implemented last July and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Fourth quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $214.0 million was up 7.9% sequentially and up 14.8% year-over-year. The sequential revenue increase was primarily related to increased Clear Aligner volumes. Q4 ASPs were slightly down, slightly sequentially, about $5, due to foreign exchange rates, as well as a small shift in product mix towards our low end products. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies, partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily to the Additional Aligner Policy change and foreign currency exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 160.4 thousand cases were up 8.8% sequentially, reflecting growth from our international North American customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 26.4%, driven by growth across all regions. For North America orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 1.5% sequentially, reflecting higher adoption and utilization rates across the channel, and up 24.5% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, case volume increased 9.4% sequentially and was up 20.3% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 16.8% sequentially and 34.8% year-over-year. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q4 was a record 4.9 cases per doctor, up from 4.4% in Q4 last year. North America ortho utilization was 9.9, up from 8.6 in the prior year. North America GP utilization was a record 3.1, up from 2.9 in the prior year. And international utilization was also a record at 5.0, up from 4.5 cases per doctor in Q4 last year. For the full year 2015, we achieved record Invisalign utilization across all three customer channels. In Q4, we added 2,670 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1,270 of which were new North American doctors and 1,400 of which were new international doctors. This is consistent with the same quarter a year ago. For the full year, an additional 9,795 doctors became Invisalign providers, reflecting continued expansion of our customer base, especially outside the U.S. Our Scanner & Services revenues for the fourth quarter were $16.2 million, up 73.7% sequentially and 33.4% year-over-year. We're excited to be ramping up production and shipping the new iTero Element scanners to our customer practices given the high volume of preorders we have received since its announcement in March. Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 75.0%, down 0.9 points both sequentially and year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower ASPs from currency, which amounted to approximately 0.9 points, as well as the Additional Aligner Policy change by about 0.7 points, which was partially offset by lower costs per unit. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 77.9%, also down 0.9 points, both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by higher freight costs and increased trading activity, which carries a lower margin. Q4 gross margin for our Scanner segment was 37.7%, up 23 points sequentially as a result of higher scanner ASPs and lower manufacturing costs associated with the new iTero Element. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 gross margin was up 7.5% as a result of product mix shift to the lower-cost iTero Element, coupled with reduced service costs. Q4 operating expenses were $113.5 million, down sequentially by $6.1 million, primarily due to lower marketing and media spend. Recall also that in Q3 we incurred severance costs for organizational changes, as well as costs related to the termination of product development efforts targeting for the obstructive sleep apnea market, which contributed to the sequential decline as well. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 operating expenses were up $14.3 million, or 14.4%, as a result of our sales expansion efforts, as well as our European implementation project. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 25.8%, up 7.5 points sequentially and approximately flat year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin relates primarily to increased Clear Aligner volume and lower expenses. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 operating margin was impacted by approximately three points from foreign currency and the Additional Aligner Policy. With regards to our fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate of 18.1% was down 6.3 points from our Q3 tax rate. This was primarily the result of a more favorable mix of earnings and lower tax geographies, lower tax expenses realized upon the filing of certain tax returns, and to a lesser extent, the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit. These items together amounted to about an incremental $0.04 benefit in earnings per share in the quarter. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.60 compared to $0.34 reported in Q3 and $0.48 reported in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter EPS was impacted by approximately $0.07 related to the company's new Additional Aligners Policy. Finally, the year-over-year impact on the fourth quarter from the Additional Aligner Policy change as well as assuming constant year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates, was approximately $0.11 per share. Moving to the balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $16.8 million, primarily relating to equipment purchases to expand our manufacturing capacity in Juarez, Mexico, as well as our ERP implementation. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $79.4 million and free cash flow for the fourth quarter, defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, amounted to $62.6 million. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 179,000 shares of stock, amounting to $11.2 million in open market repurchases. As a side note, our last 12 months of stock repurchases, together with cash used to pay employee taxes for the net settlement of investing employee stock awards that otherwise would have been issued, amounted to 66% of our worldwide free cash flow. We believe our free cash flow generation and these repurchases are consistent with our express capital allocation objectives returning cash flow in excess of that needed to run and grow the business to our shareholders. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments were $679 million. This compared to $603 million at the end of 2014, an increase of approximately $76 million. Of our $670 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, $236 million was held by the U.S., and $443 million was held by our international entities. Before we move to the Q1 outlook, I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2015 results. In 2015, we shipped a record 583.2 thousand Invisalign cases, up 22%. This reflects 32.5% volume growth from international doctors and 17.7% volume growth from our North American doctors. Revenue was a record $845.5 million, up 11% year-over-year, including the impact of foreign exchange and the Additional Aligners policy. Full year operating income of $188.6 million or 22.3% of revenue, which included 1.6 points of impact from additional aligners and foreign exchange rates on a constant currency basis. Our operating results also included approximately $12 million of costs related to ERP and a one-time refund of $6.8 million for medical device excise tax refund, which will not recur in 2016. Free cash flow was $184.5 million or 22% of revenue, consistent with our long-term model target of 20% to 25%. For the year, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of Align stock for $101.8 million. 2015 diluted EPS was $1.77. To recap, 2015 was a strong year for Align, and despite several headwinds, including foreign exchange rates, as well as the impact of our new policy -- Additional Aligner policy, we did better than planned across the Board. Strong Invisalign growth offset much of these headwinds, enabled us to achieve revenue growth in operating margins above our original outlook. With that, let's now turn to our business outlook for the first quarter and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook. Consistent with current demand trends, we expect North America volume to be up sequentially in Q1, primarily driven by the ortho channel. For our international business, while we expect continued strong year-over-year growth, Q1 is a seasonally slower period in Europe due to winter holidays, and notwithstanding sequential growth expected from APAC, we anticipate total international volume to be down sequentially. As for our scanner business, demand for our new iTero Element scanner has been strong. As a result, we expect Q1 scanner shipments to be up significantly sequentially. With this as a backdrop, we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 161.3 thousand to 163.7 thousand cases, up approximately 23.4% to 25.2% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q1 net revenues to be in the range of $232.5 million to $236.6 million. We expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 73.5% to 74.1%, slightly down sequentially, primarily due to a higher mix of our scanner business which carries lower gross margins. We expect Q1 operating expenses to be in the range of $130.9 million to $132.4 million. Typical of prior years, Q1 operating expenses will increase quarter-over-quarter, based on several factors. First of all, employee compensation related costs will increase in Q1 due to our annual cycle of employee compensation reviews, which include salary increases and promotions, as well as annual stock grants and employer paid payroll taxes such as Social Security taxes in the U.S. that we had set with the start of each new calendar year. Second, incremental investments and sales territory coverage, go-to-market and product development activities will increase operating expenses as we add additional resources, much of which is front-end loaded in the year. And, finally, we're entering the last stages of our European implementation program and will not be able to capitalize as much of our total program costs as compared to the earlier stages of the program. Our Q1 operating margin should be in the range of 17.2% to 18.2%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, this is relatively consistent with historical Q4 to Q1 trends if you exclude ERP investments and the impact from a higher mix of our Scanner business. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 25% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $81.1 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q1 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. Let me now provide some directional comments with respect to the full year 2016. From a total revenue standpoint, we anticipate year-over-year growth to be in the low to mid 20s% and somewhere in the upper half of our long-term operating model. From a volume perspective, we expect continued strong growth in Invisalign case shipments. For Scanners, based on current backlog and demand for our new iTero Element, we expect Scanner revenue to be approximately double that of 2015. Notwithstanding higher topline growth in 2016, we believe 2016 operating margins will be relatively consistent with our 2015 results for the following reasons. First of all, 2016 will bear the full year impact of the Additional Aligner policy, which we anticipate will impact revenues by approximately $25 million to $30 million. Secondly, we anticipate higher overall mix of iTero scanner revenue in 2016. And while the new iTero Element scanner is more profitable than the older version, it still carries lower gross margins than Invisalign Clear Aligners and, therefore, will somewhat dampen total margins. Finally, while we expect to complete most of the implementation of our new ERP system by midyear, the smaller percentage of these program costs can be capitalized in these later stages, meaning more of these costs will now be included in operating expense. For the full year, we expect ERP implementation expenses to be relatively consistent with 2015. We believe these investments are key to continued customer adoption and accelerating our growth. Similar to last year, many of these investments will take time before they realize meaningful returns. All included, we expect our earnings power in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half with second half operating profits to account for somewhere in the range of 55% to 60% of our full year results. With that, I'll turn the time back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, David. As you have seen from our record 2015 results, the investments we made in the onset of the year have helped us accelerate growth and increase adoption of Invisalign globally. These results reaffirm our confidence in and commitment to new investments in 2016. This year, we will continue to invest in international expansion in new country markets like India and Korea, sales in customer support resources, as well as product and technology innovation to address such things as treatment times, indication unique to teens and predictability. In addition, we will establish our first order acquisition and treatment planning facilities in international regions, so we can be closer to our customers, improve our operational efficiency, and provide doctors with the great experience to further improve their confidence in using Invisalign to treat more patients, more often. All told, we believe these investments will further extend our competitive advantage and leadership in the market. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to sharing more details with you as the year unfolds. I'll now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks. Just on the revenue outlook for the year, based on the full year outlook and the doubling of the scanners, it looks like you are implying high teens Invisalign revenue growth. I was just hoping maybe you can share a little bit more around the assumptions behind that, both from a volume versus pricing perspective. And then, if you could, share anything on geographically how you are thinking about the year, specifically curious about APAC, just given some of the concerns out there and the strong growth you've seen. Just anything you can share behind the what seems to be very healthy Invisalign revenue growth would be helpful. David White : Yeah, Rob, David. So, I'll give you a couple of pieces. Let me kind of start with the scanners since that's where you started from. We announced the iTero Element scanner back in March of last year and really only began shipping that product back in September. And during that interim period, we were actively promoting the product and selling it and generating interest at all kinds of conferences and so forth and taking orders for the product at that point in time. And so since September to December, which we just began shipping that product, we have accumulated some backlog, and we've shipped what we had supply capabilities of. And we were starting the year with a very healthy demand profile for the product that is really driving the comment I made about we are expecting that revenue to double year-over-year. We wouldn't expect it to double in 2017, although we'd love to have that high quality problem. But that's kind of how we are looking at 2016 as it relates to the scanner business. When you look at the Clear Aligner business, the only color I'll give you as it relates to volumes and so forth is that you can see by the slides and our commentary and so forth, our international business is growing at a faster rate than what North America is, notwithstanding the fact that we got a great rebound in North America. Our EMEA business is growing in 2015, grew roughly at the same rate as APAC did, although a few points behind but pretty close. And we expect to continue to see strong growth in each of those international regions as we continue to make investments in expanding our territory coverage. And as Joe mentioned in his comments, actually entering into some new geographies. When you look at North America, like I said, we had a great rebound. We're expecting that to continue. We have continued to add territory coverage here in the U.S. And we have seen the results, I think, of some of that manifest in not only volumes, but higher utilization rates in both channels in North America. So, when you net all that together, we're seeing 2016 from a revenue standpoint being somewhere, as I indicated, the growth being in the mid to low 20s%. And I don't know if that gives you enough color there or not. Robert Jones : No, no, that's helpful. I guess just to move away from revenue, it seems like obviously there's a lot of momentum there. But in the operating profit side, if I look at the 1Q guidance and then the outlook, even with the second half operating profits to account for 55% to 60%, it still seems like even with that back half ramp, you are expecting the year to be below those three to five-year long-term targets. So, either one of you, but maybe Joe, curious now that you have had a little more time with the business, is that 25% to 30% operating profit margin range, is that still the right metric to represent the profit profile for the company, or is it something different, in your mind? Joe Hogan : Rob, I think it's still the right profile. If you take our end of the year operating profit, you add for Additional Aligners and you add for FX, we're right at the bottom part of that range right now. So, I mean I don't see any reason to change it at all. Robert Jones : Got it. Thanks. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Bob. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hey Jon. Jonathan Block : Great. Thank. Good afternoon. One really high-level one, maybe for you, Joe, and then some specific annoying ones for David on the guide. So, Joe, it's going to sound like a little bit of a suck up question, but, really, you have got a base that is maybe 3X what it was back in 2007. You've got a product that is really not recurring, and yet you are recapturing the growth rate. And so can you just talk to us at a high level, what is allowing you to recapture this level of maybe 20%-plus Clear Aligner growth, and then how many more investments do you need to layer on from, call it, exiting 2016 from that level if you would going forward? Joe Hogan : Jon, I'd just say the growth is deep and wide in a broad sense. And so, if you look at our utilization levels across the Board, you see them going up even in GP and ortho, substantially. Secondly, from a breadth standpoint, where you look internationally, the growth from an international standpoint, it is in new markets, but also there is some depth in new markets, too, like we're seeing in Spain and with TFM and things we have talked to you about before. I think there is also -- there is an adoption profile for plastic aligners versus metals and brackets that's starting to be accepted on a wider sense, and there is a lot more confidence out there in the sense of the use for it. I mean we see that in our discussions with orthodontists and doctors around the world, too and people that have been with us for 11 years and people that have been with us for three or four. If I go off and I talk about the investment aspects, I mean, this is -- it's a high-growth business. It requires continuing investments in order to do that. I think a lot of what you have seen, Jon, we're doing this from a non-dilutive standpoint if you take out an additional aligner policy and you pull away some of the ERP. But these are investments. You take a look at the ERP, we need that. I can't tell you how much this business needs an ERP platform in order to grow in the future. We basically juggle this business on Excel spreadsheets in a way that's just not a good long-term way to conduct this business. There's so many things we do that are a lot of arms and legs around here that we should be used for really interpreting information rather than generating it at times. And I could go on and on about that. Secondly, to go into Korea, to go into Taiwan, to move into India, those aren't just salespeople. There is certain infrastructure, certain compliance, certain things that you just need to invest in to ensure that you adequately go into those markets and we will continue to do that. But hopefully, Jon, and you know us well, you see that we're doing that in a sense of not telling you to hang on for three years. We're getting good returns on those investments. And what David and I are projecting right now, we'll see the same thing in 2016. Jonathan Block : Okay. That was very helpful. And then, it dovetails well into the next question for you, David, or just sort of three quick little parts. You mentioned flat operations margins year-over-year, but I do think you have roughly an additional or an incremental 12 or 13 from the Additional Aligner program -- full year versus six months. So, should I think about it on a non-GAAP basis the op margins are up maybe roughly 100 bps year-over-year? And then you mentioned the ERP expense. What is that that is similar to 2015? And then, finally, just the tax rate -- R&D tax credit, it looks like we have going forward, so does the tax rate going forward look like it was for full year 2015? Thanks, guys. David White : So flat on the operating margins and your question in that regard. If you look, again, back to what Joe just iterated, if you pull out FX, you pull out Clear Aligner and you pull out the portion of ERP that we would not expect to be recurring on a long-term basis, we're in the range of our long-term model. When we gave guidance for 2015 you will recall a year ago, we were facing a lot of FX headwinds at that point in time and we articulated that our strategy was that we would grow our way out of the FX challenge. And I think if you look at our results this last year, we largely succeeded in reclaiming a lot of that headwind. Now, since then, the dollars continued to strengthen, so we are still chasing a little bit of it. So, it's not quite -- we're not anticipating this to be as big of an impact in 2016 as what it was in 2015. But if I neutralize for that, we're inside the long-term model and it is a modest improvement, as you articulated, over 2015 when you look at it apples-to-apples. On the tax rate question you had, one of the -- our guidance for Q1 was 25% or you saw that our rate last year was 22 point something I think was the effective rate. Part of one of the things that's driving it -- in fact, probably the largest thing that is actually driving that is the growth of our Scanner business. And those sales are largely being made here in the United States where they are taxed at the -- our U.S. federal and state tax rates. And that is driving some pressure on the tax rate as it currently stands. So my best guidance for you at this point would be somewhere in that ballpark. I haven't got a better number than that. Jonathan Block : Okay, perfect. Works for me. Thanks guys. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Jon. Joe Hogan : Thank you, Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Steve Beuchaw : Well, thanks for taking the questions. And thank you operator, that was the best pronunciation of my last name I've ever heard. First question is actually on Element gross margins, you mentioned that they are likely to be higher relative to the prior iteration of iTero. My sense is that what we saw in this quarter is probably not a great barometer for how high they can go as you are still -- is that a fair assessment? Joe Hogan : It would be, Steve. Given that we're just starting to ramp the product and so forth, we still have a learning curve that we're going down. We're still or were still experiencing a yield ramp on the product. So, we're expecting it to be reasonably better in 2016 than in 2015. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Got it. And then two quick ones for Joe. One is on expansion of the commercial force. Can you speak to the magnitude of ads in 2016, how they might compare to what you did in 2015, appreciating that 2015 was a big year? And then, normally, in January as you think about working with Align over the years, normally in January we hear a little bit about product launches, plans for innovation, it wasn't as big a focus. Could we see something interesting at, say, the AAO, or is this maybe a quieter year on the product launch front? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Steve, first of all, from kind of a commercial investment standpoint as the basis of your question, I'd say very similar to 2015, but you would say more up in international and a little bit less in North America from a ratio standpoint. I think that expansion is something we just need to do. We know we get a decent return on it, as I mentioned before and we don't see it as being dilutive. I don't think we see it as being expansive. And Steve your second question was? Steve Beuchaw : The question is about [Technical Difficulty] for product launches, innovation cadence in 2016. Joe Hogan : Yeah. We'll have some announcements on product launches and some things that we think will be pretty exciting for the industry. In that sense, I can't necessarily talk about that now. We're still moving through different clinicals and things that exist out there. But I think from a broader standpoint too Steve -- not think I know, we continue to focus a huge amount on engineering. We see so many additional malocclusions that we can address through our technology. We'll continue to invest that way going forward so we can capture a larger and larger percentage of the market. But we'll have some exciting announcements in 2016. Steve Beuchaw : Well, looking forward to it. Thanks for all the comments. Joe Hogan : Yeah, thanks Steve. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question John. John Kreger : Hi, thanks very much. Joe, I know sometimes it can be hard for you guys to give a -- get a good market assessment, given all those share gains you have gotten, but what is your view, if you go around the horn, the U.S. orthodontic market, GP, and then Asia and Europe, does the market feel to you like it's getting better or worse based upon feedback you are getting from your sales reps? Joe Hogan : John, my comment would be that it seems to be stable. I think we saw an uptick in the market in 2015, and you go through the statistics and you can see it. Fortunately, we just traveled around the world for sales kickoff meetings from North America, Pacific and also Europe. In each one of those cases, we talk about a market that's pretty much stable from year-to-year, in that sense. I wouldn't count on a big market uplift. So what we're basically expressing here in our 2016 forecast is continued penetration in those markets. John Kreger : Great. Thanks. And then, maybe just to expand a little bit more about what you're hearing out of China, given some of the headlines in that region. How comfortable are you that the really strong growth that you guys have seen in the last year can hold up as we move through 2016? Joe Hogan : China is really interesting in this sense. We saw we doubled our growth last year. We spent a lot of focus in resources on China. The quick answer to your question is that we feel good about China growth next year. We -- just a week ago, we were together with that team. That team is very excited about it as we move into 2016. They are not feeling a lot of what we see and get concerned with from a Western standpoint with what's going on with the Chinese GDP figures and also some of the industrial investment that is going on there. Look, John, I'm long enough in business to always be on my toes in this sense, that something might change, but from what we see right now and what we hear from our sales team from a customer base is we're looking for China demand volume to be equivalent to what we saw in 2015 in the sense of continued growth. John Kreger : Great. Thanks. And then one last one. Are you seeing any uptick in electronic case receipts for Clear Aligners from any of your partner scanner companies or is it pretty much all still coming in through iTero? Joe Hogan : It's pretty much all through iTero. We're seeing a little bit right now, but we're just on the beginning edge of the qualifications of those. So specifically Serono. You know that is done. There's a qualification aspect that they are going through with their customers to make that work, but there is nothing that I would say is material and meaningful yet. John Kreger : Great. Thank you. Joe Hogan : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question Richard. Richard Newitter : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I had two. One, first, just on the ASP. I caught some of the company-comments that I'm not sure I heard. Can you just go over again what the mix shift was with respect -- I think you said in 4Q in particular that you had a shift towards less complicated cases. And I just wondered, one, was that correct? And then, two, does that have anything to do with just the strength that we're seeing and the pickup in GP utilization? And is that that they are intending to use lower kind of -- or do less complicated cases? David White : Yeah, Rich. This is David. We announced back in June or July -- I can't remember a specific date on it, a single arch option for both our Express 5 and i7 product, which is our lightest stage internationally and domestically as well as the E10 and light product, which is the 10 stage and 14 stage, respectively -- respective products. And those products have -- and part of the objective of that was to satisfy a need that doctors had in treating people who only had one arch to be treated. Historically, when doctors needed to use an Invisalign product to treat a single arch, they had to pay for the price of both. So, we bundled a -- we debundled that and gave them basically the option to divide a single arch. And we've seen -- if you look at the growth of that product or that class of products in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of our business, they are going at roughly a 50% faster rate than our full cases. And we don't think that rate will necessarily continue, but that in and of itself drove some shift in our overall ASP mix to those lower side products and put some pressure on ASPs as a result. Now, two things about that. One is, when we look at the data from -- the demand from that, we certainly know how many single -- we certainly know how many dual cases we were selling previously where the doctor only wanted to treat one arch. And we can look at how the adoption of that single arch product has accelerated doctors actually using the Invisalign product relative to what they were doing previously. And so we believe we've gotten a lot of incremental volume at the low end for that and so incremental income on the margin from that at the same time. Richard Newitter : Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. And then, Joe, just with respect to some of the investments that you were talking about, we've heard you in China and getting closer to the customer, we've heard kind of some explanation around the initiatives there that you want to implement. Can you tell us kind of which ones in particular are the top priority as we move into first half of this year and what kind of the payoff landscape or timeline might be for those? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Our top focus right now is APAC. That's where we have the most diversity in the sense of a customer base and I think the most lag time lag just from a distance standpoint and with our current operations. We move over order acquisition, which is basically when someone takes an impression, we do a CT scan and then lower it to a digital file. We move that over, getting it close to the customer who will allow us to improve that part. And then we move treatment planning treatment, which I think is the biggest customer satisfier that we can move with quickly. And we will move that over to different parts of Asia as we go through 2016 and we'll begin probably with EMEA also to begin the foundation of that. Our resources are somewhat limited at times. So, we have to get started in APAC and we will figure out how much residual capacity we have from movement over to Europe on the treatment piece. But we'll move forward with both of those. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Joe Hogan : Yeah, Rich. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lewis of Roth Capital Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Lewis : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start on the teen segment. You had a nice quarter there. You pointed out the continued strength in North America. Joe, I was hoping you could spend a minute or two just talking about where teen is internationally at this point? And what's the strategy there over the next call it one to three years to really start driving teen in international markets? Joe Hogan : It's a good question, Chris. I mean I'll just stand on North America for a second. We saw good results this year and even though they are good results, it's still 75% of the marketplace and we're not even near the penetration rate that I feel our product deserves in the sense of that particular demographic. Taking what we have learned from a promotional standpoint a clinical confidence standpoint with customers are moving it overseas. There are parts overseas where we do see better teen engagement, in different parts of APAC and some parts of Europe. But to tell you that there's a magic formula for North America that's transportable to these other markets, it's not. It's very similar to what I had in GD [ph] Healthcare too. When you start to move into these markets, they all have their different idiosyncrasies, so we're going to have to look at each one of the large ones and make sure that we bring our teen product forward in the sense that our customer base is comfortable with it and we're right kind of clinical information that supports that. So, we known in North America we can do that, we\u2019re confident we'll do it around the world and we can make those kind of progress we saw in North America this year. But there's going to be a lot of work year-in and year out both from a clinical standpoint and also from a sales standpoint and a channel standpoint in order to continue to penetrate that base. Chris Lewis : Got it. And you talked -- you continue to carve the important of the clinical confidence. I was hoping you could elaborate on that. How are the strategies you've implemented here so far progressing per your expectations? And what types of strategies are you implementing for this year to continue that? Joe Hogan : Chris, I'd say, starting in Europe, it has gone really well with the TFM process that we use, which is, I think you know, is it's our focused touch point strategy that we have with customers to bring them up the learning curve as quickly as possible. I digress one minute, if you think about what are we doing here in this business, we're taking customers from an analog process to a digital process. And, frankly, it's not easy. I mean, if you take a E5 or E10 case, it might be easy, but as you go up the scale and you start doing different kinds of malocclusions, it gets pretty complicated. And we have to be able to work through -- get customers up that learning curve as quickly as possible in that clinical piece. But also the business piece, too, because cash flow and different things that they associate with their analog business changes pretty dramatically as you move into a digitized business, also. So, from a clinic -- back to the major point that you're making from a clinical piece is doctors want that confidence that they start a case that they can be confident they're going to finish it. They are not embarrassed in front of their customer. They have to call them back in a lot of times. And TFM and those kinds of processes we are putting in place. And frankly, some other things that we're working on inside the company we think are going to be able to improve that clinical competence piece as we go forward. Chris Lewis : Appreciate it. And then, David, maybe just one more. In terms of Invisalign ASPs, you talked about that shift towards the lower end products. Just looking out in the guidance, it looks like maybe ASPs are down slightly sequentially in the first quarter. I guess first, is that correct? And then, second, any color you can provide on just how we should think about ASPs trending throughout the year in 2016, both in North America along with international markets? Thanks. David White : So to your point on Q1 ASPs and so forth, when you look at -- as our business grows, there's a number of things that impact the ASPs, as I talked about previously, any product mix shift from full cases to light cases. Any shift from doctors that are high volume doctors to doctors that are less volume-driven doctors can have an impact on it because of our Advantage program, which incentivized doctors to go deep into their practices. And so when we look at those influences going over into 2016, we do have a little bit of ASP pressure on Q1, not very much. Consistent with what we saw in Q4, which was I think $5 I mentioned in my script. And over the course of the year, we would -- as our utilization rates go up, we would expect to see that doctor engagement create some ASP pressure as well. But generally speaking, we would look at ASPs over the course of the year for other factors that we're working on that I won't go into the details on would offset some of those impacts. And so right now, I think we would continue to say holding FX aside and Additional Aligner policy aside and so forth, I think we would say that our ASPs would still be in the flattish type of directional indication. Chris Lewis : All right. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Chris. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Most of my questions have been addressed, but a couple of bookkeeping items for you, David. As far as the ERP program goes, should we expect that $12 million roughly of spend that is being absorbed in the P&L to go away in 2017? And could you sort of describe some of the benefits you anticipate on the other side of this? David White : Yeah. The vast majority of that $12 million we would expect to go away in 2017. We will be -- we do have built into 2016 a portion of operating costs associated with the new platform and so forth. So, you won't get all the benefit of the $12 million, but you get the vast majority of it. In terms of benefits, there's a number of them, and I think the ones that we're probably most excited about from a business standpoint have to do with our ability to offer products and services to our customers today -- tomorrow that are very difficult for us to offer to them today because of some system limitations. And so we have a number of ideas that we have not announced at this point that we're actually working on that we hope to be able to launch not far after the date we go live on our new ERP system. And so we think our doctors are going to appreciate some of those changes. We think it will drive improvements in their customer experience. We think it will allow us to get our business more closely aligned with their business model at the same time so that we practice our relationship with them more closely approximates the type of relationship they have with their patients. And I won't go into more details than that, but we think that the customer experience will be greatly enhanced. And then the other thing is from an internal standpoint, when we launch new programs here in the company, there is a significant amount of heavy lifting that has to be done even to announce and launch a new promotion. And when you consider that we have got a number of systems that all have to be updated, they have got to be tested before we can go live on them, et cetera, we believe that having one consistent platform for the company is going to improve our agility as a company, will allow us to be much more responsive to opportunities that we see in the marketplace, as well as our time to launch new initiatives and so forth. Brandon Couillard : And then last one, can you give us a sense of what we should be embedding for the currency headwind on revenues next year and then any sense of CapEx full spend for the full year? David White : When you say headwinds in 2016 for FX, right now we are accounting zero because we gave our guidance for the year based at today's current rates. And I don't know what their euro is at right now, but $1.08, $1.09, something like that and all the other currencies roughly at those rates. On the CapEx side, I think our guidance for the quarter was -- is in the press release, like $20 million, $25 million. And I think for the year, it's somewhere going to be in about the $60 million range. Most of that will be spent on manufacturing capacity additions. Brandon Couillard : Thank you. Shirley Stacy : Operator, we'll take one last question please. Operator : Our last and final question comes from the line of Jeff Matthews of Ram Partners. Mr. Matthews please proceed with your question. Jeff Matthews : Hi, thanks very much. Can you hear me? Shirley Stacy : Yeah. Hi, Jeff. Joe Hogan : Clearly hi. Jeff Matthews : I have two questions. One is a follow-up on Brandon's ERP question. You don't seem to be having the cost overruns and glitches that many other companies do when they get into this. Is that accurate? And is the timetables for going live roughly the same as it was when you started? David White : So, to your first part of that question, it is a -- I think for any company a change of an ERP system is a significant undertaking. We have a lot of people engaged in doing this. A lot of energy and momentum behind it. So, I wouldn't say it has been easy, but we're making great progress. And when we announced the program a year ago in the same call at the end of Q4 of 2014, we expect it to be going live somewhere around midyear 2016, and we are still on that plan. Jeff Matthews : Great. Thanks. And then, what I'm really interested in is India and coming on the heels of just marking your 10th year in Japan, because I know you spend a lot of time in Japan working through case complexities before you go into China and I'm just wondering how you view the potential in India relative to what you have seen in China, and is there anything that makes long-term potential there markedly different positively or negatively? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Hey, Jeff, I have been doing business in China and India for 15, 20 years and I think they are always in jeopardy of comparing those two markets and trying to make them similar. They are just night and day. I think India has a good opportunity for us. You can see we're going into Tier 1 kind of cities that we will start in. There is a good number of orthodontic case starts that are similar to China, but the similarity really stops there. And so we expect good growth, but I don't expect a lot of what we're doing in China to be transferable to India in the sense from a commercial standpoint. And we're going to have to get into each one of those cities and learn and adapt properly as we move forward. But it is a focus for us. We're going to have to be successful there. But we're going to take it -- we're going to start one step at a time, and 2016 will be a foundational year for us. Jeff Matthews : Understood. Thanks very much Joe. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Jeff. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and industry events, including the Chicago Midwinter Meeting at the end of February. We also hope you'll join us for our Financial Analyst Meeting, which is scheduled for Thursday, June 2nd, in New York City. More details will follow, but for now please hold that date on your calendars. If you have any questions, please contact Align Investor Relations. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful rest of your day.",

Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments : Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanners. David will provide more detail on our financials and also discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. Q1 was a solid start to 2016 with better-than-expected revenue and earnings, driven by continued strong year-over-year Invisalign volume across our entire customer base, with North America up 21% and international up 34%. Demand for our new iTero Element scanner remained strong, driving a 72% year-over-year growth in Scanner & Services revenues. For Q1, North America Clear Aligner volume was up both sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Q1 was driven primarily by our North American orthodontist customers, who achieved record utilization of 10.4 cases per doctor this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our Q1 volume growth rate continues to outpace the three-year average, and was driven by continued increase in ortho utilization and expansion of our GP customer base. Q1 Invisalign volume for international doctors was down 1.5% sequentially, as expected, given the seasonally lower period in Europe through the winter holidays and up to 34% year-over-year. In EMEA, Q1 volume was up 34% year-over-year, led by growth across our core European countries. It was especially strong in Spain, which was up 70%. The investments made in sales, clinical and customer care with our new selling processes are showing quick returns. Our new geographies also performed well year-over-year with Benelux, Eastern Europe and the Nordic markets up over 90%. In Asia-Pacific, total Q1 volume was 35% year-over-year, led by China and Japan, each of which were up 50% or more. Record Invisalign volume in both Southeast Asia and Taiwan was driven by growth of more than 40% year-over-year, as we continued to make progress in smaller country markets with our direct sales approach. Next month in Macao, we look forward to hosting our second Invisalign APAC Summit, where almost 700 customers will attend the largest Invisalign Summit outside of North America. The APAC Summit will focus heavily on recent innovations, Invisalign advantages over other treatment options and peer-to-peer sharing of successful treatment outcomes in very complex cases. In the important teen segment, the total number of Invisalign cases worldwide in Q1 increased 22% year-over-year, reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign treatment for teenagers 11 years and 19 years old. On a 12-month basis, 148,000 teens started orthodontic treatment with Invisalign with an average age of 15 years. We're pleased with continued growth in teenage cases, especially among North American orthos. We're also beginning to make progress in growing our teen business outside the United States, where we had 30% year-over-year growth from international doctors. Our integrated customer marketing campaigns in North America, EMEA, and APAC leverage traditional paid media, search, digital marketing, PR and social media to engage consumers at every point in the consumer purchasing journey. Consumers' interest and demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow, as we can see from the increase in key program metrics worldwide. For example, in Q1, the total number of unique web visitors to invisalign.com or its regional equivalent, increased 30% to 3 million. And the total number of consumers who search for an Invisalign provider increased 27% to nearly 0.5 million. In North America, 2016 marked the strongest Q1 to-date for the Invisalign brand, in terms of earned media with 27% increase in overall impressions. In EMEA, we focused primarily on lead-generation activities in Q1, which drove 670,000 visitors to rejoin Invisalign website and our Invisalign social media community grew significantly, up 150% compared to Q1 last year. In Asia-Pacific, we've been preparing for several major consumer campaigns in China, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan that we'll launch in Q1. The new campaign in China will be our very first in the country, targeting females 25 years and older in both Shanghai and Beijing. In Q1, our Scanners business revenue was up 17% sequentially and 72% year-over-year, reflecting a record number of units shipped in a quarter. Demand for the iTero Element scanner continues to expand our installed base, fueled primarily by North American orthodontists. As of Q1, 94% of our top 1% of elite orthos have purchased at least one scanner and 64% of our top 1% of elite GPs have purchased a scanner for their practice. We also continue to see strong adoption of digital scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions. For Q1, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanning worldwide increased to 36%, which reflects a record 44% from North America and 18% from international doctors. While these scans are predominantly from our iTero scanner, we're beginning to see some uptake from 3M's True Definition, and Sirona's Omnicam, the other two digital scanners that also qualified for Invisalign case submission. Adding to this today, we announced Invisalign interoperability with another third-party scanner. In Q4 of this year, 3Shape scanners are expected to be approved which will enable Invisalign providers with a TRIOS scanner to submit a full arch digital impression in place of a traditional PVS impression. Clinical validation of the workflow is mostly complete, however given our ERP implementation this summer, the ability to support TRIOS scanners for Invisalign case submissions could not be finalized in our Invisalign Doctor Site, which we call IDS until after the ERP implementation is complete. We also announced an agreement with 3Shape to enhance existing STL export workflow between iTero scanners and laboratory partners using 3Shape dental system software. This will enable improved consistency for customers using the workflow. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David. David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Joe. Let's review our first quarter financial results. Revenue for the first quarter was $238.7 million, up 3.7% from the prior quarter, and up 20.5% from the corresponding quarter a year-ago. On a year-over-year comparative basis, first quarter revenue growth rate was lower by approximately five points, related to the Additional Aligner policy and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. First quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $219.7 million was up 2.6% sequentially and up 17.5% year-over-year. The sequential revenue increase was primarily related to increased Clear Aligner volumes. Q1 ASPs were slightly up from Q4, about $5, due to more Additional Aligner submissions and dealer promotions, partially offset by foreign exchange rates and a small shift in product mix towards our low-end products, driven by the single arch option we introduced last year. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies, partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily related to Additional Aligner policy change and foreign exchange rates. For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 163.7 thousand cases were up 2.1% sequentially, reflecting growth predominantly from our North American orthodontist customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 25.2%, driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontist, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 7% sequentially, reflecting higher adoption and utilization rates across the channel, and up 23.6% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, case volume was flat sequentially and up 18.6% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was seasonally down 1.5% sequentially and up 34.1% year-over-year. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q1 was 4.9 cases per doctor, up from 4.5 cases in Q1 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 10.4 cases, up from nine cases in the prior year. North America GP utilization was a three cases, up from 2.9 cases in the prior year. And international utilization was 4.7 cases also a record, up from 4.4 cases per doctor in Q1 last year. In Q1, we added 2,470 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 870 of which were new North American doctors, and 1,600 of which were new international doctors. Our Scanner & Services revenue for the first quarter was $19 million, up 17.2% sequentially and 72% year-over-year. We're pleased with continued strong demand for the iTero Element scanner. Notwithstanding these strong results, production capacity has been more constrained than expected as we strive to ramp production and work down backlog. Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 75.7%, slightly better-than-expected, up 0.7 points sequentially and down 0.6 points year-over-year. Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 78.3%, up 0.4 points sequentially and down 0.8 points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by lower freight costs from a slightly lower mix of international shipments. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower Clear Aligner ASPs related to our new Additional Aligner policy implemented in July last year. Q1 gross margin for our Scanner segment was a record 45%, up 7.3 points sequentially and 16.7 points year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year increase in gross margin was primarily a result of higher ASPs and lower cost of our iTero Element scanner. Q1 operating expenses were $127.3 million, up sequentially by $13.8 million or 12.2%, primarily due to the planned annual increases in employee compensation and benefits programs, costs associated with our internal sales meeting event that take place in Q1, increased investments in sales and marketing, and go-to-market activities, as well as our ERP implementation program. Q1 operating expenses were lower than our outlook due primarily to more ERP costs being capitalized and anticipated during the quarter. In addition, the timing of certain investments in marketing were delayed to the second quarter and second half of the year. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 operating expenses were up $25.1 million, or 24.6%, reflecting increased head count and continued investment in go-to-market activities incidental to the growth of our business, as well as our ERP implementation project. Also recall, that in the first quarter last year, operating expenses included a benefit of $6.8 million, associated with a medical device excise tax refund. Our first quarter operating margin was 22.3%, down 3.5 points sequentially and down 2.4 points year-over-year. This sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to higher expenses as just described. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 operating margin was impacted by approximately 2.5 points from Additional Aligner policy and foreign currency exchange. Also note, again that the year-over-year comparison reflects the aforementioned benefit on the medical device excise tax in Q1 2015. With regards to our first quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 23.4%, slightly up from our 2015 tax rate of 22.6% and 18.2% in Q4 2015. 2015 and Q4 2015 tax rates are lower primarily a result of lower tax expense related to the true up incidental to the filing of certain tax returns and the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in Q4 2015. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.50 compared to $0.60 reported in Q4 and $0.44 reported in the same quarter a year-ago. First quarter EPS was impacted by approximately $0.09 per share from the new Additional Aligners policy and a year-over-year impact of currency. Further, recall that the first quarter of last year included a benefit of $0.06 per share associated with the refund of the medical device excise tax. Moving on to the balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $20.2 million, primarily relating to equipment purchases to expand our manufacturing capacity in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, as well as our ERP implementation. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $30.7 million and free cash flow for the first quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $10.5 million. During the quarter, we also used $22.6 million of cash to pay employee taxes for the net settlement of vesting employee stock awards that otherwise would have been issued. Over the last 12 months, these amounts, together with repurchases, has amounted to $128.6 million. Today we announced that our board of directors has authorized a plan to repurchase up to an additional $300 million of the company's stock. This latest authorization is in addition to the existing $300 million authorization announced in April 2014, which brings the total authorization to $600 million. Today, we have repurchased approximately $200 million of our stock and anticipate we'll repurchase another $100 million over the next 12 months. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short-term and long-term investments were $680.8 million. This compares to $678.7 million at the end of 2015, an increase of approximately $2.1 million. Of our $680.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $216 million was held by the U.S. and $464.8 million was held by our international entities. With that, let's now turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook; for North America, we expect Invisalign volumes to be up sequentially from Q1. For international, we typically see strong sequential growth following Q1 winter holidays in EMEA and the Lunar New Year in APAC. For our Scanner business, we expect revenues to be up sequentially from Q1, as we continue to ramp production for the new iTero Element and fulfill strong backlog and demand. Notwithstanding this strength, given recent and continuing constraints on production of the new iTero Element, our outlook for Scanner revenue for the full-year is slightly less robust than originally anticipated. With this as a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows : Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 174.5 thousand cases to 177.0 thousand cases, up approximately 20.7% to 22.4% over the same period a year-ago. We expect Q2 net revenues to be in the range of $253.3 million to $258.3 million. We expect Q2 gross margins to be in the range of 75% to 75.5%, slightly down sequentially, primarily due to a higher freight cost due to increased mix of international shipments, as well as increased training revenue, which carries lower gross margins. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $142.7 million to $144.2 million. Q2 operating expenses will increase quarter-over-quarter based on several factors. Q2 will carry the full quarter impact of employee compensation-related costs, such as annual wage increases, stock-based compensation awards, and new hires. Some investments in sales territory coverage and go-to market activities that were anticipated in Q1, were delayed to Q2 in the second half of the year. Given our continued success in driving growth and adoption of Invisalign outside the U.S., we do intend to make some incremental investments in the second half of 2016. Our Q2 operating margin should be in the range of 18.7% to 19.7%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.4 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q2 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.49. With that, I'll turn the time back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, David. I'm pleased with Q1 and our better-than-expected start to the year thanks to continued growth and adoption across our customer base. We credit that to our focus on and investment in key growth drivers, especially our continued expansion outside of North America, commitment to product and technology innovation and consumer demand programs that help drive Invisalign adoption. Q2 will be a busy quarter for us with the upcoming AAO in Orlando, the APAC Summit in Macao, and our Analyst Day coming up in June. I look forward to seeing many of you at that Analyst Meeting in New York to sharing more details about our opportunities for growth, our competitive advantages and the key things we're focusing on for the future. Thank you for your time today. I'll now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the questions. You guys mentioned that some of the investments were delayed from Q1 to later in the year. I guess, first part will be why, were they delayed? And then the second part and more importantly, does that delay in investment have any impact at all on your view of mid-20% revenue growth for the year. Obviously, case growth continues to be pretty strong and also tied to that level of investment. Just wondering, if the timing of the spend, has affected at all your view of the full-year? David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : So, Bob. This is David. I'll see if I can field that for you. They were marketing expenses as we talked about, as I mentioned in the script. They were, however, though related to things that had a longer-term aspect to them. So, they weren't near-term types of items that would necessarily be driving current year case growth. They had more to do with portfolio types of planning and studies and things like that. So, no impact to the year. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then I guess just on the international side, case growth, you are obviously very robust there. But kind of in line with the type of growth we've seen in the last few quarters. I know you guys had mentioned more investments this year coming on the international side versus the domestic side. I'm just curious, if you could talk about what type of growth rate or growth rate acceleration we should maybe think about on the international side, and then maybe just the timeline or timing around the returns on the investments you're making internationally would be helpful? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's Joe, Bob. And I'd say, you know the \u2013 what we expect is to continue with the growth rates, we've seen you know in the \u2013 from an international standpoint, but I don't see a change there. In a sense of \u2013 you know overall in that business, it's pretty much what we've been telling you, there's not a lot of dilution in the sense of what we do internationally, in the sense of the resources that we put it in a year; and the return, we're getting on those resources through so, think about that return in the aspect of a one-year kind of return on international commercial kinds of resources. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks so much. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions, guys. My first one is actually on the buyback. Well, of course, very nice to see. My question is, are you framing the buyback for 2016, as something like a new normal or is this something that we should think of as a one-time step-up relative to the historical trend? David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : So, I don't think there is any intended change in the program that we announced a couple years ago, Steve. We announced $300 million, we anticipated to repurchase $100 million a year. In the first two years of that program, we repurchased $70 million of the $100 million in each case, using an ASR and then we repurchased the remaining $30 million in open-market transactions over the balance of the year. And this year, pretty much the same thing except for changing it to a 50-50 split. No other change other than that. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. So, it's not \u2013 okay, now I understand the period you're saying. And then, my second question actually David is, could you quantify how much of the spend was delayed out of Q1 into the balance of the year? David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : So, the portion that was delayed into Q2 is in our guidance. Portion that was delayed into the second half is about $2 million or so, roughly. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, I will... David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : Go ahead. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Have a good night. David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : You bet. Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, John. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Hi, Joe, can you just maybe give us some update on market commentary. There has been a fair amount of economic volatility in recent months. Are you seeing any of that filter through to your GP or ortho customers? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I haven't seen any change at all from what we experienced in 2015, as we go into 2016 and nothing recently either in that sense. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: So, what does that tell you? Does that say there is just not as much sensitivity around what we would probably think of is a fairly discretionary purchase by consumers or do you think there's just such an under penetration for Clear Aligners that you can kind of power through a cyclicality that an orthodontist might see? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll be cautious, I haven't gone through a cycle in this business yet, John. So, I'll just be cautious on what I'd say here. See, if I look at the economic data and backup a little bit, a lot of that economic data has to do with inventory and production right now. And I don't think it's in a consumer sense, something that's definitive yet. So, what I'm seeing right now, I want to try and communicate to you is, the market fields now is the market has for the last really 10 months since I've been here. If this thing hits the consumer and there is a significant consumer effect, I think, it'd be na\u00efve of us to say that we think we'll just power through that with the same kind of growth rates we have today, but I think we just got to take that a quarter, but a quarter of time right now. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And then one more. You mentioned the upcoming AAO meeting. It's been a little longer than I think in the past of when you guys have announced some product updates, any preview you could give us about something that might be coming there or just in general the cadence that we should expect about new product innovation? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No big change in the cadence of new product introduction. I can't give you any kind of a look under the covers right now, in the sense of \u2013 you know what we might do at the AAO, John or not do at the AAO. But, look R&D is incredibly important to us, you know we're focused on now inclusions in the sense of making this a deeper and deeper penetration against wires and brackets. We're really excited about that future portfolio and what we can do, but not ready to announce anything big coming up on the AAO right now. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, just a question on the digital case submissions. I'm curious as to your latest thoughts on how much contribution, or how would you characterize the success or progress of the Seric (28:32) relationship so far? And just given the installed base size, I'm surprised it didn't seem to have been a larger contributor to-date, any color you can share there? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Brandon that really hasn't changed. I think we try to communicate to the market as much as possible, as that we think that these open-source way is the way to go to make sure that you know \u2013 ability to no matter what's game you're on, if you have the kind of accuracy and capability that you can submit in this line kind of order. I'm frankly not surprised of what we see, I think when you look at Sirona, they've been cautious in the sense of how they bring people on and make sure of the accuracy and \u2013 which is really good in the sense of how they can interface with us. And so, right now, it's really no change in the sense of, I think what we anticipated prior to Sirona coming on and what we're seeing right now. But again, we feel good about that open-source commitment, and we feel good from a North America standpoint, in particular, to see the rates of digitized impressions coming in. It's good for our business, it's actually good for customers, because of the sensation, because of the accuracy of it, and how much faster we can actually turn things around. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : And \u2013 sorry, if this has already been asked, I don't think so, but could you \u2013 you'd pointed to perhaps the Cadent or iTero scanner revenues falling a little bit short of your prior goal for the year. Could you quantify that and perhaps give us a sense of the magnitude of the backlog and how long you think it might take to burn off? David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Brandon. So, when we ended 2015, we had more than six months of backlog on the iTero scanner and that number still holds true today. Notwithstanding the fact that, our revenues in that business were up significantly in Q1 and we're almost doubling the business. In the January call, we talked about our expectations that business perhaps doubling this year and I think that might have \u2013 given where we are today with some production capacity constraints and so forth, that might have been a little bit more optimistic by maybe 10% or so. And we hope to work through those constraints and work down the backlog as we continue to ship product throughout the balance of the year. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Matthew O\u2019Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, you guys have seen impressive North American growth over the last four quarters, how much can you attribute that to the stratification of the sales force? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, it's not a binary instrument on this whole thing, I think the stratification was helpful, when you define that stratification is, we're focused on our really high-end orthos, what we call our SAM (31:38) accounts and then how we've \u2013 allow our territory managers to go across orthodontics and also GP. It's been an efficient alignment, but we've also put a significant number of more resources into the field also, and so there is a multiplier there in a sense that the customers were touching and how we're spreading the workforce. So, I think those two main variables, it's hard to pull part how much each was effective, but we know that both of them have been effective in the sense of allowing us more customer time and placing reps in front of high user kind of accounts that really need different types of things than some of the newer users or smaller users, too. Matthew O\u2019Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Great. And also, I apologize if you guys have maybe answered this already, but single arch was a big growth last quarter. How much of that contributed to GP segment this quarter? Thanks. David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : So, good question. As we looked at it, if you look at the single arch and you look at even the pricing actions we took a year-ago in Q2, where we lowered the pricing on both the E5 and the E10; we changed the staff discount program, and so forth. As we look at it now, we're seeing great traction on those products; I mean they're growing well and \u2013 much faster than what the rest of our business is on a volume basis, maybe not the same way on a revenue side. But, certainly on a volume basis, they're growing at a rate faster than what our full products are. And when you look at it on a quarter-over-quarter basis, or I should say a year-over-year basis, it's probably about three points of growth when you compare it year-over-year. Matthew O\u2019Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Great. Thank you very much. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Lewis from ROTH Capital Partners. Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Hey, Chris. Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Joe, you mentioned \u2013 hey guys. Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Are you there? Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : I'm here, can you hear me? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, got you. Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Joe you mentioned, you're beginning to see some progress with teen in international markets; can you talk about what's starting to drive that progress? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Chris, again it's not subjectivity to my comment here, but I think, if you look at the history, particularly in North America, we had a history here of years of people thinking we really \u2013 orthodontics is not thinking we can do with teen. As we go overseas, I don't think we're burdened with that mythology as much as \u2013 because obviously we changed the type of malocclusions we could do; we moved into teens pretty well. We've changed our portfolio to address that, and just think there is less inertia to overcome overseas than maybe what we've had in North America over the years is my guess. And obviously what we're going to have to do is double back in North America and push a lot harder in the sense of our capability in that area now to overcome, I think, some history that's existed there. Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : On Additional Aligners program, it's been around I think nine months since you implemented that, I was hoping you could just take a minute and kind of talk about it here, if you're starting to see ordering patterns and your customer behavior in terms of your utilization rates being impacted from that program? David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Yeah, Chris, when we look at the impact of Additional Aligners, we look at it over many years. We see increasing usages of Additional Aligners over time. And primarily, that's the result of a number of factors : the fact that we're treating more complex cases, the fact that our mix is shifting a little bit from the standpoint that International is growing faster than what North America is, since they treat typically more complex cases than what we do here in North America; that's kind of shifting some of that. But when we look at all those usage rates, we don't see any particular aberration in those rates that we can specifically attribute to the change in the policy. What we know is that, when we talk to doctors they love it. They are appreciative of the fact that it's easier for them to practice with us; they don't have to be constantly thinking in the back of their mind, if I submit in a \u2013 and a request for Additional Aligners, am I going to pay for this one or not. So, when we look at the data, we don't actually see anything that shows an aberration, since all pretty much qualitative, and we know that it's one of the factors that we believe is driving the record ortho utilization we're seeing right now. Utilization last quarter \u2013 Q1 was 10.4 cases and it's one piece of the whole puzzle, I think. Christopher William Lewis - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, and good afternoon, guys. Maybe two or three. The first one Joe, I believe for you, on the teen market, I think you guys gave some metrics, teens up about 22% trailing 12 months, but it is like in adult, and you mentioned the average teen age around 15 years old, but of course, a lot of teens are out there getting orthodontic care at 11 years old to 14 years old. So, I guess the question is, can you go younger with the current product, or do you need something more specific to mix dentition and tracking compliance et cetera? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jon, I think you know the answer of that question, you know that. But I think honestly, one part of the practical side of me, Jon, is that our teen utilization rate in the 20% to 25% range depending on how you look at it, is really insufficient, given the market is 75% teens. And so, regardless of how young, you want to move back into the teen segment, we have plenty of opportunity when you look at complete dentition above 13 years old. So, we should be able to get out regardless of that kind of an approach. But I mean, obviously our R&D is focused on how we can go back and look at what I call morphology changes rather than just moving piece is actually moving things in. Obviously, we have some clinical trials in the marketplace in that area to see how well our appliances can fit in that particular area and we're optimistic about it. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And next two questions I promise I really don't know. So with the first one David for you, you mentioned maybe on Cadent more optimistic by 10%. I just want to make sure, I understand what you meant. So, the Cadent revs were going to roughly double this year, which was the initial guidance, that was an incremental $45 million. I believe what you're saying, maybe it's $4 million or $5 million too high, that's \u2013 is that correct? And then second part is, do you make up that $4 million or $5 million shortfall just to keep your \u2013 I think it was low to mid-20% revenue guidance for the year? And then, I've just got one more. David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : So, I think, the net of it all is that our revenue guidance is roughly intact. We'll make it up elsewhere either through pricing or through other things that were built into that plan. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just a very last one, you guys gave some interesting metrics on sort of the percent of high volume guys that own a scanner and there is a lot of them and we've been showing the average scanner user. There is a lot more cases in your overall average, but this brings back in the question sort of the chicken or egg, so are there any metrics that you can give even at a higher level of what someone looks like before they get a scanner and then where they go six months, 12 months or 18 months after they bring it into their practice? Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Jon. We're obviously looking at that. Our penetration rates are being furthered right now. You got to look at ortho, definitely we do GPs in that sense, but we really don't have anything definitive to share with you yet, that would say, you buy a scanner, you automatically do more Invisalign. We're not ready to say that. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for your time, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Thanks, Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is Robby (39:55) in for Rich. Can you hear me? Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Hi, Robby (39:58), yeah. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Robby (40:00). Unknown Speaker : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a question \u2013 a couple of questions. One, maybe on the doc training and then another on gross margins. First, on the Invisalign doctors training, sequentially, it looks like there is a seasonal step down in North America, but you're flat year-over-year, whereas O-U.S. training stepped up sequentially. Hoping you could help explain some of the dynamics behind that, and how we should see training progress throughout the year. And then, maybe second on the gross margins. Scanner gross margin of about 45%. Where do you think that can go over time? And should we think of sort of 2Q, 4Q at the similar level? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Robby (40:47), on the doctors trained, when you look at those statistics, you'll notice that typically we train more doctors internationally than what we do in North America. And when you break it down and you look in North America, it's primarily GPs. I mean, there are reengagement of orthos and so forth, but the predominant mix is on the GP side. And in terms of the seasonality of that, we typically have a couple periods during the year, where that is higher, Q2 and Q4 are typically the periods during the year that we offer more training, and we try to get more enrollment during those time periods. On the international side, I think it fluctuate less on a quarter-to-quarter basis and it probably geared more by our capacity that take on doctors and feel like we've got enough clinical health and so forth, to get them watched and start off their Invisalign practice. And I don't think we see as much seasonality in terms of how we plan out the international doctor side of it. And then the second question was on scanning. David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : The gross margins on Scanner. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, the gross margins on Scanners, they are in the 45% to 50% type of range and a lot of that is due to, when we designed the new iTero Element. We designed it, as not only a more feature-rich product than the 2.9, which it replaced; but we designed it a lot for cost reduction and so, you have a much smaller footprint in terms of physical form factor, that sits in the doctor's office, you have much lower support costs for the product, because the wand detaches from the base unit. The training is all done virtually, instead of us actually \u2013 having to actually whole classes on the training, it's done virtually. The doctor installs it himself versus us having to send somebody into do a field install. So, all those things kind of contribute from a business model standpoint, why it's a better gross margin proposition than what the prior version was. Does that answer your question? Unknown Speaker : Yeah. It does. And then maybe if I could get one more in, regarding the 3Shape announcement, sorry if you had mentioned it, I may have missed it. Did you say anything about what you think their installed base is and how many that opens up? David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : No, we didn't. And we're not quite privy to that information either. So, I mean obviously, it's a successful scanner, but there is not an installed base number that's been shared with us. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thank you. Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Thanks, Robby (43:46). David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Robby (43:47). Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Operator, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Our last question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good evening, guys. Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Jeff. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Joe, just wanted to start with you. Hey, how are you? So, Joe, starting with you on the utilization number, the 10.4 case number obviously as you guys said kind of an all-time high on the North American ortho side. As I'm looking at it, it's also I think without the biggest sequential jump up I've seen in that metric as well. So, I don't revisit the point you made about kind of end market being stable. How much of that sequential improvement maybe is coming from some of the efforts, you guys have been putting in the field, a lot of the work we've done and I'm sure others, but survey work in that seems like North American dental market has picked up here a bit in the last six months. How much might be tied to those factors, things like that? Just want to focus a little more on that 10.4 case number, if possible? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, it's a good question. I'd tell you again, it's a great answer, because I think we don't see this definitively. But I would say, I just look at kind of a constant force from a market standpoint over the last 12 months. And then overall, I think it's really the people we put into field and it's obviously I think some of our inventions like D5, D6. And then frankly, when you think about E5, E10 and some of our pricing dynamics on that too, all these things I think have really helped from a penetration standpoint with those guys. So, I wouldn't necessarily attribute it to a market uptick. I think, the market is in very consistent. I think, our resource allocation and focuses, I think, it really help in that sense. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Great. And then David, just one question for you on the guidance or at least on some of the P&L numbers. You mentioned the operating margin 250 basis points here, I think, you said between the extra Aligner policy in the FX in the quarter. Any chance you could split that out or disaggregate those two numbers? And then, just want to make sure I've got my gating correct. It seems like the FX drag pretty much goes away starting in the second quarter in the extra Aligner policy, will at least anniversaries through the model starting in the third quarter. Is that the right way to think about those drags? David L. White - Chief Financial Officer : When you always do these compares, it's always against what you're comparing to. When you're comparing quarter-over-quarter, FX and Additional Aligner is not a big impact on Q2; it was a little bit of a drag, but 20 bps or so. When you look at it year-over-year, you see a bigger impact and like we said about almost three point, most of that Additional Aligner, about $8 million of that is Additional Aligner and like another $2.5 million or so roughly of FX. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, the FX component as we go into 2Q would expect that pretty much on a year-over-year basis, were done with most of those headwinds at this point you think? Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, you tell me what exactly... Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): No. Assuming currency stays stable where it is today. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. If currency stays flat, the only \"headwind\" you might say we have that we keep calling out is Additional Aligner. An Additional Aligner \u2013 our discussion about Additional Aligner and its impact, kind of swan songs in Q2, because once we get to Q3, our comparatives will have the full impact in both ways. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Thanks, Jeff. Joseph M. Hogan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jeff. Shirley Stacy - VP, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations : Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. If you have any further questions, please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Invisalign Clear Aligners and Scanners. David will provide more detail on our financials and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. Q2 was driven by a better than expected revenue due to continued strong year-over-year Invisalign volume across our customer base and record utilization. With International case volume up 38.3% and North America up 15.3%. We also had a continued strong demand for our iTero Element with record shipments this quarter, resulting in revenue growth of almost 200% year-over-year. For Q2 North America Clear Aligner volume was up 4% sequentially and 15% year-on-year on a sequential basis Q2 growth was driven by both our orthodontist and GP customers. Utilization among our orthodontist customers continued to increase and we reached record levels in both ortho and GP channels for a total of 10.7 cases per doc this quarter. On a year-over-year basis our Q2 volume growth rate continues to outpace our three year average driven by an increased ortho utilization, as well as expansion of our GP customer base. Q2 Invisalign volume for International doctors is up 17% sequentially and 38% year-over-year, continued strength reflects record International utilization driven by EMEA, as well as continued expansion of our customer base in APAC. We are also seeing increased use of Invisalign G5 for deep bite in EMEA as well as in our Invisalign G6 for extraction cases in APAC, both showing momentum in the quarter and nearly equaling the overall growth rate for each respective region. In EMEA Q2 volume was up 37% year-over-year led by Spain, France and the Netherland. Smaller country markets such as the Nordics and Eastern Europe also had strong year-over-year growth, although off a smaller base. Execution of our high touch TSM program is expanding our focused approach across all our markets in Europe and starting to deliver stronger growth. Our low state\u2019s Lite denies seven products and continue to contribute incremental growth. In Asia Pacific record shipments in Q2 resulted in 42% growth year-over-year, growth is very strong again in China, Japan, South Asia and Taiwan. Q2 was a busy quarter for customer events that is more than 700 doctors and clinical staff attending our second annual Invisalign APAC Summit in Macao. In addition we had more than 500 orthodontists attend our country focused forum in China. We continue to ramp-up doctor\u2019s training in APAC with particular focus on developing doctors in newer markets such as India, Korea and Taiwan. In fact more than 100 doctors in Taiwan were trained in June alone. In important teen segment the total number of Invisalign cases worldwide in Q2 increased 20% year-over-year reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign treatment for teenagers 11 and 19 years. We have definitely began to see an increase teen case starts in late Q2 as more teens go into treatment during the summer timeframe in North America. Teen volume grew 19% year-over-year among our North America orthodontists. In addition we continue to make progress internationally among teenagers where we had 35% year-over-year growth. In Q2 in APAC for example we held a teen\u2019s forum for Australia and New Zealand markets where 200 doctors attended which was twice of what we expected. We also participated in a separate teen\u2019s forum sponsored by the SWAN University on a 12 months basis 155,000 teens started orthodontic treatment with Invisalign with an average age of 15 years old. Our investments in the teen segment continue as discussed at our Investor Day last month. We are currently developing products that will stay in Invisalign applicability over the next two or three years enabling our doctors to treat more teen patients and address younger kids for the first time. Specifically we will preview a mandibular repositioning product for teen Class II corrections as well as our prototype parallel expansion used for Phase 1 treatment. With these additional offerings and features will give our doctors a complete set of clear and removeable appliances capable of any orthodontic treatment for patients of all ages. Our integrated consumer marketing campaigns in North America, EMEA and APAC leveraged traditional paid media, search digital, marketing, TR and social media to engage consumers at every point in the consumer purchase journey. Consumer interest and demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow. North America, a key focus area for Q2 was sharing the stories of real patients that have used Invisalign treatment to improve their smile. These patient stories have driven high consumer engagement with 136,000 video views. New program launches included a partnership with Bravo TV on a network that reaches millions of woman who could benefit from Invisalign treatment. The Bravo integration via the Invisalign treatment into the story line of the hit show Odd Mom Out. In EMEA, we focused primarily on the real patient campaigning which continues to drive interest from Invisalign treatment online with Web visits growing 112% compared to the same period last year. In Asia Pacific, new consumer campaigns kicked off in China and Australia, New Zealand and programs continued in Hong Kong and Japan to drive consumer awareness and patient demand. In Q2, we are planning a big bang consumer campaign in China, which will leverage [Paris fashion week]. In Q2, our scanners business revenues were up 36% sequentially and up nearly 200% year-over-year, reflecting a record number of units shipped in the quarter. Demand of the iTero Elements scanner continues to expand fueled by primarily by North American customers. This past March we began shipping iTero Element to restore their workflows to customers who had pre-ordered and were awaiting the new iTero Element. In EMEA we received a record number of iTero contracts. And in APAC we received strong orders upon launching iTero Element at our Invisalign APAC Summit in May. We continue to work through the backlog of iTero Element Scanners, which remain at roughly six months lead time, as demand for our industry leading Intraoral scanners continue. Use of iTero Scanners for Invisalign cased emissions in place of [TDS] impressions continue to expand. For Q2, total Invisalign cases submitted with the digital scanner worldwide increased 37.4%, which reflects a record 46.4% from North America and 20.5% from international doctors. While these scans are predominantly from our iTero Scanner, we are also seeing some uptake from 3M\u2019s True Def and Sirona's Omnicam, the other two third parties of digital scanners that are qualified for Invisalign case submission. Before I turn the call over to David for our financial review, I want to talk to you about a supplier agreement we announced today with SmileDirectClub for their doctor directed at home Aligner program for minor tooth movement. It feels that orthodontics and dentistry has changed tremendously in a few decades since Align Technology was founded. Many of the greatest changes we have been and continue to be driven mass customized Clear Aligners, 3D treatment planning and restorations, digital photography, XRAYS, scanning, laser therapy, practice management, software, mobile devices and this can go on-and-on. Technology has changed the demands of potential patients as well. The Internet, ecommerce and social media, if consumers access the more information and more options for every type of treatment and procedure including where and when they want it and that cost much lower than traditional options. We have been watching the intersection of these technology advances and changes in consumer behavior and particularly we have tracked the different approaches to at home teeth straightening with Clear Aligners. I am talking specifically about doctor directed treatment, shipped directly to consumers. Not consumers trying to treat themselves in a do it yourself fashion. The at-home model follows an established trend of direct to consumer ship to home option for eye glasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and more. Logically this type of at-home treatment in orthodontics is only possible with Clear Aligner. And as the leader in Clear Aligner technology we believe Align has to participate in and help shape this evolving market. The emerging leader in this market is now SmileDirectClub. It\u2019s a privately owned business based in Nashville, Tennessee, they were found in 2013 and are doing business in 49 out of 50 states so far. Potential patients can either visit a smile shop to get scanned, schedule an in-home scanning appointment or send them photos and impressions online to begin the evaluation process. SmileDirectClub offers a device first class Medi many treatments that includes up to 20 stages with no attachments and no iTR in their proximal reduction. Primarily full adults it is permanent injunctions they have a network remote licensed orthodontists and general practitioner dentist to evaluate review and approve the patient treatment and monitor progress of the case throughout treatment. In a separate release today we announced the supplier agreement with SmileDirectClub specifically Align will provide a digital case set up which is made available on SmileDirectClub smile check portal. A SmileDirectClub licensed orthodontist or a general dentist will review and approve the treatment and Align will then manufacture aligners and ship them directly to SmileDirectClub. These aligners will be manufactured per SmileDirectClub specifications which does not include attachments and iTR. To be clear this is not Invisalign, Invisalign brand and system of Clear Aligners will not be used for this kind of direct to consumer market. The Invisalign system requires in office doctor involvement throughout the course of treatment, while only be made available from an Invisalign provider. At Align we are investing nearly $100 million in R&D and marketing to further advance the science and technology for Invisalign brand. The most advanced Clear Aligners in the world. So our doctors could continue to achieve great outcomes for their patients. We will continue to path the innovation we have delivered over the last 20 years as per advance of science and technology through our Invisalign doctors with new products such as class III, teen class II morph and Phase 1 pilot expander that we indicated again recently in 20-F, that will be available in 2017. These types of Invisalign advancement will significantly increase the applicability of Invisalign Clear Aligners to our in office doctors. With the goal of our agreement with SmileDirectClub is to help expand the market and opportunity for Invisalign doctors while supporting SmileDirectClub\u2019s protocol as described. Which means we expect there to be little cannibalization of existing markets. In addition we are creating a new Invisalign doctor referral program similar to our Invisalign doc locater that will ensure that the 30% of SmileDirectClub potential patients that do not fit these protocols and who are interested in strengthening their teeth will be channeled back to existing Invisalign and office docs. The process will work like this, beginning in October we will create a new Invisalign doctor referral program much our like doc locator works today, consumers will request the smile check case assessment from SmileDirectClub, but whose case is outside of their treatment scope will be systematically referred to an Invisalign provider in the area. We believe this will provide incremental growth opportunities for Invisalign doctors by connecting them with new potential patients that would not have sought otherwise. The at-home direct to consumer market is growing rapidly and while still very small today we believe the incremental growth potential that this huge market represents is compelling, providing consumers who had very simple mild inclusions with access to more affordable treatment from the convenience of their own home is accelerating and will only expand the overall market for orthodontic treatment. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David. David White : Thanks, Joe. Let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenue for the second quarter was $269.4 million, up 12.8% from the prior quarter, and up 28.6% from the corresponding quarter a year-ago. Second quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $243.4 million was up 10.8% sequentially, and up 21.2% year-over-year. The sequential revenue increase was primarily related to increased Clear Aligner volumes and to a lesser extent our price increase in North America. On a year-over-year comparative basis, the growth rate for both total revenue and Clear Aligner revenue was lower by approximately four points, related to the Additional Aligner policy change we implemented in July last year. Q2 ASPs were up sequentially from Q1, about $30, reflecting a price increase in the U.S. as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. Our year-over-year revenue growth reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies, as well as our price increase in North America and International. These increases were partially offset by lower ASPs, primarily related to the Additional Aligner policy change made last year. For the second quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 177,000 cases were up 8.1% sequentially, reflecting growth from both our international and North America customers. Year-over-year case volume growth was 22.4%, driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontist, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up 4.7% sequentially, reflecting higher adoption and utilization rates across the channel, and up 20% year-over-year. For North American GP dentist, case volume was up 3% sequentially and up roughly 10% year-over-year, reflecting continued solid performance from mid high volume GPs offset somewhat by our large base of oral volume GPs. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 16.8% sequentially and up 38.3% year-over-year, reflecting increased adaptors and utilization. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q2 was 5.1 cases per doctor, up from 4.6 in Q2 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 10.7, up from 9.5 in the prior year. North America GP utilization was 3.1, up from 3.0 in the prior year. And international utilization was 5.0 also a record, up from 4.6 cases per doctor in Q2 last year, driven primarily by increased utilization in EMEA, which was a record 5.5 cases per doctor in Q2 compared to 4.8 cases a year ago. In Q2, we added 2,885 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1,125 of which were new North American doctors, and 1,760 of which were new international doctors. This compares to 2,470 in Q1 and 2,455 in the same quarter last year. Our Scanner & Services revenues for the second quarter were $26 million, up 36.3% sequentially and up almost 200% year-over-year. As Joe mentioned we began shipping the iTero Element for restore the workflow in Q2 and as a result almost half of the scanners shipped were for our GP customers who have been patiently waiting for their new iTero Element. We are pleased that demand for scanners continues to be strong as we continue keeping pace with shipments. Moving on to gross margin, second quarter overall gross margin was 76.2%, slightly better-than-expected, up 0.5 points sequentially and year-over-year. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 78.6%, up 0.3 points both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher ASPs partially offset by seasonally higher training activity. The year-over-year gross margin increase primarily reflects the benefit from leverage of our fixed cost over higher case volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs as a result of the additional Aligner policy. Q2 gross margin for our Scanner segment was a record 53.6%, up 8.6 points sequentially and 38.6 points year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year increases in gross margin were primarily a result of higher ASPs and the lower manufacturing cost of our iTero Element scanner. Q2 operating expenses were $140.1 million, up sequentially by $12.8 million or 10%, primarily due to a full quarter of employee compensation related cost such as annual wage increases, stock based compensation awards and new hires as well as go to market investments. Q2 operating expenses were lower however than our outlook due primarily to slower hiring and investments in sales territory coverage, same go-to-market activities that were delayed on the second half of the year and more ERP cost being capitalized and anticipated during the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 operating expenses were up $23.8 million or 20.4% reflecting increased headcount and continued investment in our go-to-market activities incidental to the growth of our business as well as our ERP implementation project. Our second quarter operating margin was 24.2% up 1.9 points sequentially and up 4 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin relates primarily to higher Clear Aligner volumes and higher gross margins overall. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 operating margin was impacted by 2.3 points from the Additional Aligner policy change. With regards to our second quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 23.2% compared to 23.4% in Q1 2016. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.62 compared to $0.50 reported in Q1 and $0.39 reported in the same quarter last year. Moving on to the balance sheet, capital expenditures for the first quarter were $18.8 million, primarily relating to equipment purchases to expand our manufacturing capacity in Juarez, Mexico, and our ERP implementation. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $76.2 million and free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $57.3 million. During the quarter, as a part of our $300 million April 2014 stock repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement, to purchase $50 million of our common stock. Under which we paid $50 million and received the initial delivery of approximately 0.5 million shares based on current market prices. The final delivery of shares is scheduled for October and the number of shares will be based on our volume weighted average stock price during the term of the ASR less on agreed upon discount. Upon completion of the ASR, we will commence the repurchase of $50 million of our common stock on the open market. These two options together will complete our April 2014 stock re-purchase program. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, included both short and long-term investments were $685 million, this compared to $678.7 million at the end of 2015, an increase of approximately $6.3 million. Lastly I wanted to comment on our ERP implementation, which went live the first week of July. Over the past year plus our team has worked very hard to ensure successful data migration and integration of new systems and processes. Overall our implementation went very smoothly. Given the magnitude of this process, and project we are continuing to monitor and trouble shoot potential issues but at this time believe we are past any potential for significant business disruption. We are pleased to have a foundation that enables new capabilities, improves our speed of execution and will be used to improve our customers\u2019 experience. As part of this implementation, we also implemented a legal restructuring of our subsidiary relationships, which will return in access of $100 million of cash to the U.S. tax free in Q3. As Joe mentioned earlier, in October we will begin supplying aligners to SmileDirectClub\u2019s aligner program for minor tooth movements. As part of this transaction Align acquired a 17% stake in SmileDirectClub for $46.7 million and gained a seat on SmileDirectClub\u2019s Board of Directors. As a result of our equity holding in SmileDirectClub Align is required to account for this investment under the equity method of accounting. Thus Align will include a proportional share of SmileDirectClub\u2019s earnings or losses in its financial statements beginning July 25, 2016. Our financial results will reflect two components, commencing in October when we begin to supply aligners the sale of aligners to SmileDirectClub and the income there from under the supply agreement which will be reported in our Clear Aligner business segment. And in Q3 and going forward our portion of SmileDirectClub\u2019s reported profits and/or losses will be included in our operating expenses. We are excited about this incremental new market opportunity and the potential our Invisalign doctors to benefit from an untapped segment of consumers with minor malocclusion who want a better smile. We anticipate this relationship would be incremental to our top-line revenue and earnings in 2017. With that let's now turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook, as we head into the summer months and busy teen season we expect to an increase of teen case starts, among our North America Orthos. Our North American GPs typically have a seasonally slower quarter in Q3. Overall we are expecting North America volumes to be seasonally down quarter-over-quarter. In our International markets our European doctors typically spend fewer days in the office due to summer vacations and extended holidays. Our Asia Pacific region continues to grow and is beginning to offset some of the seasonality we typically experience in our European countries. We therefore anticipate international Invisalign patients to be flat to sequentially up from Q2. For our scanner business we expect scanner shipments to be up sequentially as the iTero Element continues to penetrate the market. We estimate the Q3 impact of the SmileDirectClub transaction will reduce diluted EPS by less than $0.01 per share. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows, Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 174,200 to 176,900 cases, up approximately 18.1% to 19.9% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q3 net revenues to be in the range of $267.2 million to $273.5 million. We expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 74.4% to 74.8%, down sequentially, primarily due to increased mix of scanner business and continuous investment in international manufacturing expansion. We expect Q3 operating expenses to be in the range of $147.1 million to $148.1 million, up quarter-over-quarter primarily due to hiring. The late marketing investments as previously mentioned and higher ERP expenses as the cost of the last implementation phase called stabilization are not capitalized. Our Q3 operating margin should be in the range of 19.3% to 20.6%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 24.5% and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.4 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q3 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.52. With that, I'll turn the time back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, David. Exciting time for Align Technology demand and adoption of our Invisalign system continues to expand across all of our regions and with each new Invisalign innovation, doctors are doing more and more with Clear Aligners and growing their practices. Today we announced a supply agreement with SmileDirectClub, who will provide access to Clear Aligner treatment to more consumers than before while providing Align with an incremental revenue opportunity and helping us to connect Invisalign providers with a new base of potential patients. Thanks for your time today. I'll now open the call for your questions, operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Most of the metrics in the quarter were ahead of your own guidance and then ahead of our expectations. I guess one exception relative to us at least was North American cases and in particular case growth with GPs so I guess I was just curious how does the 10% growth case in North American GP is compared with your own internal expectations, and then just related to that any view of what you can do or what you are doing that could reaccelerate growth in that group in the back half? David White : Yes, Bob, David. So, if you look at our business in North America and you compare that growth relative to the last few years. If we feel like our North America business has really taken a nice uptick this year and starting last year with many of the investments we made, we think it's still strong on both the ortho and the GP side where we're continuing to see at record or near record utilization amongst those classes of doctors. We still are challenged when it comes to low stage doctors particularly the most emitting GPs who engage with us one quarter and then maybe don\u2019t engage in the next quarter, and so we struggle at times trying to reach those doctors and we continue to invest in various to go market strategies that will build engage them more fully with us but it does represent a challenge for us in terms of how we forecast those doctors in any particular quarter. The other thing I would just mention is that when you look at our comps particularly in second quarter year-over-year you will remember that Q2 a year ago we had, we were running an E5 and E10 promotion at that point in time, which we\u2019re not running this year. And so when you look at last year, Q2, we had a very strong quarter from a case launch standpoint because of those promotions on those low stage products, as well as the fact that we had additional aligner program that was -- you might say an easier qualification mark for the doctors to qualify for. And when you look at those two, they have a bigger impact on our year-over-year volume, but certainly a lesser impact on a year-over-year revenue basis. Robert Jones : Okay, that will make sense. And I guess just one on the SmileDirectClub agreement. And it sounds like you are saying it could be incremental to the P&L and in particular top-line next year. Anyway we could put a little bit more numbers around that, maybe how many members that they have today, how many do you anticipate will show up at Invisalign dentist offices, anything just directionally to help us as we think about layering that in, would be really helpful? Joe Hogan : Hi Bob, it's Joe Hogan. You can tell by the announcement that that will start in October, we\u2019ll start shipping then. It\u2019s hard for us to really triangulate around what that might mean as we go into next year. But we\u2019ll give you as much transparency as possible when we come back for the third quarter earnings announcement. Robert Jones : Fair enough, thanks so much. Joe Hogan : Okay. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Willoughby : Same line of questioning, I guess. Can you give us any sense of how much you think the SmileClub deal expands your total addressable market here? This looks previously untapped. Do you have a size of the overall opportunity? Joe Hogan : Yes it's really hard for us to call the market. I mean when you look at the run rate right now of SmileDirectClub it's in the $50 million range. It has really been accelerating significantly over the last six months. So it's really difficult to quantify this market. You can also see by the statistics that we threw out, Rob did -- this is the market that we really haven't serviced. It's less than 2% overlap with our current business. It's something we\u2019re learning a lot from Doug and David, the two key leaders in the business who know exactly how this works. So we\u2019re excited about it. We think we can help. We\u2019ll make a good partnership. We\u2019re also excited about how we feel it can help our business too in the sense of referrals back, they\u2019re going through this protocol back to our Invisalign in-doc office business, so. David White : But again this is brand new. It's hard for us to call it. And we\u2019ll give you more data as it becomes more apparent and as we move into the supply agreements in October. Robert Willoughby : Maybe another factorial question around it though. If they\u2019re kind of tracking along at a $50 million rate, I assume they\u2019re losing a little bit of money on that. Is that a safe bet? David White : Yes right now, I think they\u2019ll be cash flow positive next year sometime. So, this year they\u2019ll still burn again. Robert Willoughby : And just how worse -- is there a liability if the treatment goes bad, that goes back to an orthodontist somewhere, correct? That does not come to you. And just the last one on SmileClub is there a bad debt number associated with the business? David White : I\u2019ll take the later part. As it relates to the bad debt part, they have a very small cancellation rate amongst the people that are qualified. So, they go through a process where person identifies himself in having an interest in being treated. They are screened in multiple levels from both a photographer -- both from a photo standpoint as well as from a scan or an impression. And assuming the person passes their protocols and is capable of being treated, they have a very small cancellation at that point in time. Joe Hogan : And Rob on the question as you had about, from a liability standpoint. Remember we\u2019re the supplier of these aligners. We are -- FCC will sell them to the customer base. We do as per their specifications. Our job is to make the cleanest best aligners we can based on those specifications. FCC obviously makes the transfer, and something like that. We have liability. And we think we\u2019re all doing a lot too there we have the deepest pockets they are going to have some issues too, but I think from a liability standpoint, I think it's shared in that sense that I'll ask Roger to make a comment on this. Roger George : Hi, it is Roger George, General Counsel. The doctor is writing the prescription and then treating the patient, so that is where they start. That's our common model. Operator : The next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sachin Kulkarni : Hi, it is Sachin in for Brandon. David if we look back four years ago, 3Q12 was on the very few periods historically that Aligner has come short of its revenue guidance. And at that time, you pointed to noise around Olympics as well as the pullback in advertising activity because of the event, so I am curious did you apply an extra dose of conservatism or not with respect to your initial 3Q guidance with upcoming Olympic and for which extent did you consider that factor if at all? David White : Well, I wasn\u2019t here four years ago, but I think that\u2019s an interesting cause well I haven\u2019t heard that one before since I have been here. I can tell you as it relates to our Q3 guidance that we have given today that didn\u2019t enter into our thinking at all. And we basically approach our guidance the way we typically approach it, looking at the strength of the prior quarter, the doctor engagements, et cetera. And that particular factor wasn\u2019t considered. Sachin Kulkarni : And also could you walk us through impact of the anniversarying of the aligner policy change in the second half on both the revenues and the P&L? David White : So, it continues to be a drag on earnings and it will be drag on earnings for as we said a year ago, for at least a couple of years as we work off those grandfathered cases. But starting in Q3, however, it won't be a drag on a year-over-year compare because Q3 2015 was the first quarter in which we actually implemented that policy. So, I think those -- we won't talk about it necessarily so much on a year-over-year basis, but it still will be a drag to some extent. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw : Just a two couple of little household housekeeping items, the ERP, I mean once we get to fourth quarter, can you give us a sense for what the swing is on OpEx between say 3Q and 4Q just for underlying purposes once we get past that ramp? David White : Yes. So, Steve, it\u2019s going to be a little bit up in Q2, about a little bit less than a couple of million dollars, primarily as I indicated in my comments that, the stabilization phase is not capitalizable. So, that\u2019s an uptick in Q3 and when we get to Q4, we would expect that principally to reverse itself almost dollar for dollar as those costs begin to drop off. Steve Beuchaw : And then just one Joe sort of reflecting back on your prepared remarks, probably the most positive I have heard you in your tone around third-party scanners and their contribution, I wonder if you could just expand upon that, I mean what is it you're saying there that is incremental here and could you give us a sense for where you think volumes are headed there? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Steve, I think my enthusiasm is around just the scanners in general when you see the percent of scanner are getting right now, they come into organization approaching 50%. I mean it is a lot to us from a quality standpoint and how we can build our customer base, so I think I interpreted my enthusiasm more around just the scanning piece than it is third-party or whatever. Our scanning business obviously is having a really good year and we are expecting it to have a very strong this year too, and it's not just selling scanners, it's just what it does it reinforces from a customer base standpoint, both through GPs and Orthos, and just makes things easier for us. And it gives a wonderful platform in the sense to use that scanner for additional products, making things easier for our customer base. As far as the third party piece, as shown in 3M or whatever, we're just seeing continued growth of those. There is nothing I would say that that's entotic about it. But it's just good strong linear growth going forward. And so that's helpful also. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel. Please go ahead. Jon Block : I might have a two or three. And numbers look really good. So I'm actually going to focus on the FCC deal that you announced. The first one Joe, I'm still a little confused. You mentioned 1% or 2% cannibalized. But when I look at your cases and sort of lean on the Analyst Day, spread seems to be 15% plus. So can you sort of walk us through numbers, or rectify them. Why Express 15 plus, you are cannibalizing one and two. Is that just because of the lack of attachments in the ITR? Joe Hogan : Hi Jon it is Joe. When you look at there is different protocols on this and so it's not just a number of aligners. It's what\u2019s done. So just from an overall standpoint, remember there is no ITR as it's been on these, there is no attachments and obviously on E5 you wouldn\u2019t have attachments, but E10 you do sometimes. Secondly is, it's not directly it doesn\u2019t move lower. They are basically moving so-so swiftly, and they\u2019re moving with different velocity and different rates. And when you add that all up, it really comes after to as a very small overlap on that piece. Now your question has to do with our Express line. I think those overlaps are like 4% on E10, 8% on E5. When you are running against our whole portfolio, that's where you get less than 2% to the whole thing. So, we have a track pretty well. We know this well. That's why we're confident about the minimum amount of cannibalization we would expect as we go into market. Jon Block : Okay. And maybe, can you give any details on what you are going to ship aligners to FCC in terms of the cost that they don\u2019t pay on the revenue that you will recognize on those aligners? Joe Hogan : So we have not disclosed, Jon, the pricing of those aligners. What we have disclosed is that the pricing is dependent upon volume discounts. And as their business ramps, they will earn lower pricing. But when you look at it on an incremental basis, we priced it basically on a pro-liner basis. We believe it's going to be accretive to the Company, both from a revenue standpoint as well as from an operating margin standpoint. Jon Block : So, I get that, and accretive to you guys. But is it going to be dilutive to your customers, and that\u2019s maybe my final question, and then I have got more and I'll take them offline. But that's what I'm having a really hard time here with is. Joe you came in and you did such a great job, sort of walking off to the customers, shaking hands and eliminating the main point of friction with the additional aligner policy. And it seems like to me, is this a risk that you just sort of bring back in a main point of friction, because you are going to have a subset of docs who believe they are Express business in some other cases are now being pointed to that whole business? Thank you, guys. Joe Hogan : Jon, it's a fair question. And obviously it was something we strategically had to wrestle with inside the Company as we work with SmileDirectClub. But I think you can see that as we work through this, when you looked at, we keep the Invisalign product within SmartTrack, SmartStage, all the pieces of that, Invisalign brand name, all that stages at doctor's office. And also see this is EX30 it is basic dental materials that\u2019s been out there for years.  There is no ginger of a cut straight rail system it's going to a group where we feel demographics that are a lot more concerned with convenience and cost. And then when we ran those protocols that we just talked about and showed the less than 2% would be an issue for us from a cannibalization standpoint. And I make stat Jon honestly with when you look at what's going to on overall in the market place right now with direct to consumer, you just saw the thing with Dollar Shave Club and what Unilever had to pay for that company, because they were late to that game.  I really felt that for a lot of reasons both from an offensive standpoint and a new market standpoint, that this would be balanced well with concerns from a customer base. And we will do our best to ensure our customer base if this isn\u2019t intended that way. And we'll work as best to see to continue to target the demographic that they have been targeting and being successful with. Jon Block : Alright. Thanks for your time guys. Joe Hogan : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Please go ahead. John Kreger : Hi thanks very much, I had a CapEx question. I think at Analyst Day you talked about over the next few years moving both planning and our fabrication to Europe and Asia, can you just remind us the timing of that and if we should assume any sort of a step up in CapEx to do it and when you layer the volume of SmileDirect on, will that prompt any sort of retrofitting anywhere else? Joe Hogan : So John, we have actually begun some of the activities incidental to expanding our pace of international operating activities. So as an example, we established in Europe a base where doctors who are submitting physical impressions, can send them to a European address to have them scanned. Those are sending them all the way to Juarez. So we have implemented that. And so you've seen, there has been some CapEx associated with that and there has been some operating expenses for starting that activity up.  We have also begun looking at establishing some treat capacity in some of our regions and begun piloting some of that with small numbers of people and experimenting with how those work flows might work. As it relates to a bigger piece which would be doing Aligner Fabrication, that is still further add to the future, 2017 plus. And so, we will begin to see some of that now. And when you look at our gross margins actually for guidance in Q3, there is a little of an impact from that. As far as CapEx standpoint is concerned, STC won't really impact that very significantly. Their volume is relative to our, volumes are still very modest. And we wouldn\u2019t expect the uptick to be meaningful. As it relates to the rest of our business, probably for the next two years or so, I think as that infrastructure begins getting placed geographically, we would probably see a little bit higher CapEx than what we normally experience. And that at which point as those operating are established and the brick and mortars up, we would probably expect CapEx return to kind of a nominal rate we saw historically. John Kreger : Great thanks and just one more, Joe, stepping back if you think about your opportunity with that Clear Aligners, the bigger opportunity which seem to be teens, but that tends to have a little bit lower volume growth for you, what do you think you need to do to get teen growth equal to or outpacing your adult case lines? Joe Hogan : Yes I think, at our Investors Meeting recently in New York, I think we laid that out pretty well. When you look at first of all from an R&D standpoint. China moved from a chronological standpoint backward to the pilot expansion and main digital expansion kind of devices that we announced that we'll have in the marketplace in 2017 is one part of that. Secondly is a sense of how we go to consumers and how we communicate Invisalign capability to the consumer base. Honestly, a lot of our approach to that marketplace over the years has been primarily through our results and that\u2019s all demographic. And we feel pretty strongly as we move into next year, we\u2019re going to have to - really there is two sides this equation. As you look at the three people involved normally in teens, you have a father, you have a mother, and then you\u2019re going to have the teen and then you also have a doctor. We found that overtime you get to win two out of three. And I think often we win the one with teen we lose the mom, or we lose the doc. And so we\u2019re working on both ends hard from an advertising standpoint to make sure we do better in working with our docs in the sense of our teen capability and expanding it coming forward. And then secondly is to get to the mom in a much better way, particularly around compliance, a lot of mothers or fathers have concerns of their teens really were aware of the amount of time that\u2019s needed to properly move the teen. We found out through over the years that actually teens are more compliant than adults. And so we\u2019re very confident. And frankly the dentition and teen are really helpful in the sense of how loose the dentition is and how fast we can actually move teen teeth. So, as we speak, we\u2019re working hard in a sense of how we\u2019re going to approach teens next year. It\u2019s a great question, because it is obviously 75% of the marketplace, and it\u2019s one that we have not obviously penetrated thoroughly. And I think we can make some really good progress in the next year. David White : Hi John just to add a little bit color to Joe\u2019s comments there. If you look at our teen growth, our teen growth is still north of 20% year-over-year, which we think is really outstanding in a market that\u2019s only growing 3% to 4%. You know that share that we\u2019re taking away from large in brackets. And I think when you look at the 20% it made a lag our overall growth as a company by maybe a point or two. But I think some of that is largely attributable to the fact that our international business is growing faster than what we\u2019re growing here in North America.  And their business is more dominated by treatment of adults. So as our international business has been growing at those faster rates, it had somewhat of a dilutive impact on our overall teen growth, because our teen is more dominated here in the U.S. So we still feel like that the teen business is growing great and still feel like we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities still headed of us there. John Kreger : Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter : Hi thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the CDC, I\u2019m curious if you could characterize for us the type of customer or consumer that just the lead generation aspect to the type of customer or consumer that\u2019s going to SmileDirect and how will that compares to who is learning or coming to Fair Aligners through your Web site. Did you do any research, or do you have any information there about kind of the types, who were just getting this type of products versus traditionally who goes through the doc locater and traditionally on your align channel? Joe Hogan : You know I could day that we don\u2019t have exhaustive data on that. I mean what SmileDirectClub has shared with us. the demographic end tend to be heavily weighted toward women versus men, which we see in our demographics too. But these are people that are really often millennials. The convenience is really important to them. If they have a certain want, from a freedom standpoint as such that visiting doctors' offices, there is obviously a price point here too that's something simple in the sense of what they want to move from inclusion standpoint. So it's not necessarily a gender difference from what we've done or an age difference, but it's a preference difference in the sense of how people want to engage from what we can see so far. Richard Newitter : Okay and then maybe just turning one financial one, on gross margin, I think you said that you have some manufacturing start up cost for you APAC kind of initiatives there bringing manufacturing closer to that part of the world, that's going to impact the step down in gross margin in third quarter. Can you just give us a sense as to whether or not that is kind of finite nature or should we kind of think of that as kind of a go forward kind of gross margin rate for future quarters modeling or how should we think about that? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Yes, I would say it's probably more of a go forward rate, but let me give you a little bit more color to that, because I was answering that question in the context of a CapEx discussion. When you actually look at the biggest impact on gross margins and the fact that they are declining just slightly quarter-over-quarter, the biggest impact is from our scanner business, which has a gross margin that is in the low 50s. And as that business is growing more than doubling on year-over-year basis, it's having a little bit more of a dilutive impact on overall gross margins. But I would say that the guidance we've given for Q3 is probably the best guidance we could give you on a more going forward basis as well. Richard Newitter : Okay, thanks. And if I could squeeze one more in. I believe you said you had the G6 product launching in the U.S., so you had anticipated that, I was just wondering any initial feedback there and how that launch is going assuming it's already happened? Joe Hogan : We've launched G6 in the U.S. G6 functions well. I mean we have good feedback on it, but honestly when you look at the demographics again of this, it moves to Asian, because extraction cases in Asia are way over board in a sense of number of cases they see. So It's being used in North America, it's been successful, it's growing in that sense, but predominantly it's been an APAC product. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Rich. Operator, we will take one last question, please. Operator : Okay, the last question today comes from Chris Lewis of ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead. Christopher Lewis : Hey guys thanks for squeezing me in. Shirley Stacy : Hi Chris. Christopher Lewis : I guess first just on North American price increase, can you quantify what the increase was on the timing of that and the rest of just what you've seen since you have implemented that pricing strategy? Joe Hogan : Yes, the price increase was effective April 1, so we saw just a partial impact of that in the second quarter. The magnitude of the price increase vary depending upon the products that are primarily applied to our full stage products and varied anywhere from $50 to I think $70 to $80. Christopher Lewis : Okay got it, so it's reasonable to assume that at least in North America ASP trend up in the third quarter from second quarter? Joe Hogan : From a revenue standpoint, yes. There are other factors however though when you go into the third quarter, because typically we have more promotion activity going on in the third quarter particularly for teens, but holding that aside, you are right. Christopher Lewis : Understood, and then just turning to actuarial element, understands it's going to increase sequentially. Are you still working through the backlog there and if so when do you think that will be kind of more on a normalized basis. I guess I'm looking beyond the third quarter and just kind of trying to gauge where sales go post to 3Q? Thanks. Joe Hogan : So, I think one of the things we've been very fortunate where this that, demand that we saw and post the announcement of the product in March of 2015 has continued to almost outpace our ability to deliver. And so we\u2019ve had a very good first half of the year with orders maintain that backlog in spite of our increased efforts to get ahead of it. We would expect that more nominal way to backlog would probably be somewhere in the half the levels that we have today. And we think that would be somewhere maybe towards the end of the year by the time we would catch up. Christopher Lewis : Okay great and then just one more from me, as we think of that full list of new scanners being placed, it sounds like mostly in the GP channel. When do you think that will really start to translate into utilization? And do you think - is there an immediate pick up, uptick in utilization, once the GP receives that scanner or is a bit of a lag effect there? Thanks. Joe Hogan : We still wrestle with that question. Honestly, Chris I think obviously there is an immediate pick up if they are a user today, from an Invisalign standpoint, they turn all the impressions over to iTero, and you see it immediately. But as far as, they actually keep doing more and more cases, we have more and more data say that\u2019s true. We can't quantify exactly right now, exactly how true that is and to what degree it occurs. Christopher Lewis : Okay, thanks for the time. Shirley Stacy : Thank you everyone - sorry operator. I\u2019ll go ahead and close. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your time. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Align Investor Relations. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today in conjunction with our Q3 earnings announcement, we also announced the retirement of David White, who will step down as CFO on November 10. David's been a key contributor to our business growth over the past three years and the board and I want to thank David for his dedication and wish him the best in his retirement. We're fortunate that David will stay on with the company through February 2017 to work on certain planning and ERP implementation projects and ensure a smooth transition with his successor, John Morici. I'm pleased to have John join Align and here with us today on this call. I've known and respected John for years. I've watched him grow and kept up with his career for over 16 years and have a huge amount of confidence in him. John is an experienced CFO and General Manager who can partner with me and the leadership team to accelerate progress. He has financial experience across several large dynamic companies including Abbott Labs, GE, NBCUniversal, so he can scale with the growth we expect from Align in the upcoming years. John doesn't officially start until the November 10, so we won't make him answer any questions about the business, but he'll be happy to take a couple of your questions during Q&A about why he's so excited about joining Align. Let me now turn to our third quarter results. On our call today, I'll provide some financial highlights and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Clear Aligners and intraoral scanners. David will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and open up the call to questions. Q3 was a solid quarter with revenue, margin, and EPS each above the high-end of our guidance. Our results were driven by record Invisalign case volume, up 20.5% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all customer channels and geographies as well as continued demand for iTero scanners. The Q3 North American Clear Aligner volume was up slightly, 0.9% sequentially, consistent with historical Q2 to Q3 norms, and up 14.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, North American orthos were up, driven by teenage cases which increased 20% from Q2, and contributing to another record quarter for ortho utilization. This was offset by North America GP volumes which were down sequentially, primarily due to a seasonally slower period for GPs as well as weaker dental market. The GP channel remains challenging, particularly among low volume practices. On a year-over-year basis, North American ortho volume was strong and GP growth rate was solid, especially considering tougher 2015 comps. We believe North America still has a lot of headroom for growth as we continue to execute our strategic initiatives, including new products and technology innovation, evolving our go-to-market approach, and leveraging the TFM model that has been so successful in EMEA, and rolling out new Teen initiatives, including a new consumer campaign next year. In the GP market specifically, we're working to scale two very successful practice development programs led by key opinion leaders, increasing our focus on DSOs and large group practices. And in October, we began piloting Invisalign Go, our new product engineered specifically for GP dentists, with full commercial launch in the second half of 2017. Q3 Invisalign volume for international doctors was roughly flat, 0.5% sequential, driven by strong growth in Asia-Pacific offset by summer seasonality in EMEA, especially in Southern Europe where doctors and their patients typically take extended holidays. On a year-over-year basis, international Invisalign volume was up 33.8%, reflecting continued strong performance across both EMEA and APAC. In EMEA, Q3 volume was up 27% year-over-year, reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign in core markets like Spain and France as well as rapid growth from expansion into new country markets including Eastern Europe, Benelux, and Nordic regions. In Asia-Pacific, we had another record quarter with volumes up sequentially and up 44.3% year-over-year led by China and Japan. Most APAC country markets had record shipments including China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia markets. In addition, we continue to see positive industry response at major events across the region, including the Guangdong (06:33) Ortho Society Meeting, one of the biggest in China. During Q3, we announced multiple innovations that enhance Invisalign treatment planning and predictability of treatment outcome. Invisalign G7, which we announced in October, builds on earlier Invisalign G-series releases with new features to fine-tune certain tooth movement and deliver excellent treatment outcomes that doctors expect, especially with Teen. We also announced ClinCheck Pro 5.0, which has new features that deliver an exceptional user experience and new visuals along with increased control for doctors during treatment planning. Finally, we are very excited to announce our new one-week wear recommendation for all Invisalign Teen and Full products. Based on the predictability of the Invisalign system and our experience as well as patient case data shared by our customers who have been prescribing weekly aligner changes, we believe that for most cases, one-week wear can deliver shorter treatment times for patients and greater efficiency for Invisalign practices. Turning to the Teen market, 162,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign over the past 12 months, an increase of 21% compared to the same 12-month period in 2015. For Q3, the total number of teenagers using Invisalign increased 19% sequentially and up 17.4% year-over-year driven by continued adoption worldwide. In Q3, we saw a strong uptick among teenagers using Invisalign outside the United States, up 36% year-over-year, with strong growth particularly from Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 51% of the total international Teen cases. For North American orthos, Q3 Teen volume increased about 14%. It was lower than expected and not as robust as Q3 last year when we ran several Teen-specific promotions that drove incremental Teen volume. Q3 will serve as a good baseline as we head into next year where we intend to launch a major Teen program and a new direct-to-consumer campaign with greater investment in targeting teenagers more directly than ever have before. While we're pleased with our Q3 results, our incoming case receipts in North America were lower than expected. We believe case receipts were impacted primarily due to a weaker dental market for GPs as well as a lack of Teen promotional activity for orthos. Today, with more than a month into Q4, I'm pleased to report that our North America case receipts have since improved and the demand outlook appears solid. David will provide more details in his business outlook. Our integrated consumer marketing campaigns in North America, EMEA, and APAC leverage traditional paid media, search, digital marketing, PR and social media to engage consumers at every point in the consumer purchase journey. Consumer interest and demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow. In Q3, we celebrated a major patient milestone and launched a global social media and advertising campaign to promote the London-based 4 millionth Invisalign patient. We promoted this milestone as a part of our partnership with Operation Smile with Align Technology donating $1 to Operation Smile for every public share of a photo of a person's smile on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram with a #4millionsmiles for a total donation of up to $1 million. The #4millionsmiles campaign has been a great success in driving region awareness of the Invisalign brand around the globe and with this hashtag being seen over 51 million times around the world. In North America, we saw positive gains in our consumer engagement and conversion metrics including web traffic conversion, doc locator searches and consumer opting for more information on treatment. In September, we partnered with the AAO at the start of New York City Fashion Week to highlight the best fashion accessory ever : a great smile as a result of Invisalign treatment. The Invisalign brand was a primary event sponsor and created an Invisalign lounge experience to showcase the power of a confident smile through Invisalign patient testimonials, iTero scans and consults with New York City area orthodontists. In EMEA, our consumer outreach focused primarily on our #4millionsmiles campaign and the launch of the patient experience program in the U.K. market. This program is aimed at helping Invisalign providers create an excellent patient experience and includes learning modules aimed at practice staff to help them discuss Invisalign treatment with prospective new patients. In Asia-Pacific, our consumer marketing campaigns are focused on demand generation in key markets including China, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan. In China, for example, our big bang consumer outreach program has focused on consumer engagement through Invisalign providers and social media KOLs, or key opinion leaders. This campaign delivered a 380% year-over-year increase in consumer web traffic and is on track to deliver 150,000 lead generations behind this campaign. We'll also continue to see traction in our Australia Teen campaign. In Q3, our Scanner business revenues were up 35% sequentially and up 274% year-over-year, reflecting a record number of units shipped in the quarter, primarily in North America. Demand for the iTero Element scanner has stabilized. At the recent ADA meeting in Denver, we announced new software upgrades for our market-leading iTero Element Intraoral Scanner and Invisalign Outcome Simulator. Only iTero scanners provide an optimized Invisalign scanning and treatment experience that includes the enhanced Invisalign Outcome Simulator 4.0 application, now with Invisalign 3D Progress Tracking and Patient Simulation Sharing. The 3D Progress Tracking feature gives Invisalign providers the ability to compare a patient's new scan with a specific stage of ClinCheck treatment planned to visually assess and communicate Invisalign treatment progress with an easy-to-read color-coded tooth movement report that allows the doctors to know how each tooth is tracking. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to expand. The Q3 total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner worldwide increased 39.6%, which reflects a record 48.4% from North America and 22% from international doctors. While these scans are predominantly from our own iTero scanner, we're also seeing some uptake from 3M's True Def and Sirona's Omnicam scanners. We also completed the final validation process for 3Shape's TRIOS scanner, TRIOS Standard, TRIOS Color and TRIOS 3, in which Invisalign providers with a TRIOS scanner can now submit digital scans as part of the Invisalign case submissions. Now, I'll turn to the supply agreement we announced in July with SmileDirectClub for the emerging doctor-directed, at-home aligner market. Our agreement with SmileDirectClub is to manufacture non-Invisalign aligners for simple cases, which include up to 20 sets of aligners with no IPR attachments and are produced with an off-the-shelf polymer material. On October 15, we began accepting cases from SDC and subsequently started manufacturing aligners. We also recently implemented the Invisalign referral process for sending patients whose case falls outside the scope of the agreed upon SDC protocols to Invisalign providers and began scheduling Invisalign consultation appointments. While this is still early, we are pleased with our initial progress and remain excited about the untapped opportunity to help provide access to treatment for consumers who wouldn't otherwise seek orthodontic treatment. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Let's review our third quarter financial results. Total company revenue for the third quarter was $278.6 million, up 3.4% from the prior quarter and up 34.2% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Third quarter Clear Aligner revenue of $243.7 million was flat sequentially, reflecting a slight increase in Clear Aligner volumes. Our year-over-year revenue growth of 22.9%, reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies as well as our price increase in international markets. Note that this past July marks a full year since we implemented the Additional Aligner policy, and therefore, our year-over-year comparisons no longer reflects the impact from this policy change. That said, our results still, however, reflect the impact from the grandfathered cases that were under the previous policy. Q3 ASPs were flat from Q2 at about $1,285, reflecting a slightly higher mix of Full and Teen product, the partial impact of the international price increase, which were offset by several factors including higher product discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 ASPs were up $26 primarily due to a price increase this year, partially offset by higher product discounts. For the third quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 177,800 cases were flat sequentially reflecting growth from our North American orthos and APAC region offset by seasonality across North American GPs and the EMEA region. Year-over-year case volume growth was 20.5%, driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volumes was up 3.8% sequentially and up 18.2% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, case volume was down 2.7% sequentially and up 9.8% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was down 0.5% sequentially and up 33.8% year-over-year reflecting continued expansion of our customer base as well as increased utilization. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q3 was 5.0 cases per doctor, up from 4.7 in Q3 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 11.1, up from 9.9 in the prior year. North America GP utilization was 3.0, slightly up from 2.9 in the prior year. And international utilization was 4.9, up from 4.6 cases per doctor in Q3 last year, driven primarily by increased utilization in EMEA. In Q3, we added 2,615 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, 1,300 of which were new North American doctors and 1,315 of which were new international doctors. This compares to 2,885 in Q2 and 2,260 in the same quarter last year. Our Scanner and Services revenues for the third quarter was $34.9 million, up 34.7% sequentially and up 273.7% year-over-year. Moving on to gross margin, third quarter overall gross margin was 75.1%, down 1.1 points sequentially and down 0.8 points year-over-year, both primarily attributable to a larger percentage of Scanner and Services revenue which carries a lower margin than Clear Aligner. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 77.7%, down 0.9 points sequentially and down 1.1 point year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by a higher number of aligners per case, partially offset by seasonally lower training. The year-over-year gross margin decrease was primarily driven by a higher number of aligners per case, partially offset by higher worldwide ASP. Q3 gross margin for our Scanner segment was a record 57.1%, up 3.5 points sequentially and 42.4 points year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year increases in gross margin were primarily a result of higher ASPs and the lower manufacturing costs of our iTero Element scanner relative to its prior version. Q3 operating expenses were $147.1 million, up sequentially by $7 million or 5%, primarily due to payroll and other costs related to increased head count, higher depreciation as we started to depreciate our newly-implemented ERP system, as well as post go-live support costs, but those should be decreasing over the short-term. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 operating expenses were up $27.6 million or 23.1%, reflecting increased head count and continued investment in our go-to-market activities incidental to the growth of the business. Our third quarter operating margin was 22.3%, down 1.9 points sequentially and up 4 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to slightly lower Clear Aligner gross margins, a higher mix of Scanner revenue, which while I mentioned achieved record performance, carries a lower gross margin, as well as higher operating expenses. On a year-over-year basis, increased operating margin primarily reflects lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue due to volume leverage achieved on our year-over-year growth. With regards to our third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 18.4% compared to 23.2% in Q2 2016. Our Q3 tax rate was lower by approximately 5 points due to a one-time benefit from our new international corporate structure, which we implemented in conjunction with our ERP. Commencing in the third quarter, we also began including our relationships with SmileDirectClub in our reported results. While we didn't actually commence shipping product to them until the current quarter, our equity investment in SDC requires that we report our proportionate share of their losses. Our share of that loss is reported below operating margin and our tax provision and is entitled equity in losses of investee. This Q3 loss net of tax was approximately $0.5 million. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.63 compared to $0.62 reported in Q2 and $0.34 reported in the same quarter last year. Moving on to the balance sheet, for the third quarter, our accounts receivable balance was $245 million, up approximately 27% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 78 days, up 14 days sequentially and year-over-year as a result of our new ERP system and other related systems that impacted the timing of some of our customer collections. We would anticipate that our DSOs will remain above our historical average for several quarters as we work through these changes. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $17.3 million, primarily related to equipment purchases to expand our manufacturing capacity in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, and to a lesser extent our ERP implementation. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $59.8 million, and free cash flow for the third quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $42.5 million. During the quarter, we concluded our previously announced $50 million accelerated stock repurchase with final delivery of 143,310 shares and purchased an additional 88,000 shares amounting to $8.2 million in open market repurchases. These repurchases were collectively part of a three-year $300 million stock repurchase program announced on April 23, 2014. In addition to the April 2014 repurchase plan, Align also announced on April 28 of this year a new plan to repurchase up to an additional $300 million of the company's stock. There remains approximately $341.8 million available for repurchases under these two existing stock repurchase authorizations. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long term investments, were $675.8 million. This compares to $678.7 million at the end of 2015, a decrease of approximately $2.9 million. Of our $675.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $288.3 million was held by the U.S. and $387.5 million was held by our international entities. Our U.S. balances were up $107 million quarter-over-quarter, of which $147 million was contributed a result of implementing our new international corporate structure, which was then reduced by our investment in SDC of about $47 million. As of September 30, 2016, the balance of our equity method investments for SmileDirectClub was $46.3 million. With that, let's now turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook, as Joe mentioned in his comments, our incoming case receipts in North America in Q3 were slower than we had originally anticipated, and given in our targeted turnaround time to our customers, we shipped much of our backlog as of quarter end. Since then, our case receipts in North America have improved and returned to a year-over-year growth rate early in the quarter that is well ahead of both our second and third quarter performance. As such, our outlook for Q4 appears solid. However, lower Q3 case receipts and less backlog will dampen our Q4 shipment growth rate as our backlog begins to naturally return to normal levels. As such, our Q4 guidance reflects this impact. On a longer term basis, we remain confident that our Invisalign revenue growth on a full year basis will be within the upper half of our long-term model range of 15% to 25%. With that backdrop, for our international markets, Invisalign demand remains strong and we would expect Invisalign volume in Q4 to be up sequentially driven by growth in EMEA coming off a seasonally slower summer period. APAC is usually seasonally down sequentially coming off a strong summer. For North America, we would expect North America Invisalign volumes in Q4 to be flat primarily as a result of the factors I just described. For our Scanner business, we expect scanner shipments to be up sequentially as the iTero Element continues to penetrate the market. With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows : Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 182,500 cases to 184,500 cases, up approximately 15% over the same period a year ago, reflecting continued strong growth from international but muted by the factors just described. We expect Q4 net revenues to be in the range of $289.2 million to $293.9 million, an increase of 27.6% year-over-year and well above our long-term target of 15% to 25%. We expect Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 74.7% to 75.1%, essentially flat sequentially, primarily due to an increased mix of Scanner business and lower margins and slightly lower Clear Aligner ASPs. We expect Q4 operating expenses to be in the range of $149.6 million to $150.6 million, up quarter over quarter primarily due to increased head count, offset by seasonally less advertising and lower ERP post go-live support cost. Q4 operating margin should increase sequentially and be in the range of 23.0% to 23.9%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 22%. We estimate the Q4 impact of the SmileDirectClub transaction will reduce diluted EPS by less than $0.01 per share. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.5 million shares exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q4 diluted EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.67. Before I turn the call back over to Joe, I want to say a few things about my decision to retire and spend more time with my family. This is something my wife, Nikki (27:20) and I have thought about and planned for some time and communicated to Joe. This timing has afforded Joe and the board time to find a replacement for me before I step down. I want to thank many of you who I've worked with and come to know well over the past few years. It has been a pleasure working for such a great company, and I feel honored to have been a part of history in the making as we transform and modernize the orthodontic industry. But it's not time to say good-bye just yet. Although John will start this week and I will hand over formal CFO responsibilities immediately, I will work closely with him in the coming months, and you will see us together at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings. Until then, let's turn the time to Joe for his closing comments and then open the call up for your questions. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, David. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q3 results, especially the continued strength from our EMEA and APAC region. Notwithstanding weaker-than-expected North America case receipts in Q3, our business remains solid and on track. Based on the high end of our Q4 guidance, the implied full-year results will be significantly higher than our original outlook provided in January with 28% revenue growth, 20% Clear Aligner volume growth, and 23% operating margins. We have a huge opportunity in front of us to replace wires and brackets and transform the orthodontic market. As we continue to execute on our strategic plans, I'm confident in our ability to outpace the market and achieve revenue growth for 2016 and beyond at the upper end of our target of 15% to 25%. Looking forward to following up with many of you in the coming weeks at various conferences and industry meeting. I'll now open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Unknown Speaker : Yeah, hi. This is Jack (29:33) on for Steve. Just a question looking at the trends in the business. Clearly, the Scanner business is doing very well. The Aligner franchise not going quite as strongly as we thought into 4Q, obviously with some of the weakness in North America. But I'm wondering if there's anything going on with the sales force and if there's a bandwidth issue at all there with Scanners drawing so much attention? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Jack (29:59), it's Joe. I'd say the definitive answer to your question is absolutely not. We obviously watch that closely to make sure that we primarily focus on where the focus needs to be by sales rep. And I'd also just take a difference with your initial comment as I think the overall Aligner market continues to be strong. We had little bit of a speed bump in third quarter from an order standpoint. It's mainly GPs, low-submitting GPs that we've talked about before. But overall, in the forecast that we've given you for fourth quarter and fortunately given the timing of the call today, we get a good clear October look. We're very confident to be on the upper-end of our 15% to 25% revenue growth that we've been indicating over the last 18 months or so. Unknown Speaker : Okay. That's good. And just on the one-week aligner policy that you introduced about a month ago, just curious what doctor uptake has been like so far, and how quickly you might expect that to start to become the norm? And I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, as we mentioned in the release, many doctors were already experimenting or were actually utilizing one-week wear, not just in North America but all over the world. So many are just continuing with what they were doing. Overall, we've had a very positive response. Again, we leave this in the doctor's hands. There are some cases, we don't think majority of the cases at all they might have to move to two weeks at some point in time, but we feel by far the majority of our cases could go with one-week wear with a lot of confidence in the teens market also in the sense that their dentition being looser and being able to move more quickly. So we're not predicting an immediate surge in orders based on one-week wear, but we think it's just another aspect of our go-to-market that makes Invisalign very enticing for patients versus wire and brackets. Okay, Jack (31:53)? Unknown Speaker : Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Unknown Speaker : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Congrats on these strong results. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Steve. Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hey, so I guess just for us, you had a comment about the Q4 shipments growth rate and you're reflecting the backlog beginning to return to normal levels. Just curious to make sure that that should work itself through in the fourth quarter such that if the strong volume you saw in October carries over into early next year that we should mechanically then obviously see some improvement in the year-over-year growth as we go into early 2017. Is that the right way to think about that? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Steve, just to back up on it. Yeah, we expect that to stabilize in the fourth quarter. That's why we called the shipment rates that we've been calling for you too. If I interpreted the second part of your question is as we move into 2017, should we be on a stronger footing in the sense of a backlog, that's our plan. Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. So the backlog will not extend beyond one quarter, basically? That's what I was trying to clarify. So sorry for the poor wording the first time around, so. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Correct, Steve. It will naturally return to its nominal levels this quarter as our case volumes recover \u2013 case receipt volumes recover and as we're seeing early in the quarter so far. Steven J. Valiquette - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay, got it. Okay. All right. Great. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe or David, as we think about the economic sensitivity of the Clear Aligner business, to what extent do you think we've seen any of that bleed over into the ortho channel? And not wanting to really split hairs here, but the EMEA growth slowed a little bit sequentially. To what extent, if at all, have you seen any I guess economic effects there in the core Western Europe market, if at all? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I'll let David join in on this too. I wouldn't call these any macroeconomic effects as far as what we're seeing right now. Your comment about bleeding over into ortho, we had record utilization rates in ortho, up significantly. I think it's 9.9% to 11.1% in the quarter. So it shows terrific continued growth in ortho utilization with our product line. So we feel broadly this is a GP blip. This has been talked about in the marketplace in the third quarter that we saw in North America across the board, not just with Invisalign but with the dental market in general. But, again, our October order rates indicate that we're on track with the kind of growth we experienced in the second quarter of this year. And we think that will continue to \u2013 go ahead. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, Brandon, just to add a little color to that. When we look at our GP doctors by segment in terms of the case volume that they do, the doctors that are fully engaged with Invisalign have incorporated into their practices are typically less susceptible to softness in the market because their practice have been built really around \u2013 Invisalign has become such an integral part of their practice that they typically are on the offense in terms of business development. It's really more the lower-tier doctors that are still quite dabbling in Invisalign, haven't quite changed their practice flows and so forth. And so when we see an overall softening in the market, it tends to be those doctors that tend to be the first to pull back. And when we look at the Q3, that's precisely where we saw it, really those doctors that are at the lower volume levels. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Then one more for you, David. Through the operating cash flow and the DSO build in the period, why would it necessarily take several quarters for that to normalize? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, I hope it won't. We had a very successful implementation in July. We did have some delays in invoicing a few customers, and we're working through those right now and expect to have those worked out. When we sell to 30,000-plus customers at a time, it doesn't take very many to influence that DSO. And one of the things with most customers is when a sales tax rate or a VAT rate is incorrect, you typically wind up having to rebill the customer at the correct VAT rate or sales tax rate and then the clock starts all over again. And so we're generally up against that issue right there and we think over the next couple quarters it will be behind us. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Sure, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Two questions. The first one's got two parts, just one for Joe and David. So just to begin SDC, Joe, maybe if you can tell us what has been the Invisalign provider reaction to date? Anything surprised you on either the positive or negative side? And the second part of that question is for David. Anything on the 4Q 2016 revenue guidance on SDC? Since I believe, as you mentioned, they'll be shipping cases for the vast majority of the quarter. And then I've just got a quick follow up. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Jon, it's Joe. Look, I think honestly the provider reaction to this was anticipated. I think you picked it up in your analysis, too, with the 100 orthodontists or so that you do. Many orthodontists aren't happy with this. Many of them understand why we did it. I think they feel good about it not being Invisalign, that it's GX30 (37:52) and it's a lip roll kind of a system and not a gingiva cut. That it's just really a complete offtake of what the product that they were using before. Jon, so I think overall I haven't been surprised with the reaction. We haven't seen a response in the market that would be negative in some way. We're sitting here at the Ortho Summit, so we'll get on the ground feel here this week. But I would say overall good, because I think frankly there's an understanding in the marketplace of what we did and how we did this. That doesn't mean there's not a lot of passion about a doctor-directed kind of virtual model that exists out there. But we feel the response has been in line with what we had anticipated. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: And, Jon, to your second part of the question, really SDC didn't really impact any of our thinking as it relates to the Q4 guidance. When you look at our year-over-year growth that has been baked into our guidance, it really comes to two factors : one, which has to do with a renormalization of our backlog, if you call it that, coming off of Q3, a weaker case receipts; and then secondly, when you look at a year ago, Q4 of 2015, that quarter was up 25% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. And so it was just a rock-solid quarter for us. And so I think when you look at the compare quarter-over-quarter, I think you're seeing a comp there that's also having some bearing on it. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I'll follow up with you offline on that one, David. I guess I'm just wondering if you're recognizing revenue from shipping out the aligners, but I'll follow up with you offline on that one. The other one \u2013 just hate to burn one on Cadent, but I do think it's important. Just for 2017, Joe, how do we think about the scanner? And I'm just asking because it's a very different business than Invisalign, it's capital and you're coming off a big upgrade with Element. So just when we look at 2017, up, down, flat, specific to the Cadent business? Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: 2017, Jon, just to be clear, up. I'm not going to give you a percentage, but it will be up. I think you can see with our announcement with our simulator product and things that we're putting together, this scanner's really important for us in the sense of how we go to market with the orthos but particularly with GPs also. So think about that Scanner business as going up. Don't think of the margin being as dilutive as what we had talked about before as you put that in the model. Just think of it being almost equal to Invisalign in that sense. I'm going to let David backtrack here on the SDC fourth quarter piece and next year so we can just clear that up now with you, Jon. Okay? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. So back to that question, Jon, on SDC, very minimal revenue in our outlook this quarter for SDC. We really just got off, started in the middle of October. We're taking this very slowly as we integrate into their practice. So really a minimal consideration in the revenue guidance we gave for Q4. Very small. Going back to the Scanner, I just want to highlight one other thing about our Scanner business. There's two components to that business, one of which has to do with the sale of the hardware itself, the equipment, but then secondly the ongoing revenue that we recognize associated with maintenance and subscriptions and so forth. That revenue grows in proportion to our installed base, and as you've seen this year, our Scanner growth rate from a unit standpoint is quite significant. So the installed base is building actually quite nicely. And so that's going to form a nice foundation I think for the Scanner business going into 2017. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: All right, Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Joe, maybe following up on Jon's question, any other 2017 comments that you'd care to give us? You are certainly coming up against some very tough comps in terms of the Invisalign unit growth. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: John, I prefer not to give any more 2017 comments, but I think you can tell from my comments we're optimistic about 2017. We'll leave this year I mean obviously above guidance of what we gave you in 2016. Our international growth has been tremendous. Our ortho utilization numbers are good. Coming up next year we have several programs with GP in North America that we think will address some of the weakness that we've experienced. Invisalign Go that we've put in place is a big one, some of our key opinion leaders and how they go about the GP market right now has really been incredibly successful. Our TFM model that we're employing here in the United States not just in the ortho channel but the GP channel also, also gives us confidence that we can maintain that kind of momentum. But outside of that, I don't care to talk about any numbers and specifics, John. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just one other follow-up in terms of your comments about the slower incoming case receipts. When did you start to see that? We've heard other dental providers talking about slowdowns as early as June. Was that strictly in September? Or did you see it start earlier in the summer? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: So, John, it really began showing itself up in early July, and at the time when we were seeing it, we were thinking it just might be early seasonality. Even though we know that Q3 is a seasonally weaker quarter for GPs, a seasonally stronger quarter for ortho, particularly Teens, weaker seasonally EMEA, et cetera, that seasonality tends to move. And so sometimes it'll show up earlier or later. So in early July, we thought it was more just simply an earlier seasonality, and what wound up happening was it wound up being more seasonally weak, you might say, across almost the entire quarter. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Joe, just maybe one more kind of on the go-forward view, without maybe giving specific additional guidance on 2017. Can you give us a little more color or at least some of the things we should be thinking about as we refine our models for 2017, what puts and takes should we be considering on the cost side, whether it's mix shift, just things to bear in mind as you anniversary the ERP? Can you walk us through some of the things just to think about there? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: No, not really. Richard, we appreciate you wanting to fill out your spreadsheet for next year. We're trying to give you as broad a guidance and positive guidance as we can. But to really start to nail those specifics wouldn't be in line with the kind of information we normally devolve. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. When we get to the January earnings call for reporting year-end results we'll be glad to throw some meat on the bones, so to speak, to kind of describe our outlook into the year. But suffice it to say at this point, I think Joe's comments earlier about revenue growth and so forth and our long-term range, et cetera should suffice. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. And then maybe just \u2013 you put out there a confidence level to get to the kind of the upper part of your long-term range of 15% to 25%. Is that really just kind of the GP initiatives? Obviously some of the backlog normalizes, works itself out, but you are up against tougher comps this year. Should we just be thinking about that as really as these initiatives around kind of the GP segment? And then kind of marketing and new direct-to-consumer and Teen that are really kind of what give you the confidence there? Or is there something else? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, I mean, we didn't have easy comps this year when you look at \u2013 we had easy comps on 2015 versus 2014. But this year we had a, Richard, pretty difficult comp even what David just referenced in the fourth quarter last year what a tough time we had. So look, I think when we talk about or when I talk about the GP focus that we're going to have, the international growth focus on teens next year, all those things are just to focus in areas where we develop products and systems over the course of last 18 months that go after those areas that historically have been some soft areas for us that maybe more unpredictable than they should have been. The rest of this business, the international parts, the ortho utilization piece, those things are going really well. Did we lose you? Richard, are you there? Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Sorry, I was on mute. Yeah. No. Thanks. That's really helpful. And just maybe one last one. The difference between \u2013 what is GP Go do for you that kind of prior initiatives haven't in the past? Maybe just elaborate on that a little bit. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Richard, basically GPs don't want to be orthos. They haven't been trained in tooth movements and when you look at products like we have, like ClinCheck and our full case assessments and those things, they are, as much as we want to make them, they are very sophisticated products. It's almost like using 90% of PowerPoint, which most people can't. And so with GPs what we have to do is build their confidence in the sense that they can look at a case and quickly say, I can do this case and I can do it well for my patient or I can't, and just in a short kind of a statement that's what Invisalign Go is. You can scan that patient or take a photo of that patient, we'll quickly assess that, we'll tell that particular GP if they can actually handle that case. If they can, we can quickly work up a case assessment and give it to the customer while they're in the chair. It's a substantial difference than trying to in two days teach an ortho, I mean, a GP how to do ortho work, which is very difficult. We feel we can really integrate into a GP practice much more simply by making less complexity in a sense the way we do case assessments and the burden it would place on a GP to take that kind of burden. I hope that makes sense. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : It does. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, Jeff. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon. Hey, Joe. How are you guys? Let me start just by saying, David, best of luck in retirement. It's been great working with you for the last three years or so. So best of luck going forward. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. Appreciate that. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. So, Joe, let me ask a couple of questions here. I mean, again, kind of like John I hate to burn a question on the Scanner business but it's been so strong here. You mentioned kind of that being up next year. If I look at your second half numbers here what's kind of implied in fourth quarter guidance and the third quarter strong result, it looks like you're up 50-some percent sequentially even first half to second half of this year. So not to pin you in a corner but kind of up year-over-year based off the 2016 base? Or do we keep seeing growth even off these low-$30 million numbers which are just well above what I think any of us were probably thinking they would be at this point? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: I mean, growth over the 2016 base, Jeff. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): 2016 base. Yes. No. That's helpful and then, David, maybe a clarifying question on the margin side. You made comments in your prepared remarks about margins. I think you said gross margin is down a little bit year-over-year, next quarter, and you said that aligner ASP is down. You kind of made reference to some bigger promotions here in this quarter. I guess, I'm trying to figure out why aligner ASPs would be down in the fourth quarter if you've anniversaried through the additional aligner thing. Now you've got price increases. You also have the positive mix if the backlog on North America is a little lower than the OUS backlog I would think \u2013 or the OUS growth I would think would be helping ASPs next quarter, so just trying to reconcile margins being down next quarter \u2013 gross margins. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay. So, for a couple of things, one, as it relates to Clear Aligner, our \u2013 well, more about ASPs, which will impact that. ASPs are affected by product mix, and our low stage products are very heavily concentrated or more so concentrated, you might say, from a mix standpoint in our EMEA region than the rest of our business. And so since Q3 was a seasonally weaker quarter for EMEA and Q4 is seasonally stronger, that mix of low stage product is going enter into the equation and is going to influence the ASPs this next year, it will go up. That mix is going to go up by 1 plus points quarter-over-quarter and that will have some bearing on it. And then secondly, you've got doctors \u2013 this is the end of the advantage period for many of our doctors, and so as those doctors begin to get close to or approximate the next tier of their pricing, they'll begin to see lower prices, even this year early as they're running towards that December 31 date. So those two things right there are bringing down the ASP and bringing down very, very modestly the gross margin at the same time. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. That's helpful. And Joe, last question from me, I just want to make sure I understand clearly your comment on being in the upper half of that 15% to 25% range. I think you were talking Clear Aligners and you were saying get back to that by first quarter of 2017? Or is that just kind of a general comment getting back to that over the next few quarters? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, from an order rate standpoint, Jeff, we feel we'll be in that range in the fourth quarter. So as we move into the first quarter of next year, we feel that way and that is why I'm quoting, as you mentioned, Clear Aligners. This is not mixing Clear Aligners with the Scanner business. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. That's helpful. Thanks guys appreciate it. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: All right, Jeff. See you. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Operator, we'll take one more question, please? Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question, Mr. Jones. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the questions, and David, yeah, congratulations on the retirement. John, look forward to working with you. I guess, Joe, just wanted to go back to something you had said about what you're seeing in case receipts quarter-to-date? Wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. It sounded like you're saying based on what you're seeing to-date you do expect to return to the type of growth, case growth that is, that we saw in 2Q as we move into next year? Wanted to be clear that, A, I heard you correctly. And B, are you talking specifically about North American GPs? Or was that a reference to overall North American expectation for case growth? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: The 20% that we're talking about is overall for the Clear Aligner business, is what we see right now in October for the entire business. We're seeing better North America performance than what we saw in the third quarter. I haven't specifically referenced if that was GP or ortho. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: And better than Q2 as well. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Better than Q2. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Better than Q2. Okay. Got it. And then I guess just on the international side, it does look like the 4Q guidance for international cases seems to imply a bit of a slowdown there on a year-over-year basis. Just wanted to see if you could comment on some of the factors at play, do you feel like you're reaching any kind of capacity constraints? Anything else as far as, how quickly you can go after that big international opportunity? David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: So Bob, our factory basically fabricates aligners on a first-in first-out basis and without really much respect for where those aligners come from. And so when we talk about our case receipts increasing this quarter and our backlog and factory WIP returning to a more normalized level, that cuts across all regions of our business. And so whatever dampening effect it has, it is across all regions. So that's part of the reason. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. David L. White - Align Technology, Inc.: On the case receipt side though, international is very strong and it continues to be strong. Nothing's really changed there on the case receipt side. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thank you Bob. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks Bob. Operator : There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today I'll provide some highlights from the quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, care aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the first quarter and I'll offer some commentary on how we see the 2017 unfolding. Following that I will come back and summarize a few key points and then we'll open upto questions. Q4 was a strong to the year with revenues at the high end of guidance, up 27.3% year-over-year resulting from better than expected Invisalign and iTero volume, primarily in North America offset by lower ASPs, discounts and FX. Q4 Invisalign case shipment increased 6.9% sequentially reflecting an uptick in North America and EMEA, and was up 18.5% from the prior year driven by continued growth across all geographies and customer channels. Our iTero business also finished strong with scanner units up 27.7% sequentially and 171% compared to Q4 a year ago. EPS was $0.59 which was lower than our outlook primarily due a $0.08 impact from exchange rates on a strengthening U.S. dollar that John will explain further in his comments.  By all accounts 2016 was a terrific year for Align. We exceeded $1 billion in annual revenues for the first time in our history. We had more than 700,000 adults and teenagers store [indiscernible] with Invisalign care aligners and we more than tripled our shipments of iTero standards to nearly 4,000 units. All while delivering several new products expanding our global footprint in operations, establishing a new doctor direct-to-consumer channel, the small direct love and implementing an entirely new ERP system without any major business disruption. For Q4 North American Invisalign volume was up 5.7% sequentially driven by expansion of our customer base and increased utilization from both customer channels. During the quarter, North America Orthos gained momentum following our Invisalign Summit in November. And North American GP growth was driven by both Invisalign Full and Express family of products. On a year-over-year basis, a shipment growth of 15.2% was driven by continued adoption by North American Orthos has seen a record utilization and solid growth from GPs, especially with Invisalign Express. We continue to make progress with the Dental Service Organizations or what we call DSOs, the fastest growing segment of the dental industry which represents nearly 20% of the market today. In Q4, roughly 8% of our North American volume came from DSO practices and they outperformed private practices significantly, both in terms of growth rate and ortho utilization. Q4 Invisalign volume for international doctors was up 9.1% sequentially driven by strength in EMEA coming off Q3 summer seasonality, offset somewhat by seasonally a slower period in APAC. On a year-over-year basis international Invisalign volume was up 25% reflecting continued strong performance for both EMEA and APAC. In EMEA, Q4 volumes were up 20% year-over-year reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign in core market led by the UK, Spain, and France, as well as continued rapid growth in our expansion markets of Central Eastern Europe and Nordic. We also saw initial momentum with a successful launch of IGo. Our Q4 EMEA shipments do not reflect the strong underlying demand as our reported growth rates were dampened by the imbalance between receipts and shipments that we described in our Q3 earnings call. As our backlog in fact returns to more normalized levels in Q4, there was a dampening effect on the shipment that cut across all regions because the lines were fabricated and shipped on a first-in, first-out basis without regard to geographical regions, notwithstanding this EMEA still had a record quarter. In Asia Pacific, Q4 volumes were up 35% year-over-year led by China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. During the quarter we held numerous clinical education and training events across the region. In China more than 1,000 doctors attending an Invisalign Day at the China Orthodontic Society's Annual Meeting. In Japan we held Invisalign Forum with more than 200 doctors in attendance, and we participated in the Taiwan Association of Orthodontists meeting for the first time. We also successfully transitioned from indirect coverage in Korea to direct, our largest beauty/cosmetic surgery market in the world is in Korea. During the Teen market, or two-fourth of the total number of teenagers using Invisalign decreased 7.7% sequential as expected due to the seasonality and was up 19.7% year-over-year driven by continued adoption worldwide. Q4 is typically a seasonally slower quarter for teenage start. For the full year 169,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign, an increase of 19.6% we compared to last year. The International teen case starts represent about 30% of total teen starts and grew 31% in 2016 when compared to last year. Our results reflect solid execution of our strategic approach drivers which includes international expansion, driving ortho utilization of Invisalign, especially among teens, helping GPs treat and refer more patients; and lastly, ensuring that billions of potential patients that we generate through consumer demand program are offered Invisalign treatment. Product and technology innovation are key to all these initiatives and in 2016 we continue to see increased clinical confidence as a result of innovation in Invisalign treatment for customers worldwide. Q4 was a particularly busy quarter with product releases designed to improve feeder [ph] predictability, outcomes and efficiency. We launched Invisalign G7 with features that helped us to fine tune certain tooth movements and we launched the latest version a ClinCheck Pro for more flexibility in treatment planning. We also announced upgrades to our iTero Element scanner, software the Invisalign Outcome Simulator chairside app, adding 3D progress tracking to help assess Invisalign treatment progress and finding with a recommendation of many of our most experienced doctors and our North American Clinical Advisory Board, we issued a recommendation for weekly aligner wear and Invisalign Teen cases. But we are now recommending one week wear for Invisalign Go. Innovations like our G-series features and smart-track material give doctors' confidence that they can get the result they want with Invisalign while changing aligners weekly instead of every other week. It's a real improvement in treatment efficiency and a better experience for patients to reduce overall treatment time. Our integrated consumer marketing program where we're just traditionally in media search and digital marketing, PR and social media to engage consumers at every point and consumer purchased security. Consumer interest in demand for Invisalign treatment continues to grow. In 2016 there were over 8 million unique visitors to Invisalign website; 1.8 million potential parents searched an Invisalign provider on dock locator which is up 38% from 2015. And Invisalign social media community grew 50% to 530,000 consumers [ph]. In Q4, our scanner business revenues are up 19.3% sequentially and up 157% year-over-year reflecting a record number of units shipped in the quarter, approximately 27.7% quarter-over-quarter, primarily North America. Usually iTero scanners from Invisalign case submissions in place of EDS impressions continues to expand and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner North America increased to a record 51.3%, up from 48.8% in Q3 and 39.7% in the same quarter last year. While these scanners were predominantly from iTero scanner, we also are seeing some uptake for [indiscernible] which were previously qualified for the Invisalign case submission. Q4 was our first quarter supplying aligners for Smile Direct Club. We continue to work closely with Smile Direct Club theme developing processes around the manufacturer of their aligners and continuing to ramp our efforts in the referral cases to our network of orthodontists and dentists for in-office Invisalign treatments. The potential this new entirely market, new market force is large. While the business is going to [indiscernible] we remain very excited. I'd like to update you on our plans to expand our operations globally and get closer to our customers local market. This past July we transitioned our order acquisition operations which is the digital scanning of the cemented TBS impression for the EMEA region, we move it to Amsterdam. We focused initially on moving the order acquisition process because of the huge customer experience benefits which faced several days for initial ClinCheck turnaround time. Order acquisition has a low labor and training component and is therefore relatively easier to relocate. We also get immediate net cost savings for COGS or costs of goods sold from the lower freight costs. While still early, we're already seeing these benefits from having operations in the region. We're planning to establish order acquisition for the APAC region in Singapore and expect to begin processing incoming Invisalign cases for that region in early 2018. Our first treatment planning operations outside of Costa Rica and our first aligner fabrication operations outside of Mexico will both be located in the APAC region. We are focusing on Asia Pacific first because of the diverse customer needs of that region, language and translational challenges, and a significant distance in time zone differences that currently results in more time for ClinCheck turnaround. The China market will be our initial focus for treatment planning operations in APAC and be located in Chengdu, China. We expect to begin processing Invisalign cases in Q2 2017. A location for our APAC aligner manufacturing has not been finalized yet however, we plan to be operational in the first half of 2018. We plan to establish our operations in EMEA in a similar way. We have treatment planning operations in Cologne, Germany starting in Q3 2017 followed by Spain in the first quarter of 2018. We're building more detailed plan for putting treatment planning and the other core markets in EMEA over the next few years. International expansion of Invisalign value chain which includes order acquisitions, treatment planning and aligner fabrication is on the way. I'm excited about the opportunity and the potential to being closer to our customers. Our operations are very flexible and we see so many benefits that will allow us to scale with our business and ensure that we offer the best customer support experience. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to update you on our patent litigation. At the conclusion of the International Trade Commission action against ClearCorrect in September 2016, we filed a motion in federal district court in Houston to lift the stay that had been in place since the filing of the ITC action. The court granted our motion and the matter is now active and we are proceeding aggressively, relying in part on these prior findings of infringement and validity from the ITC proceedings. In addition, today we announced that we have filed a new lawsuit against ClearCorrect and Your Smile Direct LTD of Dublin, Ireland, for patent infringement in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice of the United Kingdom. We believe that ClearCorrect is now infringing Align's European patents by offering its aligners to consumers through Your Smile Direct and to practitioners through it's own distribution throughout the United Kingdom. The ITC already found Align's U.S. patents to be infringed by ClearCorrect and we will continue to assert and defend our intellectual property rights against infringement, both in the United States and internationally. With that, I'll now turn it over to John Morici. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. I'm very pleased to be here. Let's review our fourth quarter financial results. The total company revenue for the fourth quarter was $293.2 million, up 5.2% from the prior quarter and up 27.3% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis our reported Q4 revenue was reduced by approximately $3 million, both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter clear aligner revenue of $251.5 million which now includes both Invisalign and Smile Direct Club aligner revenue was up 3.2% sequentially reflecting growth of Invisalign volume partially offset by lower Invisalign ASPs. Our Q4 shipment volume and revenue to Smile Direct Club were immaterial to the quarter. Our year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 17.5% reflected Invisalign case volume growth across all customers' channels and geographies. Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially $50 to -- from Q3 to about $1,230 reflecting higher promotional activity and the impact of foreign exchange rate. On a year-over-year basis Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down approximately $20, primarily due to promotional activity and again, the impact of foreign exchange rates which was partially offset by price increases. For the fourth quarter total Invisalign shipment of about 190,000 cases were up 6.9% sequentially refracting growth primarily from our EMEA and North American customers. Year-over-year Invisalign case volume growth was 18.5% driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 3.2% sequentially and up 20.2% year-over-year. For North American GPs, case volume was up 9.1% sequentially and up 9.5% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 9.1% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year reflecting continued expansion of our customer base, as well as increased utilization. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q4 was a record 5.2 cases per doctor, up from 4.9 in Q4 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 11.3, up from 9.9 in the prior year. North America GP utilization was 3.2, slightly up from 3.1 in the prior year. And international utilization was 5.0, flat from Q4 last year as we continue to expand our customer base. In Q4 we added 3,700 new Invisalign doctors worldwide of which 1,420 were new North American doctors and 2,280 of which were new international doctors. This compared to 2,615 in Q3 and 2,670 total doctors trained in the same quarter last year. Note that the total number of doctors trained in Q4 includes 670 Invisalign Go doctors in EMEA that were recruited over the course of the year. Our scanner and services revenue for the fourth quarter was $41.7 million, up 19.3% sequentially and up 156.8% year-over-year. Moving on to gross margin; fourth quarter overall gross margin was 75.1%, flat sequentially and up 0.1 point year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 77.5%, down 0.2 point sequentially, primarily due to lower Invisalign ASPs partially offset by cost leverage from higher volume. Clear aligner gross margins were down 0.4 point year-over-year primarily due to increased aligner's per case as we continue to treat more complex cases. Q4 gross margins for our scanner segment was a record 61%, up 3.9 point sequentially and 23.2 point year-over-year, both the sequential and year-over-year increases were primarily a result of higher ASPs and lower manufacturing costs of our iTero Element scanner relative to our previous scanner. Q4 operating expenses were $151.9 million, up sequentially by $4.8 million or 3.2%, primarily related to increased employee headcount which was partially offset by lower media cost and foreign exchange rate impact. On a year-over-year basis Q4 operating expenses were up 33.8% reflecting increased headcount and continued investment in our go-to-market activity, each critical to the growth of business. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 23.3%, up one point sequentially and down two and half point year-over-year. This sequential increase in operating margin related primarily to OpEx leverage from higher volumes and revenue. On a year-over-year basis decreased operating margin primarily reflects higher OpEx as we've grown into business. On a sequential and year-over-year basis, Q4 operating margin was minimally impacted by foreign exchange rates as we have a natural hedge between our revenue and operating expenses. With regard to our fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 19.8%, up by approximately 1.4 point compared to Q3 of '16. Recall that Q3 was benefited by a change in our corporate structure as part of our ERP implementation. Commencing in the fourth quarter we also began to find aligners to Smile Direct Club. Revenue and cost for this activity are included in our operating profit and reported results although they were immaterial to the company. Additionally, we also report our share of Smile Direct Club's losses below operating margin in our tax provision and is entitled equity in losses of investee, net of tax. This Q4 loss, net of tax was approximately $1.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.59 compared to $0.63 reported in Q3 and $0.60 reported in the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter EPS was unfavorably impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar which amounted to approximately $0.08 per share, primarily due to the net realized foreign exchange losses related to the revaluation of certain balance sheet accounts addressing unrealized foreign exchange losses included in other income and expense. In conjunction with the implementation of our new international corporate structure in July we changed the function of currency of our Netherlands entity from euro to U.S. dollars. As a result, monetary balance sheet accounts are revalued into U.S. dollars and any impact from that is charged to the P&L. Prior to this change these impacts were charged to the balance sheet. We have now changed our processes to limit our exposure and the impact of these kinds of currency movement which we believe should not have nearly as large of an impact on earnings going forward. Moving on to the balance sheet, as of the fourth quarter cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long-term investment were a record $700 million. This compared to $678.7 million at the end of 2015, an increase of approximately $21.3 million. Of our $700 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities, $241 million was held by the U.S. and $459 million was held by our international entities. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $247.4 million, up approximately 1% sequentially. Our overall DSA -- DSO was 76 days, down two days sequentially and up 14 days year-over-year. The year-over-year increase is a result of our new ERP system implemented in July 2016 and other related systems that impact the timing of our customer collective. As we indicated last quarter, we anticipate that our DSOs will remain above our historical average for several quarters as we work through these changes. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $81 million and free cash flow for the quarter defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to a record $66.8 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $14.2 million, primarily relating to equipment purchases or additional manufacturing capacity as well as building improvement. During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of stock for $38 million under that April 2014 repurchase plan. Subsequent to year end we completed this plan, we purchasing the remaining $3.8 million. We still have $300 million available for repurchased under the 2016 repurchase plan which we announced last April. Before we move to Q1 outlook, I would like to make a few comments on the full year 2016 results. In 2016 we shipped a record 708,000 Invisalign cases of 21.5%. This reflects 32.4% volume growth from our international doctors and 16.4% volume growth from our North American doctor's. Shipments of iTero scanner were up more than three times over 2015 to nearly 4,000 units. Total revenue was a record $1.1 billion, up 27.7% year-over-year. Full year operating income of $248.9 million or 23.1% of revenue, free cash flow was $177.1 million. For the year we repurchased 1.1 million shares of Align stock for $96.2 million. In 2016 diluted EPS was $2.33. With that let's turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with demand outlook; for our international market expect seasonally slower period for APAC with the Lunar New Year and for EMEA with winter holiday and vacation. For North America, seasonally up GP and Ortho. For our scanner business, Q1 capital equipment purchases are seasonally lower. With this as a backdrop we expect the first quarter to shape up as follow; Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 200,000 to 203,000 cases, up approximately 22.2% to 24% over the same period a year ago reflecting continued strong demand across all channels and region. We expect Q1 net revenues to be in the range of $295 million to $298 million, an increase of 23.6% to 24.8% year-over-year with gross margins in the range of 74.2% to 74.5%. We expect Q1 operating expenses to be in the range of $162.5 million to $164.5 million, up quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the increased headcount and increased marketing expenses. Q1 operating margin should be in the range of 19.1% to 19.3%. Regarding our tax rate; at the start of 2017 we adopted accounting standards update entitled improvements to employee share based payment accounting under this new standard excess tax benefit and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as paid in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement for the reporting period in which they occur. Under this new standard we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 1% to 2% which includes $12 million in extra tax benefit. We estimate the Q1 impact of the Smile Direct Club transaction will reduce earnings per share by $0.01 per diluted share, and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $81.3 million exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q1 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 which includes approximately $0.14 of excess tax benefit. Finally, it should be noted that our Q1 CapEx will be larger than normal as we recently entered into a purchase agreement for the new -- for our new facility in San Jose, California. Accordingly Q1 CapEx should be approximately $70 million to $75 million. Now let me turn our view to the full year. We anticipate 2017 revenue growth to be above the midpoint of our long-term operating model range of 15% to 25%. We also expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to be at or above midpoint of that model. As for our scanner business, recall that 2016 revenue and volume growth significantly benefited from the unfilled backlog carried over from 2015. And while we expect the scanner business to do well and continue to grow, we would not expect the same rate of growth of volume and revenue as we saw in 2016. We expect operating margins to be flat to slightly up over our 2016. Those investments will include geographic expansion both in countries and markets we already serve, as well as expansion into new territories including Latin America and India. And aggressive direct to consumer advertising campaign targeted directly at teen, international expansion of the Invisalign value chain including order acquisition and treatment planning to get closer to our customers as Joe mentioned. Commercialization of several new products including in class two and tubular [ph] advancement feature for international markets, Invisalign Go for North America and new iTero scanner features and functionality, and implementation of the CFM model in North America and APAC which was previously rolled out in EMEA. We believe these investments are key to the continued customer adoption and acceleration of our growth. Similar to last year, many of these investments will take time before they realize meaningful return. We expect the equity loss from our investment in Smile Direct Club would be two to three times the 2016 losses we recorded. We expect our tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 18% which includes $19 million of excess tax benefit. Finally, as typical, we expect our earnings power in the second half of the year to be stronger than in the first half with second half operating profit to account for somewhere in the range of 56% to 58% of our full year results. With that I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. In closing, I'm pleased with our continued progress but behind all this progress and hard work, what we've really done is to build on the original vision and work started 20 ago this year, and that has created digital way to move [indiscernible] predictably, comfortably and statically and we're doing that. Digital is the future of what Donek [ph] which means all season in future will be moved digitally throughout. We have good momentum and energy heading into 2017, something we all felt that they are still waiting to kick-off at the year in North America, APAC and EMEA. We have a lot to be excited about with new products coming to treat younger patients and solutions specifically for general dentist, expanded opportunities through Smile Direct Club and our new consumer campaign to much more. I look forward to following up with many of you in the coming weeks at various financial conferences and industry meeting. Before I open the call to questions, I want to take a minute to welcome Lin [ph] who will join Align on February 27 in the newly created position of VP, Americas. This newly created position for the Americas region will allow us to provide greater focus on each region, respond to their different needs more quickly and effectively and harness to collective power of our largest market in the world. We've never had one leader for the region with our expansion in Brazil and greater Latin America, we thought it was time to bring all these activities in the Americans under one leader, just as we have in EMEA and APAC region, this is an opportunity for us to add an executive with experience who is going to help us scale and continue to grow. I know that she'll be an excellent addition to our team. Lastly as we announced in Q3 earnings, David White, will officially leave Align in February. I want to thank David for as many contributions to the company over the past three years and which him the best is his retirement. With that we'll now open for any questions you might have. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Thanks, Joe and welcome John. So I guess you know looking at the results, despite what appears to be somewhat of a softening overall dental end market, you guys were able to post and forecast strong case growth. So I guess Joe big picture question, I guess how important is the overall foot traffic in particular in the GP office relative to how you think about referrals and growth of Invisalign? Joseph Hogan : You know I think you can never negate what traffic, I mean it's important that you have -- store traffic in that senses point of view there. I mean witness what happened to us in the third quarter and obviously from a GP market segment we saw that decline so I think what you're seeing here is, you know GP did come back kind of from a seasonal standpoint we expected that as we indicated in our forecast. So also you see this ortho utilization really picking up in a big way also. So I think those two combined variables but I mean to specifically answer your question, so what traffic goes down 20% in ortho, this is going to affect us in one way or another but a continuation of 2016 into 2017 is what we're projecting when you heard with forecasted -- I think that's why we're still bullish in a sense of as we look at 2017. Robert Jones : Got it. And I guess just a quick follow-up, you know, you guys called out higher promotional activity as driving the decline in the ASPs and I know you guys run promotions often but I don't remember it being this big of a drag on ASPs. Can you maybe just give a little bit more detail on the promotions you ran and should we expect this level of promotional activity to continue as we think about '17? Joseph Hogan : Yes, I think you know, when you -- look Robert, we have some promotional activity but obviously nothing would have been outline as what we've done in the past and fourth quarters except there is one 75% -- $75 bonus that we gave to the orthodontic community that came through Las Vegas. And we saw a pretty big uptick from that thing. And so you know, that hit us a little bit from an ASP standpoint but held volume but then we had some FX and some mix in here also. So it was a good balance in that central [ph]. Robert Jones : Got it. Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Thanks, good afternoon. Joe, on -- in terms of the '17 outlook first on the top line, can you give us a sense of what you're embedding for FX impact to the top line as well as the ASP trends for the year? And then when you look in the middle of the P&L you outlined a number of initiatives; can you help us size or put some numbers to the relative sizes of each of those initiatives, each of the cost buckets in terms of the incremental commercial spend? Joseph Hogan : Yes, I'll take the FX and ASP. You know we've set our plan for 2017 based on current FX rate, so we've adjusted to what we're currently seeing and that's what's in our guidance. And as far as ASPs, we expect them to be flat to slightly up as we plan for 2017 from that standpoint. And then from a spend standpoint we're continuing to invest in our sales and marketing organization and specifically on the marketing on the direct to consumer and really targeting that team market. So it's a continued investment that we're making in 2017. And as we think about this from year to year is, you know we've done the last few years in this business, we really hit the channels hard in a sense of hiring sales people, seeing the international growth that we have. Just to look at our business next year is doing exactly the same thing; we're running the same plays maybe to a higher degree because we have higher momentum and higher volumes to deal with. So real added cost is our team focus these for next year, you know that will be anywhere between $10 million and $14 million but I would say that's the inordinate kind of change from your year that we would have had versus our normal kind of OpEx extension that we feel -- you know, I mean that's why we struggled so much in the first quarter in a sense of it could be lowered all these investments so we can realize those in the second half of the year. Brandon Couillard : And just curious about you think about the potential risk of a board of tax on Mexico imports? And any -- let's say mitigation efforts that you could take to perhaps offset that? And could you update on the exact mix of how much of the production is coming out of Mexico today? Is it 100% of the volumes? John Morici : Well, I mean out of everything our production right now is slowly and whereas in Mexico, and 60% of our production goes to North America and 40% goes overseas. Now you're asking me to comment on Trump's comments, I don't know which tweet you want me to address. I'd say all those tweets have different financial scenarios. Part of it also is going to be reduction of the corporate tax rate, it looks like it's come together maybe the 20% range or so; so it's really hard -- it's kind of washed that's been out right now. What I want to give investors' confidence that we're aware of it, and we'll make the new kind of changes from a flexibility standpoint, we could be nimble on what new to be done. But the last thing I'd say is, you know our Mexican facility, I don't want it to be looked as the low cost facility, this is an incredibly high tax credit -- incredibly important aspect to us and so we've invested tons of money over 20 years to bring this as a modern day production facility, it's the biggest 3D printing business in the world. This is really a valuable asset for us and we'll do all we can just to make that asset as productive as possible regardless of what we see. Brandon Couillard : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Bouchard [ph] of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions everyone. I wonder if we could reflect just for a minute on the first quarter guidance when I think back to the company's approach to guidance over the years, that there has been -- you know, there have been times when we thought well, you know, the guidance could have been a little higher but the company has pretty steadfastly stuck to this view of looking at past sequential trends, seasonal trends to say, okay, here is where we think the business is going to grow. When I look at the first quarter though, the guidance for the sequential volume growth -- significant -- relative to trend, stronger than normal trend; so I wonder if you could spend just a minute there -- kind of clue us into anything we might be missing about what might be different this time around? John Morici : Steve, this is John. I think what we saw -- we saw a very good volume in Q4 and I think that's what led to strong shipments and strong revenue performance in Q4 and we've seen that continue into January and into 2017 that we feel very good about where we're at from a volume standpoint and that's why we've given the Q1 guidance and it helped strengthen where we think we're going to be at for 2017. Unidentified Analyst : As you look back at order patterns over the last several months, do you think it might have been in part more of a timing issue where new orders were delayed upto the latter stages of the year and into January? Joseph Hogan : I think you got to look at Q4, Q1 normal list -- you know how -- there is some seasonality in a sense of how we go about things too. So I hope we're answering your question but I know what you're saying is we're probably a little outside of what -- kind of guidance we've given in the past. I'd just take John's comments in this specific momentum but also your understanding of the seasonality that says the Q4 to 1Q is the two main variables and why we're predicting that Q1 to be what it is. Shirley Stacy : Just a final on Steve, I -- do you recall a few -- the order imbalance that we referenced on the Q3 call that -- you keep in mind right that strength carried over, [indiscernible] which is the received strength obviously carried over as the inventory and backlog, even down in Q4 and that strength obviously has carried over to Q1. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Now last one for me\u2026 Shirley Stacy : This was actually Steve -- I think you even said something about this on the last earnings call you asked whether this would carry over into Q1 and that's potentially what you're seeing. Unidentified Analyst : Well don't give me too much credit Shirley. Shirley Stacy : We won't give you credit for the strength but -- Unidentified Analyst : Last one for me. I wonder if you could give us any early reflections on the traction you're getting with the one week change out; how broadly are you seeing that adopted if it's something you can pick up from your friends in the channel? And what are the -- what's the early feedback or clinicians thinking about this as in any way changing the way they go about using Invisalign? Thank you. Joseph Hogan : Yes, I think we've had good reception from a doctor's standpoint Steve. And the data we presented, the clinical evidence was as far as wide smart track, smart force, that you need aspects of our product line that allows us to happen, honestly we feel -- some of the doctors are aggressively pursuing this and it's ones who are really investing in this line in a big way, it's significant. Other ones are more cautious I think in a sense of how they start up and that is part of the tendency of this industry. The last thing I'd say is, it's going to be really important for us as part of our communications to patients is that the availability of this kind of opportunity, I think as patients ask for that as they movie with the GP treatment that you will see a more and more enthusiasm and uptake in that. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. I really appreciate the help. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John Kreger : Hi, thanks very much. Joe, I believe in your prepared remarks you talked about the design order backlog, and generally coming back to normal. Can you just expand upon that is there any imbalance in the backlog that still persists in the first quarter? Are you totally back to normal there? Joseph Hogan : We're back to normal John. John Kreger : Great, great. And then John the '17 outlook commentary that you gave which was very helpful; can you give us a sense about what the Smile Direct Club contribution would likely be based upon your expectations to either revenue or volumes? John Morici : Yes, sure John. It's very minimal, we're definitely ramping up and growing with the Smile Direct Club but in our numbers it's very, very minimal. John Kreger : Great, thanks. And just one last one, Joe, you mentioned that DSOs are becoming a much bigger part. Are you seeing that globally or really just in the U.S. and how do you think about that from a mix impact on your business either in terms of ASP or margins? Thanks. Joseph Hogan : John, it's a good question. First of all, this is more of a U.S. kind of phenomenon, that's what to say that other heavy GP markets like the UK or whatever won't go through this dollar consolidation effect. Obviously there are some large DSOs out there from a deal standpoint, we obviously incentivize to drive volume but you know, right now we're not looking at any kind of -- I say material effect in the sense of ASP because you know balance is going other full patients in things that we offer. So as we go forward, we will be continuing to report as how we work with DSOs and how the things are going but did you prepare like a model John for 2017, I wouldn't think that you want to handicap it for DSO pricing. John Kreger : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Ravi [ph] in for Rich. One question on the gross margin, it's a little bit [indiscernible] came in guidance for a little bit later than we had thought. Your base volume guidance is little bit higher, I'm just wondering if you could plan to put to take around that? Joseph Hogan : Yes, I mean from a gross margin standpoint I mean we're going to continue to see some FX pressure. ASPs what we expect in the first quarter to be a little bit better than the first quarter due to some of the promotional activity that won't continue from Q4 into Q1. And you know, I think it's -- we haven't -- from a standpoint of planning our pricing for 2017, in the past we've taken is it's price increases in the past couple years we haven't planned that for 2017 yet so that might be something that is further down. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. And then one on this -- forced in your revenue mix, the scanner business you have this new launch sort of hitting the little drive last year growing pretty impressively, you know it seems that we shouldn't be expecting that this year, in '17 should we still think of the scanner business is growing faster than clear aligner business? Sort of what commentary you can provide for another backlog? Joseph Hogan : Yes, definitely we had a great backlog coming out of 2015 into 2016 for iTero and that contributed to the significant growth. The backlog is much more normalized growth for an equipment business now for iTero. So for 2017 we expect consistent [ph] growth to maybe a little bit better than Invisalign but certainly not nothing like we saw in 2016 because of the backlog. Unidentified Analyst : That's it for me. Thanks. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Ravi. Operator, next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Block of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Block : Great, thanks and good afternoon guys. Joe, you gave '17 guidance and maybe now I can ask about 2018 and beyond. But -- you better top line for '17 but also higher spends, so it looks like you're getting to a similar operating income or you're absolute dollar is not far off from where we were but just a different formula getting there. And in around that 23% op margin, just taking a step back -- when you look out where the business is today or from an investment standpoint, where do we start to see that sort of elusive leverage? I mean you've got tremendous topline and it really is huge but you're still short of a good couple of hundred basis points below the low end of that 25 to 30 EBIT goal; so maybe can you speak to -- when you look out beyond '17, how you bring the leverage back to the business? Joseph Hogan : When you say bring the leverage back [indiscernible] this happens to the point of the 25 or 30 that -- everyone here wants to get to and what you've got to look for. I'd say John, we're constantly faced here with are actually, really great short-term investments for us to expand this business significantly and an operating expense, it's almost immediately accretive within that year. And so you know what -- I think at some point in time as we become more and more penetrated or over utilization of these markets more spread internationally in a sense when we go internationally, you just don't hire sales people, you have to put infrastructure in place, you have legal firms, so a lot of things you have to put in place that puts this organization together. So I can't tell you that I don't want to start forecasting 2018, 2019 or whatever John but I hope what you see here is an incredibly profitable business that throws out a ton of cash year-in, year-out; we're in the 23%, we're in striking distance for the 25% range. If you want to cut back some of that investment and sacrifice some growth, we can be at 27% tomorrow. We just feel like it's the right thing for this business to keep investing in these. But I would say accretive types of investments, the payback was less than a year to 18 months and you're seeing in our results, you're seeing in the growth. But as we go forward, I'm very confident we're going to reach a 25% to 30% range, it's just -- we will continue to invest to grow and improve that utilization rate where it makes sense for the business. Jonathan Block : Got it, very helpful and fair enough. I guess the second one, unless I miss the EMEA commentary, it seemed like it suggested that trends picked up throughout the quarter, so sort of 4Q orders were higher than shipments and arguably that sets up well for 1Q '17 shipments. I believe IGo was launched in the quarter in the UK and Germany, sort of during that fourth quarter. So any thoughts on -- you know the early traction or findings from IGo in EMEA. And when do you expect IGo to be released here in North America? Thanks. Joseph Hogan : You know as far as IGo uptake, I mean we saw good uptake in the UK, we're working through Germany; Germany you see has a slower infusion rate than most countries in a sense of how we go about things. We're moving into Australia in that sense and working over to APAC and we will introduce it -- we're beginning to introduce it here in certain regions in the United States. So we'll keep you updated John, I mean we're excited about that product, we do need something for that GP segment, it's simple, it will allows GPs to assimilate this product quickly and see how it's integrates into your workflow. And so you will see us aggressively push that product around the globe in North America as we move in 2017. Jonathan Block : Alright, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon. So Joe, let me follow-up I guess on John's margin questions and you might not have liked his question, you'll probably like mine even less I guess. But I'm just trying to understand -- you know, operating margin has been down a couple of hundred basis points this quarter. It seems like you're guiding down 250 basis points or so next quarter, and yet guiding flat for the year and I really respect a lot of the investments you're making; I think they're the right calls for the business in 2017 and beyond. So just trying to understand if the last couple quarters or at least 4Q and 1Q are down; how do we get flat for all of '17 in the face of some of these investments that you are making? Joseph Hogan : Jeff, I think -- you know, I've been here long enough to be through a few of these first quarters now, I think you know that our first quarter a lot of something that presses up working margin in expenses, that's is a reason how we account for things, we lay in investments for the rest of the year so it's always our most pressured quarter from an operating profit standpoint. So I mean look at that comparison from 4Q to 1Q, that's always a tough comparison in sense of how we're offering. I'll step back, you know, Jeff, I don't mind John's question, in fact I think it's a question that we've always asked ourself here so I never wanted you guys to misinterpret that we will get unsettled for a question like that. I think it's legitimate in something we wrestle [ph] this year. You know as we forecast for next year, you're right, we're keeping our projections for operating profit or you know, it's pretty much flat with what we thought this year. This year it's pretty phenomenal and sensible what we're forecasting. We think that's the right focus for this business right now. You know, look, I'd just say it from respect to the standpoint if I came in closer, we're going to be 18% operating profit for all of the next year because we're doing something -- I'd say that and we'll probably be out of the room or what we will speak of this team but we want to be as close to the edge as we possibly can in making sure we produce good margin and cash for this business and take advantage of all the opportunities we've had and that the balance we hope that we're communicating for you and now we're executing. Jeff Johnson : That's helpful. And last question I guess or two, one for John, just -- can you remind me John, does the peso of weakness that we've seen so much in accelerate here recently, does that help at all from a margin perspective? I think the answer is yes, but just if you could remind me there. And then on ASPs, I know the question's been asked a couple times Joe but just want to circle back there; they have been declining here over the last couple of years and I know the promotional activity and some of the utilization rates, people are hitting their targets, things like that so that's all good but I think you said DSO is flat on the year and that would definitely be a change in the trend line from the last couple years so just want to confirm maybe what's driving the flattening out of those ASPs after a couple years of having come down a bit. Joseph Hogan : Just to answer your question on peso, yes, the dollar strengthening against the peso is favorable for us as of the cost there. John Morici : On your DSO question, I'd say don't misinterpret my answer on the DSO. You know, the DSOs, they have some pretty good targets in a sense that they could grow; they will get a commensurate kind of discount from Invisalign standpoint. What I'm saying is in the whole mix of products that we have in North America, don't overweight that thing falling down the overall total. But you will see the DSOs can grow aggressively, they will be rewarded for it and so we'll continue to grow that. From an ASP standpoint, I think you have to remember we've got price last year too and that helps us. FX didn't help us in the fourth quarter and that way also so we're playing in a bandwidth here, you know, price increases, FX of $20 or so and I have no idea\u2026 Shirley Stacy : International mix. John Morici : Yes, international mix. So I think David continue to guide ASPs that we're pretty much constant from year to year. We still think about that but there is a lot of noises when we think about that from oceans that we do and mix like Shirley mentioned. But we're counting on it pretty level as we go into 2017. Jeff Johnson : Fair enough, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steven Valiquette : Thanks, good afternoon everyone, congrats on the results. So just for us, I guess a couple of quick questions here, just on the litigation news that was in the other press release today. Just first on that patent loss in news in the UK, we don't have as much background than UK market dynamics; so I guess I'm just wondering you are able to provide any current approximate market share splits maybe for you and other such as clear correct in that market? And then I have a follow-up after that. Joseph Hogan : As far as I can't give you any answer but it's not material in the sense of market share in the UK. You know, there entity over in UK, I want the o be certain when those bounce like direct but it's not, it's something to do with this, and is still pretty much [indiscernible] here, just trying to continue with the model that they have in that and hook up with someone in the UK that really wants to try to implement it in the model. And so you know obviously our lawsuit is not exactly what we do but it's extended as we mentioned to the international market and we'll continue to be aggressive in defending our IP. Steven Valiquette : Okay, and then as far as the implications in refilling the action in the federal court in Houston, again without having the full historical background at my fingertips; is this still related more to the patents that are set to expire this year in the U.S. or is it more geared towards U.S. patents that go well beyond this year? Joseph Hogan : We've got a special guest today. Unidentified Company Representative : Good afternoon everybody. The patents that are before the court in the clear correct action are a combination of patents that will expire in the next couple of years and also patents with a longer life span. Steven Valiquette : Okay, but as far as\u2026 Joseph Hogan : [Indiscernible]. Unidentified Company Representative : Sure. I mean once the patent expires, it just means that the art disclosed in the patents can be freely practiced by anybody in the market. It doesn't make up for infringement during the life of the patent for which anybody would be responsible for damages. Steven Valiquette : Okay, got it. Okay, maybe I'll just follow-up offline with some additional questions on that. Thanks. Shirley Stacy : We can set up a call with Roger. Steven Valiquette : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Matt O'Brien: Thanks. So I've got one here. EMEA growth continues to be very strong, how much of that growth is attributed to the expansion into non-core markets? Joseph Hogan : You mean non-core market to be other countries? What do you think it is? Matt O'Brien: Yes, correct. Joseph Hogan : I'd say it's minimal at first. I mean, we look at India, we're moving in from different places, so I wouldn't look at that as material but I might look at Nordic countries in Europe that we've done that three or four years ago, that's starts to become important. So again, as we talk about moving into new markets just think we have -- we laid out a lot of infrastructure, spend money to put sales people in place and then you start to see almost geometric growth in those areas but that's not what I would say to drive in anyway. Right now the kind of forecast we're getting in for 2017 or what we saw in 2016. Matt O'Brien: Okay. And then also you guys point out low volume docs in Q3; how did those guys perform in the quarter? Joseph Hogan : They were good. And we had -- we had -- because we had the issue obviously in the third quarter, they came back pretty strong. You saw the GP in United States from 3.1 to 3.2 utilization standpoint, that might sound small but that's pretty big when you look at it across more than 150,000. Matt O'Brien: Okay, great. Thanks. Shirley Stacy : Operator, we'll take one more question please. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Matthews of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Two things; one Joe, you mentioned in the script something about being improved evidence of clinical efficacy and I'm wondering where that came from and what impact that's having because you know back in the day the pushback from Orthos was all about a lack of clinical proof here and so that sounds like a trend in the right direction. Joseph Hogan : I first say you know not to be smartass during the things but we spent in a course of 20 years a $1 billion in trying to learn and accomplish significant predictable orthodontic movements and increasingly as you've seen our G-series, you know, from G3 all the up to G7, we just announced; we just improved that capability year in and year out. So I think depending on when you take, when you go back in history, many of the people in Nordic [ph] community, they have gone way up and they wanted their competence. And what's really critical or in general how you finish and they have confidence that they can really finish and what more we hear is that they have as much confidence in how this line can finish but they do it large. So I hope I'm answering your question? Unidentified Analyst : No, that's right. No, I appreciate it. And don't worry, you're not being a smartass, I appreciate that. Second thing, you were early on Joe in this production shift, moving closer to end market even before the election result made it sort of a headline issue; but given all of the comments that you made about how much you've invested in [indiscernible] and high tech it is; what are you learning about the shifting to other countries now that you're actually in the process of doing it in Asia and Europe; what have you learned? What's the price, if any? Joseph Hogan : You know, honestly Jeff, I've done this is in other businesses I've been in the moving products and facilities in some locations to others and I'd say over learning here is what I've seen in other areas. One is, you never been just transfer production unit to unit, it's going to be different and have to reflect culture and where you're moving to. So if you look at APAC, we'll probably look at different types of automation in different aspects of that plan because as you know there is a difference than what you have from a labor standpoint in Mexico to do that. I think we're learning that our infrastructure is really a challenge in the sense of the IT piece and I have to have much more flexibility to be able to handle these things and when you get away from a unitary spot and you move to a broader area. But you also understand from our customers, you see the excitement from our customers knowing that things like ClinCheck, or to get closer to with China because we have many interactions for Mandarin, you know, the fact that English that goes between Costa Rica and China and different part of APAC; great excitement from our customer base to really improve that efficiency and to have more of a regional -- kind of a cultural aspect to the business. So those three things aren't a surprise to me but what I really love is how much customers embraced it. And we have flexibility in the sense of how we manufacture products and how we do things in that whole value chain that we talked about between OA and clinical IT and also the fact for using -- disassemble and reassemble those change around these areas to make it better for our customer base and that's a great thing about them. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks so much. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Jeff. Well, thank you everyone. This concludes our conference call. We appreciate you taking the time today. Look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences including Leerink and ROTH, as well as the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show at the end of February. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful rest of your day.",

Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights on the quarter, and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments clear aligners and intraoral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the second quarter, following that I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. 2017 is off to a great start with first quarter revenues, volumes, gross margin, and EPS all above expectations. First quarter net revenues were up 30% year-over-year, driven by strong Invisalign case shipments of 27% year-over-year to a record 38,900 doctors this quarter. These reflect the growth from both our North America and international regions and higher than expected teenage cases across the board, which increased 32% year-over-year. iTero's scanner revenues increased 47% year-over-year, and were down sequentially as expected. For Q1, North America Invisalign case volume was up 8.4% sequentially and 20.3% year-over-year, driven primarily by North American orthodontists, with GP Dentists showing improving growth trends. Continued strength in North American ortho channel reflects another record quarter for Invisalign utilization, up 12.6 cases per quarter, which includes substantially higher use by teenager patients, a positive indication for market share gains for metal braces. In Q1, we expand our adult-focused media buying to target both men and women with specific segment focus. This new buying target built on the historical strength we have had with adult females while also reaching adult males in a much more pointed way than ever before. We saw the results of this new media targeting come through in our sales as strength continued with adult females, and also significant growth with adult males choosing Invisalign treatment. During the quarter, we launched Invisalign Lite in North America, which was the first introduced in EMEA and includes up to 14 stages of aligners. We also begin titling Invisalign Go in North America in Q1 including with some of our dental service organizations, or DSOs. iGo for short is an aesthetic solution designed to empower general dentists to treat more patients. iGo creates a simplified approach that guides dentists through identifying, planning and treating aesthetic cases. On a year-over-year basis, shipment growth of 20.3% was driven by increased adoption of Invisalign by orthodontists and continued expansion of our GP customer base. We continue to make good progress with our DSOs, with Invisalign shipments up nearly 50% year-over-year in Q1, significantly higher than non-DSO practices. DSOs are leaders in adopting new technology and innovation in dental industry. They were the first to consolidate practices, automate, processes and drive greater efficiencies in order to scale their operations. The next phase in the DSO industry shift will be driven by the consumer and their preference for everything digital, which we have branded DSO 3.0 in our new marketing programs and collateral. Consumers today want digital experiences to provide them with more insight to the treatment and options and what steps to take in order to achieve a healthy lifestyle. By leveraging our technologies, iTero scanning, Invisalign treatment plans, progress tracking application, time-lapse features, our DSOs will be able to collect data on their active patients and tailor dentistry and orthodontics the way their patients want to consume it digitally. Working together with DSOs, we can help accelerate the industry shift the full digital practices much quicker and more effectively than with other companies. As part of our newly formed Americas region, in Q1, we completed the acquisition of our distributor in Brazil, which includes a small team of employees who'll be based in our S\u00e3o Paulo offices in Latin America. Brazil is estimated to have approximately 1.4 million new orthodontic case starts each year, and employs nearly 20% of the world's dentists. As the world's second largest market for cosmetic interventions, Brazil represents a tremendous growth potential for Align and this acquisition will help us establish our leadership position in Latin America and support our long-term growth strategy. Q1 Invisalign volume for international doctors was up 11.4% sequentially and up 41.3% year-over-year. The better than expected sequential increase was driven by growth in both the EMEA and APAC regions. In EMEA, Q1 volumes were up 38.8% year-over-year. We had a record quarter of growth across nearly all country markets as our TFM model continues gaining traction across the ortho channel with Spain, the U.K. and Germany leading the way. In Q1, we introduced Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement in certain country markets in EMEA and launched Invisalign Go in the UK, France and Germany. We also completed the acquisition of our EMEA distributor, which includes opening our first office in the Middle East, which gives us direct access to customers and distribution partners across Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States, the Baltics, Turkey, Monaco, Israel, Cyprus, the Middle East and Africa. In Asia Pacific, Q1 volumes were up 45.2% year-over-year, led by China, Japan and Australia, New Zealand. In Q1, we launched Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and South Asia and more than 800 doctors attending the peer-to-peer launch event. We also held a South Asia forum with a record 200 doctors and participated in New Zealand's Association of Orthodontists forum. Finally in South Korea, we transferred all Invisalign practices currently managed by our network partner to a direct coverage model. This gives us 100% direct coverage of the Korean market, and will enable our team to continue developing the market for clear aligners and help accelerate growth and adoption in the Invisalign treatment. Turning to the teen market, for Q1, 49,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, up 11.3% sequentially and 31.6% year-over-year. North America ortho shipment growth was well above the three year average both sequentially and year-over-year. International case shipments of teenage patients increased both sequentially and year-over-year as well, with Q1 teen shipments representing about 30% of total teenage cases. In Q1, we introduced the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction in certain country markets in Canada, EMEA and APAC. Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement combines the benefits of the most advanced clear aligner system in the world with features for moving the lower jaw forward while simultaneously aligning the teeth. This new solution offers a simpler, more efficient and patient-friendly treatment option than functional appliances and without the need for elastics typically use to treat teen Class II patients. It's not available in the U.S. yet. It's pending 510(k) approval from regulatory. In Q1, we're excited to launch our new global Made to Move campaign. This is the first time we've had an integrated campaign approach for consumer and professional audience across all regions. The multi-channel national consumer campaign will reach potential patients through TV and digital advertising, social media and PR programs. Launched first in North America, we'll begin to extend our Made to Move campaign in other key country markets beginning in May. While it's still very early, our new campaign is already driving over 40% higher engagement in digital media versus prior media, and followers across Invisalign's social channels were up 13% this quarter. We're also seeing the effectiveness of the new target audience in media planning. In Q2, we'll launch a significant push to drive consumer demand and conversion with moms and teenagers. We will dial up our investment in marketing to moms with a national multi-touch campaign under the Made to Move campaign umbrella. And in mid-May, we'll launch our national campaign marketing to teenagers. The national campaign will utilize key social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat and YouTube to raise awareness of clear aligners with custom programming for teens. In Q1, our scanner revenues increased 46.9% year-over-year and decreased 33% sequentially as expected. Given we worked through the backlog for iTero elements from the end of last year, these results are more reflective of a typical capital equipment buying cycle, which is softer in Q1. This past March, at the International Dental Show, IDS we call it, in Cologne. We had a greater presence and showcased iTero and Invisalign Go and the benefits of the combination with applications such as Invisalign Progress Tracking. We also previewed the time lapse application that provides dentists with the ability to compare scans over time to instantly visualize changes in patient's tooth wear movement and gingival recession. Overall, positive interest, as we continue to expand our presence among GPs in EMEA. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to expand and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q1, total Invisalign case submitted with a digital scanner in North America increased to a record 54.4%, up over 10 percentage points from the same quarter last year, which reflects an acceleration in case shipments with intraoral scanners, especially by North American orthodontists. Q1 was our first full quarter supplying clear aligners to SmileDirectClub, and shipments to this new channel were solid. At the beginning of the year, SmileDirectClub launched a consumer advertising campaign that has performed well and is extending the message of treatment with clear aligners versus braces. They've also doubled their network of SmileShops where potential patients can schedule a scan or have 3D impressions and photos taken. Overall, we remain excited about the long-term potential for the at-home doctor-directed market and working with SmileDirectClub to bring better smiles to more people. With that, I'll turn it over \u2013 the call to John. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Let's review our first quarter financial results. Total company revenue for the first quarter was a record $310.3 million, up 5.8% from the prior quarter and up 30% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Clear aligner revenue up $282.4 million was up 12.3% sequentially, driven primarily by better than expected Invisalign shipments and higher Invisalign ASPs. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth up 28.5% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies, partially offset by foreign exchange rates. Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially approximately $40 from Q4 to $1,270, reflecting lower promotional activity. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up approximately $15, primarily due to price increases, partially offset by increased promotional discounts, product shift to low stage products and foreign exchange. For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 208,100 cases were up 9.5% sequentially, driven primarily by North American orthodontists and international doctors. Year-over-year Invisalign case growth volume was 27.1% driven by growth across all regions as well as expansion of our customer base predominantly from the Asia Pacific region. For North American orthodontists, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 13.6% sequentially, and up 27.5% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 2% sequentially and up 11.4% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 11.4% sequentially and 41.3% year-over-year. Worldwide Invisalign utilization in Q1 was a record 5.4 cases per doctor, up from 4.9 in Q1 last year. North America ortho utilization was a record 12.6, up from 10.4 the prior year. North America GP utilization was 3.1, up slightly from 3.0 the prior year. And international utilization was 5.0, up from 4.7 in Q1 last year, reflecting continued expansion of our customer base in Asia Pacific. In Q1, we added 3,260 new Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which 980 were new North American doctors and 2,280 of which were new international doctors. This compared to 3,700 in Q4 and 2,480 total doctors trained in the same quarter last year. Our scanner and services revenue for the first quarter was $27.9 million, down 33% sequentially and up 46.9% year-over-year. Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 75.9%, up 0.8 points sequentially and 0.2 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 77.9%, up 0.4 points sequentially, primarily due to leveraging our manufacturing costs over higher volumes, higher Invisalign ASPs and partially offset by increased aligners per case. Clear aligner gross margins were down 0.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased aligners per case, as we continue to treat more complex cases, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies. Scanner gross margin for the first quarter was 56.1%, down 4.9 points sequentially primarily due to a slight increase in excess and obsolescence reserves and higher freight costs. Scanner segment gross margin was up 11.1 points year-over-year, primarily a result of higher ASPs and lower manufacturing and servicing costs of our iTero Element scanner relative to our previous scanner. Q1 operating expenses were $174 million, up sequentially by $22.1 million or 14.5% primarily related to increased employee head count, commissions associated with higher volumes and marketing spend as a result of our investments in geographic expansion, our new advertising campaign and the commercialization of new products. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 operating expenses were up 36.7%, reflecting the aforementioned investments. Our first quarter operating margin was 19.9%, down 3.4 points sequentially and 2.4 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily due to increased head count and marketing expenses as we continue to grow our business. On a year-over-year basis, decreased operating margin primarily reflects the higher operating expenses as we invest in head count, geographic expansion and new products in order to increase the adoption and accelerate the growth of our business. With regards to the first quarter tax provision, our tax rate was minus 11.4%, which includes $21.3 million in excess tax benefits and is down by approximately 31.2 points compared to Q4 of 2016. In our first quarter of 2017, we adopted accounting standards update entitled improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. Under this new standard, excess tax benefits and efficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement for the reporting period in which they occur. We also supply aligners to SmileDirectClub and therefore, revenue and cost for this activity are included in our operating profit and reported results, although they were immaterial to the company this quarter. Additionally, we also report our share of SmileDirectClub's losses below operating margin and our tax provision and is entitled equity in losses of investee net of tax. This Q1 loss net of tax was approximately $1.1 million or $0.01 per diluted share. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.85 compared to $0.59 reported in Q4 and $0.50 reported in the same quarter last year. First quarter earnings per share included the benefit of $21.3 million or $0.26 per share from excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation in accordance with the new standard. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of the first quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long-term investments were $644.2 million. This compared to $700 million at the end of 2016, a decrease of approximately $56 million, primarily related to the purchase of our new headquarters building. Of the $644.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $222.7 million was held by the U.S. and $421.5 million was held by our international entities. Q1 accounts receivable balance was $267.1 million, up approximately 8% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 77 days, up one day sequentially and up 10 days year-over-year. The increase is a result of our ERP and other related systems implementation last July, which have impacted the timing of our customer collections. We anticipate that our DSOs will remain above our historical average for several more quarters as we work through these changes. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $47.6 million. During the quarter, we used $36.5 million to pay employee taxes for the net settlement of vesting employee stock awards that otherwise would have been issued. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $59.6 million, primarily related to the purchase of our new facilities in San Jose, California, as well as equipment purchases for additional manufacturing capacity and building improvement. During the first quarter, we've repurchased approximately 40,000 shares of stock or $3.8 million, which completes the April 2014 repurchase plan. We have $300 million available for repurchase under the 2016 repurchase program that was announced on April 28, 2016. With that, let's turn to our business outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For our international markets, expect seasonally higher period for APAC and EMEA. For North America, seasonally up for orthos and GP dentists. For our scanner business, Q2 equipment purchases are seasonally higher. With this as a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows : Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 221,000 to 224,000 cases, up approximately 25% to 27% over the same period a year ago, reflecting continued strong demand across all channels and regions. We expect Q2 net revenues to be in the range of $340 million to $345 million, an increase of 26% to 28% year-over-year. We expect Q2 gross margins to be in the range of 74% to 75%, reflecting a higher mix of iTero business and Align manufacturing expansion in Asia Pacific. We expect Q2 operating expenses to be in the range of $180 million to $184 million, up quarter-over-quarter primarily due to increased head count, increased marketing expenses related to our new Invisalign brand and teen campaigns. Q2 operating margin should be in the range of 21% to 22%. Our effective tax rate included a windfall benefit of $2 million to $3 million should be approximately 21%. We estimate that Q2 impact of the SmileDirectClub transaction to not significantly impact EPS and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.6 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q2 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.74, which includes approximately $0.03 of excess tax benefits. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q2 to be approximately $30 million to $35 million. Now, let me turn to our view of 2017. Given the stronger than expected results we've seen to-date, we now anticipate 2017 total revenue to be at the high-end of our long-term operating model range of 15% to 25%. We also expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to be at the high-end of that model. Notwithstanding continued investments in our strategic growth drivers, we remain comfortable with the operating margin for the full year to be flat to slightly up from 2016 operating margin of 23%. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, John. In closing, I'm pleased with our continued process and execution of our strategic growth drivers. The dental industry remains healthy and our customers continue to report solid patient traffic in their offices. I just returned from the AAO meeting in San Diego this week and was excited to see the level of activity in our booth and the interest level in our products, especially for teenagers as we kickoff the summer teen season with our new teen-focused campaign. We had 2,000 doctors and their staff visited our booth and 300 attendees participated in our iTero, Iron Records scanning challenge, where an iTero scan was completed in under one minute for the first time in competition. We will be in Dubai in May hosting our EMEA summit with over 400 customers attending the two day peer-to-peer event. We've got a lot going on in Q2 and I look forward to sharing more with you at the upcoming financial conference and meetings. I'll now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first person comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks so much. I guess, just looking at the significant step up in case growth per ortho in North America. And in particular, Joe, you highlighted a couple times on the call that the impressive teen growth, which accelerated materially. I'm curious you had a few initiatives at play in the quarter. Anything you can share on how much of the teen growth specifically within ortho North America was because of things like the teen challenge versus some of the more tactical changes you had within the sales force. And I'm thinking about doc locator and things of that nature. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Bob, it's a good question. (26:05) going into quarter two is unfortunately, we don't do single variable equations around here. We have a number of things we've done with teens. And again, we'll make it more complicated as we get into more intense advertising in the second quarter. But you mentioned teen challenge, we think certainly had an impact in this sense, I think, some of the changes we've made on Doc Locator in a sense of the specificity of the patient directed into accounts, is part of that also. Also our next level partnership parts with customers, which basically takes customers to another level depending upon the share of business that we're going to see or the accelerated growth level that it can provide to us. Remember, Bob, when you go back about 75% of the normal orthodontic cases in the United States are teen-based. So if you want to do more Invisalign, it's going to be hard to just dip into adults if you really want to increase in that sense and you have to look at your teen business too. So I'd say those three major valuables is what really we drove from a North American standpoint for teen growth in the first quarter. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And so no one stood out more than other? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: No. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then I guess... Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Couldn't separate it. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then, I guess just my follow-up on the early recently launched products that you mentioned like Invisalign Lite, Invisalign Go, mandibular advancement. Given those are still relatively new within the case numbers that you're sharing, how should we think about these products helping accelerate or play into case growth as we move throughout the year? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I can't give you \u2013 John can help you on the dimensions of it. But I'd say when you talk about the mandibular advancement, which is a completely different animal than the \u2013 like the 15 stage we have for Lite. The Lite product fits really well when you think about E5, E10 and now E15. Customers can understand it they can integrate it. We saw really rapid uptake with that product line. When you come up with new products in this business like mandibular advancement, the infusion rate into the marketplace is slow. You really \u2013 you have dentists and orthodontists who want to try the product, they want to see how it works. They're just cautious on the front-end until they gain confidence with it. So I mean, mandibular advancement, remember we don't have a 5 and 10-K in the United States yet. We have to \u2013 that will occur later this year. We hope so. But we'll launch it directly around the world. That product is truly a breakthrough. We have to work hard from a peer-to-peer standpoint to help to promote it, whatever. But it gives us more credibility again in that teen market than we had before. But I wouldn't look at significant \u2013 I wouldn't look at material numbers from mandibular advancement in 2017 in any way, it will be how fast we can infuse that product in the marketplace. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you so much. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Bob Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well, good afternoon. So I've never been someone who congratulated a company on a great quarter, and I'm not going to do that here, but even it was a great quarter. But I'm good going to be the first to congratulate you on joining the $10 billion market cap club here in the aftermarket. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. That's great. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, hopefully I was first in the queue on that one. Just a couple for me. I mean I completely agree, of course, with Bob that even when you look at the quarter, you have to take a step back and say, wow, this is the fastest growth I've seen in \u2013 certainly in my model, it's fairly remarkable to step up. Teen really jumps out. I wonder if you could sort of hypothesize for me about how important the one week aligner change that was specifically, I know you called it out briefly. But could you just dive a little bit deeper there? And could you give us a sense for \u2013 specifically in the U.S., because a lot of investors really like to focus on this point. Just how much faster teen growth was relative to the 2016 trend? You mentioned it was faster, but can you give us any more granularity there? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I'll take the first one. I give John the second one on this one, Steve. On our growth trial on one week wear piece again, it's hard to pull that signal out from the volume noise, I'd call it. But what we see is, we're seeing rapid uptake by our orthodontists and GPs on moving to seven day kind of aligner wear. We're also getting good feedback in a sense that helps them in a close cycle with patients to know that those particular episodes are going to last some time \u2013 half the time of when another one was. So it becomes another item in that discussion that's really helpful. So it's certainly helping us, again, but I can't quantify to the extent of what it is. As far as the U.S. and the faster piece that you mentioned before, John will do it, Steve. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Steve, with your question, specifically on teen growth in the U.S.? Or was... Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Exactly. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, teen growth, we have an overall growth model built in. This is definitely faster than we had built in initially and that's what led to some of our offside that we saw in the first quarter. So teen was definitely stronger than we would've modeled out so far this year. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. And I think \u2013 just adding to what John said, Steve, the comment that we made about teen \u2013 North American ortho teen growth being faster than the last three year average. That gives you a couple of things to look at. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then as I was at the Align booth at IDS, I thought \u2013 look, the message that I'm getting here from the team is very clearly that this just almost isn't an orthodontics company anymore. This is a company that wants to \u2013 and has now taken a big step towards becoming a bigger part of the doc office is sort of consumer brand. And I understand that your ambitions are to become a true consumer power, maybe the Nike of oral healthcare. Joe, it'd be really helpful now that you've seen some of the progress with these initiatives. And some of the progress with SDC for that matter, if you could just sort of refresh us on your thinking on the path there and how this plays into your thinking about the 15 to 25 range with the business really sitting at the high-end? Thanks so much. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Steve, first of all, I mean you saw our presence at IDS. We had a strong present at AAO in San Diego. But I hear your comments like that, one thing I want to make sure is that we're not looking at ourselves as a general dentistry company. We do clear aligner systems and we do scanners and we don't have the kind of penetration into marketplace we think we should have here and anywhere in the world. And so we'll stay focused on those items. So I don't want anyone to think that we're trying to broaden our wings to become more of a general dentistry company. It's not what \u2013 it's kind of in the cards. I think, what you \u2013 when you \u2013 Steve, when you look at the Google searches that have really rocketed for clear aligners over the last quarter or so, some heavy investing by SDC and also having invested by us, it's generating a lot of interest from a consumer standpoint in the marketplace. More and more, we know we have a strong consumer brand and we'll reach out the consumers who try to drive that. But again, I want to emphasize, we're a doctor-directed kind of a product line. We work through our docs to get these things done and we do want to establish a strong brand identity with consumers as they turn into patients. At the same time, we don't have a direct-to-consumer kind of model that we're pushing at the moment. We got to exercise through SDC and our supply for those kinds of things. I hope \u2013 does that help, Steve? Does that make sense to you? Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It's loud and clear. Thanks, Joe. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And I will congratulate on a quarter because it really was. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : The first question I just had on SmileDirectClub, in the past, we've heard some discussion from orthodontists little nervous what this might mean for their practice. I'm just wondering, can you update us on where the conversations have been at the respective conferences you've attended so far? Clearly, some of the initiatives you have in place from a advertising standpoint, they must be drawing in new patients. So I'm assuming orthodontists are getting comfortable that it's not going to cannibalize their business. But any update there? And then I have a follow-up. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, Rich, I'd say, we announced July last year the SDC relationship that we have. This caused a lot of turmoil in the industry in a sense of what we did and why we did. We continue to explain to our customer base in the sense of a logic behind that. Their business continues to expand and the market continues to expand. So I think there \u2013 I can't tell you that this will ever go away. There's still I would quantify is a large amount of anxiety in the marketplace. I don't think that will change. What I do find though, Rich, is that customers that do a significant amount in Invisalign and have a good relationship with Align tend to understand this more or accept it more. Once it happens and once its stay more in the metals and brackets, I think it'd been more voice for us or more concern than some of our \u2013 now that's empirical. I can't give you any statistics specifically on our customer based on that. But it's what I feel. But I \u2013 overall, I think as time goes on and the orthodontic market continues to expand as well as the consumer market continues to expand, and the \u2013 I think it generates, as we said before, huge amount of business goes for the GPs and the orthos that use Invisalign and we'll continue to recycle patients that don't fit the protocols that SDC has into the current customer base that we have. So I just say we have to keep working it, Rich. If we're not out of the woods in the sense of discomfort of our customers. But we'll keep driving the same message, we'll keep bringing business into those accounts, to help those accounts grow and hopefully they'll reach a high comfort level over time. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And then just one follow-up. On the distributor acquisitions you're doing internationally. Wondering if you could just quantify the contribution that you saw in the quarter and what we should think going forward? And also, are there additional ones we should expect in future quarters aside from the ones you executed in 1Q and if you could talk to the gross margin impact as well? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take that one, Rich, this is John. The impact is very, very small when we get closed those deals in the first quarter, so there's really not much of a material effect that we saw. But it is in line with our overall strategy where we want to be able to have our own sales team, go to \u2013 work in those markets and try to grow faster. So it continues and it's part of our strategy, but there really is a really small factor to start in the first quarter. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks and good afternoon. I'll also congratulate you guys on a pretty strong results. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So the average selling price numbers look pretty solid and probably reflects at least \u2013 the other price increase you took several months ago. But just on pricing in the market, and we did notice that ClearCorrect announced the shift in their pricing at AAO over the weekend where now practitioners can pay per aligner. This probably only has impact maybe on the low-end of the market, but just curious if you have any thoughts about their pricing change that whether it really matters for Align overall? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, Steve. I think, I mean I saw that too. It's pretty well presented by ClearCorrect. I think if you have kind of product that they have, that's a pretty simple way to go to marketplace. And so we don't see that changing our strategy because when you look at the sophistication of our product line and how it is directed towards certain malocclusions and the number aligners associated with it, our pricing makes sense in that way. But if you're ClearCorrect, I'd say that that was a simple way to go about it. And I think it makes sense in that into the marketplace. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Got it. Okay. That's it for me. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: All right, Steve. Thanks. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I'll limit myself to two questions. First one is just international. I mean big, big numbers, diverse growth. EMEA was up 38%, Joe, a big acceleration from the 4Q 2016 number of up 20%. And I know 4Q 2016 had some sort of EMEA backlog moving parts, if you would. So just maybe your thoughts on how that market is growing? Is the best to look at it \u2013 I guess what I'm asking is somewhere in between that 20% deceleration that we saw exiting 2016 and the big 38% number that you put up them in 1Q 2017? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Jon, that's a great question. They came back very strong in that sense. I would say that in this case, we continue to do incredibly well in Spain. You see us in the U.K., both from a GP standpoint, orthodontics standpoint continues to grow and we're seeing great strength out of Germany also, France. So by country, when I look at that and again I've spent a lot of years over in Europe too, all those countries are so different when you see that kind of acceleration and growth across each one of those countries, the team is executing well on the strategy across all the different cultures. I honestly would say it's hard to explain exactly what happened in the fourth quarter in EMEA. I would tell you that internally, we probably did not guess the vacation schedule as well as what happened in Europe. And we had some bleed over, obviously, from a case shipment standpoint. And I'd say in general, we as a company, we haven't anticipated well the turndown in the holidays in Europe and how that can affect case growth. So I think behind your question, Jon, there's \u2013 we're executing well over there, we're excited about it. Obviously, this expansion that we've done in the Middle East and Russia with this next distributor acquisition is something we know how to do. We've proven we really can grow from that. I'm confident we can continue to drive some pretty impressive numbers out of Europe as the team continues to execute there. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, very helpful. And then the other one just specific to SDC, it seems the cases that you guys are providing them are still in sort of infancy stage. But Joe, I'd love your thoughts on how that \u2013 you came into the agreement nine months ago or so. How that doctor-directed at-home market has progressed? And rather than cannibalizing a ton of Align cases, I guess what I'm trying to figure out, is there a component of this where you have another player out there talking about clear aligners, spending marketing dollars. Is that helping to sort of stimulate the entire market, which could be a precursor for what happens when some of the other big ortho companies, if they do come out with their clear aligner products? Thanks guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yes, Jon, I'd say we think that this is helping to stimulate the whole clear aligner category. SDCs, they spend a lot of money, they're very good in a sense of how they advertise. We see that as we go to marketplace too. So I do think that's a component in the growth of the marketplace right now. I'd also caution you, Jon, as the other clear aligner companies come in, I don't expect big consumer spend. These are companies that you normally just sell to orthodontists through their channels or through distribution channels. They're not used to massive consumer advertising campaigns and the associated \u2013 expense associated with that. So I'm not so sure that the next list of competitors, and you can reel them off as much as I can, are going to come into the marketplace with that kind of gunpowder to go directly to consumer. I don't think the SDC and our model will be broadly duplicated with the next round of competition. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Understood. Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good evening, guys. Let me ask maybe two revenue questions, and then I have a margin question as well. But Joe, on the revenue, the guidance you're giving for second quarter and then for the full year, it would seem to imply a slowdown in the second half to maybe 20% revenue growth. And given the strength this quarter, that's almost hard to imagine, which just a couple of quarters ago, that would've been a good number. And so just trying to figure out if there's just conservatism in there? What kind of \u2013 how you're thinking about the second half playing out? And then on the international side, for a long time, we've kind of heard the story that you need to continue to invest in the international markets to really kind of sustain 30% growth. You tick up to 40% this quarter, is that kind of \u2013 should we be thinking about sustainability now above 30% in the international markets at least in the near-term? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay, Jeff. This is John. I'll take the question. On revenue, what we've seen in the first half is you saw great performance in the first quarter. We continue to see that as we head into the second quarter. Strong performance and we're guiding to the high side of what we had in our long-term model of case shipments on our high side of 27%. Our strategies are playing out. We're seeing that in what we've seen in volume and that's why we felt comfortable of taking this to the high-end of our guidance to closer to the 25% for the year. And as we get through this quarter and the second quarter, we'll revisit that if the volume continues to where we see it. So right now, it's not being conservative. We're just kind of calling what we see. And then in terms of the growth that you saw \u2013 that you were talking about, was this specifically for international or are you \u2013 was it... Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: EMEA or APAC or... Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Pretty much just rolling the international up all together, we've kind of long thought of that as the sustainable 30% or 25% to 30% and you have to keep investing to maintain that kind of number. Now we see it up to 40%. Just wondering how sustainable is that here going forward? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I mean so we definitely still have volume opportunities in these developing countries. So that is growth opportunities for us. We've mentioned on our earlier part of this call about some of the distributor deals and some of the things that we're going direct. That should help us with some of the volume. But we're still seeing a lot of growth and a lot of opportunities in places like China and parts of EMEA and so on. And we're going to continue to push for that growth where we can and we expect it to continue to keep growing like it has. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Fair enough. And then just on the margin side. A couple of quarters here where margins have been down. Your guiding, for the full year, obviously, flat to up slightly, so many initiatives going on at this point that's really helping support that top line. I guess, what gives you the confidence? And where does the margin improvement come from I guess, going forward with all this investment that you've got going on at this point? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, what we've seen, Jeff, so far is we've invested as we have really last year and now into this year upfront with a lot of our sales initiatives, some of our marketing expenses upfront. We're seeing that volume come through and that's happened in the first quarter and expected to continue into the year. And that's what gives us confidence in holding our margin rate flat to slightly up from last year. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: All right, Jeff. See you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Please pardon any mispronunciation. Please proceed with your question. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I think that's me. You mentioned the ERP process is driving that DSO number higher. You say it's kind of a several quarter phenomena, but can you give us any granularity around that? It's getting to be a larger number. So when is a reasonable timeframe to see that number turn over and see the cash start to improve? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, Robert. It's something that we've worked hard within the companies to try to improve. It's not \u2013 the big ERP implementation we had was last July. But we've also been putting on additional entities and going live on our new ERP. And that has caused us to struggle a little bit in terms of getting some of those collections and moving from one system to another, getting customers and our collectors to kind of be in sync. We expect that it's going to start to come down as we go through this year. And some of the initiatives that we have that to be able to really focus on those collections and also work on our ERP to make sure that we're able to fix some of these issues that we have. But we expect it to start coming down. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And there's no bad debt experience of consequence? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Now what we've seen is as we've tested and has gone through, it's taking longer for us to collect but it's not turned into bad debt. It's just a slower pain that we normally experience. But the bad debt has not increased. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. One last question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, good afternoon. Not to disparage the results at all, but I'm curious if the North American GP experience in the first quarter was in line or maybe better than your plan? It seems that it was more in line I suppose with typical seasonality whereas we saw the rest of the business really pick up in the first quarter versus historical trend, curious on your thoughts there? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, Brandon, it's Joe. I'd say it's in line to trending up. Maybe slightly stronger than what we thought. I'd say it straight and probably came from like we mentioned DSOs more than anything. And I work with them. So we thought good about the quarter in that sense. And they're not dramatic, but let's say trending up. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : If you can, one more. Curious if you have any data or if you even track this in terms of like the new iTero shipments. Last year was a big year in terms of how many of those go to non-Invisalign docs? And kind of what the uptake trajectory or trend might be from doc to get one of the new scanners sort of translating those into pull through for new case starts? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: That's always kind of a magic question around the table here is \u2013 we do know that we do see an uptick and uses of Invisalign when we sell Invisalign and account. Usually, that account has already been associated with Invisalign in some way, Brandon. So, but we haven't been able to quantify that. Sometimes, it's a blip, sometimes it's bigger. Sometimes it tends to kind of fall back down to the initial line as an Invisalign customer some point. But we certainly know that once your customer does get an Invisalign scanner, they tend to do more Invisalign cases. And frankly, we can bring more power to that customer in the sense of the software and the ease of the use of the product line that we really start to build in with the iTero scanner. As far as how many we sell to non-Invisalign accounts, I really don't have that data and I don't think we've kept track of that data at all. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Fair enough. Thank you. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Operator, we'll take one more question, please? Operator : Not a problem. Our last question will come from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks very much. Joe, given the nice uptick in growth, what is your sense about the underlying market on the ortho side? Are your customers reporting any changes in their sort of typical case start growth or is this all share gains on your part? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, I mean we're seeing an increase of orthodontic patients through the orthodontists that we track and we talk to, John. So we do have a healthy orthodontic market behind us. There's no doubt. I think our team expansion shows that we have taken significant share in that area too. So look, it's wonderful to have a good \u2013 a stronger market behind you like that, but this is a story of a strong market and a share shipped at the same time. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. And what are your views as the underlying market growth? We'd sort of put it maybe at about 4% on a unit basis. Would that be in sync with what you hear from your customers? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yes, right on. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. And then one other one, the very good growth in DSOs, I assume that's primarily in North America. Can you just talk a little bit about what your strategy has been to drive that? Or has it really been just as those entities get bigger, they viewed Invisalign as a good same-store growth driver? Just curious what you're seeing? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Look, it kind of \u2013 John, you led the question really well, I mean it's kind of a story at a DSO level. As soon as you join the DSO, it's all about growth, right. And we're trying to transfer best practices on growth and efficiency across all the different units that they have. Invisalign is a great story because you can attract more patients with Invisalign, you have a different revenue source and you tend those patients to attract with Invisalign. You tend to keep them over time, too. And so, we incentivize these customers, we train them as much as we possibly can, with more work to make it as easy to use Invisalign as possible. And it's worked out well. Obviously, Heartland has been a good partner for us and several other DSOs that we have out there. And it's a good business partnership in that sense, but a lot of work we have to do to work together to get the right advertising in place, demographics from a patient identification standpoint, the training is necessary for each one of those. DSOs can really help to facilitate that based on a kind of organization that they are. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.

Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights on the quarter, and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. Our second quarter results were better than expected across all key financial metrics, including revenue, volume, margins and EPS. Q2 revenues increased 32.3% year-over-year, driven by strong Invisalign case shipments across all channels, and especially in the teen segment. Solid execution of our strategy and key investments continue to deliver strong growth across the board, with record Invisalign volume in almost every geography. Q2 also had all-time high of nearly 5,000 newly trained doctors in a quarter for the first time ever. And our iTero scanner business also performed well this quarter with revenues up 36.7% year-over-year. For Q2, North American Invisalign case volume was up 10.3% sequentially and 27.6% year-over-year, reflecting strong year-over-year growth from both orthodontists and GP dentist channels. Continued uptake with teens drove Invisalign growth in North America and contributed to another record quarter for ortho volumes, up 34.5% year-over-year, and an utilization up to 13.6 cases per doctor. Q2 volume for North America GP dentist increased 18.9% year-over-year, primarily reflecting continued expansion of our GP customer base and utilization growth, which increased to a record 3.3 cases per doctor. Q2 was the first quarter we offered Invisalign Lite in North America and we saw solid uptake, especially among GP dentists. Invisalign Lite includes up to 14 stages of aligners and is intended to treat simple to moderate cases. Q2 Invisalign volume for international doctors was up 13.6% sequentially and 37.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by new customers in both EMEA and APAC regions. In EMEA, Q2 volumes were up 33.2% year-over-year. All five of our core European markets showed record growth rates led by Spain and the UK. Expansion markets also had record volume with over 50% year-over-year growth led by Central and Eastern Europe and the Benelux. In Asia Pacific, Q2 volumes were up 44.4% year-over-year led by China where we trained over 1,000 doctors for the first time, followed by growth from Southeast Asia, Japan, and ANZ. Turning to the teen markets, over 55,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners in Q2, up 12.6% sequentially and 37.6% year-over-year, reflecting continued acceleration above adult case volume growth. North America ortho teen cases increased 11.6% sequentially and 42.1% year-over-year compared to adult cases of 9.8% and 30.5%, the third consecutive quarter teen growth rate that has been above adults. International case shipments to teen patients increased both 13.7% sequentially and 40.5% year-over-year as well. In Q2, we expanded commercialization of Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement to select countries in EMEA and APAC. MAT (05:29), as we call it, is the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction that advances the mandibular while moving teeth at the same time. While we're still very early in adoption cycle to-date, we're pleased with the initial update and expect to see continued ramp-up over the course of the year Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement is not available in the U.S. yet where it's pending FDA approval. The Invisalign brand and our consumer marketing campaign programs continue to be key factors in raising awareness and creating demand for Invisalign treatment. In Q2, we continued to benefit from our investments in new programs as well as optimizing online spending and media mix for existing programs. In U.S., we launched our new teen-focused marketing campaign in May that aims to educate teens and their parents, moms especially, about the benefits of teeth straightening with Invisalign clear aligners. It also works to ensure that teens know Invisalign treatment is the best option for their lifestyle. The new program contributed significant growth in consumer demand during the quarter that helped drive Invisalign teen volume. Our teen campaign expands to the Invisalign Made to Move campaign that we introduced in March and we continue to see positive impact from the overarching campaign and consumer interest as well. Specifically, in Q2, we saw 23% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and achieved significant growth year over year in doctor locator searches. We also saw continued uptick in adult male patients as compared to females as a result of our changing consumer targeting approach. In EMEA, early results show the Invisalign Made to Move campaign is resulting in higher engagement with consumers across digital display, PPC and social channels. During the quarter, we piloted new social media formats that delivered exceptional results, Pinterest, Facebook Canvas and Instagram, all outperforming benchmarks. Social media remains a key driver delivering 200% more users. Although we also saw a significant increase in the number of smile assessment completions, plus 22%, and total leads, plus 30%, and we'll continue to roll out the Made to Move campaign across the remaining countries in EMEA in Q3. In the Asia Pacific region, our Q2 customer marketing campaign is focused primarily on Australia and New Zealand where we saw momentum from our Summer Campaign featuring Invisalign Ambassador, John (sic) Jason Dundas, a well-known TV host and personality in Australia. The campaign shares Jason's personal journey of how Invisalign treatment helped transform his smile and his career along with a call to action for consumers focused on their New Year's resolution to improve their lives by getting the smile they've always wanted. We also continued driving Invisalign website doctor locator visits by reaching out to potential patients who engaged with our ads and banners in Q1. And in India, where we're just getting started, we participated in Beach Fashion Week, where the Invisalign brand was their Beautiful Smile Partner. In Q2, our scanner revenues increased 36.7% year over year and 26.9% sequentially. In May, we announced the new iTero Element 1.5 software upgrade, which includes two key features, TimeLapse and 1 minute scans. TimeLapse compares a patient's prior 3D scans to their most current scan and gives doctors an enhanced visualization assessment and communications tool that can help them provide additional treatment recommendations. 1 minute scans enable practitioners to complete a full arc scan in less than a minute, with the same accuracy and reliability practitioners have come to expect from iTero scanners. The use of our iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to expand, remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. In Q2, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in North America increased to a record 59%, up from 47% in Q2 of last year. In the doctor-directed, at home channel, Q2 was our second full quarter supplying clear aligners to SmileDirectClub or SDC. Q2 shipments to this new channel was strong and nearly tripled sequentially off a small base. As their exclusive third-party supplier, we produced roughly one-third of SmileDirectClub's clear aligner volume and they manufacture the remaining amount. In Q2, SDC continued to invest significantly in consumer marketing, including TV advertising, print, online media, including social media, which we believe has a positive effect on both SDC and Invisalign demand. We also opened several new SmileShops in the U.S., which are continuing to ramp. Overall, we're excited about the long-term potential for the at home, doctor-directed market; remain pleased with our investment and supply agreement. Today, we also announced that we have purchased an additional 2% of SmileDirectClub for $12.8 million, which brings our total ownership to 19%. We've extended SDC's line of credit from $15 million to $30 million. Finally, before I turn the call over to John, I want to provide a brief update on our operational expansion plans. In June, we opened a new treatment planning facility in Chengdu, China which services and supports our customers within China. It also serves as a clinical education and training center for all of our customers across Asia Pacific. We have been steadily migrating Chinese Invisalign cases to Chengdu and are continuing to train new technicians and improved lead times. We'll also open a treatment planning facility to support our EMEA customers in Cologne, Germany in Q3. With that, I'll turn it over to John. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total company revenue for the second quarter was a record $356.5 million, up 14.9% from the prior quarter and up 32.3% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Clear aligner revenue of $321 million was up 13.7% sequentially, driven primarily by better than expected Invisalign shipments and higher Invisalign ASPs. Year over year clear aligner revenue growth, up 31.9%, reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies and increased prices. This was partially offset by product mix shift to non-comprehensive products, primarily driven by increased sales of SDC clear aligners, higher discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Q2 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially approximately $15 from Q1 to $1,285 reflecting price increases and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by increased promotional discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 Invisalign ASPs were flat, reflecting price increases, offset by increased promotional discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. For the second quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 231.9 thousand cases were up 11.5% sequentially, driven primarily by our international doctors and North American orthodontists. Year-over-year Invisalign case volume growth was up 31%, driven by growth across all regions as well as expansion of our customer base, primarily from Asia Pacific. For North American orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up 10.5% sequentially and up 34.5% year over year. For North American GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 9.9% sequentially and up 18.9% year over year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 13.6% sequentially and up 37.4% year over year. Our Scanner & Services revenue for the second quarter was $35.4 million, up 26.9% sequentially and up 36.7% year-over-year. Moving onto gross margin, second quarter overall gross margin was 76%, up 0.1 point sequentially and down 0.2 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 78.1%, up 0.2 point sequentially, primarily due to leveraging our manufacturing costs over higher volumes. Clear aligner gross margins were down 0.5 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower ASPs. Scanner gross margin for the second quarter was 56.7%, up 0.6 points sequentially, primarily due to lower services cost on our installed base and partially offset by lower ASPs. Scanner segment gross margin was up 3.1 points year-over-year, primarily a result of lower service costs and product mix shift to our lower cost iTero Element scanner. Q2 operating expenses were $187.3 million, up sequentially by $13.4 million or 7.7%, primarily related to increased employee head count, marketing programs, including our advertising campaigns, key customer events and international commercialization efforts. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 operating expenses were up 33.7%, reflecting increased head count and continued investment in our go-to-market activities critical to the growth of the business. Our second quarter operating margin was 23.4%, up 3.5 point sequentially and down 0.8 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin relates primarily to increased clear aligner volumes. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in operating margin primarily reflects higher operating expenses, as we invest in head count, geographic expansion and new products in order to increase adoption and accelerate the growth of our business. With regards to our second quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 17.7%, which includes $1.1 million in excess tax benefit and is down by approximately 5.5 points compared to prior year, primarily due to a favorable resolution of foreign jurisdiction unrecognized tax benefits during the quarter. We supply aligners to SmileDirectClub, and, therefore, revenue and cost for this activity are included in our operating profit and reporting results, although they were immaterial to the company this quarter. Additionally, we report our share of SmileDirectClub's losses below operating margin and our tax provision, and is entitled Equity and Losses of Investee, net of tax. Our Q2 loss, net of tax was approximately $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.85, flat compared to Q1 and up 37% compared to prior year. Moving onto the balance sheet, as of the second quarter cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $676.6 million. This compared to $644.2 million at the end of Q1, an increase of approximately $32.4 million, primarily related to net income growth and our collections efforts. Of our $676.6 million of cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities, $218.4 million was held by the U.S. and $458.2 million was held by international entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $291.7 million, up approximately 9.2% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 74 days, down three days sequentially and up 10 days year-over-year. The year-over-year increase is a result of our ERP and other related systems implementation last July, which have impacted our timing of our customer collections. As we work through these changes, we anticipate that our DSOs will continue to decline over the next few quarters. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $110.5 million, up $34.3 million compared to prior year. Free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $92 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $18.5 million, primarily relating to building improvements, equipment purchases for additional manufacturing capacity, as well as our global expansion efforts. During the second quarter, we paid $50 million under an accelerated stock repurchase plan, ASR, in which we received an initial delivery of approximately 300,000 shares of common stock. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined at the completion of the ASR, based on Align's volume-weighted average stock price during the term of the ASR, less an agreed upon discount. Their remains approximately $250 million available for repurchases under the existing stock repurchase authorization. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we have purchased an additional 2% of SmileDirectClub for $12.8 million, which brings our total ownership to 19%. And we extended SDCs line of credit from $15 million to $30 million. All other terms remain the same. With that, let's turn to our Q3 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For our international markets, expect Invisalign volume to be up sequentially which reflects continued strong growth in APAC, partially offset by summer holidays in EMEA. For North America, expect Invisalign volume to be flat to slightly down sequentially reflecting stronger teen volume for orthos, offset by GP dentists who typically have less days in the office and lighter patient traffic during the summer. For our scanner business, we expect revenues to be up sequentially. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 231,000 to 234,000 cases, up approximately 30% to 32% over the same period a year ago, reflecting continued strong demand, including summer seasonality in North America, ortho, and Asia Pacific. We expect Q3 net revenues to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million, an increase of 27% to 29% year-over-year. We expect Q3 gross margins to be in the range of 74.7% to 75.7%, reflecting higher ASPs, partially offset by higher expenses as we globalize our treatment planning operations. We expect Q3 operating expenses to be in the range of $184.5 million to $187.5 million, relatively flat on a sequential basis. Q3 operating margin should be in the range of 22.7% to 23.6%. Our effective tax rate, including an excess tax benefit of about $1 million, should be approximately 21%. We expect a $2 million loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.8 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q3 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.81. In addition, as we continue to operationalize expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q3 to be approximately $70 million to $75 million, which includes purchasing a new facility in Costa Rica for $26.1 million. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, John. Overall, we're pleased to see the first half of the year off to such a strong start. Many of you already recently think of a question about us being at a tipping point and I'm sure we'll get that question following today's call. Frankly, we think it's too early to tell. The growth we're seeing in our business is better than we expected and reflects progress in several areas, including clinical efficacy, sales coverage and support models, customer engagement and demand generation and patient capture. We believe it also reflects a healthy underlying market with solid patient traffic and a significant increase in direct to consumer programs by us and others. There's still a lot of work ahead as we move toward our goal of replacing metal braces and making Invisalign the standard-of-care in orthodontics. We know there will be challenges and we aren't drawing a straight line up and to the right at this point. But we're confident in our ability to drive this industry forward and transform it from an outdated analog process to a fully digital system. Thanks for your time today and we look forward to your questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the questions. Joe, the teen growth for the past couple of quarters now \u2013 the acceleration has been noticeably pretty steep, understanding that it's obviously not one factor that's driving this acceleration. Is there any couple areas that you would point to specifically, anything that you could just help us get our head around what you think is most resonating with practitioners in the marketplace? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Bob, from a teen's standpoint, overall, I'll just focus on North America for a second. We mentioned last year when we put our plan together that we would have a strong focus on teens as we go into the second quarter this year, because this is the teen season for North America. What we started that program off with is we had several programs in North America just to get doctors ready for this program overall, next-level partnership, a program we call IMOP (23:50), some specific things that really focused on teen to get that base ready. And then we started to really unleash the communications part of this, the $14 million or so that we're moving in consumer advertising to do that. So I think when you look at the first half and those two kind of simultaneous actions, that's been really one of the biggest underlying drivers in North America to make that really go. That along with our ad campaigns and everything else we've put in place that are much more specific these days in the sense of how we go to market. You see how we're working both at teens channels and the moms channels from a marketing standpoint also. It's just a much cleaner, more specific approach to teens that includes a real sales effort with our doctors and a real strong customer patient facing piece with moms and teens. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, I appreciate all that. And I guess just shifting over, I had a question on North American GPs. I know the focus just has been on orthos and rightfully so, but noticed that the North American GPs saw a significant step-up from the level of growth you had been seeing. Anything that you would talk to there specifically that you think would attribute to the step-up in growth we saw in the quarter? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say two major variables, Bob. One would be just media spend. We've had a significant increase in media spend itself and we have seen a strong correlation between media spend in the U.S. and the GP increase. And then secondly, like our Lite product that we introduced in the second quarter with the GP segment, we're more and more targeting that segment with easier products that are more simple for them to deliver to the marketplace. So I'd say media spend in some specific products have really helped in that sense. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for the questions. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay, Bob. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, Brandon. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Joe, on SmileDirectClub, could you give us the sense of how much the manufacturing volume you did for them in the first quarter? And I'm just curious like why the additional equity investment couldn't have been larger and if that was even an option for you guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, you know what, we mentioned in my briefing that we're doing one-third of their cases right now. It's still not material in that sense, Brandon. We just wanted to give you just an idea of where we stand overall. They do still two-thirds of their volume. As far as the percent equity, it was just an opportunity we have. We work closely with David and his team at SDC. And that equity was available. We're pleased with the relationship and we thought that was just a great next step for us in that sense. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : And then on teen, I'm curious if the second quarter was materially ahead of where you thought it would be in terms of volumes? And then would it be reasonable to expect a further acceleration in the teen growth rate in the third quarter given that the ad campaign didn't really start until mid-2Q? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take that one, Brandon. This is John. What we saw with teens that helped us contribute to some of the upside that we saw in the second quarter for some of the volume and it's part of the overall campaign that we have where we're spending additional this year. And our guidance in Q3 reflects all those factors into our numbers. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. And then the $14 million for the ad campaign, was that all absorbed in 2Q or is there some that rolls into the third quarter as well? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: That's throughout the year. I mean primarily where a lot of that hits in the second quarter and third quarter, but there is additional spend throughout the year. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Got you. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Brandon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, John. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Another just quick follow-up on SmileDirect. When you did that deal, I think, you said that when income in case volume came in, if the case was too complicated, it would sort of get pushed into Invisalign. Is that the case? And if so, what have you learned? And what sort of percentage of case volume ends up driving into Invisalign? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: We haven't had \u2013 John, it's Joe. We haven't had terrific conversion rates in that sense, but we've learned a lot and we tweak that model all the time is the patient to SmileDirectClub service, they have a certain price point in mind. They usually have a simple kind of an approach that they want in the sense of correcting their smile. And they need to be dealt with really quickly. In other words, when those patients are interested, moving them into an orthodontist in this case or a GP that wants to do that, it has to be done quickly and concisely, because these patients are \u2013 they're just different than the normal patients that we work with. So we keep honing that model. We've had some success and we keep building on it, but we think in the future, as we put this thing together, we'll have a much better yield. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And, Joe, I think, you said you're just getting started on India. Can you talk a little bit more about that market, maybe try to size it for us and just kind of lay out what sort of strategy you're thinking about to ramp it over time? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Oh, India. You said, India, John? John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, India. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: India. That's India. I'll go back to India again this year. I was just there last year. What we do when we go into a country like that, John, is you really do this by city. You go in a city and you recruit doctors and you just begin to ramp up in those specific cities. You find great doctors in the sense of peer-to-peer being able to \u2013 one doctor teach another. And so, you look at this as almost the city-by-city effort in India. We'll take obviously the biggest and the most prosperous cities first and we work out from there. We're really in our second year of this in a big way. We're reaching our goals. The businesses has been growing pretty rapidly in that sense and this is a model we really follow all over the world. It's just when you get to India, you just have to make sure that you approach it in an Indian way. And here is an example what's an Indian way is. They often don't want to buy our scanners. So what we have is a scanner that's up in a few of them in a city on a truck, just they rent and we move them in almost daily into different offices. They line up patients to do scans. And so we just acclimatize, to use that word to the marketplace, and keep working that. So we're excited about it and we feel very confident of our long-term trend there. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks much. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Adam Krasner - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Adam Krasner on for Erin. I just wanted to touch on the strength in doctors trained in the quarter. I'm trying to get a sense of what the typical ramp is for new doctors who were added to get up towards the average level of productivity? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Average ramp of a new doctor? Is that... Adam Krasner - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. Like that probably didn't contribute very much to the record shipments in the quarter, the fact that you added so many new doctors or did it? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: So, where we're having a lot of expansion opportunities, obviously, outside (30:54) or adding new doctors. So you're seeing a lot of the growth outside the U.S. being driven by adding new doctors. In the U.S. and in particular in both our ortho and GP channels, you're seeing growth by utilization predominantly, but we saw both as a driver in the GP channel. Adam Krasner - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. And do you have a sense of \u2013 I'm looking at the statistic in the press release of 123,000 doctors trained worldwide. Is there a sense for what the total size of that market is to get a flavor of kind of how far the penetration is as of now? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. So, when you look at the total size of the number of orthodontists and general dentists \u2013 and we can follow-up with you if you want more details \u2013 in the U.S., there is roughly 140,000, 150,000 GPs and orthodontists, roughly 10,000. Outside the U.S., the market is substantially larger. In Europe, there's probably 300,000. In Asia Pacific, there's probably twice that. So very, very \u2013 yes, it's huge. It's four or five times up. So \u2013 and we're happy to provide more stats for you offline. Adam Krasner - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Adam. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good afternoon, Joe and John. Incredible results. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, Steve. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So as you've been doing work and just talking to more practitioners, we're getting even greater appreciation for the SmartTrack aligner material. And, I guess, the disclosure back in May that you got the two patents issued, just curious to get more color around the patent protection on that material. If you think it is a critical part of the overall picture. I mean the biggest thing is \u2013 these seem to be the primary patents to protect that material, just want to confirm that. And then one was filed in 2012, the other one in 2016. But really, I guess, what I care about more than anything else is that what's the expiration dates? How long will you get protection on these materials? Is it 20 years from the date of filing or 20 years from date of issuance? I just forgot the details around that. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Steve, it's Joe. Data filing is 20 years. There's some multi-layer material. Yeah. We do have patent protection on it now. The vendor that we use on it has a certain amount of restrictions in the sense of dentistry and where it can be used, but also has patents on process and all and how this is put together, not an easy material to doing that way. So yeah, I mean, just look at it as from data filing and all, we have a significant number of years that SmartTrack continue to be an Invisalign material. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, on the simple math, you should be good until about 2032 or so. Is that about right? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. We'll both be on a beach by then, so. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Just wanted to confirm that. Thanks. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, Jon. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Hey, guys. Joe, you'll be on the beach then. I still think I'll be at this desk right here. But maybe just some thoughts on 2017 and maybe I missed that, John, from your commentary or even the slides. But I think last quarter you talked about the high end of the 15% to 25% revenue growth and op margin in around 23%. Are there revisions to either of those numbers that you gave last call for 2017? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: What we've guided to Q3 \u2013 and you could see that from overall guidance standpoint. So, that's the update, Jon, that we have after we've seen Q2. And then from there, you can probably do the math to kind of get that overall from a year standpoint, but at least for the Q3 guide we feel comfortable with what we're seeing so far and that's what we ended up forecasting. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I mean I got it from a math perspective. I guess just to push you a little bit notably on the revenue. You blow out two or three \u2013 I'm sorry, you blow out 2Q. You guide 3Q ahead. Obviously you just keep it 25% for the year and would imply a bigger step down for 4Q, but, I guess, you're just sort of saying go with what you guys gave last quarter. There is no official change to those numbers. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: That's exactly what you're hearing, Jon. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: You said it better than we wanted to. That was really good. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. And then just any thoughts on the ASP? John, if you can remind us \u2013 I believe you took price in the U.S. earlier in the year. Did you take price internationally more recently? And then the euro for the first time in several quarters sort of flipping, should be a tailwind. So maybe when you think out on the Invisalign ASP in the back half of 2017, is there any direction you can give us there? Thanks, guys. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. You're right, Jon. In North America, we took price increase in April. And in EMEA it came in July. So the price increases have happened. And, as we look at what's happening for the next quarter, we're pretty much expecting price to be flat to this quarter. So we have price increases. We also have other pressures and FX unfavorability as well, but you net all that out and third quarter we expect ASP to be flat. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Jon. Joe again, on your question on third quarter, fourth quarter. I think the best way to take what we're saying is we're not calling a step-down in the fourth quarter. We're just doing and giving you a good clarity on what the third quarter is. That's what we have clarity on now. And... Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Understood. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Understood. Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Jeff. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just on the ASPs, Jon's question just reminded me, he was asking about euro flipping and then maybe getting a little benefit over the next few quarters. John, as we get into 2018, are we inching closer at all to any release of those additional aligner reserves where that could theoretically start to help ASPs at all? Or is it still too early for thinking about any ASP benefit from those kind of factors? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Jeff, it's too early. I mean it's part of our overall plan, where we have that premium price product that has the additional aligners and that's built into the plans that we have and the pricing that we have. So, there's no extra reserve coming back related to that. It's just part of our overall plan from a strategic standpoint, as well as what we're thinking from an ASP standpoint. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Fair enough. And, Joe, I found your comments interesting at the very end of the call, just maybe a note of caution. And, obviously, I know as the numbers go up, so to do expectations, and so I guess trying to keep everybody kind of a little level headed here. But I think in the past calls, you've also talked about your confidence in clear aligners eventually replacing brackets and bands and why would you want metal on your teeth and things like that, and you had a slightly different message this evening. Is there anything looming over the next few quarters that has you maybe a little worried or you just want to make sure we all kind of account for tight rate in our models, anything like that? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: No, I'm not trying to give you any kind of warning or anything like that, Jeff. I have all the confidence in the world, like I said in my final comments, that we'll complete this mission of eliminating wires and brackets with a digital system, with plastic. I think, I get questions all the time as you can guess when you see these kind of growth rates about the tip \u2013 that we're at a tipping point in this business. I think we all know about the whole term tipping point, and what it would mean. And all I was trying to get across is I don't think you can take two quarters and draw a line towards the tipping point, but don't mistake in anything at all that there is something that we see that would in some way shake our confidence in what we think we can do. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Fair enough. I appreciate it, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Misra - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. This is actually Ravi in for Rich. Thanks for taking the questions. So just a couple if I can start just with the scanner business. You guided, I think, I heard up sequentially 3Q. Can you give us a little bit of a color in terms of what kind of penetration into your adoption base are you seeing here? I mean if we use a proxy of about 34,000 doctors that you shipped Invisalign product to last year, can you help us kind of understand what the runway here is for additional docs picking up this product? And then, secondly, just going to take a stab at the SDC volume. I'm guessing it may be about 2,000 cases in the quarter. Any direction on that? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Ravi, on the scanner penetration, you have to look at it as almost two separate markets, the orthodontic market and the GP market. I'm not sure exactly how far penetrated we are in the orthodontic side, but, let's say, what you have to look at is often when a doctor starts to do more and more Invisalign they want an iTero scanner per chair. And so you really can't look at it as a unit per doctor in that sense. You've got to look at it as a unit in the sense of number of chairs in that office. And so I'd say, obviously, we have a higher penetration rate right now on the ortho side than we do on the GP side, what's like Shirley quoted a moment ago at 150,000 GPs in the United States. We haven't really even begun in that sense. And that type of scanner has a good balance between Invisalign and being able to do restorative applications too. So if you're worried about kind of a max out on penetration that's not necessarily in the way that we're thinking certainly on a yearly basis. On the SDC volume piece, I don't think we've given out that data and I don't think we necessarily want to do that both for our sakes and SDC's too. Ravi Misra - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. And then if I can just get one more on just OpEx and investments. Some of the calls that we've spoken to is that dentists are pretty favorable on maybe shifting more of their cases towards Invisalign. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of the TFM, how that's kind of playing out as you brought it to the U.S. and whether you feel like you need to expand and doing more investments to support further conversion of these cases to Invisalign? Thanks? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Ravi, first, I think your question is a great question. It's just from a penetration standpoint how do you drive more of it, and what you do. TFM is one of it. I mean, we've really rolled that out strongly in North America this year. Our numbers are tremendous in the sense of when you have a customer who wants to dedicate time to really learn. So again think of TFM as kind of the learning curve, as you have primarily an analog process and your whole office is worked around gluing wires and brackets and adjusting emergencies to people's teeth and what's it look like when you go do more of a digital format. And at the front end of the digital system, how you work with ClinCheck. And these are doctors that come forward and say they want to devote 90 days, 120 days of just learning, spending time to learn how to really ramp up in a digital format and it works well. But it's self-selected in that case, because doctors come forward. They really want to do that and spend their time. I'd also say the other thing I've learned in this job over the last two years is how important peer-to-peer is from a growth standpoint. It is having really good strong doctors that can communicate to other doctors about how to use Invisalign. We see this not just in North America. We see it all over the world. It's critical. And we've ramped up new programs like IMOP (42:47) and some other things that just really helped in that sense, both across the orthodontic community and also across the GP community to do it. So those are the two big programs I'd say we use to address the question that you have about how you ramp-up doctors. Ravi Misra - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. Thanks. And if I could squeeze one last one in. Just given that the landscape in the dental industry you're out there right now and your cash balance, any type of color on what kind of acquisitions that you guys would be potentially interested in, beyond the \u2013 I appreciate that you've been kind of building out the OUS, kind of, sales base by some of those distributor purchases, but anything beyond that that we can kind of think about? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Ravi, I call than an IQ question, kind of, okay. And the way I'd answer that is we're in the clear aligner business and anything that help us to sell more clear aligners directly, it doesn't have to be explained, would be in our wind \u2013 our range. So, that's why we have a scanner business. We have a scanner business not from a diversification standpoint. We have a scanner business because it allows us to sell more clear aligners. And so, just you're not looking, I don't care how much cash we have. We're not looking to be a diversified dental company. We do clear aligners. Ravi Misra - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks. Appreciate the questions. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Ravi. We've got one more question, operator? Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks. This is actually Zach Wachter on for Steve. Joe, hey, just one question on Invisalign Go. I'm wondering if you could just update us, Joe, on the ramp there and how we should think about the timing of Go given that the GP channel seems to be doing a bit better here. When should we think about Go making a more substantial impact? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I think, Zach, the best way to think about that is if we take a step back from this whole thing. Our approach to GP channel more and more is we make it easy and efficient. And Go is a product like that. It's a product where you can adapt quickly from a GP standpoint. It does simple cases. Most Gos are less than, I think, 15 aligners or so. We've adopted the protocols to make it simpler for doctors to do also. So, I would say, don't just take Go. You can look in the future. We'll have a series of more simple kind of products and systems that we'll introduce to GPs to get through. iGo is just the first one of those. That's not to down-sell iGo, but as we learn from iGo, we continue to iterate on that product line and make new and new offerings. But it's a big part of our GP strategy overall, is having the right product and the right kind of system that have feature that make it really simple for the GP docs. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got you. Okay. And just last one then. As far as the distributors that you acquired in EMEA and Brazil Go, was there any meaningful impact in the quarter from that? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: No material impact and you usually don't see material impact in that for 18 months or two years really, so. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Next year this time is a great time to ask that question, Zach. Zachary R. Wachter - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. All right. Thanks for the question. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Zach. Operator : There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on our conference call today.

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights on the quarter, and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and Q3 results that exceed our expectations across our key financial metrics including revenue, volumes, margins and EPS. Our Q3 revenues increased 38.3% year-over-year driven by increase Invisalign volumes across all of our geographies as well as strong growth from our scanners. Our strong Q2 results also reflect accelerate growth from teenagers in both North America and Asia Pacific with total Invisalign shipments to team up 46.3% year-over-year and up 26.5% in Q2. On sequential basis revenues increased 8.1% driven by continued strength across Asia Pacific which offset expected seasonality in Europe as well as higher than expected revenues from shipments [as record]. For North America, Q3 Invisalign case volume was down 1.1% sequentially reflecting a decrease in GP dentist channel due to less patient traffic and fewer days in the office from the summer holidays.  In addition, as result of the devastation caused by hurricane Harvey and Irma, we estimate that our North American volumes are lower by approximately 1,500 cases in Q3 and mostly adults. These declines were partially offset by strong growth from the ortho channel, specially teens.  On the year-over-year basis North America was up 25% reflecting strong growth from the ortho channel, driven by an increase in team patients and in Invisalign express life products. Q3 in Invisalign volume for international doctors is up 6.8% sequentially, driven primarily by Asia Pacific region, which offset expected summer seasonality declines in EMEA. On year-over-year basis Invisalign volume was up 47.4% reflecting strong growth from both APAC and EMEA.  In EMEA, Q3 volumes were up 37.6% year-over-year lead by our core European markets particularly Spain, UK and France. We also saw strong growth across all of our smaller expansion markets, which includes central and eastern Europe, Benelux, Middle East and Africa, the Nordics and Russia.  In APAC Q3 volumes were up 57.4% year-over-year with record Invisalign across all country markets led primarily by China, Q3 marked the first quarter in which China was our second largest market in the world behind United States. Our asset customer base in APAC is almost triple year-over-year with over 1500 [doctors to entered] in Q3 mostly within China.  Turning to the teen market, over 698,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners in Q3, up 26.5% sequentially and 46.3% year-over-year, reflecting a very strong summer teen season and accelerating growth rates. North American ortho teen cases increased 22.9% sequentially and 43.6% year-over-year reflecting our continued efforts to drive adoption of teenage patients through sales initiatives and our direct-to-consumer campaign emphasizing teens and mom.  For international Q3 teen cases increased 36.7% sequentially and 65.7% year-over-year driven by accelerated growth across the APAC regions primarily led by China. The introduction of Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement is helping to raise visibility for Invisalign treatment of teenagers and contributed to some of the growth in the APAC region. We call the Invisalign treatment of mandibular advancement is the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction that advances the mandibular while moving teeth at the same time. Mandibular advancement is intercooled to increasing teen adoption. Approximately 30% to 45% of teen cases globally need Class II correction. Based on early indications we are seeing a positive correlation between those customers who use our mandibular advancement feature and the increased teen utilization.  One example is [Dr. Lethic] in Canada, who has seen the benefits of switching from an analog to digital method of orthodontist not just with mandibular advancement but with Invisalign treatment in general. With the launch of mandibular advancement and because of the renewed commitment to being fully digital in phasing out the use of metal braces [Dr. Lethic] has started 162 patients in Invisalign treatment since Q2 '17. Of those 120 were teenagers and 24 were treated with mandibular advancement features. This is compared to only 3 Invisalign patients in 2016 and only 1 Invisalign case in the first quarter of this year. That's an amazing transformation of [Dr. Lethic's] business and speaks towards the impact of digital growth for patients. Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement is not available in the United States yet, as it's currently pending FDA approval.  Our consumer marketing programs continue increased demand for Invisalign's treatment and our key to adoption in both the teen and adult segments. Each year we invest millions in consumer advertising and social and media campaigns to raise awareness, create preference and help consumers to find an Invisalign practice near them. In 2017, we increased our investment in consumer marketing by 60%, which we believe is contributing to our strong growth. But despite our efforts most of the consumers interested in Invisalign's treatment still end up in metal braces or don\u2019t start any type of orthodontic treatment at all. This is phenomena isn\u2019t new and we've been working through years to identify gaps like these and develop solutions that turn more consumers into Invisalign patients for our customers.  In January, we launched a new consumer capture program with a Smile Concierge team enrolling with Carolina whose goal is to reach more consumers one-on-one and ensures that anyone that contacts us directly has the best experience with Invisalign brand beginning to end. Our Smile Concierge service educates consumers on the benefits of Invisalign treatment, answers their questions and help them to schedule an appointment and Invisalign providers from our next level partnerships listed as DIT on Invisalign.com.locator. The team also follows up with consumers through digital apps and email to find out whether they keep their appointment and start Invisalign treatment. It's really existing to see how something as simple as direct personal touch has resulted in such positive response from our consumers and adopters.  The team received incredible feedback from consumers every day, who appreciate the white glove service we provide which is translating into shorter research cycles for the average consumer interested in the Invisalign treatment and a win-win for Align, our customers and consumers. Over the past 10 months our Smile Concierge team have contacted 50,000 consumers, who took a smile assessment on Invisalign.com and scheduled 20,000 consultations with nearly 800 Invisalign practices across the U.S.  Today 5000 have already started treatment within an Invisalign provider which equates to millions of dollars in revenue through Invisalign practices and we're just getting started. Our new Smile Concierge service is not only helping turn more consumers into Invisalign patients, we're also learning a lot about consumer conversion. For example, convenience and speed of contact are critical to conversion. If we can't schedule an appointment for consumers see a doctor within 72 hours mean they can't get on to the doctor's schedule within three days, the likelihood of that consumer converting to Invisalign patient drops by 40%.  On top of that for the consumers that get scheduled for a consultation, 65% of them cites financial concerns as the reason don\u2019t start treatment with 25% of them stating that a high down payment in the practice is the main barriers of acceptance. With that in mind as part of our smile concierge service, we just launched a patient financing pilot, that address consumer financing concerns as well as insurance coverage for orthodontic treatment. In developing this project, it's important for us to find the solutions that offers consumers the ability to customize their own down payment, monthly payment and interest rate in a way that can fit into any budget.  Equally important is providing an end to end digital workflow for both the consumer and the doctor and with our new third-party financer partner, we\u2019ve done just that. When consumers finance their treatment through us and Invisalign providers no longer pay Align, instead they just receive payment for the treatment fee minus Align's lab fee. By changing the financial relationship between the patient, Align and the provider, Invisalign treatment become a revenue source for the provider and eliminates the needs for them to pass on the high down payments to patients.  Finally, we've also learned what\u2019s important for consumers when it comes to choosing Invisalign practice and digital technology really matters. As part of the smile concierge referral process consumers are offered the top three Invisalign practices in their areas and it turns out that the iTero scanner is one of the key influencers. While this isn\u2019t surprising to us, it is important to be able to validate another example of digital technology like our iTero inner oral scanner replacing an old analog process like PVS impressions.  With that let\u2019s review the results for the iTero business. Q3 was a strong quarter for iTero and better than expected with revenues up 25% year-over-year on record iTero scanner shipments. The iTero scanner is central to restore the workflows and key to our GP strategy. In Q3, we saw a nice uptake by GP dentist with record contracts out of GP summit September. Q2 results also reflect the initial uptake of iTero scanner from its first commercial availability in Japan as well as from our new distribution agreement with Paterson Dental in United States and Canada.  Use of the iTero scanners from Invisalign case submission in place of PVS impressions continues to expand and remained a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q3, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in North American increased to a record 61.9% up from 48.8% in Q3 of last year. Overall, we continue to be excited about the long-term potential for at home doctor directed market and are pleased with our equity investment and supply agreement with SmileDirectClub. For Q3 in aligner shipments to SmileDirectClub or SDC were higher than expected and more than doubled sequentially reflecting continued strong volume growth as well as a shift to Align manufacturing more of SDCs aligners than what SDC internally produces. As SDC's is exclusive third partly supplier this quarter we produced about two thirds of the Clear aligner volume as compared to only one third in the prior two quarters. While this shift was not anticipated our world class manufacturing operations can accommodate changes in SDCs order flow easily. We are pleased that we are able to support their continued rapid growth. With that, I'll now turn it over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total company revenue for the third quarter was a record $385.3 million, up 8.1% from the prior quarter and up 38.3% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Clear aligner revenue up $341.6 million was up 6.4% sequentially, and higher than expected volume and variable foreign exchange rates as well as increased revenue from shipments to SEC. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth, of 40.2%, reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies, increased Invisalign prices and revenue from shipments to SDC. Q3 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially approximately $25 from Q2 to $1,310 reflecting favorable foreign exchange, a favorable shift in our product mix and price increases partially offset by increased promotional discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Invisalign ASPs were also up $25, reflecting price increases, an increase in additional aligner revenue, favorable foreign exchange partially offset by increased promotional discounts. For the third quarter, total Invisalign shipments of [236.1000] cases were up 1.8% sequentially, driven primarily by our Asia Pacific doctors and North American orthodontists. Year-over-year Invisalign case volume growth was up 32.8%, driven by growth across all regions, as well as expansion of our customer base, priced predominantly from Asia Pacific. For North American orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 1.8% sequentially and up 31.9% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was down 5.2% sequentially and up 15.9% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 6.8% sequentially and up 47.4% year-over-year. Our Scanner & Services revenue for the third quarter was $43.7 million, up 23.2% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year, primarily due to our continued investment in go-to-market activities in APAC and EMEA, as well as the initial uptick of the iTero Scanner from its first commercial availability in Japan. Moving onto gross margin, third quarter overall gross margin was 75.9%, down 0.1 point sequentially and up 0.8 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 77.9%, down 0.2 point sequentially, primarily due to an increase in aligners per case driven by additional aligners, partially offset by higher Clear aligner ASPs. Clear aligner gross margins was up 0.2 year-over-year primarily due to leveraging our manufacturing costs over higher volumes. Scanner gross margin for the third quarter was 60%, up 3.3 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs. Scanner segment gross margin was up 2.9 points year-over-year, primarily a result of lower service costs.  Q3 operating expenses were $193.7 million, up sequentially by $6.4 million or 3.4%, primarily related to increased global head count. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 operating expenses were up 31.7%, reflecting increased head count and continued investment in our go-to-market activities critical to the growth of our business. Our third quarter operating margin was 25.6%, up 2.2 points sequentially and up 3.3 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin relates primarily to increased clear aligner volume. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating margin primarily reflects higher revenue and lower cost per case partially offset by increased head count and higher marketing expenses.  With regards to our third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 17.9%, which includes $1.7 million in excess tax benefit and is down by approximately 0.5 points compared to 18.4% in the same quarter last year. Primarily due to 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-9 which requires access tax benefits related to stock based compensation we recognized as a reduction to tax expense and certain one-time tax charges encored in the prior year from implementing our new international corporate tax structure. The revenue and cost to supply aligner small direct club are included in our operating profit and reported results.  Additionally, we report our share of SmileDirectClub's losses below operating margin and our tax provision, and is entitled Equity and Losses of Investee, net of tax. Our share of SSE loss net of tax in Q3 was approximately $1.6 million decreasing our diluted earnings per share by $0.02. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.01 up 18.8% sequentially and up 60.3% compared to prior year.  Moving onto the balance sheet, as of the third quarter cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $739.9 million. This compared to $676.6 million at the end of Q2, an increase of approximately $61.3 million, primarily related to earnings growth. Of our $737.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $236.3 million was held by the U.S. and $501.6 million was held by our international entities. Q3 accounts receivable balance was $321.3 million, up approximately 10.2% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 75 days, up 1 day sequentially and down 3 days from 78 days in Q3 last year. We anticipate that our DSOs will continue to decline over the next few quarters. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $118.1 million, up $58.3 million compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $70 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $48.1 million, primarily relating to building improvements purchases and improvement, equipment purchases for additional manufacturing capacity as well as our global expansion efforts.  During the third quarter, we concluded our previously announced $50 million accelerated stock repurchase. We received a total of 0.4 million shares under the ASR, at a weighted average share price of $146.48. We have 250 million for repurchases under the existing stock repurchase authorization. With that, let's turn to our Q4 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For our international, we expect Invisalign volume to be up from Q3 as EMEA customers return from seasonally slower summer holidays, partially offset by a slight decreased in the APAC as the greater China market observes the golden week holiday. For North America, we expect Invisalign volume to be up sequentially reflecting the seasonally stronger quarter, partially offset by some lingering effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. For our scanner business, we expect slight sequential increases but in a typical strong end of the year demand for capital equipment. Q4 sequential growth reflects the benefits from orders taken at our North America GP Summit in Q3 and global expansion. As Joe commented earlier, this quarter we produced two thirds of SEC aligners. However, we expect our aligner shipments to SEC to be down sequentially in anticipation of a production ship back to their own internal manufacturing.  With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 245,000 to 250,000 cases, up approximately 29% to 32% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q4 net revenues to be in the range of $391 million to $398 million, an increase of approximately 33% to 36% year-over-year. We expect Q4 gross margins to be in the range of 75% to 75.5%, reflecting higher ASPs, partially offset by higher expenses as we regionalize our treatment planning operations. We expect Q4 operating expenses to be in the range of $198 million to $202 million, up on a sequential basis to reflect our continued investments in go-to-market activities. Q4 operating margin should be in the range of 24.3% to 24.8%. Our effective tax rate, including an excess tax benefit of about $1 million, should be approximately 22%. We expect a $1.5 million loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.9 million, inclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q4 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.95. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q4 to be approximately $55 million to $60 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $10.5 million to $11 million.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. We're pleased with the performance the business and feel good about the overall momentum and strength of aligner.  With that we will open up the call for any questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Jones : A very big step up in ASP, John you touched on some of the factors that affect mixing and pricing increase but it does look like that you're calling for this is to be sustainable through the end of the year. So, I was may be hoping if you could just talk about the drivers and I guess may be specifically, mix and the pricing increases where I will be most interested in what's driving that why you think that looks like it will hold at least through the end of this year. Joseph Hogan : Good question, you're right we did see some mix benefits with some volume that came through Asia, so that helps up from overall stand point we saw some FX favorability that came in this quarter. As you noted we have price increases that is in our numbers as well, partially offset by some discounting, so netted altogether we feel that for fourth quarter, flat to slightly down in Q3. Robert Jones : Okay I got it and then I guess just on the patient financing interesting new wrinkle, Joe was hoping maybe you could talk about the opportunity there. Any data or survey work you guys have done that might help us get ahead around how many people actually may be go to doc locator or go to see a doctor about perusing Invisalign but ultimately don\u2019t elect to do the treatment because of cost. Might help us frame, how this might help the opportunity there. Joseph Hogan : About two questions, we don\u2019t have any real statistics to tell you, how many people going doc locator and but we could tell you, from our consumer capture efforts and we talked about this concierge service, this is one of the big items that consumers have to deal with, often orthodontists also ask for a large down payment upfront too that even if a customer can avoid credit, it's still a pretty hit from a cash standpoint upfront. We think this will be a good factor for us and helping to bring more consumers into Invisalign but we don\u2019t have any statistics right now to tell you exactly what that might be, I would say just stay with us and as we go through this we will able to give you more and more specific on it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : Two from me on the same basic concept and it's about the trajectory of investment in the business. I have to imaging you feel happy on the marketing expense trajectory and on the efforts in Asia that these have paid off, as well as they have, and you give you couple of interesting statistics on, I think it was growth and marketing spend and something like a tripling of the customer base and I believe that was a broader Asia.  Could you talk about one, how you think about the growth of marketing spend and the commercial team from here and then two, a similar question, more specific to Asia, how you think about the remaining runway for customer acquisition, considering how much success you have a much you probably learned about how things are working there. Joseph Hogan : Steve, so on the marketing spend, I would just way we just continue to do what we can in a sense of driving volume. There is no formulating methodology we have here, we mean obviously we focused on teens in a big way. In North America to get a look that we had. That spend also has been I think really refined in the sense of how much of social media, how much goes to some other segment how much go to the team that have done, so I feel there is the lot of accuracy and sophistication in a sense of how we go about it.  But we do know that we had a pretty big signal in the sense of being able to spend more of in that channel and see an increase in orders and we will keep spending where we can. I think a broader question in that and I believe then your second one is how we do this oversees too. North America a lot of our marketing dollars, our teams were focused in the third quarter in the second quarter also. But we look at translating what we are learning here in the United States oversees and we've had a pretty good response from a teen standpoint in China also and now we have some restrictions in the sense of how you can advertise in certain geographies and we have to be compliant in that sense but we will be smart in the sense of how we use as advertising dollars.  From an Asia runway standpoint, I mean we talk about going wide in the business you saw we train another 1,000 docs overall in China for the quarter. There is a direct correlation in the sense of being able to train those docs and we see the increase in orders going forward. Remember our penetration rates in places like in China are still relatively thin when you think about the available population. Also, India, we are really just getting started in Korea and Taiwan. In Australia we saw terrific growth there too and that's a market that we've have had fairly good penetration rates and over the years and so there is different formulas we have to use for different geographies in the sense of adding sales people, adding docs, like in Australia it's a different deal in the sense of it is more like North America where it's advertising a specificity where you spend from a sales standpoint that helps in that way. But I know I'm not helping you a lot Steven in the sense of being able to model that, but tell you that we obviously watch as closely, we want to invest in the sense of where we get the biggest return and we do watch that part also. Unidentified Analyst : If I could just sneak one housekeeping item. I wonder if you have any updates on timelines in the U.S. for mandibular advancement and for iGo? Joseph Hogan : On mandibular advancement we expect to hear back from the FDA in December sometime and that's all we know. It's like that when you do that, you submit your data and then basically the FDA kind of goes behind closed doors and kind of works through it but we feel we have submitted good data and we will just wait and see what happens in December. And now from an iGo standpoint remember we keep better rating on iGo and in different parts and different geographies in the sense of the product itself and how that interacts with the doc and the patient and we've had -- we continue to do well with that product line but you'll see more data on that on iGo and as iGo success as we get into -- as we report the fourth quarter next year we have more specificity on that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John Kreger : Joe, obviously the years split are very, very well in terms of volumes. Can you just talk about how the infrastructure is holding up? Are you starting to see any bottlenecks or choke points that could be challenges if the demand continues to be this strong? Joseph Hogan : Obviously when you start to grow at this rate above what we've predicted, we've been able to stay ahead from the manufacturing standpoint we always go to certain amount of buffer capacity so we cover things like this. Initially we had a little bit of trouble in the sense of clean check and our people did actually do the clean check pieces but we experienced that back actually in January or so we adjusted to give us extra capacity for the year or so.  Right now, we're in good shape, it's a good thing about this business in the sense we can adjust capacity pretty quickly within a certain number of weeks and months when we have this kind of things, but we're trying to anticipate and lay resources ahead of these things, so we don\u2019t get into a situation where we can't handle demand. John Kreger : Great thank you and then, may be any early thought on 2018 and sort of key puts and takes, for example should we think about the storms here in North America as may be causing you to start more slowly or may be giving you a little bit of pent up demand as you move into next year. Joseph Hogan : I wouldn\u2019t call the storms material at all, I probably wouldn\u2019t even consider that in your accusation. And right now, we kind of talk about this, we anticipate there will 2018 questions but we have good momentum now you can see us going into fourth quarter. And I think John has given you some really strong indications of where the fourth quarter is going to be and so we try to be as specific as we could to help in that sense but we are really not ready to get into conjecture on 2018 at this point. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block : May just a first one, the international case volume there was tremendous, notably APAC. You mentioned the train docs and that was certainly big, but is some of that drill also due to the local treatment planning facility that just opened up or is arguably that even too soon to be yielding benefits and that so might be on the come in subsequent quarters. Joseph Hogan : I would say right now that I won't call any extra volume right now John associated with those, in fact we discussed that from -- we were in Germany, just last week to take a look at our [indiscernible] facility we opened up in Cologne there and honestly, it's just starting to ramp up, the initial indications, like just like in China these are really good, they interface well with customers, the teams there are very excited in sense of what they can do. Just getting closer to those customers and being in that geography from a cultural and timeframe standpoint is really critical, so that really hasn\u2019t impacted volume yet, but we will give a report as we get into next year and this becomes a little more mature. I mean we obviously put that in there because we think, mid -term longer term, this is going to a volume driver for us. Jonathan Block : Got it, actually you just answered the question with the very last statement. That\u2019s perfect. And then just to shift gears, patient financing pilot, I want to make sure I got my arms on this correctly, so the doc gets the treatment fees, less Align's lab fee. So are you guys the one taking on the financing risk and if so, should we think about it as a potential long-term tailwind to sort of your realized ASP offset by what could be sort of the theoretical bad debt expense on the consumer, may be if you can just talk through that. Thanks guys. John Morici : No, it\u2019s a third party that would take on any of the financing sort of bad debt, or anything out that comes with this would be third party, it would not be associated with us at all. Jonathan Block : Okay so zero impact to your ASP. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon team, this is Kevin on for Matt today, thanks for taking the time. I wanted to take a moment on iTero which seems to be the focus for this year and beyond and with record shipments, I'm just curious, how you're looking at the trends for case submissions and the broader strategy on the ground for iTero, seems like a bigger piece than we previously anticipated. I know you mentioned -- and the second part of the question, as I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks about the lower patient traffic in summer holidays. Just wanted to reconcile the sales effort on the scanners and the GP offices and kind how does that relate to the lower volume in the quarter. It seems a bit of a mismatch. Joseph Hogan : You remember last year Tim we were shipping a lot from backlog on the volume piece. What you are seeing this year is a pure demand signal there is nothing really coming out of backlog. So, I think if you are talking about that discrepancy that's the one I'd other point out.  On your broader question on the volume of the business I think it's important for you to understand that when we talk about sales last year of iTero, its broadly an North American business. What we're seeing now we're seeing an increase uptick in Europe, we just approved in Japan, we had significant semantic shipments in Japan in the third quarter also and we'll move into Asia broadly into more next year. I say the business is just getting broader internationally and that adds to the volume also. But in the United States I hear in your comments that I think you understand that we've have a really good amount of orthodontic penetration with iTero, and more and more of our sales are moving into GPs and so that's one of the reasons we put together the Patterson dental distribution agreement because of their strong position with GPs and help us through so we have some work to do on restore the workflow in areas like that to be more viable in that channel but we've got a really good pickup and we are enthusiastic about the future in North American channel for GPs too. Unidentified Analyst : I mean the second question kind of comes from China. I think a few folks touched on this to just wanted to discuss just the utilization trends in that market and the strategy that's kind of done differently there that you would highlight versus the rest of the international markets. Is there anything on the grounds that I am missing driving this or is it just continued adoption training and utilization as you would expect? Joseph Hogan : Continual adoption, training and utilization just as you described it Kevin. I wish I could make it sound harder and more sophisticated but it's about getting resources in place and moving it through. Now you know we just put up a treatment planning facility in China and that's really, they are ramping up well we are getting good customers feedback and so you know we will continue to do more and more resources to enhance that position in China in the future. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Erin Wright : Just as a follow-up on sort of the Scanners. I guess what sort of traction are you seeing for kind of standalone I guess versus sort of the closed architecture systems just given sort of the distribution shift that we've been seeing kind of in the U.S. and is there stocking dynamics that we should be considering here in near term? Thanks. John Morici : I missed that question, can you rephrase the question? Erin Wright : iTero. John Morici : Yes, I know that\u2019s iTero, but it was underneath that. Unidentified Company Representative : What do you mean by closed systems? Erin Wright : Like closed architecture systems involving like [Indiscernible]. Joseph Hogan : You mean like a Scarano system. [indiscernible] But Scarano they are capable of doing a scan and sending it into us and you can bypass them and an impress them with a Scarano Scanner. You can't necessarily get stimulation and lot of visualization and things that we offer on the iTero side. Does that answer -- and then you talk about did you, you talk about capacity on iTero or\u2026 Erin Wright : Yes, or any sort of stocking with just your relationships there that we should be\u2026. John Morici : I understand what you mean. No nothing like the Patterson, Scarano thing, don\u2019t worry about any kind of stocking things affecting our numbers in a material way. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then can you give us an update on this SmileDirectClub and how's that sort of resonating with customers and how you weigh sort of that direct to consumer relationship with all those practitioners as well. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : I mean, our relationship with SmileDirectClub is good, we value, I think we\u2019re very synergistic in the sense of how we work with one another, remember those are SmileDirect customers, we don\u2019t see them, we don\u2019t really experience them we just do what SmileDirectClub asks us to do it.  Obviously, part of your question is a lot of consternation in the orthodontic channel, about doctor directed and kind of systems that will be more of a digital dentistry, remote kinds of things where it's not involved in the doctor's office. Again, that\u2019s not us, we\u2019re not part of that, SmileDirectClub really controls that and holds it, so.  I mean there is market for this, SmileDirectClub continues to do a great job in market and grow pretty substantially but it would be stupid to ignore that there is certain amount of consternation in the market place and a pushback but, I think SGC continues to do a great job out there. Operator : Next question is from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Richard Newitter : I just wanted to start, your growth trajectory, it continues to accelerate, you're at a level, there is some pretty enormous year-over-year numbers here and I was just wondering if you could reflect a little bit upon, the age old question we always ask you balancing, driving future growth through the investment and dropping to the bottom line and as we kind think about, some of these marketing initiatives that are clearly being paying off, it sounds like you guys are probably at a point where it team's inflecting and you might want to dial over some of these initiatives and is that the way to think about it, you could be at a tipping point here, inflection point in adoption and you guys are going to put the gap total expense or how should we think about your growth for all the investment. Joseph Hogan : I'll just turn your attention to how underpenetrated we're in this market place, I mean its incredible right. globally we can do 60% to 70% of the orthodontic cases out there today, we have 8%. And so, a lot of the investment and things that we make, whether it's recruiting new doctors in China or its targeting moms and teens here in Untied States, it's about really driving the penetration that there is an entitlement in this business we should have based on what patients want and based on what our technology can deliver.  I know there is always questions on leverage out there, our operating profits are over 25%, obviously was held by SGC this quarter, and its significant but we shown good leverages this quarter despite exchange and despite what I call unusual from an SGC standpoint. So, I would say we're getting some leverage in this business, but I don\u2019t expect kind of the material change in this sense of the input, output ratio of this business. We have to continue and invest aggressively in forward sales forces and marketing, especially in technology to stay ahead and to penetrate more to market place. We\u2019ve always said that our goal is 25% to 30% operating profit in this business. We could do that tomorrow if we wanted to, you wouldn't like the growth numbers. Now we're getting close to that lower end and we keep working that piece and we feel good about the tradeoffs that we are actually administrating right now between volume and margin. Does that make sense Richard? Richard Newitter : It makes a lot of sense and I think a number of investors would agree to it, that are striking the right balance and the trade of there. My second question is just on teens, can you break out a little bit the, continued acceleration that we're seeing in that category, I get a lot of it was held outside the U.S. but in North America what kind of attraction you're getting with the GP channel in teen obviously your orthodontic channels are a little more dominant there but are you starting to see some inflection on the GP side with that segment? Joseph Hogan : With the GP segment in general I would say no, honestly, I would say I go helping us understand that more and I can tell you the GP segment in the U.S. is certainly different in the segment in Germany than it is in Japan, than it is in China and so each one of these countries kind of has a different solution that we have to work through whether its workflow or what preferences re whatever so. I will not say we are in an inflection point in all the GPs I would say we have a lot of growth. Teen growth for GPs not where they are focus, and so a lot of GPs only touch a teen, they are worried about working teen so that's not a -- and when we talk about teens we are really talking about all ortho channel utilization in the end. Operator : Yes, and that question is coming from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Jeff Johnson : I'll try to be quick here as the last question so Joe I guess first question just why did we see the increase in SDC volumes in the third quarter? Was there a driver of that was there a reason behind that and why does it revert in the fourth quarter? Do we just kind of live with the little bit of volatility here going forward? Joseph Hogan : I'll answer your last question first, you live with the volatility going forward Jeff okay. We don\u2019t control SmileDirectClub's decision making process. I'm not quite sure exactly why we receive that much more of SDCs volume but I don\u2019t count on that going forward and that's basically John's comments where in his opening remark. So, I wish I could more specific about it Jeff but I can't and it's just\u2026 Jeff Johnson : Should we at all bring that as a demand spike in the third quarter like all of the sudden volume came in stronger than they expected in the third quarter or do you think it was just them putting out some volume on you? Joseph Hogan : Well, they continue to grow but I say it's a combination of both but it's not driven discreetly by volume I would say. Jeff Johnson : Yes, okay and my last question just on the fusion, the iTero fusion program you know you are locking GPs and it's some higher implied volumes there with that program just what's been the response to that program? Has that program taken off or is it taking off and how should we think about the implications for the GP numbers from that program going forward? Joseph Hogan : I think again I have to move outside of North America in general, the biggest uptick in segments for fusion has been outside of North America, and it's been really received extremely well. In North America right now, we're really just getting cracked up on the fusion piece and we'll have more for you in the fourth quarter results, Jeff. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone. This concludes our conference call for today and look forward to seeing you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings. If you have any other questions, please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the quarter and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and oral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the first quarter and how we see 2018 unfolding. Following that, I\u2019ll come back and summarize a few key points and then open up the call to questions. Overall, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to another outstanding year for Align with better than expected revenues, volumes and operating income. Record Q4 revenues were up 43.7% year-over-year, driven by increased Invisalign volumes across all geographies and customer channels as well as by record iTero scanner revenue. Q4 Invisalign volume was up 34.2% year-over-year, reflecting strong international growth from increased utilization and expansion of our customer base, which included over 4000 new customers for the third consecutive quarter. Notwithstanding the strong performance, our Q4 results were impacted by the new US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which reduced our reported net income and EPS. However, Q4 operating income was a record $109.6 million or 26%. John will discuss this in more detail in his section in a few minutes. For the full year, revenue of 1.5 billion increased 36.4% year-over-year, driven by both record Invisalign revenue, which surpassed the 1 billion mark for the first time ever and record iTero scanner revenues. These results reflect continued progress in execution of our force strategic growth drivers, which focus on driving international expansion, increasing orthodontist\u2019s utilization of Invisalign, especially with teenagers, enabling GP dentists to treat and refer more Invisalign cases and generating consumer demand from millions of people worldwide and connecting them with Invisalign Doctor. Turning to the specifics around our fourth quarter results, let's start with the results of our North American region. For North America, Q4 was a good quarter with Invisalign case volume up 5.1% sequentially and 24.2% year-over-year. Sequential growth primarily reflects the seasonality, a seasonally stronger period for GP dentists as patients\u2019 activities in their offices increased after summer holidays. Ortho customers treated more adult patients following the busy teen season. In addition, Q4 Invisalign utilization increased to 3.3 cases per GP dentist and North American Orthos received a record 14 cases per doctor, reflecting continued confidence and uptake of Invisalign system. On a year-over-year basis, strong growth was driven primarily by increased Ortho utilization and continued expansion of our GP customer base. For the full year, both North America Orthos and GP Dentists achieved record annualized utilization of 47 and 8 cases per doctor respectively. For international doctors, Q4 was another strong quarter with Invisalign case volume up 12.7% sequentially and 52.3% year-over-year. Sequential growth reflects a seasonally stronger quarter for EMEA region following summer holidays for doctors and patients, which offset expected decreases from seasonality in APAC, particularly as the Greater China market observed local holidays. On a year-over-year basis, strong Invisalign volume was driven by growth from both EMEA and the Asia Pacific region.  Year-over-year growth for EMEA was up 42.9%, led by Spain, France and the UK. We also saw strong growth across all of our smaller expansion markets, which include Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. And APAC Q4 volumes were up 63% year-over-year, led by China, Japan and Australia with record Invisalign volume in most APAC countries. For the full year, Invisalign volume increased 44.9%, led by growth from China and our core EMEA country markets. In total, international volume represented 38% of worldwide Invisalign case shipments. Now, turning to the teen market, which makes up 75% of total orthodontic case starts each year. In Q4, 63.5 thousand teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 44.1% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions and increasingly for younger teens and tweens. For Q4, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North American Orthos increased 37.8% and international was up 64.7%. Notwithstanding some seasonality during the quarter, given fewer teen case starts, Q4 was a fifth consecutive quarter that Invisalign teenage patient volume grew faster than adults.  On a sequential basis, North American ortho teen cases were down as expected as our ortho customers shifted their focus toward adult patient case starts in Q4 following a very busy summer teen season. For the full year, a total of 237,000 teenagers or 26% of our total volume started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, up 40.4% from 2016.  During the year, we continued to drive adoption of teenage patients through sales and marketing programs, including a major new direct-to-consumer campaign, empathizing teens and moms. In addition, at the beginning of 2017, we launched the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction that combines all the benefits of the most advanced clear aligner system in the world with features for moving the lower jaw forward, while simultaneously aligning the teeth.  Invisalign teen with mandibular advancement or MATH [ph] as we call it, offers a simpler, more efficient and patient friendly option than functional appliances. MATH was launched in certain country markets in Canada, EMEA and APAC and is ramping up nicely across the board, especially in China. To date, we've shipped over 5000 MATH cases outside the United States, half of which were in Q4 alone and we're very excited about the potential for MATH worldwide. However, we do not expect any material contribution in the US from MATH until the back half of 2018, as we continue to work through the 510k regulatory approval process with the FDA, which includes collecting additional data and analysis. Invisalign brand is one of the most recognized in the dental and orthodontic market. Our integrated consumer marketing programs leverage traditional paying media, search, digital marketing, PR and social media to engage consumers at every point in the consumer purchase journey. These programs continue to drive demand for Invisalign treatment and are key to adoption in both the teen and adult segments. In 2017, we launched a new Made to Move brand platform for Invisalign, which has been really impactful around the world.  In North America, we expanded our traditional digital media campaigns, targeting both men and women for the first time and made a significant investment in our marketing to teens and moms. We stepped up our approach to teens by partnering with content developers, teen and mom social media influencers and team brands like AwesomenessTV, which we saw pay off and increases in our consumer website activity and opt-in metrics.  We also saw a positive impact from the global Made to Move campaign across EMEA and APAC and may have focused heavily on digital, social and web traffic, which resulted in huge increase in their online smile assessments and other KPIs. APAC markets like Singapore and Australia also saw an increase in KPIs based on their focus on social media and local event and influencer driven marketing.  As a result, in total for the year, there were over 15 million unique visitors to the Invisalign websites worldwide, 1.8 million potential patients search for Invisalign provider on Doc locator, up 41% from 2016. 600,000 consumers completed Invisalign smile assessments on our website, of which 445,000 opted in for follow-up in the Invisalign social media community grew over 42% to 745,000 consumers following the Invisalign brand worldwide. You may recall that in January last year, we launched a new smile concierge program in Raleigh, North Carolina with the objective to help more consumers start Invisalign treatment and improve their overall experience by shortening their research cycles and utilizing consumer insights to help our doctors better engage with consumers. Throughout the year, we made great progress from ongoing program improvements in December. We achieved a major milestone with the 6500 Invisalign patients for the smile concierge team.  Cumulatively, we schedule over 26,000 Invisalign consultations which equates to connecting hundreds of consumers to Invisalign practices every day. We continue to see incredible potential as our doctors\u2019 offices are implementing changes to better engage with consumers that we send to them every day. We've also started to expand the small concierge service outside the United States with our first teams up and running in Singapore, Brazil and Australia, with each of these countries having a great start to the year helping more consumers become Invisalign patients.  Over the course of the year, we\u2019ll update you on our continued progress in leveraging important learnings about consumer behavior and establishing smile concierges team in EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. In 2018, our smile concierge team will be very closely linked to the new Invisalign store pilot that we opened in November, which will utilize our consumer insights to better capture leads coming out of the store experience. The smile concierge team will be utilizing our touch point learnings to reach out to consumers who received a scan but don't schedule an appointment with a doctor.  In addition, we\u2019ll use our automated text and email services to remind consumers when and where to pick up their aligners or to see a doctor as scheduled. These are just a few of the exciting new ways that we're helping to educate consumers on the benefits of getting a better smile with Invisalign treatment and connect them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice. The Invisalign store pilot program that launched in November is an extension of our long standing direct-to-consumer marketing programs that connect potential patients directly to doctors for Invisalign treatment.  We're looking at other successful brands and how they use a physical location to engage consumers and extend the brand experience. In this case, we are trying to extend and strengthen what we do through digital ad, social media, PR and TV advertising and our customers own in practice patient marketing. Our pilot store model relies on the doctor and the doctor's office for treatment. We are not treating patients in the store. Instead, we are educating consumers on how Invisalign works, showing them a scan driven simulation of how they might look with straighter teeth and offering to connect interested consumers with a doctor of their choice, so that they subsequently decide to pursue treatment.  To date, we've learned a lot about creating the right consumer experience with Invisalign system through a store front and are continuing to evolve and make continued progress. In Q1, we will open another pilot store in San Jose, California, near our corporate headquarters. We're planning to open two additional pilot stores on the East Coast sometime in the first half of this year. We look forward to continuing to learn more from these four locations and sharing our progress throughout the year. Q4 was a strong quarter for iTero and better than expected with revenues up 30.8% sequentially and 37% year-over-year on record iTero scanner shipments. Q4 results reflect continued strength in our GP channel following our GP summit in September as well as sales to our major DSO partners and through our iTero distributor, Patterson Dental. The iTero scanner business was also strong in EMEA and has been growing rapidly in Asia Pacific, especially Japan where we see certification for iTero in Q3.  Customers are quickly realizing a significant benefit of our iTero scanner platform and we are excited about the opportunity to continue to expand iTero\u2019s footprint worldwide. The iTero scanner is central to our digital approach and overall customer utilization of Invisalign treatment. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case as shipments in place of PBS impressions continues to expand and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization.  For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in North America increased to a record 64.1%, up from 51.3% in Q4 last year. International scans increased to 40.8%, up from 24.9 in Q4 of last year. not only does the iTero scanner provide the best work flow for Invisalign treatment with Invisalign outcomes simulator and progress assessment tool, but it's also seamlessly integrates with downstream restorative workflows, significantly improving their accuracy and precision. iTero is also the only scanner with time lapse technology that makes chair-side consults more productive.  By scanning patients at every visit using time lapse and comparing historical scans to a current scan, patients see for themselves the changes in their tooth wear, tooth movement and changes in [indiscernible], encouraging them to accept treatment on the chair-side. In Q4, we cited a distribution agreement with Glidewell Dental for our iTero Element scanner in North America with glidewell.io the in-office solution, a chair-side restorative ecosystem designed to simplify the process of prescribing and delivering laboratory quality dental restorations. In 2017, iTero scanners volumes were up 37.5% year-over-year. To date, over 6.3 million orthodontic scans and 2.4 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners. Finally, in the doctor-directed at home channel, Align is a third-party supplier to SmileDirectClub and has 19% equity investment in the company. We manufacture a portion of SDC aligners with non-Invisalign clear aligners. For Q4, shipments to SDC were down sequentially as expected as SDC increased their own internal capacity. As an investor and supplier to SDC, Align is focused on two things, expanding the market for orthodontic treatment and providing greater access to simple teeth straightening solutions to millions of more people who prioritize convenience and affordability and creating new opportunities for Invisalign doctors by connecting consumers who aren't candidates for SDC\u2019s limited protocols to an Invisalign practice. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total company revenue for the fourth quarter was a record $421.3 million, up 9.4% from the prior quarter and up 43.7% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Clear aligner revenue of $364.2 million was up 6.6% sequentially on higher than expected volume. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 44.8% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies and increased Invisalign prices. Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially approximately $5 from Q3 to $1305, reflecting higher deferrals related to additional aligners and higher promotional discounts, partially offset by international price increases.  On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Invisalign ASPs were up approximately $75, reflecting price increases, favorable foreign exchange, product mix as well as the impact of discontinuing distribution and going directly in several regions, partially offset by increased promotional discounts and higher deferrals related to additional aligners. For the fourth quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 255,000 cases were up 8% sequentially, driven by our EMEA and North America customers.  Year-over-year Invisalign case volume growth was up 34.2%, driven by growth across all regions. For North American orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 2.3% sequentially and up 30.7% year-over-year. For North American GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 9.2% sequentially and up 16.1% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 12.7% sequentially and up 52.3% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the fourth quarter was $57.1 million, up 30.8% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year, primarily due to continued global investment and go to market activities and sales promotions as well as shipments to key DSO partners and our US distributor, Patterson Dental. Moving on to gross margin, fourth quarter overall gross margin was 75.5%, down 0.4 points sequentially and up 0.4 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 77.6%, down 0.3 points sequentially, primarily due to higher manufacturing spend, driven by operational expansion activities. Clear aligner gross margin was up 0.1 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased ASPs and partially offset by higher manufacturing spend. Scanner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 62%, up 2 points sequentially and up one point year-over-year, primarily due to higher manufacturing efficiencies. Q4 operating expenses were $208.3 million, up sequentially 7.5% and up 37.2% year-over-year, primarily due to increased employee headcount and continued investment in our go to market activity is critical to the growth of our [indiscernible]. Our fourth quarter operating income was a record $109.6 million, up 11% sequentially and up 60.3% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 26%, up 0.4 points sequentially and up 2.7 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin relates primarily to leverage operating spend in sales and marketing of higher volumes, partially offset by lower gross margin due to operational expansion activities. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating margin primarily reflects higher revenues from both clear aligner and scanner and services which created operating expense leverage.  With regards to our fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 92.4% and is up by 72.6 points compared to 19.8% in the same quarter last year, which includes $86.6 million in tax expense as a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. This is comprised of $76.6 million of mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign on accumulated foreign earnings not previously taxed by the US that we expect to pay over the next eight years and $10 million non-cash write down of our deferred tax assets due to the statutory tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%.  Going forward, we may repatriate cash back to the US to invest in market expansion opportunities, provide additional working capital and have greater flexibility to fund our stock repurchase program. In accordance with the SEC staff accounting bulletin number 118, we have recorded provisional amounts in the Q4 financial statements for certain income tax effects of the act based on reasonable estimates and information available as the close of the period. We may adjust and refine the provisional amounts over the next year when additional information, analysis and legislative guidance becomes available. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.13, down 87.1% sequentially and down 78% compared to the prior year. Our diluted earnings per share includes 86.6 million or $1.06 per diluted share impact due to the new US Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Moving on to the balance sheet, as of the fourth quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long term investments, were $761.5 million. This compared to $700 million at the end of 2016, an increase of approximately $61.5 million, primarily related to earnings growth. Of our $761.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $271.4 million was held by the US and $490.1 million was held by our international entities. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $322.8 million, up approximately 0.5% sequentially.  Our overall days sales outstanding, DSO was 69 days, down six days sequentially and down seven days from 76 days in Q4 last year. DSOs have decreased as a result of improved collection activities across all regions. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $162.3 million, up $81.3 million compared to prior year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $92.8 million.  Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $69.5 million, primarily relating to building purchases and improvements, equipment purchases for additional manufacturing capacity as well as our global expansion efforts, included a new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China which will open in the second half of 2018. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares of stock for $50 million under the April 2016 repurchase program. We have $200 million remaining available for repurchases under the existing stock repurchase authorization. Before we move to the Q1 outlook, I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2017 results. In 2017, we shipped a 931,000 Invisalign cases, up 31.4%. This reflects 44.9% volume growth from our international doctors and 24.3% volume growth from our North American doctors. Shipments of our iTero scanner were up 37.5% over 2016. Total revenue was a record $1.5 billion, up 36.4% year-over-year with Invisalign revenues breaking above $1 billion for the first time. Full year operating income of $353.6 million, up 42.1% versus 2016 and operating margin at 24%, up 0.9 points versus prior year. Free cash flow was $242.8 million. For the year, we repurchased 0.6 million shares of Align\u2019s stock for $103.8 million. 2017 diluted earnings per share was $2.83, which includes 86.6 million or $1.06 per diluted share impact due to the new US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, comprised of a $10 million write down of our deferred tax assets and a mandatory deem repatriation tax of $76.6 million. With that, let's turn to our Q1 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. We expect our international business to continue to grow sequentially. For North America, we expect Q1 to be seasonally up for both GP dentists and Orthos. For our scanner business, we expect a sequential decrease following a strong year end. In addition, capital equipment purchases are seasonally slower in Q1. As Joe commented earlier, this quarter we supplied fewer aligners to SDC in Q4 2017 compared to prior quarters. We are anticipating this trend to continue as SDC continues to ramp up their own manufacturing capacity. With this as a backdrop, we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 264,000 to 269,000 cases, up approximately 27% to 29% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q1 net revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $410 million, an increase of approximately 29% to 32% year-over-year.  We expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 74.3% to 75%, reflecting higher expenses as we regionalize our treatment planning operations, partially offset by higher ASPs. We expect Q1 operating expenses to be in the range of $223.5 million to $227.5 million, up on a sequential basis to reflect our continued investment in go to market activities. Q1 operating margin should be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5%. Our effective tax rate including an excess tax benefit of about $22 million should be approximately 2%.  We expect a $1 million to $2 million loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 82 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q1 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.98. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect capital expenditures for Q1 to be approximately $65 million to $70 million and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $10.5 million to $11 million. Now, let me turn to our full year view. We anticipate 2018 revenue to be at the high end of our long term operating model range of 15% to 25%. We also expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to be close to the high end of that model. While we expect the scanner business to do well and continue to grow, we would not expect the same rate of growth of volume and revenue as we saw in 2017. We expect operating margins to be approximately flat to 2017 result as we plan to continue to fund our investments to fuel growth. We expect the equity loss for our investment in SmileDirectClub to be $1 million to $2 million per quarter.  We expect our tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 18%, which includes approximately $24 million of excess tax benefits. As we\u2019ve seen historically, we expect our earnings power in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half with second half operating income to account for somewhere in the range of 56% to 58% of our full year results. We expect capital expenditures for 2018 eighteen to be in the range of $200 million to $230 million, primarily due to operational expansion and ongoing growth of the business.  Finally, regarding the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606, we plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018 by applying the full retrospective method. We have assessed the financial statement impact of adoption, including but not limited to volume based discount programs, sales commissions and the identification of performance obligations and are continuing to evaluate the transition and disclosure requirements of the standard. We anticipate that adoption of the standard will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, John and thanks again for joining us. 2017 was a great year for Align and I'm very pleased with our strong performance across all key regions, customer channels and product lines. This year, not only do we celebrate our 20th year in business, we also achieved several major milestones. We reach our millionth Invisalign team and our 5 millionth Invisalign patient. Invisalign volume in EMEA exceeded 200,000 cases for the first time. We opened our first treatment planning operations in China and Germany.  China became our second largest country market, next to the US. Invisalign revenues exceeded 1 billion for the first time ever. As I reflect on these achievements, I want to take a minute to thank more than the 130,000 Invisalign providers around the world who helped us expand the market for orthodontics using the Invisalign system. They\u2019re increasing confidence in using Invisalign clear aligners to treat moderate to complex cases as reflected in our record utilization across all customer channels and we're grateful for their partnership. We're continuing innovating to deliver new technology and solutions that provide Invisalign doctors with the right tools, support and services to keep their practices flourishing. Even with growth rate significantly above the industry, our market opportunity is enormous and getting larger every day. With less than 10% share of the world orthodontic case starts each year, we have a long way to go to make clear aligners a standard of care, but our goal is to do just that. There are more than 300 million people around the world who would or could benefit from straighter teeth. Reaching out to those consumers, helping them understand treatment options and getting them started in treatment will require new approaches and new models. We're committed to doing that in partnership with our customers.  For 2018, we'll continue to focus on and execute our four key strategic priorities and I feel really good about our plans. We're continuing to expand our business in EMEA, APAC and will accelerate our investment in LATAM and Canada, bringing more resources closer to our customers and launching direct-to-consumer advertising in some markets like Canada for the first time. The teenage market remains our number one priority across the ortho channel. For the first time, we will focus on teens and their moms and our consumer marketing programs in the EMEA region, making it easier for GP dentists to treat more cases also enables them to refer more complex ones to specialists. So we are creating dedicated GP resources across our sales and marketing organizations to ensure that we have a better understanding of how to drive Invisalign adoption among GP dentists and support their unique customer needs, including restorative and aesthetic dentistry. And finally, the Invisalign brand and our consumer marketing programs are key differentiators for the company. So we'll continue to invest and to build capabilities that enable us to talk directly to consumers, improve the overall experience with our brand, connect more people than ever with Invisalign practices and ensure that they get started in treatment with Invisalign clear aligners every time. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator and we\u2019ll open the call up for your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this evening. Joe, I just wanted to start with the revenue outlook for growth to be at the high end of the long term range. Obviously, that still implies a healthy level of growth, but down a little bit from what you guys saw in 2017. You\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the call obviously talking about the initiatives that you've put in place and the opportunity that the company still has. So I was just wondering if you can maybe help us understand what the key drivers of the outlook are for this year and what if anything has changed from your point of view. Joe Hogan : Well, I think nothing's really changed in that sense. There's some amplitude that we're talking about in the sense of what we're calling right now. But overall, we feel good momentum in the business and what we're trying to convey with you is we stay within the volume ranges that we've talked about before. But, we're just going to look quarter-to-quarter, we continue to look at the same drivers, I mean, continue to look at APAC being strong, Europe will be strong and North America, particularly around teens and our focus there and iTero scanners continue to go off well. So overall, I really feel good about our forecast and will be more and more clear obviously as we come back to you after the first quarter. Nathan Rich : And just a follow up on the outlook, does it contemplate any change in the competitive landscape in 2018 and if you were to see a new competitor come to market, how would that impact your view of the year? Joe Hogan : I think Nathan, we've been very I think clear over the last year or so that we do expect competition in 2018. In these forecasts, we are reflecting any kind of competition we might see, but there's been nothing out there recently that's changed any position that we've had from a competitor standpoint. So these forecasts do reflect how we see the marketplace and that includes potential competition as we get into longer parts of this year. Operator : Our next question is with Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Erin Wright : Can you speak to your retail store contact and how you envision that progressing, has there been any sort of surprises thus far with the initiative and how will the smile concierge team be involved, like do you plan to leverage your smile concierge build out in other countries as well to then leverage the retail store concept there or is it too early on that process? Joe Hogan : Well, we are translating Erin the small concierge program overseas. We will look at it, we will move it into APAC this year and also move it into EMEA. What\u2019s nice about it is it\u2019s scalable right now. We can take what we've learned in North America and there's a lot of IT involved and a lot of processes in a sense of how you turn a consumer into patients that we\u2019re able to I think plug and play much better now, we have that experience. That's really what that understanding is what led to the Invisalign store, the pilot that we currently have in San Francisco is that just wanted to move this even closer to patients.  And remember again, we're not doing any kind of diagnosis or anything like that. We do scans in these shops and we show potential patients or consumers, what their smiles could look like in two different sets of -- two approaches what we call signature and deluxe. I would say what we're doing, we continue to -- it is a pilot and we work through the workflow between us and the doctor and us and the patient and we refined that pretty well over the last 60 days and we're making progress.  That should give us the confidence to announce that we're going to move a store in to San Jose and also two on the East Coast this year, but we'll be very clear with you about what we learned, but again, this is all about how you turn a consumer into a patient and this is as much -- this is a doctor model. We're working with our doctors to make this happen. And so how you touch these consumers, how the frictionless way that you move a consumer into a doctor, how fast that information can be received, all that is really important in this customer journey and we're learning more and more about that and how to do it better. So we're optimistic about it and we do this -- have it on our future plans. And obviously, just like the concierge services, we have success here and we have a model we think scalable. We\u2019ll look at where that might fit in different countries around the world. Erin Wright : And can you give us an update on mandibular advancements here, what sort of data has been requested from the FDA and what sort of visibility do you have on timing of the launch. I guess what are the next data points and also how traction for that product I guess hoping to build adoption across the teen market outside of the US. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Erin, this is really, it\u2019s actually simple. Sounds like a drug or anything like that. They just need more data at the FDA and they just want to have more comfort with the safety and the efficacy of the product line, so we're supplying that data. We expect hopefully we\u2019ll be through that by the second half of this year and then we'll move on. I mean, I talked about the 5,000 cases that we did last year with 2500 of those being in the fourth quarter alone. Honestly, the feedback that we get from our patients overseas is tremendous. I mean when we look at the device that we've replaced through this, it's amazing like a twin block device. Let\u2019s normally use that there.  When you can actually move this jaw forward as comfortably as we do with math, but also straighten teen\u2019s teeth at the same time. It's really an amazing invention. So I think that's part of the way the FDA wants more and more information because they really haven't seen a device like this before, but we feel very confident we'll be able to supply their informational needs and as we move in to the second half of this year, we'll give you more clarity on exactly where that stands. Operator : Our next question is with Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Jamie on for Rich Newitter. A quick question that I have I guess is on the teen segment. Of course, you guys posted nice performance this quarter, so I'm kind of thinking about when you guys think this market could be potentially reaching an inflection point and how we should be thinking about the additional investments in your direct-to-consumer campaigns and really seeing the payoff there and how it translates into further growth in 2018? Joe Hogan : It\u2019s Joe again. Look I would say we've done one in a row on teens and we have more work to do on this, but we have to put a lot of money into the system in the sense of educating moms and teens, peer to peer training for doctors, all these things. And so I'd say, the whole idea, enthusiasm around the tipping point, we're not there yet. We have to continue to see this market and push this market in order to get it going. We're confident in our ability to do that based on what we experienced in the last five quarters, but not necessarily ready to claim victory and that this has its own momentum at this point in time. Unidentified Analyst : And then just one other quick question on scanners, I guess you were saying for you, if I heard you correctly, for the full year 2018, you're not expecting the same sort of growth for the scanner business. So just kind of on that front, what sorts of expectations or assumptions do you have baked in for 2018 for growth in this market. John Morici : This is John. We would expect scanner growth to be approximately equal to Invisalign. Operator : Our next question is with Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block : Joe, maybe for you, in 2018, another great year of revenue growth expectations and another year of sort of healthy spend expectations as well. So maybe if you can talk to where that spend is being allocated. Clearly, there's a return, but what is it -- is it more reps, is it additional DTC, is it both and then how do we think about that spend maybe throughout the year in terms of reaching sort of the critical mass on the rep front and then I\u2019ve got a follow-up. Joe Hogan : Jon, what we're doing is we\u2019re basically magnifying the investments that we\u2019ve made in 2017, so you'll see again investment in teen, broader advertisements, so we now help to drive GP volume growth, particularly in United States too. Investments in our concierge service, but behind that too is what you alluded to also is more field people on the ground calling on customers to actually drive the business. So there's a direct correlation -- when you look at the correlation between our investment in these particular areas to drive demand and the demand we're able to drive and we can see that we realize through that, we're continuing on the same plane that we have before, Jon. I think I'm behind you, I know your question is leverage. As actually when that leverage does occur, I mean that's \u2013 I\u2019m voiding that -- it's just -- I don't this thing is not self-sustaining yet. We have to invest in to drive demand in this business and to educate consumers and particularly and to train doctors. And so I don't see that going away in 2018, Jon. Jon Block : To shift gears, I know it's early, but I do want to sort of follow-up with the store front initiative. Clearly, the model, it gets the volume into the doc\u2019s offices and you've been very vocal about that and it's unlike that of SDC, nut what are you hearing from your customers, maybe even if it's only specific to San Francisco, are there any that are sort of unsettled by called the fixed economics for Express type cases and they shouldn\u2019t be saying, hey, I'm getting 500 bucks instead of 50 for doing an SDC markup, but have they come around and what are you hearing in the early days from that customer base? Joe Hogan : Jon, from a San Francisco store standpoint, when you ask the doctors around San Francisco about the store, there's enthusiastic support for it, because they're close to it and they see what we're doing. But if you go around the country, there is anxiety with doctors in the sense of what is Align trying to do with these stores and how to go about it. So we continue to try to communicate that this is a doctor's model and we're trying to drive that demand as much as we can through the orthodontics, and also the GP. To your specific question about the signature product and our cost forward, I mean that hasn't been a favorite of our doctors that we set that price, but obviously there is a market price for around that, but that kind of -- and I call it anterior teeth movement which is basically just a smile kind of improvement that we know that patients really want and we feel that we have to deliver. There are some docs that readily support it and they are happy with it.  There's other ones that aren't happy with it too and we continue to let them make that selection, whether they want to participate in that or not. We also have our deluxe cases as we haven't set a priceline that the orthodontists have been very happy with in a sense. So, we do have a significant number of patients that offer the Deluxe too when they understand potential bite changes and what that might do for the long term dentition. Operator : Our next question is with Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Zach Wachter : This is actually Zach Wachter on for Steve. Thanks for the questions. Joe, I wondered if you saw the 3Shape and 3M release out today on the collaboration and any early thoughts on that. Joe Hogan : Yeah. Zach, the one thing I was kind of stunned with was that basically 3M admitted that their scanner doesn't function properly for digital marketplace. I mean that surprised me more than anything. With that, it doesn't surprise me that they would go to 3Shape because 3Shape does have a good Confocal imaging scanner as we know, partially supported by our technology, but that's just to be expected in that sense. But -- the real part that surprised me was really that the def scanner that 3M currently has apparently will be retired in some way. So as far as what does that mean from a competitive standpoint, it doesn't change anything at all. It just means that 3M felt that they needed a different front end from a digital standpoint in their system than what they currently manufacture. Zach Wachter : And as far as the 3Shape transition on the scan submissions, how are you doing in terms of back filling those volumes and what do you think about the overall impact there? Joe Hogan : That\u2019s like we didn't call our forecast any impact. We have customers upset at us because we had to make that move and wanted to make that move. But we're working through that, through offers of iTero that help offset this and also through subsidizing some submissions we did have in a fundamental way than the analog way in order to do impressions. So right now, we're not calling any kind of a downside based on that. We emphasize with customers have been effective from a workflow standpoint, we're doing everything we can to mitigate that and make it as easy as possible. Zach Wachter : And there have been a couple of questions on store front, I wonder on the -- specifically on the consumer finance program, separate from the store, if there have been any early learnings there that you can share and any incremental volume left to speak to. Joe Hogan : These are good questions. We\u2019ll tell Steve how good you are. John's going to answer that question for you. John Morici : Look, we're doing a pilot now in some key markets and learning a lot and working through to make sure that we have the best possible patient and customer experience through this. So we're learning, making sure that it gets rolled out in the right way and you'll see a larger rollout coming in the future. Operator : Our next question is with John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger : Joe, given the very strong growth that you just finished up in \u201917, how do you feel about the manufacturing infrastructure\u2019s ability to handle it? If you had similar growth in \u201918 as you just put up, would there be any strains on the system and whereas in particular and do you have to put some more capital work there to stay ahead of that? Joe Hogan : John, yes, we do. And we do that almost systematically. We make sure that we have enough SLA equipment and capability and whereas, obviously, we're going to have extra capacity now coming on in China that will help take some pressure off that facility too. We also could have a bottleneck on the patient and -- when you look at Costa Rica and what we do overall from the case assessment, case prescriptions standpoint, but we tend of stay up at that and we had a big challenge last year because we had a lot of volume come out as pretty quickly and we were able to recover and get it done. So I think the job right now I feel good about our operations team, our ability to anticipate that, to have the kind of capacity available upfront to get this done. So we don't look at that as being an issue in 2018. John Kreger : And then just one follow-up, can talk a bit about key new innovations. So you gave us a nice update on mandibular advancement, as we think about \u201918, is there anything out on the horizon that you would maybe care to preview. Joe Hogan : Well, I think we've talked a lot about rapid palatal expansion, I mean we talked about that about 18 months ago. We\u2019ve given updates on that, that technology continues to progress. We're enthusiastic about it. That's rapid palatal expansion, John. You put in, in this case a device, it replaces a device where you use actually a wrench today to turn it, it's very crude in the sense of how you expand the palatal, that this would be a digital way with plastic and being able to expand the palatal on a regular basis.  We also have a product called dental expansion, which will expand your upper arch also Invisalign with Invisalign aligners also. So those are the big products that we're moving toward. When you think about the teen marketplace, and we call tweens and teens and 30% of that marketplace is basically rapid palatal expansion and math, mandibular phase 1 kind of things. And so that technology is really aimed at making us more -- have a more substantial footprint and capability in that teen segment. Operator : Our next question is with Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeff Johnson : John I think as you mentioned on SDC, maybe revenue is coming down a little bit in the forward quarters here after a couple of quarters in a row, near 10 million as they continue to ramp their aligner manufacturing. I guess my question just why do they keep investing in manufacturing capacity. Obviously, they have a good partner in you guys, you guys have plenty of manufacturing, I know, maybe some strain on it and whereas as we were just discussing, but why the investments there still and why not just continue to use you guys for most of their aligner needs? Joe Hogan : Jeff, I think it looks at separate company. They're looking at this as how they want to run their company and decisions that they make to invest and produce their own product. We take anything that comes externally that they don't want to manufacture and it varies. As you've seen kind of quarter by quarter, based on what they produce versus what they go outside with, but it's an internal decision that they make. Jeff Johnson : And then when I try to triangulate, I take 1Q guide kind of your 1.8 versus 2.8 EBIT guide and think about kind of what's going on in the business right now, help me out just understand what looks like it could be a down margin in the first quarter and I know John is going to give you a pass on that, but let me just push a little bit on it. How much of that is just your opening, Cologne recently opening in China in the treatment planning, China manufacturing costs or manufacturing facility being built out, it just seems like you are doing quite a bit right now, a couple of new storefronts, all that stuff. Is that really the driver of just some elevated expenses here in the near term or should we be thinking anything ASP driven or anything else kind of core fundamental to the business just versus some investments that need to be made right now. John Morici : Yes. Jeff, it's mostly investments. If you think about how 2017 played out, from the investments early on in the year and progressively as we went quarter by quarter, we've got increasing operating leverage. That's the same type of play that we would have for 2018. We're investing, we continue to follow the strategy that we have and you'll see those investments throughout the year and first quarter, it's not as much operating leverage, but to guide something flat on a year-over-year basis, around that 24%, you would expect that some of that increase as we go through the year. Operator : Our next question is with Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Unidentified Analyst : This is Kevin on for Matt today. I wanted to follow up on a previous question on manufacturing. I know China is -- the facility there is coming on later this year. I was just curious on the primary investments there, are there any updates to new printers or materials and I guess more broadly with the large growing cash balance and possible repatriation of some cash back into the US, how the company thinks about the best use of cash at the moment? John Morici : Yeah. I can start with that one. I mean when we think about our China operation, I mean, as kind of been noted, when we talk about investments that we have to make up, to accommodate the manufacturing, we're always investing. So now, we're going to add to that capacity that we need in China. So it's really a shift in some cases from Mexico to China and we'll continue to make those investments as needed from an overall growth standpoint. And when we look at our cash position that we have, as we said on previously, we're going to look at what strategically makes the most sense to bring cash back where we need it, where we can properly use that cash for future investments. But in other cases like China, we\u2019ll leave cash there to be able to grow that operation that we need. So we're going to look at this very strategically as to how we best fund our growth. Unidentified Analyst : And then lastly, I was just -- just looking at the percentage of cases done through the iTero digital scanning process, it goes up nicely every quarter and it was right around 50% in North America this time last year. So large incremental improvement. Ideally, you're looking for 100% there, but is there an internal target that company is looking for in \u201918 or the coming years? And secondly, how would you think about any kind of savings from fewer adjustments being sent back or chipping the molds out. Is it more significant than we might assume? Joe Hogan : It\u2019s Joe. We don't really -- don't set numbers year to year to think where we're going to be, but you saw a ten point increase last year in North America alone. So I mean we expect that going forward, as scanners are more and more adopted, obviously, fewer impressions are going to be done. So, ideally, you'll get to 100% someday, but getting to 80%, 85% is probably going to be, it\u2019s the top of the area because a lot of, particularly on the GP side, they will be maybe reluctant to invest in the scanner until they know that they have enough Invisalign volume to really support that. But I -- as far as the savings of doing that, we actually obviously don't have -- you have better fitting aligners. We know all those things occur from that, but we don't have any quantification in the sense of the economics or changes in that way that I can share with you that I know. Operator : Our last question is with Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Just a couple of housekeeping questions, John. In terms of the 1Q revenue guidance, 400 to 410, pretty rare that we would see a sequential quarter-over-quarter decline if ever. Does that imply -- can you give us some sense of like the actual magnitude of the scanner step down from 4Q into the first quarter and perhaps spike out, whether that largely reflects upfront Patterson shipments that really won\u2019t recur in the first quarter. John Morici : Brandon, it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, as you pointed out, the revenue is -- the numbers that we guided to is just a pure reflection of what we expect from a scanner standpoint and being the strength of Q4 from a scanner standpoint, it\u2019s a big quarter from a capital standpoint and investment standpoint by our doctors. It doesn't necessarily repeat in Q1. So that's a step down that we see. So it's really what's driving that change and it's been that, it's not unexpected in terms of how we look at Q4 to Q1. Brandon Couillard : And then secondly in terms of the \u201918 outlook, can you give a sense of where you see your percentage of SmileDirect manufacturing volumes shaken out for the year? And then secondly curious if you\u2019ve finalized plans on whether you expect it to take a little, more or less pricing this year. John Morici : So, on SmileDirectClub, we would expect about the same volume year-over-year. So what we saw in \u201917 should approximate and repeat in 2018 and that would be included in the overall numbers that we gave. And in terms of ASPs, we increased in the past, we haven't announced any increase in 2018. We will let our customers know in advance and then communicate that afterwards, but our past history has been to include. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, everyone. This concludes our conference call today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including the Leerink Healthcare Conference, Morgan Stanley European Healthcare conference and the Chicago Midwinter Meeting. We're also announcing today that we will be hosting an Investor Day in New York City on May 23. Additional information will be available shortly. We hope to see you there. If you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Align Technology First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Shirley Stacy. Please go ahead. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO. We issued first quarter 2018 financial results today via GlobeNewswire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Note that, beginning in Q1 2018, the American region now includes the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Previously, Latin America was combined with the EMEA results for reporting purposes and included in the international total. While the Latin America region has been relatively immaterial to Align's overall results, we've adjusted our prior-period regional breakouts to reflect this change so our year-over-year comps are consistent. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 12 months. A telephone replay will be available today by approximately 5 :30 PM Eastern Time through 5 :30 PM Eastern Time on May 9. To access the telephone replay, domestic callers should dial 877-660-6853 with conference number 13678038 followed by pound. International callers should dial 201-612-7415 with the same conference number. As a reminder, the information that the presenters will discuss today will include forward-looking statements including statements about Align's future events, product outlook and the expected financial results for the second quarter of 2018. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are set forth in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may vary significantly, and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We've posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations and our first quarter conference call slides, on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights in the quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. I'm pleased to report better-than-expected first quarter results and a strong start to the year for Align with the revenue \u2013 with revenues, volumes and EPS above guidance. Record Q1 revenues were up 41% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong Invisalign volume across all geographies and customer channels, as well as iTero scanner sales which are up over 84% year-over-year. Q1 Invisalign volume growth of 31% year-over-year was driven by increased utilization, including strong teen case growth globally and expansion of our customer base, which included over 4,200 new Invisalign-trained doctors worldwide. Turning to specifics around our first quarter results. Let's start with results of our Americas region. For the Americas, Q1 was a good quarter with Invisalign volume up 7.1% sequentially and 24% year-over-year, reflecting growth in both our Orthodontist and GP Dentist channels. In Q1, we trained 1,600 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region, of which 455 were in Brazil alone. We're also seeing a continued ramp-up for Invisalign treatment. For the Americas region, year-over-year growth was led by Ortho customers with another record quarter for North America Ortho utilization of 15.3 cases per doctor. Q1 Invisalign utilization for our North American GP Dentist were also up year-over-year, although modestly and predominantly reflecting continued expansion of the GP customer base, which included 900 from new North American GPs who submitted Invisalign cases for the first time this quarter. During the quarter, we focused on key sales and marketing initiatives intended to drive growth with certain key customers. And in Q1, we continued to see higher rates among doctors in these programs than among non-participating doctors. We also saw a nice uptick in Q1 from our dental service organizations, or DSO channel. DSOs remain a very strategic part of our overall strategy, as they look to scale operations and accelerate growth for their practices through continued investment in our end-to-end digital workflow, including Invisalign treatment and iTero scanners. At the Association of Dental Support Organizations, ADSO, Meeting in Austin last week, two of our largest partners spoke to major DSOs about their success in integrating Invisalign treatment and digital scanning into their organizations. And our special markets team continues to build on these wins across the region. For international doctors, Q1 was another strong quarter with Invisalign case volume up 6.2% sequentially and 43.4% year-over-year, reflecting strong Invisalign volume across the board, driven by both increased adoption as well as the expansion of our customer base, which included another 2,645 new Invisalign-trained providers with roughly half of EMEA and half in APAC. From a customer channel perspective, while we continue to see strong growth from both the Ortho and GP practices, we're beginning to see more positive traction in the GP channel from segmenting our sales and marketing resources and programs specifically around each channel. For Q1, we're continuing to help expand the market for clear aligner treatment with approximately 1,600 newly-trained doctors in EMEA, of which half were new Invisalign Go GPs. Year-over-year growth in Invisalign volume in EMEA was up 36.6% with record volume in all but one core country market. This performance reflects continued confidence in treating complex cases with Invisalign clear aligners, as well as success in the GP channel, which was up over 67% year-over-year. The growth was led by Iberia and France, which were up over 40% year-over-year, and Iberia became our third largest market worldwide for the first time following China, our second largest market after United States. We also saw strong growth across our key expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe and Benelux, where we continue to increase our sales and marketing resources across the board and began to implement consumer marketing programs. In APAC, Q1 Invisalign volumes were up 56.1% year-over-year, led by China, Japan and Australia with China solidifying as our second largest worldwide market. Our Q1 results reflect continued strong growth overall and especially from teen cases, which were up 73% year-over-year. In addition, we saw strong growth from our GP channel, which was up over 70% compared to last year. We also continue to see positive uplift from Invisalign customers with iTero scanners. For Q1, Japan had a record quarter and showed very strong growth from doctors, who have previously purchased iTero Element scanners. Finally, Q1 was an all-time high for Invisalign volume and our smaller expansion markets in Thailand, Singapore and Korea, where we are still very early in their development and adoption cycles. Now, turning to the teen market. In Q1, 69,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 8.8% sequentially and 40.9% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions and increasingly among younger teens and tweens. Q1 was the sixth consecutive quarter that Invisalign teenage patient volumes grew faster than adults. Overall, teen case growth is outpacing adult growth on both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products. For Q1, year-over-year Invisalign Teen patient growth for North America's Orthos increased 33% and internationally was up 60%. The average age among teenagers continue to get younger and younger, falling 6 months over the last seven quarters to 14 years old. This trend in average age should continue downward, as we commercialize Invisalign products that support treatment of young teens and children, including Mandibular Advancement and Invisalign First, which we announced earlier this month. Invisalign Teen with Mandibular Advancement, or MAF, as we call it, continues to ramp internationally. It is currently pending FDA approval in the United States, which is slotted for approval in the second half of this year. The lift analysis that we have suggests a direct halo effect from MAF users that results in a higher percentage of teenagers treated with Invisalign clear aligners. Invisalign First clear aligners is a new Invisalign treatment designed with features specifically for younger patients with early mixed dentition. Phase 1 treatment, which makes up roughly 20% of case starts each year, is early interceptive orthodontic treatment traditionally done through arch expanders or partial metal braces before all permanent teeth have erupted, typically ages 6 through 10. To-date, Invisalign First clear aligners have been used to treat over 600 patients and will be commercially available beginning July 1 in 2018. Earlier this month, we announced an expanded Invisalign product portfolio that includes new options and greater flexibility to treat a broader range of patients. The revamped Invisalign product portfolio offers doctors more choices by extending desirable features across the entire portfolio and creating Invisalign treatment packages, as well as a new Invisalign First option to treat young patients with early mixed dentition. The new Invisalign clear aligner treatment options will be effective July 1, 2018. Today, we announced a new more user friendly version of our Invisalign Go product and digital platform that offers greater flexibility and expanded treatment options for simple teeth straightening cases. Invisalign Go offers intuitive Invisalign experience designed for GPs worldwide, who are seeking to integrate clear aligner therapy into their thriving comprehensive dentistry practices. We started the year off with strong consumer interest in the first quarter, over 4 million unique visitors to Invisalign websites worldwide, up 54% from the same quarter last year. More than 500,000 potential patients search for an Invisalign provider on our Doc Locator webpage, up 27% from the same quarter last year. Almost 220,000 consumers opted in for follow-up, and the Invisalign social media community grew over 20% year-over-year, adding 688,000 consumers who are following the Invisalign brand worldwide. All metrics for tracking consumer interest are up with especially strong growth in website visitors across APAC and opt-ins in Americas region. During the quarter, we also expanded on our customer outreach through the addition of our second Invisalign pilot store near our headquarters in San Jose, California. We're seeing great initial ramp-up in both San Francisco and San Jose stores, as we connect consumers to authorized Invisalign providers and we'll continue to monitor store activity. The Invisalign stores are a doctor-based model. Consumers who visit an Invisalign store are referred to a doctor's office where a doctor performs a personal clinical examination of the patient and a treatment plan. The doctor will follow the patient until the case is completed. In Q2, we are opening two additional pilot stores on the East Coast, one in Bethesda, Maryland and another in Philadelphia area. We look forward to continuing to learn more from these four locations and sharing our progress throughout the year. As we head into our highest investment period of the year for our consumer marketing program, which includes the very important summer season for teenage case starts, we plan to increase spend across mom and teen marketing programs to focus on raising awareness and turning more consumers into Invisalign patients through our doctor's offices. In Q1, iTero revenues were down 10% sequentially, as expected following a strong Q4, which reflected year-end seasonality in the capital equipment business. Year-over-year, Q1 scanners were up 84%, reflecting very strong growth across all regions and reflects how central a digital approach is to overall customer utilization of Invisalign treatments. Use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to expand and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For the first quarter, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to a record 67.2%, up from 65.3% in Q4 last year. International scans increased to 43.1%, up from 41.4% in Q1 last year. To-date, more than 7.7 million orthodontic scans and 2.7 million restorative scans have been started with iTero scanners. Today, we announced the expansion of our iTero Element portfolio with the launch of the iTero Element 2 and the iTero Element Flex scanners. These additions build on the existing high-precision, full color imaging and fast scan times of iTero Element portfolio, while streamlining orthodontic and restorative workflows. The next-generation iTero Element 2 is designed for greater performance with 2x faster startup and 25% faster scan processing times compared to iTero Element. The new iTero Element Flex is a wand-only device that transforms compatible laptop computers into a highly portable scanner that works anywhere. It's perfect for practices with multiple locations who need a scanner that is both convenient and easy to transport. The new scanners will be showcased at the AAO meeting next week. Today, we also announced that we'll have received market approval for iTero Element intraoral scanner from the CFDA, that's the China Food and Drug Administration and we've begun offering the iTero Element scanner in China. Intraoral scanners have less than a 2% penetration rate in China today and are expected to grow 6x by 2020. The iTero Element scanner launch in China not only supports growth of our base Invisalign clear aligner business, but also represents a major milestone for digital dentistry in China. Finally, in the doctor-directed at-home channel, Align is a third-party supplier to SmileDirectClub with a 19% equity investment in the company. We manufacture a portion of SDC aligners, which are non-Invisalign clear aligners. For Q1, shipments to SDC were down sequentially, as expected, reflecting SDC's desire to produce their own clear aligners. Today, we issued a separate press release commenting on SDC's allegation that the launch and operation of our Invisalign store pilot program constitutes a breach of non-compete provisions. As disclosed previously, we dispute SDC's allegations and intend to continue on Invisalign store pilot program and we oppose and defend ourselves in these proceedings. While this dispute does not impact our existing supply agreement with SDC, which is in effect through 2019, we anticipate minimal volume from SDC in Q2 in the second half of 2018. With that, I'll turn it over to John. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Now, for our Q1 financial results. Total company revenue for the first quarter was a record $436.9 million, up 3.7% from the prior quarter and up 40.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth includes a five point benefit from favorable foreign exchange. Clear aligner revenue of $385.5 million was up 5.8% sequentially on higher than expected volume. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 36.5% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies and increased Invisalign ASPs. Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially approximately $5 from Q4 to $1,310, reflecting favorable foreign exchange and product mix, partially offset by sales promotions and revenue deferrals. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up approximately $40, reflecting favorable foreign exchange, price increases and product mix partially offset by sales promotions and deferrals related to additional aligners. For the first quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 272,200 cases were up 6.7% sequentially and up 30.8% year-over-year, driven by growth across all regions. For Americas' Orthodontists, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 8.5% sequentially and up 27% year-over-year. For Americas' GP Dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 5.1% sequentially and up 19.6% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 6.2% sequentially and up 43.4% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the first quarter was $54.4 million, down 10% sequentially due to the lower volume from the Q4 seasonality effect and up 84% year-over-year, primarily due to higher volume partially offset by lower ASPs due to promotions and discounts. Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 74.9%, down 0.6 points sequentially and down 1 point year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 77%, down 0.6 points sequentially primarily due to increased aligners per case and higher training costs, partially offset by higher Invisalign ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin was down 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to regional expansion of our manufacturing activities partially offset by higher worldwide ASPs. Scanner gross margin for the first quarter was 59.2%, down 2.8 points sequentially due to lower scanner ASPs related to promotions and discounts. Scanner gross margins were up 3.1 points year-over-year primarily due to lower services costs partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Q1 operating expenses were $229.2 million, up sequentially 10% and up 31.8% year-over-year. The increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in our go-to-market activities including higher advertising spending, geographic expansion, as well as increased compensation related to expenses due to higher head count in our planned annual increase in employee compensation programs. Our first quarter operating income was $98.2 million, down 10.4% sequentially and up 59.2% year-over-year. Our first quarter operating margin was 22.5%, down 3.5 points sequentially and up 2.6 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin relates primarily to lower gross margin due to operational expansion activities, higher operating expenses as just described and lower SmileDirectClub-related revenue. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating margin primarily reflects higher revenues from both clear aligner and scanner and services, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. With regards to the first quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 2.9%, which includes $23.3 million in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and is down by approximately 89.5 points compared to 92.4% in Q4 of 2017 primarily due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December last year. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.17, up $1.04 sequentially and up $0.32 compared to the prior year. Recall that Q4 2017 diluted earnings per share of $0.13 included $86.6 million expense or $1.06 per diluted share impact due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Finally, in Q1, we adopted ASC 606 revenues from contracts with customers using the full retrospective method. While the impact to the Q1 2017 and Q1 2018 P&Ls are immaterial, the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 has been recasted to comply with ASC 606 requirements. MOVING on to the balance sheet. As of the first quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long term investments were $673 million. This compares to $761.5 million at the end of 2017, a decrease of approximately $88.5 million, primarily due to $100 million in stock repurchased during the quarter. Of our $673 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $236 million was held in the U.S. and $436.2 million was held by our international entities. Q1 accounts receivable balance was $361.5 million, up approximately 11.5% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, DSOs, was 74 days, up 5 days sequentially and down 3 days from 77 days in Q1 last year. Even though our accounts receivable aging profile has improved, the Q1 DSO was up sequentially as a result of increased sales with extended payment terms that are available in certain regions. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $57.6 million, primarily related to building purchases and improvement, equipment purchases for additional manufacturing capacity, as well as our global expansion efforts including the new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China mentioned last quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $77.3 million, up $29.7 million compared to the prior year. Free cash flow from the first quarter defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, amounted to $19.7 million. During the first quarter, we also report \u2013 repurchased approximately 400,000 shares of stock for $100 million under the April 2016 repurchase program. We have $100 million remaining available for repurchase under this existing stock repurchase authorization. Other significant cash flow activities during the quarter included the receipt of $30 million from SmileDirectClub for repayment of their existing line of credit and we paid $47.8 million in employees' taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units. With that, let's turn to our Q2 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. We expect our international business to grow significantly on a sequential basis as the European market is coming out of their winter season. And most of the APAC market we're observing Lunar New Year in the first quarter. For the Americas region, we expect Q2 to grow as our Ortho and GP customers are seasonally busier and as we continue to make progress in our Latin America expansion. We continue to invest in our iTero go-to-market activities. We started selling iTero Element in Brazil in Q1, and we have started selling iTero Element in China in Q2. We expect sequential increase in iTero units sold and revenues. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are currently in litigation with SmileDirectClub regarding our Invisalign store pilot. And while this does not impact our supply agreement, the state of our relationship, we are assuming minimum volumes for SmileDirectClub in Q2 in the second half of 2018. With this as a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 296,000 to 301,000 cases up approximately 28% to 30% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q2 net revenues to be in the range of $460 million to $470 million, an increase of approximately 29% to 32% year-over-year. We expect Q2 gross margin to be in the range of 74.2% to 75%, reflecting higher expenses as we regionalize our treatment planning and manufacturing operations, partially offset by higher ASPs. We expect Q2 operating expenses to be in the range of $245 million to $250 million, up on a sequential basis to reflect our continued investment in go-to-market activities. Q2 operating margin should be in the range of 21% to 21.8%. Our effective tax rate, including an excess tax benefit of about $10 million should be approximately 13%. We expect a $1 million to $2.5 million loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub, and diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $81.6 million exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q2 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.06. In addition, as we continue to operational \u2013 our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q2 to be approximately $65 million to $70 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $10 million to $11 million. Now, let me turn to our view of 2018. Based on the momentum in our business to-date and our planned investments for the remainder of the year, we now anticipate 2018 total revenue growth rate to be above our long-term model and in the low 30s. We also expect Invisalign volume and \u2013 revenue and volume to be growth in that same range. Notwithstanding continued investments in our strategic growth drivers, we expect operating margin for the full year to be flat to slightly up from 2017 operating margin of 24%. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, John, and thanks to those for joining the call today. I'm pleased with our start to 2018 as well as our continued progress and execution of our strategic growth drivers. There are a lot of changes happening in Dentistry and Orthodontics today. But the industry remains healthy and I think customers are starting to see new opportunities for how they treat patients and reach new customers. We're looking forward to an exciting and productive AAO Meeting in Washington, D.C. where we'll get to showcase our new products on the scanner side and also with Invisalign First. We're also going to have a pop up version of our Invisalign pilot store as a way to answer customer questions and to get their perspective on our program. Then, we'll be in Singapore at the end of May, hosting our third Asia-Pacific Summit. We will be expecting about 1,000 delegates from across the region attending a two-day peer-to-peer education event. We've got a lot going on in Q2 and I look forward to sharing more with you at our upcoming financial conference at our Investor Day in New York on May 23. Thinking about Monday for sure. On May 23. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator, and we'll open up to your questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks guys for the question. Joe, just looking at the expected new revenue growth rate for the year, you know now above the long-term model. I'm sure it's a combination of several factors, but I was hoping maybe you could just maybe in ranked order attribute what really has gone better than expected so early in the year, if we think about teen off to a good start on the new product launches. Obviously, iTero seems to be pacing much better than certainly we were expecting. Could you maybe just give us some insight into what out of the gate this year has gone better than planned? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, we had an aggressive plan for the year. But to start off, Bob, I'd say, if you look at the international business, it continues to be very strong with APAC and EMEA, really good performance in the Americas particularly around North America, too. We started to segment it. You mentioned it. Our teen product is up pretty substantially that way. iTero sales have been terrific in that sense. We talked about how customers more and more are recognizing that whole digital workflow and how important it is. And you can see with our scanning now North American being close to 67%, that's just really working out well. And we know when they purchase iTero scanner, we see more Invisalign sales. Lastly, I'd say our segmentation \u2013 I mentioned it in my script too, is the segmentation of GP and Ortho very specifically and also segmenting consumers in the sense of our Concierge service and how more and more we target consumers and lead them into specific docs from a Doc Locator standpoint. And that's gone a little better than expected too. So, overall, the company has been executing well across geographies and across our segmentation and product plans. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And I appreciate that. And then, it looks like you're seeing some early traction already from Invisalign First. I was wondering if maybe you could share with us how that launch of a product like that changes the addressable market that you can actually go after. Just getting some thoughts from you would be helpful around how much more expanded that the younger market becomes with a product like First? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. First of all, those 600 cases we did, that product launches in July. Those were actually just cases we put in place from a clinical study standpoint to prove the whole thing. So, really, that 600 is \u2013 I mean, you're going to see us do more and more clinical work like that to do a lot of cases, Bob, just to make sure that we have good evidence for our customer bases we go out there to work on. Secondly, when you look at the teen marketplace, palatal expansion, or what we call Phase 1 represents about 20% of the marketplace. Now, this is dental expansion. It's not morphology or bone expansion like you have in rapid palatal expansion. So, in the past, we said we've roughly can do 60% to 65% of the cases with Invisalign. What Invisalign First dental expansion does is expand that that market served opportunity another 10%. And then, we'll follow that with a rapid palatal expander that we're currently going through now, and that will increase it another 10%, too, so we can cover that whole 20% Phase 1 part that you have with teens out there. And that also has a good entree for us because often it's Phase 1, Phase 2 treatments were teens or young children that are 7 to 8 age have the palate expansion play and then it goes on to dental kind of work from an orthodontic standpoint later on in their teens. And so, there's a good transition period for that, too. So it's a great product. It's targeting that segment of the marketplace that we haven't had technology at before and it's specifically an orthodontic product that we've developed here. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Awesome. Great. Thanks for the questions. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: All right, Bob. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, to the extent you're comfortable, I would love to just hear your view on kind of what the path forward is with respect to SDC, SmileDirect. And then, John, any chance you could share with us the percent of cases that you manufactured for them in the first quarter? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: We can't really get into specifics. And obviously, we're going through litigation, we have to work through litigation. I'll just say we continue to have a good relationship with David and his team, and we just have a disagreement in the sense of obviously the contract that we're in and we're going to work through this from a litigation standpoint, so as that develops, we'll be able to be more clear with you as to what's going on. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Fair enough. And then, one more. Joe, with respect to the Invisalign store model, would be curious to hear your views on how that's tracking relative to plans. It looks like you pulled forward perhaps by a couple of quarters the East Coast build outs. What are some of the things you're learning and what have you learned so far from the initial experience? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Brandon, first of all, we didn't pull those forward. That was in our plan as we had for 2018 and we're just sequentially putting them in. And we've learned \u2013 honestly, these stores, we've learned a lot in the sense and these \u2013 what we learn helps our doctors an awful lot too about how you take a basic consumer and you turn them into a patient. We learned that visualization is really important. The speed of that visualization, I mean, you scan, you can show a patient what their teeth are going to look like with certain kind of treatment options, gives them a lot of confidence then to go to a doctor and to see a doctor and to complete that treatment piece. We've learned a lot about our software too in the sense of how it has to respond from a patient standpoint. There's also a lot that we're doing from a marketing standpoint in the sense of turning interest from a consumer over to a store and then back to a doc. In other words, turning consumers into patients also. Through all that, I'll tell you the iTero scanner again is really critical in being able to do this. It's really the key on the visualization piece. But also, our treatment software planning in the sense of making it as real time as possible, so patients can see how their teeth will move and what their smile will look like. Those combinations become really important, not just in the store, but as we translate that software to our doctor partners. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Very good. Thank you. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Brandon. Next question, please. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Joe, can you give us a sense in terms of the feedback that you're hearing from your field sales force on the competitive front? Are you seeing any changes perhaps in promotional activity or pricing from competitors at least at the low end? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: No, we haven't seen any change at all, John. I mean, we \u2013 I mean, the same cast of competitors are still out there that we had before. Obviously, we expect the 3M product at the AAO. We are pretty sure to see one there. We saw the supply announcement at the MTM expansion in the 510(k) that they've done. But we haven't seen that translated to any kind of strategy or implementation in the marketplace yet. We expect to see that in the second half. Our guess, John, is pretty much what we've been telling you and the rest of the teams over the last couple years is, we expect this to be midrange products. So in the 26 aligner or less kind of an area, we expected kind of a slow ramp up just because of the nature of how you have to scale in this business takes some time in treatment planning and also manufacturing. So I mean, you can see with our kind of bullish forecast for the second half of the year that John just called. We pretty much had this in place in the sense of what we thought we would face and we haven't really changed that analysis since we put the plan together last year. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And one quick follow-up on the scanner business. Did you see any kind of stocking by Patterson in the U.S. that might cause sales to slow as we move through this year or do you view that as end demand tracking as well as it would appear? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: No stocking here. In demand, that's a policy we have here. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks. Can you speak to the more recent financing pilot, I guess any surprises with that sort of initiative and when that would be a more meaningful contributor to growth? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. This is John. The pilot that we have is \u2013 took place in end of fourth quarter and through the first quarter, we saw great results. And it is going wider across the U.S. starting this quarter, where customers now \u2013 customers and ultimately the patients have a lot more flexibility in terms of how they want to finance and work through different financing options that they might have. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. I'll follow-up later there and then on \u2013 can you speak I guess on China and opportunity there I guess as well as the competitive landscape not just maybe from the clear aligner segment but also the broader iTero opportunity with the launch announced today? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I think \u2013 it's Dr. Joe Hogan. We're excited about that. I mean, our growth in China, China is our second largest market, our growth over there has been tremendous. It's hard to believe that right now everything we do in China is basically PVC impression. So and I mentioned in my script about 2% penetration of intraoral scanners in China. So from a competitive standpoint, our market is wide open in this sense and you could see that from those kind of \u2013 now we have to sell, we have to train, there's a lot of things we learned in Japan, because the iTero scanner being approved in Japan last year in the sense of how you have to ramp up and a lot of technology and people to bring our customers up to speed and saw that friction we are anticipating for this year as we ramp up in China, we're putting people in place and training in place, to be able to get that done. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Brien of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Kevin M. Farshchi - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is Kevin, on for Matt today. I wanted to start with the mandibular advancement ramp abroad, kind of what's most driving that strength. I've heard about it being incredible for the last two quarters. And then secondly with that assuming approval here in the U.S., how fast exactly is the U.S. ramp? Is this something that Ortho customers have been asking for a long time? Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Kevin. It's Joe. First of all, I'd say from a math standpoint, the ramp overseas, this is just a product that's unique. You obviously address mandibular issues and these are people, teens that are between the ages of 10 and 12 usually with that bone development through a jaw standpoint. And there's really nothing in the world to tell you have twin block and things like this, that's looks like a torture device basically with metal that's used to move kids forward with also composites. What this does is it moves your jaw forward with removable aligners and also straightens your teeth at the same time. So it's a true breakthrough for that end of the market and I think that's why you see really good pickup. Secondly is all of these products as it moves in the United States, I wouldn't model some kind of huge increase in teens because of mandibular advancement in the United States, because there is always a slow takeoff of this because orthodontist want to try it, they want to see success with their patients, they build that kind of credibility to the product line, they continue to move on. So from a North America standpoint, this is more of a 2019 discussion with math in the sense of maybe significant kinds of opportunities than I would say in the second half of this year Kevin M. Farshchi - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thanks, Joe. That's really helpful. I just had one follow up on a previous question on the competitive front and then additionally with the DTC effort. I was just curious are you hearing from your customers specifically becoming increasingly aware of the additional offerings in your view? And secondly, are they pushing back a little bit on pricing and looking for better discounts and things like this as a result of the DTC effort increasing and then also kind of layering on new products in the next coming years? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Kevin, I'd say look there's increasing awareness because I mean, it's mainly SDC in North America has really extensive advertising and so it's hard to watch TV and not run into in Invisalign ad or an SDC ad in that sense. But I wouldn't say, our customers always want lower prices like almost any other customers in the world, and anything else to sell. So I wouldn't say that the SDC price range has created more sensitivity with our orthodontic and GP customers out there. I will say that there is a price elasticity curve and obviously that kind of lower very I'd say minor type of tooth movement kind of things that opens up a new segment in the marketplace that frankly hasn't been serviced in a big way before. And so I think it just makes doctors aware of the more of a segmentation in the market of not doing a full bite correction, but just doing maybe your social six or just correcting a smile that someone is not comfortable with, that's a new segment in the market. It's priced in a different way and I'd say that's not a pushback on us on price it's more of a look at how to service those patients or what's the best products to do that with. Kevin M. Farshchi - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay, perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: A it's new one. Hey thanks for taking the questions. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey Steve. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Steve. Steve, your friends are here at... Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good to talk to you. The GP number in the quarter kind of sticks out in a really good way, really on a tougher comp kind of influx. Is it something going on in GP in the U.S. I mean, we don't have you know I go out in the field, what was the magic there? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: You know I don't \u2013 you know, it's not magic and it's not a surprise Steve I'd say. First of all SDO \u2013 I mean the DSO marketplace has been big for us right. So you know our work with Hartman, what's going on there and some other dental service organizations, team in North America has been very good at executing around those opportunities. Secondly, honestly, the increased advertising that that we've been doing, okay, has an overall halo effect with driving patients to GPs asking for Invisalign treatment. And we've noticed that since last year and we started cranking up advertising, so that is a kind of a residual effect or a second order effect that help the GPPs. Thirdly, Steve is we're doing more and more segmentation on salespeople, calling on GPs in a GP kind of a way. In other words, understanding GP workflows, they don't want to be orthodontists, having products like you know that are more simple for them to use in the sense of utilizing that within the workflow of a normal restorative kind of a dentistry type of workflow. So those three areas are doing primarily. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Super helpful. Thanks for that. And then you guys, you may have set a new record for press releases in one afternoon. I mean you introduced a lot of new stuff today and we could spend a lot of time on any one of them. But I wonder if there's any way to give us as a sort of high level of view Joe and what you think these products mean for the growth profile of the company over the next two years, the sum total of getting iTero into China and getting the GP channel you know a little bit more automated, getting more cameras on the market. What does this mean for the next two years or three years? Thanks so much. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Steve, first I'd be completely honest with you too. We're still learning, right. I mean, if you remember like a year ago, we weren't \u2013 we wouldn't really be tied down to tell you that we sell more iTero than we sell more aligners. Today I'd tell you a very concretely because we have enough data today that we sell more iTeros, we sell more aligners. We're gaining a lot of confidence in APAC as we continue to grow, like I mentioned on a previous question is in Japan, we learned a lot about what iTero can do, as you start to ramp up in a new market like Asia. Now, Japan is completely different than China has been completely how you do business there, but we do \u2013 we know how to go in there and we can anticipate in a sense of what China will need in the kind of uptake we'll have with those kind of scanners. So the iTero's that we just announced the two products in iTero, remember this is the equipment business. I grew up in equipment business and medical, that these are platforms, right these are new platforms that we're moving forward on that help to extend what we already know in that sense. So like the flex product allows you to put it into a compatible computer, move it around the different offices, that's what our customers are basically asking for, it's sort of break \u2013 new breakthrough in scanner technology is an extension. You're going to see us continue to do that as we work off a successful platform that allows us not to just go wider from a geographical standpoint like China, but to go deeper in a sense of the workflow and what our orthodontists and our GPs really want out there. Now I would look at \u2013 when you look at Invisalign Teen first the product we just announced, that's truly a breakthrough. When you think for years, we really couldn't do teeth that you know weren't completely erupted. They didn't have permanent dentition. Now we threw a lot of technology in understanding over the year, we could predict what those eruptions are going to be and that's what we've programmed in that team first product line that's wide open, so another 10% market share for us. But you've been with us long enough Steve to understand that the take up of those things are always cautious and it takes time, but it does establish and it takes time, but it does establish that and when we do the rapid palatal expansion that will establish you know another 20% of the marketplace that we haven't had before. So I mean just look at this is the continuum march of Align Technology to broaden overall our opportunities from a depth standpoint of penetrating the marketplace and from a breadth standpoint in moving into new geographies with those technologies too. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Really appreciate the color. Thanks again. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. All right. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Misra of Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital : Hi. I appreciate taking the call. A couple of questions. One on the store pilot, just kind of trying to get a sense for what the revenue potential that you see out of that is in the long-term? It sounds like you're having us moderate some of our expectations here based on what the contribution could be from SmileDirect itself as you guys work through you know your negotiations with them; and if you could give us some information on that, that would be great? And then secondly, maybe just a housekeeping question just on the EPS line, the 5 points of currency. What was the flow through down to the bottom line on that? Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: John, I'll take that last one. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take that first on Ravi on the EPS, you know, so 5 points on revenue and \u2013 we are \u2013 our model works as you know usually we get about 3 times the benefit on revenue as it is to profitability. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: So, Ravi, on the store pilot, we were not going to share any data on the store pilot right now. We call them pilots for a reason, because we're learning and we're growing through that learning and you know it just becomes more understandable because we have more data points, but we'd be happy to share that with you. As far as the SDC and all, we haven't shared specifically what we expect from quarter-to-quarter. I have never wanted you to really evaluate Align stock on SDCs, we sell the SDC never wanted to do that. And so when you say, we're kind of moderating your views of volume I would say, we're talking lower 30% for this year, that's not a moderation in this sense of what we think the growth is. We just want you to not try to handicap that with SDC volume. This is our inherent volume that we're generating in this business. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital : Yeah and I think that's pretty clear given your case start by guidance in the low 30s now. So I appreciate that. And then finally, just on the reapportionment of the Latin American sales, can you just talk about whether that's going to \u2013 is that just a reporting issue or are you going to be realigning some of the business units internally as well with that? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: No, I mean what that does Ravi is, we have a regional strategy here, right. We have APAC from an Asia standpoint, we have EMEA from Europe. We've always had just North American organization, it's been kind of Latin America was reporting into another part of the organization. And so this just straightens out our organizational intention of having regions in each one of the three key areas. And \u2013 but frankly, and then we bought up our distributorships in those areas, in Latin America, and also Brazil and we're moving forward in those areas. So you saw many doctors retrained in Brazil alone. These are good opportunities for us and it allows us to focus on it in a more of a regional sense and be able to transfer best practices within the Americas throughout the organization. So it's just a \u2013 it's a move it's in line with our regional structure. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital : Great. Thank you very much. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey Jon. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, Joe. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe two, the first one just the \u2013 on the new \u2013 iGo sort of iTero offering, is there a price point on that product, I didn't see it in the release and you know clearly you don't seem overly concerned with competition, but with that new iGo, iTero offering, I believe it's up to 20 stages. Joe is that sort of the part of the market that you do view as most susceptible and a competition does come in the next couple of weeks where they're going to try to crack the code a bit? And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: John you know this well and your analysis is right, if you take 15 up to 26, I mean that's been kind of a vacancy in the product portfolio for years. And so iGo wasn't derived without an understanding of that okay. Yeah, we do \u2013 I wouldn't call that \u2013 you know when you \u2013 if you really stand back from this, trying to do a full case with all the complexity it has to do with full cases. If you were a competitor coming in here, it's a very difficult thing to do. You want to kind of gradually learn and ramp up to that. So the logical, our logical conclusion is, yeah I mean, we're probably going to see more competition in the below 30 area. The good thing about that John, that's not new to us. We've seen competition from MTM and Angel Align and you can go down the list of competitors we've seen globally, ClearCorrect or whatever in that specific area. But when you look at Maui when you look at iGo, Maui was the structure we put in place or whatever. It just gives us more flexibility for our customers to be able to offer these products up and down the range than what we've had before. So yeah, could we respond better to competition? Yes. Is that an area we think they'll come in? Yeah, but we've already seen that and this is just a continuation of how we've been working with our customers and how we structure our product portfolio. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. I appreciate you read the reports Joe, I just need others do as well. Just to pivot for a moment, the scanners and driving utilization in the U.S., that's clearly played a big role over the past several years and we're seeing the scanners playing a bigger role globally, and you mentioned just starting to get into China. When you take a step back, is there any reason why the utilization step up which you now seem much more comfortable sort of verifying. That utilization step up would be any different globally especially someplace like China or Japan versus what we've seen in North America. In other words when we look out two years or three years from now, could that be sort of the next leg of growth in some of these more emerging markets? Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Answer to that question is just a flat out, yes. I mean I don't think it's going to be any different in China. It hasn't been different Japan. We saw an uptake with the customers that took the initial iTeros there at John significantly. So we expect China to be the same way and other countries too. You know in Brazil, I think we've been successful with iTero in Brazil also. So yeah, that is another component of growth in the company overall. What's great is it's synergistic growth, right. You have equipment growth, but it really leads to the growth of our core product line which is Invisalign. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just the first one, on the tax rate, so 13% for 2Q. Just wondering what should we be modeling for the full year? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: The guidance that we had given for total year was, earlier on was 18%, so 18% in total would be what you should use, Richard. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, so that's unchanged. And then Joe, just going back to the question I was asked earlier on competition and how if at all, it's factored into your outlook. I guess just can you comment on more specifically how you contemplated the impact of any incremental competition on your prior outlook. And I appreciate you revised your outlook upward and that's a bullish signal. But compare the current factoring of competition compared to kind of how you thought about it previously and if you could get a specific as possible, is it price, is it maybe just a little less utilization you otherwise would have felt comfortable providing to The Street just how are you thinking about that in quantifying it? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Hasn't changed for a year, honestly I mean, you can tell what we initiated during the beginning of the year we didn't think we'd have any really major competitive plays in that sense. We knew we'd see more competition, but we basically looked at our business and with the momentum of the business and projected that forward and you're seeing it within our numbers, there's no specificity that I want to share in the sense of what we think and how much in ASP and what areas. Just take a look at our bullish forecast going forward and as competition becomes more visible to us and more in line, we'll share with you what we're seeing and how we look at the business. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : And a similar follow up to that line of questioning. Anything baked into your outlook specifically for mandibular contributing in the back half. I know you expect approval, but is there anything baked in for actual contribution to revenue and same on iTero. It feels like that came \u2013 the approval in China came a little bit ahead of plan I thought you had been talking about a second half kind of ramp for that and approval for that, was that a little earlier than expected? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: First of all on MAF, no I wouldn't plan on anything from a \u2013 that would be material on MAF as I mentioned and the other thing for North America when we finally get it approved. On China, we were happy to move that through. We've had good work with our Chinese partners over there to move it through. Right now, we're not calling any upside on that I mean, as we indicated, we've had good iTero growth. We think that'll continue as we \u2013 it's not just about how fast you can sell iTero in China, there's a lot of infrastructure work you have to put in place as far as training and putting things in place to be able to sell through China from an infrastructure standpoint. So what's great about that is, we can kind of get a quarter up on that as if it would have been the second half of the year then we wouldn't have as much opportunity to be able to move that product. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Good afternoon, Joe and John. Thanks for taking the question. I guess for us just one or two quick follow-ups here on the addressable market. First probably an easy one but just to make sure to clarify here, when we're talking about this 20% of untapped orthodontic case starts you can now treat with Invisalign First. That 20%, that is within the prior industry view of roughly 10 million worldwide annual orthodontic case starts. Is that correct? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Steve, first of all, it's not 20%, okay? Invisalign First is about 10% because that's dental expansion, which means you're just really taking the teeth and rounding the arch, right? Rapid palatal expansion moves the bone, moves the palate, mouth. So, 10% more of the market would be Invisalign First, another 10% would be for rapid palatal expansion. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Steve, you're talking 20% of cases are related to Phase 1, and that's correct. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: That's right. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: What Joe is explaining is you're talking about TAM, right? Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Correct. Yeah. More on the TAM that's correct. And really, I mean the more important question I wanted to get to at the end of the day really was that when we think about the 10 million worldwide orthodontic case starts TAM. I guess my real more critical question here is once Invisalign First is generally available and also once you do have U.S. approval for mandibular advance. And I'm just curious where we would stand after those events just on the approximate percent of that 10 million worldwide orthodontic case starts. Do you think you could treat right now overall with the overall Invisalign product profile and approval, that's really the more important question I wanted to ask. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I think the simple one on that Steve is it \u2013 before Invisalign First, we said 60%. Invisalign First takes us to 70%. Once we get rapid palatal expansion, it takes us to 80%. And that's the $10 million case starts that are out there, though that's based on 25% adult and 75% being teens. So, if you really want to nail that number, you're going to have to take 75% of 10 times 0.8. Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Okay. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Our final question comes from Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good evening, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Jeff. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, Joe. Let me go after the competition question maybe one other way here, I think we're all trying to circle around different things. But you guys are launching obviously a ton of stuff right now with the iGo in the Phase 1 and iTero expansion all that stuff. What's your view in the second half here, you guys expand the market quite a bit. And so, competition gets some share, but you guys are expanding markets so fast that you can put up that solid or that very strong second half guidance that seems to be implied there now or do you just really think competition doesn't get much traction? You know your comps get tougher in that so it's getting a little messy to try to figure out kind of how much of this is market expansion? How much may be competition, is this or isn't having an impact? But just conceptually how do you think it plays out that way? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Jeff, I think the best way to look at this is, don't look at this as binary. Competition comes in and just takes our share. We actually think that competition to a certain extent will less share because it'll give more legitimacy to clear aligners. And so, possibly in that lower segment of the marketplace could we lose some share? Sure. Sure, we could. At the same time we're expanding on the upper end with our product lines that you just saw with obviously mandibular advancement team, iGo in those areas. Jeff, the other side of this too is it's we've been saying this for a long time, it's hard to do this. I mean treatment planning facilities, making sure that you can ship aligners and actually ship them in sequence. So first, second, third are really first, second, and third aligners. Putting a sales team out there that they really can walk through customers and hold their hand in sensor, but it takes time to do this. It's not \u2013 this is not like a patent cliff we've been saying all along with something is a you know a biosimilar and you can put it in your portfolio and sell it the next day it's not like that. It will take time to ramp your competition. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Now that makes sense and then one last question for me just iTero anything qualitatively you can talk about maybe scanner sales in the U.S. and are you seeing any traction outside of Invisalign cases with iTero on any kind of restorative procedures anything like that just kind of trying to get to what is the mindset of the U.S. dentist right now are they are they willing or are they at the point where they want to use scanners for things you know obviously for Invisalign but for other things as well just what your view there that would be helpful? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, if you look at \u2013 I mean if you look at the three shape in us right, I mean three shape has a good position with GPs in a sense of restorative workflow and with the labs and whatever and you know they've helped to from a GP standpoint to grow the marketplace. We're the same way. We have a good restorative scanner. We have a great scanner from overall Invisalign standpoint and in both of us kind of raised the awareness and capability out in the marketplace. So, you know honestly, when you look at this thing Jeff long-term, this is \u2013 you're going to have a scanner you know one way or another your workflow is going to be digital going forward in dentistry. It starts around these kind of application restorative you know versus you know aligners and those kind of things. It'll flow through for the rest, so I don't know what you're thinking of in the sense of how to model that Jeff or what it means, but it just shows you more and more that this isn't just an for orthodontist. This is and we're developing a scanner that's brought across the marketplace to be one of the function well for GP and restorative, if you go back to iTero beginning right, it was function well for a GP and restorative. If we go back to iTero's beginning right, it was restorative scanner. When we bought that business, we're primarily was in G you know the general dentistry segment that it was developed around. But so I think I reported that we had 2.5 million restoratives scans done on iTero. So when our team is out there are calling on a GP, we're talking about not just that you can do our liners with this, I'm confident you can do this is a great very accurate restorative scanner that can communicate very well with your dental lab, that's really important in that net workflow. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And scanner sales growing in the U.S. still, is there still a good market there for you guys on the scanner side? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: And no question. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey. You saw the results of the iTero scanner business. You know the vast majority of the business is still in North America. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Just with the Japan approval and moving Brazil where you did into the Americas and I just wanted to check on that. So thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: All right. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, thank you, everyone. This concludes our conference call for today. I want to remind everyone that we will be hosting our Investor Day at the Park Central Hotel in New York City on May 23.

Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights on the quarter and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments : clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. I'm pleased to report another better than expected quarter for Align. Our second quarter results reflect strong growth across our customer channels with record volume in all regions and almost every country market. Year-over-year revenue growth of 37.5% was driven by continued momentum from Invisalign doctors and increased adoption of Invisalign treatment for teenage patients which grew 42.1%. Q2 Invisalign volume growth of 30.5% year-over-year reflects increased utilization and expansion of our customer base which was over 50,000 for the first time and included more than 5,000 new Invisalign trained doctors. We also saw momentum from the iTero scanner and services business which includes the continued rollout of iTero scanners across Heartland Dental's supported offices as well as the first iTero scanner shipments to China. Turning to specifics around our second quarter results, let's start with results of our Americas region. For the Americas, Q2 was a good quarter with Invisalign case volume up 8.9% sequentially and 22.2% year-over-year reflecting growth in both our orthodontic and also GP dentist channels. In Q2, we trained 1,795 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region, of which 640 were in Latin America alone, where we trained more doctors in the first half of this year than we did all of last year. For the Americas region, year-over-year growth was led by orthodontist customers with another record quarter for North American ortho utilization at 16.4 cases per doctor. Q2 Invisalign utilization for North American GP dentist were also up year-over-year at 3.6 cases per doctor reflecting continued expansion of the GP customer base which represented over 20,000 GPs for the first time in a quarter. For international doctors, Q2 was another strong growth with Invisalign case volume up 14.9% sequentially and 45.4% year-over-year, reflecting strong Invisalign volume across the board driven by both increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base. For Q2, we're continuing to help expand the market for clear aligner treatment with approximately 1,650 newly trained doctors in EMEA. Year-over-year growth of Invisalign volume in EMEA was up 38% with a record quarter in all geographies as well as the teenage segment which was up 72% year-over-year. We also saw growth across our key expansion markets, led by Central and Eastern Europe. In May, we announced a grand opening of our first Invisalign treatment planning facility in Europe located in Cologne, Germany. Until recently, Invisalign treatment planning for EMEA doctors was conducted in Align's treatment planning facility in Costa Rica. The Cologne facility will also serve as a training facility for Invisalign doctors with a German speaking market providing clinical education and support in local language. In September, we'll host a grand opening of our new treatment planning facility in Madrid, Spain which will serve the Iberia market. In APAC, Q2 Invisalign volumes were up 58.7% year-over-year led by China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand. Our Q2 results reflect continued strong growth overall and especially from teen cases which were up 74.3% year-over-year. China continues to drive the majority of growth in the Asia-Pacific region and we are increasingly leveraging digital and social media marketing programs. Japan also had a strong year-over-year Invisalign growth, driven primarily by orthodontists as well as continued uplift from iTero scanners. In addition, GP dentist channel in APAC was up 77.9% compared to last year. Q2 was all-time high for Invisalign volume in our smaller expansion markets in Thailand and India which are still very early in their development and adoption cycle. Now turning to the teen market, in Q2, 78,400 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 13.6% sequentially and 42.1% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions, led by North American orthodontists. Q2 was a seventh consecutive quarter that Invisalign teenage patient volumes grew faster than adults reflecting a shift toward younger teens and tweens. For Q2, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North American Orthos increased 30% and international doctors were up 73%. One of the key drivers behind our strong growth is continued product innovation. On July 1, we launched a new Invisalign Go product with a more user-friendly iTero digital chairside experience and greater flexibility to treat a wider range of mild to moderate cases such as crowded or gap teeth that require teeth straightening prior to restorative treatments. Invisalign Go also incorporates new data-driven clinical protocols for predictable tooth movement and automated case assessments which will make it easier for dentists to tailor the treatments and plans to the individual needs of each patient. We're very excited about the potential for Invisalign Go to help accelerate adoption among GP dentists worldwide. As we aim to create even greater preference for Invisalign treatment from doctors and consumers alike, especially in the teen market, a key factor is expanding clinically applicability of the Invisalign system in order to treat more complex cases. The launch of Mandibular Advancement feature last year has continued to ramp up and help drive adoption of Invisalign treatment among teenage patients in EMEA and APAC. Mandibular Advancement feature is pending FDA approval in the U.S. and we continue to expect approval in the second half of this year. On July 1, we began offering Invisalign First, designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients' malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of eruption dentition and predictable dental arch expansion. While it's only been a few weeks, the initial response to Invisalign First has been very positive and excitement among top Invisalign doctors is rising and we're on a path to reach 1,000 Invisalign First cases across all regions in the first month alone. The $100 million investment we make each year in consumer marketing programs include TV, digital, social media, PR, event marketing and more recently, our Concierge service and Invisalign store pilot. Our goals are to make the Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. In Q2, we continue to successfully leverage the Made to Move campaign we kicked off last year, which is our first fully integrated global consumer marketing campaign launched across all major markets. We also continued to build on regional programs like Teen and Mom campaign in North America and launched an entirely new initiative in APAC called Asian Smile in May. We have included the key indicators from our consumer marketing programs in the Q2 earnings slides posted on our website, so I won't go through them on this call. Needless to say, all metrics for tracking consumer interest are up with strong growth in Invisalign website visitors across APAC and opt-ins in the Americas region, which captures consumers who take an action on our website and give us permission to contact them directly. Our Smile Concierge program that we launched over a year ago is continuing to help more consumers start Invisalign treatment by shortening their research cycle and connecting them with an active Invisalign doctor. Year-to-date we scheduled over 30,000 Invisalign consultations in the U.S. which equates to connecting hundreds of consumers to Invisalign doctors every day. Concierge service is also equipping us with valuable consumer insights that help our doctors better engage with consumers in their practices and online. It's been very exciting to see how Invisalign doctors are working to reflect these insights and connect more effectively with the consumers that we send them every day. The Smile Concierge service is also expanding outside the U.S. with teams in Singapore, Brazil, Australia, and most recently the UK. And while it's still early, each of these countries are seeing great initial traction and helping more consumers become Invisalign patients. Sole purpose of the Invisalign store is to connect new potential patients with Invisalign doctors in their offices by raising awareness of Invisalign treatment and removing some common barriers for consumers to get started. Our experience with the stores continues to evolve and grow and we are learning a lot from our consumers and participating doctors. To-date, the Invisalign stores have contributed to a significant influx of consumer interest in the San Jose and San Francisco orthodontic marketplace. Over 8,000 consumers have visited our Align (sic) [Invisalign] stores. The average participating doctor in the store network has received dozens of scanned consumers, with the top providers easily receiving over 150 consumers. Many doctors have said the Invisalign stores have far surpassed their top referral sources. Earlier this month, we opened two new Invisalign stores in Bethesda, Maryland and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. And we're excited to see the impact these pilots will have on the participating Invisalign practices in the area. We look forward to continuing to learn more from these pilot locations and we'll update you on our progress throughout the remainder of the year. In Q2, iTero revenues were up 10.9% sequentially as we saw benefit from the launch of iTero Element 2 and Element Flex, as well as the first commercial shipments of Element scanners in China. In April, we received China FDA approval to sell iTero Element in China. And, today, we announced that we have received regulatory approval to manufacture iTero Element in our new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China. Year-over-year Q2 scanner revenues were up 60.9%, reflecting very strong growth across all regions and reflects the continued trend toward an end-to-end digital workflow starting with an iTero scanner on the front-end. Not only do Invisalign doctors with an iTero scanner have notably higher utilization rates than non-iTero doctors, but it also enables greater efficiency between precision dentistry and higher overall customer experience and satisfaction. Our dental service organizations or DSO partners have recognized the strategic fit of the iTero scanners and are adopting the platform across their business. In Q2, Heartland Dental continued to rollout iTero scanners across their U.S. supported locations and plan to have scanners in 90% of supported offices by the end of the year. Similarly, Aspen Dental will begin to rollout iTero scanners to their customer base over the next two quarters beginning in Q3. Use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impression continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q2, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to a record 69.3%, up from 67.3% in Q1. International scans increased 47.3%, up from 43.2% in Q1. Finally, in the Doctor-Directed at Home Channel, Align is a third-party supplier to SmileDirectClub or SDC. We manufacture a portion of SDC aligners which are non-Invisalign clear aligners. For Q2, shipments to SDC were up sequentially and higher than expected. In April, SDC filed a complaint alleging that the launch and operation of Align's Invisalign Store Pilot program constitutes a breach of non-compete provisions applicable to the members of SDC Financial LLC, including Align. On June 29, 2018, the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, denied SDC's Entities' request for temporary injunction to prevent us from opening additional Invisalign stores. As you heard earlier, we will continue to open additional Invisalign stores as part of our pilot program designed to connect consumers interested in Invisalign treatment with Invisalign-trained doctors in their offices. We continue to dispute the allegations that we have breached our obligations to the SDC Entities under applicable law and will oppose any with a vigorous defend ourselves in the arbitration proceedings currently scheduled for December 2018. As it relates the SDC, we believe working with them was a way to influence and shape the evolving consumer market for clear aligners. Our objective was and still is to reach consumers who would not otherwise consider orthodontic treatment and connect them with Invisalign doctors in their offices. Our relationship with SDC has not worked out as expected. We have not been able to impact the decision-making process at SDC we had hoped and transfer the out-of-scope patients to an Invisalign doctor's office has not scaled as we had hoped. We do not anticipate renewing our supply agreement with SDC when it expires in 2019. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total company revenue for the second quarter was a record $490.3 million, up 12.2% from the prior quarter and up 37.5% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth was favorable in all regions. Clear Aligner revenue of $433.2 (sic) [$433.3] (16:21) million was up 12.4% sequentially on higher than expected volume. Year-over-year Clear Aligner revenue growth of 35% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies and increased Invisalign ASPs. Q2 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially approximately $5 from Q1 to $1,315, reflecting increased secondary revenue and favorable price (sic) [product] (16:50) mix, partially offset by unfavorable FX and sales promotions. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 Invisalign ASPs were up approximately $30, reflecting favorable FX, price increases, and product mix, partially offset by sales promotions and deferrals related to additional aligners. For the second quarter, total Invisalign shipments of 302.7 thousand cases were up 11.2% sequentially and up 30.5% year-over-year, driven by growth across all regions. For Americas orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up 9% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. For Americas GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 8.6% sequentially and up 18.2% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 14.9% sequentially and up 45.4% year-over-year. Our Scanner & Services revenue for the second quarter was $57 million, up 10.9% sequentially due to increased ASP benefiting from Element 2 and Element Flex product launches and the first Elements shipped into China. Year-over-year revenue was up 60.9%, primarily due to higher volume, product mix, and higher scanner ASPs. Moving onto gross margin, second quarter overall gross margin was 74.6%, down 0.3 points sequentially and down 1.4 points year-over-year. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 76.5%, down 0.5 points sequentially, primarily due to costs from the regional expansion of our manufacturing operation and increased aligners per case. Clear Aligner gross margin was down 1.6 points year-over-year, primarily due to regional expansion of our manufacturing activities and increased aligners per case, partially offset by higher worldwide ASPs. Scanner gross margin for the second quarter was 59.6%, up 0.4 points sequentially due to higher scanner ASPs, partially offset by higher production variances and freight cost. Scanner gross margins were up 2.9 points year-over-year primarily due to higher scanner ASPs along with increased manufacturing efficiencies. Q2 operating expenses were $242.9 million, up sequentially 6% and up 29.6% year-over-year. The increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in our go-to-market activities, including higher advertising spending, geographic expansion, as well as increased compensation related to expenses due to higher head count. Our second quarter operating income was $122.7 million, up 25% sequentially and up 46.8% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating margin was 25%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 1.6 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin is primarily due to volume leverage and operating expense efficiencies. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating margin primarily reflects leveraged operating expenses on higher revenues from both Clear Aligner and Scanner & Services, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. With regards to the second quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 6.6%, which includes the impact of $16.6 million in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.30, up $0.13 sequentially and up $0.45 compared to the prior year. Moving onto the balance sheet. As of the second quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $720.7 million. This compared to $673 million at the end of Q1, an increase of approximately $47.7 million, primarily due to increased collections and working capital improvements. Of our $720.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, $338.1 million was held in the U.S. and $382.6 million was held by our international entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $374.4 million, up approximately 3.6% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, or DSOs, was 68 days, down 6 days sequentially and down 6 days from 74 days in Q2 last year. Our Q2 DSO is down sequentially as a result of improvements in both collections and AR aging. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $57.7 million, primarily related to increased aligner capacity and facilities. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $139.8 million, up $29.3 million compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $82.1 million. During the second quarter, we also announced a new $600 million stock buyback authorization. As of June 30, 2018, we have $100 million remaining under the April 2016 repurchase program that we expect to utilize during the remainder of 2018. With that, let's turn to our Q3 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. We expect our international business to grow on a sequential basis as the APAC market is going into their strong teen season, offset somewhat by EMEA market going into their summer seasonality. For Americas, we expect North America to grow on strong teen demand, offset somewhat by seasonally slower adult season. LATAM will be flat on a sequential basis due to their summer holiday. We started selling iTero Element in China in Q2 of 2018. Additionally, Align has been effectively growing its iTero business in the North America DSO market. We expect a sequential increase in iTero units recognized as a result of these go-to-market activities. We continue to expect SmileDirectClub volume to be minimal in the third quarter. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 302,000 to 307,000 cases, up approximately 28% to 30% over the same period a year ago. We expect Q3 revenues to be in the range of $493 million to $503 million, an increase of approximately 28% to 31% year-over-year. We expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 74% to 74.4%, reflecting higher expenses as we regionalize our treatment planning and manufacturing operations, partially offset by higher ASPs. We expect Q3 operating expenses to be in the range of $245 million to $249 million, up on a sequential basis to reflect our continued investment in go-to-market activities. Q3 operating margins should be in the range of 24.2% to 24.9%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 21%. We expect approximately $1.5 million equity loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.6 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q3 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.18. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q3 to be approximately $60 million to $65 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $10 million to $11 million. Now let me turn to our view of 2018. Based on the momentum in our business to-date and our planned investments for the remainder of the year, we now anticipate 2018 total revenue growth rate to be above our long-term model and in the low to mid-30s. We expect Invisalign revenue and volume to be in the low 30s. Notwithstanding continued investments in our strategic growth drivers, we expect operating margin for the full year to be slightly up from 2017 operating margin of 24%. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, John, and thanks to those of you for joining our call today. 2018 is shaping up to be a very good year for Align, which reflects the continued execution of our four strategic goals and growth drivers that we focus on driving international expansion; increasing orthodontist utilization of Invisalign, especially with teenagers; enabling GP dentists to treat or refer more Invisalign cases; and generating consumer demand for Invisalign treatment for millions of people worldwide. We are pleased to see continued momentum across all of our regions and customer channels and believe that the investments we are making will continue to drive our growth well above the underlying industry. There is still a lot of work to be done to fully optimize the enormous market potential, but we remain steadfast in our vision to bring clear aligner orthodontics to the masses through our partnership with Invisalign doctors. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator, and we'll open the call up to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Two questions. Maybe the first one just on the guidance, certainly solid 3Q guidance, but curious if you can talk about at a high level what that allows for if anything from the incremental competition? In other words, you guys always seem to be a bit conservative on the guide. Are you even leaving a bit more wiggle room due to the unknown uptake around SureSmile and Clarity? And maybe just as a follow-on to that one, what if anything, Joe, have you heard about these offerings over the past few months since the ortho show? And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Jon. This is John. I'll start with the first part of your question. We guide like we always guide taking the best information that we have. No change in terms of how we've taken this guidance. So we factor in many different factors into our forecast and this is no different from a guidance standpoint. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Jon. And from a competitive standpoint, there's nothing really different than what we saw from an AAO standpoint. I mean, obviously, you saw the Clarity product from Ormco that came out in Australia here recently. From what we see, there's again \u2013 it's just in line with other offerings that we see out there. And we'll take a stronger beat on that in the future. But right now I wouldn't say we have changed in any way our assessment of the competition that we saw at the AAO. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Helpful. And then the follow up, I'm going to put you a little bit on the gross margin trend. So, I know the long-term of 73% to 78% appears unchanged but the 2Q Invisalign gross margin is 76.5%. In my model, it's one of the lowest in the past handful of years. And guys maybe if we can talk about how that trends over the next 12 months. You talked about some of the deterioration being attributable to globalizing the supply chain. So do we think about, hey, as volumes start to go through those sites in coming quarters, maybe we see the GM specific to Invisalign stabilize and maybe even possibly reverse that trend? Thanks. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: That's right, Jon. As we're investing and globalizing, we think it's a long-term strategic importance to us. We'll see some of those investments. But as we add capacity and as we add production in those facilities, we'll see some improvement. And you also have to remember too we had a lot of \u2013 from a mix standpoint a lot of iTero in Q2. So the Q2 iTero affects us from a gross margin standpoint. But, as you know, it's a part of our long-term strategy and important for us from a growth standpoint. Operator : Thank you. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Jon. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Jon. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just a few on the Aspen deal and the DSO opportunity, more broadly. I guess, maybe, Joe, or John, could you share how this deal came about? And, more importantly, would you be willing to share anything around any economic structure around the arrangement, if there's any kind of commitments or targets with Aspen? And then, Joe, if I heard you correctly I think you said that Heartland expects to have 90% of their practices within iTero by the end of the year. Curious if you'd maybe be willing to share how the Invisalign growth or uptake has tracked at Heartland as we think about that as a proxy for Aspen? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. First, on the Aspen deal and the Heartland deal, just from a high level standpoint is I think you know we've had a really strong GP focus in this business. But it's difficult at times to have an individual just focus on accounts and to drive the kind of penetration in the marketplace that we want. We find that DSOs are great partners for us in the sense of their ability to be able to spread what we want to do with our digital workflow and with our aligners across their base. And so, Heartland and Aspen both have been very open in the sense of working with us and frontloading their businesses with iTero that will allow them to \u2013 give them a very strong position in clear aligners. And so that's \u2013 it's just right in line with our GP strategy and it allows us to be able to multiply that strategy across a number of different locations with the DSOs that really help us. We've been working with Heartland for a while on clear aligners and their uptake of iTero scanners have been great. Our growth with Heartland has really been terrific. And they've been able to translate it across their organizations well. We haven't shared a whole lot of numbers in the sense of how that's going and we won't. That's how we want to handle that internally and how Heartland wants to handle that internally, too. But we're excited about the development. We think it's a way for us to be able to \u2013 it's a force multiplier for us in the sense of getting Align out there and getting it in front of a lot of customers. And iTero is still critical from a digital workflow standpoint to make it really productive. And at GP offices, you do that. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, no, I appreciate that, Joe. And then maybe I could just sneak one more in for John. On the 3Q EBIT margins, looks a little maybe softer than expected following a relatively strong 2Q on the EBIT margin line. And so just was wondering if you could talk about some of the moving pieces. I think you talked about some of the spending \u2013 areas of spend in your prepared remarks. So maybe just what informs that 3Q EBIT guide? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: I mean I think when we look at \u2013 as was noted earlier, we are investing globally to try to \u2013 as we regionalize some of our manufacturing and treatment clients, so there's some costs associated with that. We saw that in the second quarter. Some of that will continue into the third quarter. But we'll also see from an investment standpoint, from an operating expenditure standpoint, it's balanced. The high end of our guide is 24.9%, which is pretty consistent to what we saw in Q2. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Suzie Yoon - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. This is Suzie Yoon on for Elizabeth. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another nice quarter. Looks like total utilization was up nicely in the quarter. Could you just talk about some of the factors that drove the uptick in North America? And then a quick follow-up. Given your findings from the stores so far, how are you thinking about the future store plans? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: As far as the strong uptick, internationally, APAC, EMEA, but also North America. I'd say a lot of what you can see the growth from \u2013 there's good growth from an orthodontic standpoint and a lot of that is a teen marketplace. And I think you've known from previous calls, Suzie, we focused a lot on teens. And that's a really important focus for us because that's a majority of what we see in the orthodontic marketplace is the teen piece. So just seeing further evidence of our ability to be able to go after that marketplace. We're excited about the teen first launch we put in place. It allows you to do Phase 1 treatment \u2013 dental treatment on teens. And we have a good start, like we talked about, almost 1,000 starts (35:04) for the month. So it just reflects overall momentum that we continue to have that you've seen in other quarters too. From a store standpoint, we just opened up two stores, one in Maryland and one in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. We'll open up some more stores this year. I think we're doing much better in the sense of preparing doctors of how to integrate those consumers with doctors, and also we're learning a lot in the sense of how to communicate with patients, with visualization tools and things in the store that excite them about the Invisalign treatment. And then we do the proper hands-off to the doctor's office to do that. So it's just another vector for growth for us and a continuation of our consumer interaction from an advertising standpoint and be able to monetize that with the doctor base. Suzie Yoon - Evercore Group LLC : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Joe, I just want to talk to you about North America in a little bit more detail. I mean you have posted decent growth in that business, I think, 22% case shipment growth this quarter. But over the last six quarters it's trended pretty steadily in that 20% to 25% range. And I'm kind of curious to get your perspective like what percentage of the docs in this region have already been trained? And I guess what I'm really trying to get at is what's really the key to sort of breaking out of that 20% to 25% range and accelerating that growth because it feels like we're seeing very strong growth on the ortho side? We're seeing strong growth in terms of teens, but that number seems to be flat lined in that 20% to 25% range. So can you give us a little bit more color in terms of what's going on there? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: We feel good about our North American marketplace. When you talk about North America, look at Canada and the United States. And as you mentioned and I'll reemphasize, the teen piece is going extremely well. Are we doing well with GPs also on the lighter cases as we work through that? Yeah, I'd say with the steady state of that, when you start to look at our year-over-year comparisons that's still a very strong performance from a North American standpoint. So what we're doing to continue to expand that? In the orthodontics segment, of course, we've trained probably the majority of the orthodontists out there. But obviously there's refreshes. There's new products. There's a lot of things we have to continue to reenergize that market with and educate the market as we change that. On the GP side, obviously we just talked about the DSOs and that kind of an opportunity for us too. And then we feel the stores really help with that consumer initiation and turning those consumers into patients. So overall we have momentum in that marketplace. The third quarter is always a time where you see less of a GP marketplace and a strong orthodontic marketplace. That kind of reverses in the fourth quarter and so you will see in our third quarter piece we have a big number in there for teens on the ortho side to help that growth number. Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And maybe just one quick follow-up on the DSOs. What percentage of the North American market would you say is now represented by DSOs? And any other contracts above Heartland and Aspen sort of worth calling out? And what I'm really also trying to understand is, are these GPOs or DSOs rather \u2013 are they just replacing the existing technology they have or are they using iTero to sort of augment maybe what they already have? Thanks and I'll stop there. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I think just to start with your last question. The iTero is new to their office in the sense it's not an augmentation or replacement of equipment they currently have. It's more of a commitment to the DSOs for just the whole idea of digital dentistry. And obviously there's a different workflow that you have inside GPs and you have on orthos. And we've been able to more and more make sure that we have that kind of workflow capability within iTero and we continue to work with that so we can be a great tool for GPs in that sense. The DSOs \u2013 when you say what percentage of the market in North America, we normally quote 15% to 20%. That number kind of varies around depending on what you call a DSO and what you don't. So, the upper number to use on that is 20% and the other one is 15%. I hope I've answered the question. Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Yep. That's fine. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, team. How are things? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Steve. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Steve. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: The first question is on China. So when I think about the drivers for this year that are incremental, clearly the China iTero launch is a big one. I wonder if you could dive in a little bit on how you think about the customer there. Maybe, more specifically, are these people who had access to Intraoral scanners and you're going through a swap process where you give them a better mousetrap? Or are these customers where they were really using PVS or is it somewhere in between? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Steve, it's amazing. I mean it's all PVS. This is not replacing scanners that are over there. So it's not a swap. So if you would see our offices in China at any point in time you just see rooms full of PVS boxes that would previously go to Mexico. So those VPNs that (40:22) we're seeing the number of digital scans come out of China just start to skyrocket for us. John and I were going over that a couple days ago on a trip. So, it's a new foundation. This just is incredible. I've been doing business in China now for over 20 years and I'm always amazed about the country's ability to target a new technology and just integrate it so quickly into the workflow. Just kind of \u2013 it's the fastest uptake in new technology in any country I've ever seen in the last 20 years. I saw that in the medical equipment business too. You have to train the marketplace. You have to get them ready. You have to be ready to service it well. There's a lot of just foundational infrastructure things you have to put in place there to be successful and not to frustrate them. But once that's in place and you know what to do, the uptake is amazing. And that's what we're seeing right now. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's what I was looking for. And then, just to follow-up. I mean you've given us between China and some of the DSO dynamics reasons to think that the iTero trajectory this year remains really, really strong, certainly beating our numbers. Should we think about the first half as a reasonable barometer for iTero growth for the second half or are there other puts and takes that we ought to factor into the model? Thanks so much. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I think, Steve, you're right to call these out. I would call them anomalies in the sense of not \u2013 I mean there's going to be great uptake in China. This is the initial uptake in China. We expect more going forward. On the DSO side, I mean, Heartland and Aspen, two of the biggest DSOs going. So, I wouldn't necessarily draw a line through this one and continue to draw it through the rest of the year. But we are having great success with iTero. You, as much as anybody, know how important that is from a standpoint of having an incredible foundation in place to be able to drive more Invisalign. And so you're seeing these big successes. We have little ones too. But these are big penetration moves and I wouldn't necessarily say that you should take it times 2X as you go into the second half. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Really appreciate it. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Good afternoon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Joe, if you would kind of discuss the decision to manufacture iTero systems in China. Is that a cost play or a market access play? And would you expect, over some period of time, to actually shift some manufacturing to that location? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: That's actually a really good question, okay. That's a market access play. And having some experience of seeing that before, it's really important in the sense of how it's being done. And the Chinese government \u2013 those provincial governments have worked with us really well to make that work. And it's just so much easier to be able to address those Chinese regulations from a Chinese standpoint than it is, in this case, from an Israeli standpoint too. So that's why we're doing it. From a cost standpoint, this is not a cost play. I'd say expect cost to be neutral. If they are a little worse or a little better, you won't see it in our numbers in any way. So I wouldn't put it in your model. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks and a couple for John. First, any chance you could quantify the gross margin impact on the clear aligner business from the manufacturing capacity expansions? And then any pockets of inflation or material costs or freight or shipping costs that you're seeing in the business? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Nothing from a freight or material cost that is of note. It simply comes down to as we regionalize both from treatment planning as well as manufacturing going live in China from a manufacturing standpoint in Q4. There's start-up costs. You're adding that facility. You're training workers. You're getting that manufacturing up and running. And we saw some of that in Q2. We will see some of that in Q3. And then as we grow and as we get more volume out of those facilities, you see some normalize again. So, it's short-term. It's something that we've expected. And then once we're fully up and running, we get the benefits of being local, faster to our customers. We reduce freight costs. There's a lot of other offsets that we see, but we have to get that facility up and running and that will be in Q4. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. Thanks. On your retail store pilot, I understand it's still early days here, but you gave some preliminary metrics at your Investor Day as it relates to the sell-through traction with the retail stores and with, I guess, the majority of the scanned patient scheduling appointments after visiting. I guess I'm curious, do you have an update on any of these metrics and if there's a conversion rate at all that you could speak to into actual Invisalign customers? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks for the question and thanks for the interest. I think, at this point in time, we gave you as much as we wanted to give you at the Investors Meeting. We still call these pilot stores and they are. We're making a lot of iterations as we go through that. But we feel good about the progress. As we get more stores out there and we move this thing more firmly as our stores and not call them pilots, and I'd say as we move into next year we'll be more open with you in the sense of the close rates, number of patients going through. But, as I mentioned on our announcement, we have about 8,000 patients that have gone through those stores already. And then there's varying conversion rates. But, again, not ready to share that yet. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Totally fair. On the DSO relationships, I guess can you speak to how the conversation and the sales cycle had evolved, I guess, at Aspen and potentially with other DSOs and the opportunity there. Is there any sort of new approach that you're taking from a DSO perspective in that sales process? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: We take a broad approach to both of them. These are very good businesses. They're extremely successful what I call businesses too because they operate in a business sense. So we're able to, I think, communicate well in a broad sense what we can bring to the practice and how we can help to drive growth throughout. I mean, obviously, DSOs \u2013 one of the keys are going to be in-store sales. And being able to have an iTero inside that store and be able to drive more aligner sales, Invisalign sales through those is a big help. So, it's just we have organized within the business to be able to work with DSOs much better, bring the resources in place and we put those things in place under Frank Quinn and North American organization over the last 18 months. He's done a terrific job. So, it's not just us. It's the DSOs reaching out for us too. These are good partnerships that are well understood and we're excited about both of them and we feel they'll be successful. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please proceed. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First one on just competition. Joe, is there anything since some of the competitors launched back in May that you're hearing in terms of how they're approaching their customers there and potentially your customer bases with respect to trialing or getting some initial kind of traction in the field or has it been relatively kind of quiet? And then with respect to the guidance question and competition is there anything at all factored into your 2018 growth outlook, including the revised one, any kind of impact from competition? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say from a competitive standpoint what we see in the marketplace is kind of what you expect. I'd say it's a cautious approach from a competition standpoint. I'd call \u2013 if you take a look at 3M, they more like slipstream into the marketplace behind their wires and brackets business and try to get a few uptakes. We'll be on road this week in North America just out talking to many customers, most of the EMC staff. And the feedback that we get is they're being contacted, but there's nothing really that's different from what was the output from the AAO in that piece. And so there's some interest and curiosity I'd say from a customer base, but there's not a momentum piece or anything that we are adjusting the business around right now. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: And I would say, Rich, as we guide and as we forecast we're always looking at what's happening in the market, products that are coming, what's happening with competition. So that's in our way that we look at our guidance and what we expect to see coming. So when we look at our revenue that we talk to for 2018 to low to mid-30s that is inclusive of what we see from a competitive standpoint. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up. You're still guiding to Mandibular Advancement FDA approval in the back half of 2018. Anything that occurred intra quarter to kind of give you the confidence to reiterate that timeline? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: It's an old saying no news on the FDA is good news. So we're still looking at the fourth quarter for this year. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, just for me, given that you mentioned that you do not plan to renew your current agreement with SmileDirectClub next year, just curious kind of thinking out loud about this. Would you still consider partnering with other players in that direct market? Or is it more likely you'll just kind of abandon any partnerships, maybe just try your best on your own to just capture any volume in that direct market through your various initiatives? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I don't have any interest from a manufacturing standpoint of supporting other, what we call, direct to consumer kind of aligner companies. We're going to run our play in a sense of our stores and how we work with our doctor partners. We feel strongly that a doctor's office approach is a great approach to take, given the seriousness of moving teeth. And that's the vector we're pursuing in this business. And so it'd be kind of disingenuine is after our agreement with SDC runs out that we go find someone else to supply aligners to. We have no interest in that from a strategic standpoint at all. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Congrats on the quarter. Real quick one for Joe and then one for John. For the second half outlook and for the fiscal year, I noticed you bumped up the revenue guide incrementally. Is there anything there in terms of that you're seeing from the new products, whether it's Mandibular Advancement internationally, or from the new iTero launches, or Invisalign First that's giving you a little bit more confidence with how that's started? Or is it more let's call it the legacy business that you're just seeing stability in? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Mike, this is John. I think it's a combination. I think we're seeing, as we've seen in the last couple quarters here, great growth across our legacy business. We're driving great teenage growth. We have a lot of momentum internationally, and we're seeing that. But then as we've seen we've seen great iTero volume as well. So, the DSO business that we've talked about being able to have a release in China, so that in the second quarter we expect that to continue into the second half. So there's a lot of momentum given our existing business, but we have either new products on iTero with the various products that we have, Flex and iTero, too, and then also some of the expansion that we're doing in China and other places. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up on a previous question specifically about iTero in China. You mentioned that right now or previously it was all predominantly PVS. How quickly do you see that market evolving? And in five years can you get similar rates of digital submission as you get in North America or at least elsewhere internationally? Or how long of a timeframe is it going to take to ramp that up? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: As I talked about in the last call, these ramp-up times in China will be faster than they were in the Western world. We know that. The intervening variable in that equation is we're signing up more and more doctors in China, not just orthodontists but GPs. And so those could entitle more PVS impressions, too. So if we look at the current kind of installed base of docs and who submits through that, I feel very confident you'll see this ramped up really dramatically in the next two to three years. But outside of that we might have just other doctors who maybe not buy an iTero but still want to submit for that could come into the equation. And it's just hard to project what that could be. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. And then one really quick one, the 5 points of FX tail in the first quarter. Can you quantify? I'm sure it was down small in 2Q. But how much was it? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Actually 2Q was about 4%. So on a year-over-year basis, we saw a little bit less FX benefit on a year-over-year basis than the first quarter but still at 4%. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And the same one-third flow through to the bottom line? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: That's right. We saw, actually, about two-thirds flow through to the bottom line. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just a couple cleanup questions here. Joe, I didn't hear you say anything about the 19% equity stake with SDC. Is there any change to that once you end the supply agreement at the end of 2019? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I don't know, honestly, Jeff. I'd say we still own that. We'll have to find a way to reconcile that. But that's \u2013 after we get our operational conflict out of the way I think that will be addressed. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough and then on the store concept or the Pilot Store, sorry. How many more are you thinking about opening this year? And, I guess, John, maybe you can walk us through. There's obviously expenses involved in opening those stores. I'd assume maybe that's a little bit of some of the EBIT questions that have been on the call today, as well. But I also hear that you guys are getting full list price on those cases or at least very good pricing on those cases. So, I would assume there's a breakeven here that's pretty quick on these stores. So any comments or kind of color you can provide on that would be helpful. Thanks. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Jeff, this is John. Yes, you're right. Stores \u2013 we've got four now. By the end of the year, we'll have 10 stores or so. We continue to find places that are very strategic to us, the right place to turn those consumers into patients through our doctor's offices. There's expenses related to start-up. There's also some targeted marketing that we do in the area. But don't think of it all as incremental. Think of it as we're spending money in certain places on some of the marketing and advertising. And instead of going as maybe as broad, we can go a little bit more targeted to be able to try to get that consumer conversion. So when we look at the second half and what we've guided for the year, we've now said that we expect to be up in operating margins from 2014. So there's no flat anymore. So, with these investments that we're making, we still think that they're ultimately incremental to our business and a key part of our strategy. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. See you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Joe, I don't think you've mentioned the financing pilot. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on that? And if you're considering taking it more broad, what the timing might be? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I'll turn you over to my expert on the financing. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, John. This is John. So, on financing, it's really moved from a pilot to \u2013 it's fully released now. And what it is is a tool that we have with our sales team as well as working with our doctors to be able to give patients options in terms of financing, so they can do some things where they can look to come up with financing over a period of time. It's beneficial to the doctor. It's beneficial for the patients. Ultimately, we get paid faster. So there's a lot of wins. But really what we're trying to do is make it easier for those end customers, those end patients to be able to come up with financing to be able to get them into treatment and we think it's a benefit to everybody in this value chain to be able to get a higher conversion. So it's gone from pilot to full release. And we're actively working with doctors and potential patients to get the understanding of this. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then just one more follow-up, another DSO question. I think there's maybe 50 of size in the U.S., at least that's my understanding. How many of those would you say you've got relationships with at this point? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, I'd say we probably have contact with over 75% of them. I wouldn't say we have a relationship to the degree we have with Aspen and Heartland in that sense, John. So obviously DSOs are on our list in a sense to work with (58:32) and we put together an organization to do that. But right now we're really focused on the agreements we've put in place and we want to make sure that we really work and execute well on these. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. You're welcome, John. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our Q&A session. Allow me to hand the floor back over for closing remarks. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact our Investor Relations department. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on our call today. I'll provide some highlights on the quarter and then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. I'm pleased to report third quarter results with revenue and earnings above our outlook, driven by higher-than-expected Invisalign volume, offset somewhat by lower ASPs and foreign exchange. We also had another record quarter for iTero scanner business. Q3 Invisalign volume increased 5.5% sequentially and up 35.3% year-over-year, reflecting strength across regions and customer channels as well as strong growth from both teen and adult patients. From a product perspective, we saw strength across the Invisalign portfolio, with growth from both the comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, reflecting acceleration in the non-comprehensive category related to expansion of our product portfolio, as well as new sales programs and promotions intended to increase adoption and utilization. We also saw continued strength from international regions, especially Asia-Pacific, which is our second largest region after the Americas in Q3. Finally, during Q3, we trained another record 4,930 doctors, driven by APAC and Latin America, including Invisalign Go doctors, which represent continued expansion of our customer base, especially GP dentists. And Invisalign utilization increased overall to 6.1 cases per doctor, including another record for NA orthodontists. Overall, while I'm pleased with the strong volume growth that we achieved this quarter, there were a couple of unexpected factors that impacted our results. In Q3, Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially due to a combination of promotional programs, unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift, partially offset by price increases across all regions. John will provide more details on this in his commentary. Now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results and let's start with the results of our America region. For the Americas, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 5.1% sequentially and 29.1% year-over-year, reflecting better-than-expected volume in both our orthodontist and GP dentist channels, driven by strong teenage case volume from orthodontists and adult patient growth across both customer channels. For the Americas region, year-over-year growth was led by orthos, with another record quarter for North American ortho utilization at 17.4 cases per doctor. Q3 Invisalign utilization for North American GP dentists was up year-over-year at 3.5 cases per doctor, reflecting continued expansion of the GP customer base. We also saw strong volume growth from the dental service organizations or DSOs channel, which increased over 40% year-over-year in Q3. In Q3, we trained over 2,000 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region, of which 560 were in Latin America alone, primarily Brazil. As the world's second largest market for cosmetic procedures, Brazil is estimated to have more than 1 million new orthodontic case starts each year. In September, we hosted a grand opening event at our new office in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil with local doctors to thank them for their ongoing support in helping to build the clear aligner market in Brazil through Invisalign practices. We also hosted the grand opening of our newest facilities in Costa Rica located at San Antonio business center, with plans to open another multimillion-dollar facility located at La Lima later this year. The new facilities will eventually house all of our Costa Rica employees, provide space to accommodate our long-term growth. For international doctors, Q3 was another good quarter with Invisalign case volumes up 6.2% sequentially, reflecting a very strong quarter for APAC, offset by EMEA's seasonality, especially in Southern Europe markets which typically have extended summer holidays. Year-over-year volume growth of 45.6% for international reflects increased utilization and continued expansion of our customer base. In APAC, Q3 was a strong quarter with Invisalign volumes up 56.4% year-over-year, with record shipments for all country markets except Korea. Q3 results reflect record utilization for APAC driven by strong growth from teenage patients as well as growth in the GP dentists channel up 83.2% compared to last year. During Q3, we trained 1,730 new doctors in APAC, of which 310 were iGo doctors. We also held several clinical education events across APAC designed to help increase doctor's confidence in and the adoption of Invisalign treatment, including how critical the iTero scanner is to practice growth. In China, we hosted the China Orthodontic Society, or COS, annual meeting with over 1,000 doctors. In Japan, we held an Invisalign Forum with clinical speakers focused on teen treatment, including Invisalign First cases, adding iTero to their practice and Invisalign G6 innovation. In ANZ, we launched Invisalign First clinical education events and practice marketing activity and received positive feedback with great uptake of Invisalign First cases. In EMEA, Q3 was down sequentially due to expected seasonality up to 36.2% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth including the teen segment, which was up over 60% from the prior year. Year-over-year we saw strength across our core markets led by France, Iberia and the UK, as well as our key expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe. We're also continuing to help expand the market for clear aligner treatment with approximately 1,100 newly trained doctors in EMEA, which include 485 iGo trained GP dentists. In Q3, we hosted a number of doctor-centered peer-to-peer events, including our first GP Growth Forum in Copenhagen. We also hosted the grand opening of our new treatment planning facility in Madrid, Spain, which serves the Iberia market. Our Madrid facility aims to increase our commitment to Invisalign trained doctors in Spain and Portugal, and will play a key role in our strategy to be closer to our customers and support them in digital treatment planning. In October, we hosted our first MEA or Middle East and Africa Forum in Dubai, highlighting the growth of the MEA orthodontic market, as well as showcasing our latest advances in digital dentistry that provides practice growth opportunities for dentists. Now, turning to the teen segment. In Q3, 98,500 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 25.6% sequentially and 41.1% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions, led by North American orthodontists. Q3 was the eighth consecutive quarter that Invisalign teen patient volumes grew faster than adults, reflecting a continued shift toward younger teens and tweens. The Q3 year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North American orthos increased 32.8% and international doctors were up 60.9%. In Q3, we launched an expanded Invisalign portfolio including Invisalign First for Phase 1 treatment of young patients age six and up. On July 1, we began offering Invisalign First to doctors in North America, EMEA, and ANZ and Japan. We shipped almost 2,000 cases to over 600 doctors during Q3. Half of the cases were in North America, and nearly 60% of the Invisalign First patients were 8 or 9 years old. The Phase 1 segment of the market is really important for us because it's a large piece of the overall orthodontic cases. But it will also help us gain share in the teenage segment. The Invisalign Experience program is a comprehensive way of describing all of Align's activities to engage consumers or potential patients through brand experiences in consumer-friendly settings and environments, including busy mall and lifestyle centers. We started out calling these locations stores. We've realized this is confusing and concerning to some of our doctor customers. We're not selling Invisalign treatment to consumers in these locations. Doctors have always been essential to Invisalign treatment, and a doctor's prescription based on an in-person examination remains the only way that Invisalign treatment can be delivered to a patient, even if a consumer learns about the Invisalign brand in new or different ways. In late 2017, we launched the Invisalign store pilot program to create and test interactive Invisalign brand experiences in high traffic retail locations. Our goal was to educate and engage consumers who might be interested in treatment but aren't showing up as typical consults in offices, and get them connected with an Invisalign doctor of their choice. Based on what we have learned in last year and across the first four locations in this program, we are expanding this program and will open eight additional Invisalign Experience locations in the fourth quarter. The first four Invisalign Experience locations have shown great progress since opening and have contributed to a significant influx of consumer interest in the orthodontic marketplace surrounding each location. Key performance metrics suggest that the addition of an Invisalign Experience location can have a significant positive impact or halo effect on overall Invisalign patient growth in the surrounding area, even among doctors that are not directly participating in the Invisalign Experience program network. It's a new way of creating awareness for brand, capturing someone else's attention when they're not even thinking about straightening their teeth, and it benefits all Invisalign practices in the market. In Q4, under the Invisalign Experience umbrella, we're launching a major test of the program in New York City with a significant investment in media to reinforce the importance of doctor-led Invisalign treatment and a premium consumer experience to drive qualified consumers to partner doctor practices. On November 5, we will launch a targeted media campaign in New York to take advantage of growing interest in the clear aligner category to capture and direct consumers to Invisalign-branded locations and pilot practices. This test includes an Invisalign-branded kiosk at the Oculus Center on November 17 as part of the Holiday Market. Number two, piloting Invisalign Experience-branded doctor practices designed to attract prospective patients, connect them with the Invisalign brand and an Invisalign practice for treatment. And three, empower doctors with new tools, services and support to elevate the patient experience, amplify the message and grow their practice. We're very excited about this program along with several other media campaigns kicking off in Q4 to put doctors at the center of everything we do. We've learned a lot from the Invisalign Experience locations and the doctors who have worked with us in the network to-date. We're applying what we have learned and are constantly working to make the Invisalign Experience program better for consumers and better for the practices who opt-in to receive those leads. One of the things we've learned from this and other initiatives is that a lot of Invisalign doctors want to do more in their own markets to connect with new consumers. They want to create an Invisalign Experience in practice to connect with potential patients in new ways and want to leverage the total Invisalign iTero digital experience to make starting treatment easier and more convenient for them. We want to help them to do just that, so under the Invisalign Experience program umbrella, we're working with a few doctors in select U.S. markets to explore what an Invisalign Experience looks like in wholly doctor-owned, consumer-focused environment. We're calling this pilot an Invisalign Experience branded practice and are working with participating doctors to apply some of the lessons and design elements from Invisalign Experience locations to their practices. Some of these pilots will be in markets where we have Invisalign Experience locations, but most will not. Doctor-owned Invisalign Experience practices don't complete with Align. We're all working together to reach consumers in new ways. We'll share more progress with you and details on the different ways we're partnering with doctors under the Invisalign Experience umbrella in the coming quarter. Our Smile Concierge program that we launched at the beginning of 2017 is continuing to help more consumers start Invisalign treatment by shortening their research cycle and connecting them with an active Invisalign doctor. Year-to-date, we scheduled over 74,000 Invisalign consultations in the U.S., which equates to connecting hundreds of consumers to Invisalign doctors every day, providing leads they might not otherwise have had. The Smile Concierge service has also expanded outside the United States with teams in Singapore, Brazil, Australia and the UK. And Q3 was a very strong quarter across the board for our iTero scanner and services business, with better than expected revenues which were up 37.2% sequentially and 79.1% year-over-year. Record Q3 results reflect commercialization of the iTero Element 2 and Element Flex scanners, especially for restorative GP dentists in North America. Continued rollout with DSO partners and increased sales internationally including China, we have also begun to manufacture the iTero Element. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions in place of PVS impressions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. The Q3 total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas was essentially flat at 68.8%. International scans increased 51.6% of total Invisalign cases submitted in Q3. We are very excited about the continued progress we have made with the iTero business and remain confident it will continue to help drive our overall growth and help increase adoption of Invisalign treatment. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to share this important news with you today regarding our Chief Marketing Officer or CMO, Raph Pascaud. After more than eight years with Align, Raph has made a personal decision to reduce his responsibilities and transition to a part-time position in order to spend more time with his family. As a result, we have begun an executive search for a Chief Marketing Officer, and will be working to find a replacement for Raph's marketing position over the coming months. Once we've hired a new CMO, Raph will transition his marketing responsibilities to that leader, but he will continue to lead the business development and strategy for the company. Raph will also remain on the Executive Management Committee, reporting directly to me. Raph's contributions to Align have been significant. He's held numerous leadership positions across the organization, including Head of International, Marketing, Product Portfolio and Business Development, as well as overseeing the iTero business. We're fortunate that Raph will remain directly engaged in our strategy and overall business plans and will be able to help the new CMO come up to speed quickly. Until then, nothing changes and Raph remains Align's CMO and SVP, Product Portfolio and Business Development. We're sharing this news with you today so we can openly recruit for a new CMO and so Raph can begin to develop a transition plan with his global marketing team. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenue for the third quarter was $505.3 million, up 3.1% from the prior quarter and up 31.2% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth was favorable in all regions. Clear aligner revenue of $421.1 million was down 1.4% sequentially, driven by lower ASPs as a result of higher-than-expected discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by increased volume. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 25% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies, and was partially offset by lower ASPs. As Joe mentioned earlier in his remarks, Q3 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially and year-over-year due to a combination of promotional programs, unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix, partially offset by price increases across all regions. In Q3, we offered a new product promotions designed to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment and we saw much higher-than-expected uptake on some of these promotions. In addition, at the beginning of the year, we created a more robust North America Advantage customer loyalty program, which has been very favorably received by our doctors. The new Advantage Program changed to a semi-annual discount qualification period instead of a quarterly one, with additional tiers that provide doctors with more incentive to move up the tiers by increasing their Invisalign case volume. As a result, more doctors are moving up in tiers and achieving higher overall discounts than they were under the prior program. In Q3, we also saw a shift toward lower ASP non-comprehensive products, some of which is tied to promotions and some is tied to continued progress expanding our business with GP dentists and DSOs. Specifically, Q3 ASPs were down by approximately $85 and includes $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange, and down $80 year-over-year and includes $15 of unfavorable foreign exchange. Total Q3 Invisalign shipments of 319,300 cases were up 5.5% sequentially and up 35.3% year-over-year, driven by growth in the Americas and APAC, partially offset by seasonality in EMEA. For Americas orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 8.6% sequentially and up 32.2% year-over-year. For Americas GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was down 0.3% sequentially and up 24.2% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 6.2% sequentially and up 45.6% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the third quarter was $78.2 million, up 37.2% sequentially due to volume increases in North America DSO contracts and higher volume in APAC. Year-over-year revenue was up 79.1%, primarily due to higher scanner units across regions. Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 73.6%,down 1 point sequentially and down 2.3 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 75.3%, down 1.2 points sequentially, primarily due to lower ASP described earlier. Clear aligner gross margin was down 2.6 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower ASP and regional expansion of our manufacturing activities. Scanner gross margin for the third quarter was 63.9%, up 4.4 points sequentially and up 3.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher manufacturing efficiencies. Q3 operating expenses were $246.6 million, up sequentially 1.5% and up 27.3% year-over-year. The increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in our R&D and go-to-market activities. Our third quarter operating income was $125.2 million, up 2.1% sequentially and up 26.8% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating income is primarily due to higher revenues. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating income primarily reflects leverage from operating expenses on higher revenues from both clear aligner and scanner and services. Our third quarter operating margin was 24.8%, down 0.2 points sequentially and down 0.8 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin from lower ASPs as mentioned above, offset by increased operating expense leverage. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin from ASPs and continued expansion of our regional manufacturing facilities, offset by higher operating expense leverage. With regards to the third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 19.4%, which includes a $24.7 million release of unrecognized tax benefits due to a statute lapse, partially offset by a $20.2 million charge related to non-deductible officers' compensation based on recent IRS guidance. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.24, down $0.06 sequentially and up $0.23 compared to the prior year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of the third quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $613.2 million. This compared to $720.7 million at the end of Q2, a decrease of approximately $107.5 million, primarily due to our stock repurchases during the quarter. Of our $613.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $228 million was held in the U.S. and $385.2 million was held by our international entities. Q3 accounts receivable balance was $420.3 million, up approximately 12.3% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, or DSOs, was 75 days, up 7 days sequentially and flat as of Q3 last year. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $96.3 million, down $21.8 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of pending tax refunds. Free cash flow for the third quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $42.6 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $53.7 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. During Q3 of 2018, we repurchased $150 million of our stock against our stock buyback authorizations, and have $550 million still available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program. With that, let's turn to our Q4 outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook. We expect Q4 international volume to increase sequentially from Q3, reflecting the EMEA market seasonality stronger period following summer holidays in Q3, offset somewhat by seasonally slower Q4 period in APAC as China comes off a very strong summer period. For Americas, better than expected Q3 volume was driven in part due to some promotions that have been discontinued. We expect Q4 Americas volume to increase slightly sequentially. We expect our iTero business to be flat sequentially in Q4, coming off a very strong Q3, as we continue to invest in growing the iTero business across all regions including China and ongoing rollout with DSO partners in the U.S. We continue to expect SmileDirectClub volume to be at minimal contractual levels and are anticipating a decrease sequentially from Q3. With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows : Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 330,000 to 335,000 cases, up approximately 29.4% to 31.4% year-over-year. We expect Q4 revenues to be in the range of $505 million to $515 million, an increase of approximately 20% to 22% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth for Invisalign volumes, offset by lower ASPs due primarily to ongoing promotional discounts, the effect of our new Advantage customer loyalty program, continued mix shift toward non-comprehensive products as well as foreign exchange. We expect Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 72.3% to 73%, reflecting lower margins as we begin to produce clear aligners in our new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China, where we will initially have higher fixed costs spread across very low volumes. We expect Q4 operating expenses to be in the range of $248 million to $253 million. Q4 operating margin should be in the range of 23.2% to 23.9%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 22.5%. We expect approximately $2 million equity loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 81.3 million exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q4 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.15. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q4 to be approximately $50 million to $55 million. And we expect depreciation and amortization to be $15 million to $16 million. Now let me turn to our view for the full-year 2018. Based on our Q4 guidance, we continue to expect 2018 total revenue growth rate to be above our long-term model and in the low-30s. We expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to also be in the low-30s. Taken together, we continue to expect operating margin for the full-year 2018 to be slightly up from 2017 operating margin of 24%. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, John. Overall, Q3 was another good quarter with strong growth for both the Invisalign and iTero businesses. Our performance reflects continued success in driving adoption and utilization across all region and customer channels, as well as an increased traction in new expansion markets with our DSO partners. We have a huge market opportunity ahead to connect millions of consumers with Invisalign doctors for orthodontic treatment, and whether it's through traditional routes in a doctor's office or through new consumer-friendly approaches like the Invisalign Experience program, we are committed to a doctor in the center of everything we do. Align is the best positioned company to help doctors successfully navigate the rapidly-changing dental market. We're excited to be guiding them through this digital transformation. I look forward to following up with many of you in the coming weeks at various conferences and industry meetings, including the Invisalign Ortho Summit in Las Vegas next month where approximately 2,500 doctors and their staff will spend two days sharing Invisalign and iTero best practices, one of our most important peer-to-peer clinical education events. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, Joe and John, for the question. I guess just to start on the lower ASPs, which you guys provided some details around at least the areas that impacted it. And John, if I heard you correctly, it sounds like of the $85 sequential decline, if I remove FX, it would have been more like $60, $61 sequential decline. So, of that decline, I was hoping maybe you could just break down how much of that came from promotions versus mix shift. And then I guess the follow-up would be, I don't necessarily remember you guys talking so much about the additional promotional program. So, curious if there was something in the marketplace that kind of forced you to react to put the promotions in place, or if this was something that was always planned and maybe the uptake was just greater than you thought? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Bob. This is John. On the remaining piece that's left, about half of the drop in ASPs was due to mix. It was mix shift to the lower stage products. And about the other half or $30 or so was related to those promotions. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: And Bob, it's Joe. Look, obviously on the Advantage Program and the special programs we ran for the quarter, we do this all the time. We're trying to encourage customer stickiness. We're checking out different segments of the marketplace. We do this all the time. But in this case, what happened is we incentivized the upper end of our customer segment. We did not get the engagement in the lower end that we anticipated. And so, in that sense, we will shut that thing down. We won't repeat it again. We obviously learned from it and we move on. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then I guess, Joe, just to follow-up on that then, as we think about ASPs for 4Q and then more importantly beyond 4Q, is it safe to assume that FX will be what it is but that at least the portion of the headwind from the promotion should normalize? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, that's correct. Think about it as flat, Bob. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe, John, in terms of the aligner gross margins in the quarter, can you break out the impact of the manufacturing capacity expansions relative to ASPs? And as you look into 2019, given we're kind of bouncing along the low end of your three- to five-year model here at about 73%, would it be logical to expect year-over-year expansion in terms of the aligner margins as you start to soak up some of that new manufacturing capacity expansions? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. You're right, Brandon. I mean, what we'll see initially because of the low volumes, we'll see more of that fixed cost over that low volume. So, that's a 0.5 to 1 point impact due to the manufacturing start-up. And then as we get more efficient, we should see some improvement as we go forward related to those manufacturing costs. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. And then one for Joe. The OpEx guidance for the fourth quarter implies the slowest year-over-year growth rate in a few years now. To what extent are you beginning to see perhaps some diminishing returns from incremental investments, be it feet on the Street or marketing or otherwise, perhaps in some of the more international and emerging markets? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Brandon, I think if you look at our growth, I mean our growth is above 30% right now. So we don't see any diminishing returns in that sense. Remember, we had a big third quarter when you look at our volume growth versus other years. So the normal sequential kind of iteration that we go through between third and fourth quarters, we don't really believe it's going to be as dramatic as it has been in the past. And so this doesn't reflect anything from a market standpoint. Remember, as you look at our performance overall, international market's performed extremely well, okay? We still had incredible shipments in North America from an Invisalign standpoint. We also had great iTero, too. So, primarily what we're looking at is what we have with these promotions in the sense of the ASPs driven by them and the corrections we have to make as we go into the fourth quarter. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : All right. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: All right, Brandon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Jon. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, Joe. First one, John, I think you mentioned flat scanner revs Q-over-Q and I've got to make some other assumptions. But I'm backing into around a $1,200 Invisalign ASP for 4Q 2018 based on your volume guidance. 3Q 2018 I believe was $1,230 on a worldwide basis. You mentioned some of the promotions that were run in 3Q will not be repeated. So why the continued decline on the worldwide ASP into 4Q? And then do we think about extrapolating that $1,200 if I'm right out to 2019? And then I've got a follow-up. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, Jon, I would look at Q4 as continued mix effects that we have. So, as we are \u2013 the low stage that we've seen through Q3, some of the mix shift that's happening, that will continue into Q4. But like we had said, those promotions that we had, those specific promotions that were driving down some of the ASPs in Q3 will not continue into Q4. . Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, Joe, you may have answered this to Robert's question earlier, so I apologize if this is redundant. But I think it's important obviously with the focus on the promotion. So, can you be a little bit more clear that the promotions that you ran in the quarter, you hear the word promotions at the same time that two or three comprehensive clear aligners were introduced in the market for the first time ever and that's going to freak a lot of people out, right? So the promotions that you mentioned, were those specific to express-type cases? Were they more specific to comprehensive? Any clarity you can give would be great. Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Jon, to answer your question backwards is, these are comprehensive cases. From a competitive standpoint, look, we continue to monitor the competition in the marketplace. Ormco is still out in ANZ and not completely engaged. 3M has obviously hit the marketplace in the United States and we see it. But these promotions were not geared toward trying to stop any competition that we're feeling right now. That wasn't the whole part of this promotional piece. Remember, third quarter's a big teen season. We had to make sure that we run the proper promotions going in there. This is a teen promotion and also an adult promotion too. Again, we're just trying some things in the sense of incentivizing the marketplace and it just happened to engage the upper tier of our Advantage Program rather than a lower tier that we had hoped. And these go on all the time kind of under the radar screen, Jon, and we don't talk about them. This one in the sense of how it performed obviously affecting ASP, we just have to give you clarity on it. But, again, I want to re-emphasize, this is not based on anything competitively that we saw in the marketplace that we thought we had to move around. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI : Hi. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Speaking of what you were just talking about on sort of engagement in the lower end of the market, how are you sort of thinking about what you're going to shift going forward? That would be my first question. And then could you sort of also talk about the typical GP path in that lower-end customer? Do they start with lower-priced products and then sort of move up, or do they sort of stay in that lower-level product mix shift? Any further color on that would be really helpful. Thanks. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks. Actually can you repeat the first question? You're kind of light on the volume. We couldn't hear the first part of your question. Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI : Oh, sorry about that. Is that better? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI : The first part of my question was, obviously, you said that you didn't get the engagement you were hoping for on the lower end of the market. And so I was just wondering sort of what you've learned from that and sort of how you're thinking about that engagement with that segment of the market going forward. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. On the lower end of the marketplace, it's just exactly how we target those incentives and how broad do we make them, okay? This was broad across all of our Advantage tiers. In the future, we'll just have to focus on the lower tiers in that sense in order to encourage that piece. I mean, it's that simple kind of feedback. We thought it'd be more of a balanced response across the tiers and it wasn't. And now on the GP, I think your second question had to do with GP doctors and how they get engaged. With iGo, as we start iGo, it's a mid-range product that we position with GPs that allow them to be able to do certain kinds of movements that we think are relatively simple to learn and for doctors to really start off the product line. And so, as you see the iGo growth all around the world, that's predominantly what we'd call a mid-range product that we're positioning with GPs at the moment. Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Does that help? Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore ISI : Yeah. That was helpful. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. You're welcome. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: And Elizabeth, I'm just going to add one other thing just in terms of what we're talking about with respect to ASP. The other part of the conversation has to do around the new Advantage Program this year and how that has additional tiers, and intended obviously to incentivize doctors to move up in tiers, and what we saw was the higher volume doctors moving up in tiers more than the lower tiers. So, that's part of the impact as well. Operator : Our next question comes from... Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Question... Operator : Sorry? Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Go ahead, Jeremy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Steve. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, and thanks for the time here. I wonder if I could come back, Joe, to a point that you made earlier, maybe an intersection of a couple points. I mean, you talked about how doctors are thinking about an evolving environment. I wonder is there something in the environment that is changing the way that clinicians respond to promotions or product line efforts or to the Advantage Program? Is there something different about it this time? I ask the question because historically the company has a lot of experience running these types of programs. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, I don't think the market is conditioned any differently than it's been before. The biggest change we've seen in the market is really just SDC in the United States marketplace. But that is a completely different segment since it's not through doctor's offices, and obviously that's not where the competition is right now. I think if you look at this, Steve, I think with this new Advantage Program we launched in North America in 2018, it just has a different series of brackets, a different series of rewards, at different kind of bonus levels. We haven't really engaged promotions around those things before. So it was a little bit of a learning curve in the sense of how those brackets, as Shirley talked about yesterday actually respond to these kinds of promotions. Don't look at this \u2013 I think I can understand your questions and the previous questions about, is there some external aspect that's really driving those things. If there was an external some kind of catalyst in this sense, we'd tell you. I'd tell you, okay? That's not why we do these things. We do these things to encourage customer stickiness. We do these things to figure out what really works in the marketplace. Look, I've never been in a business that has price elasticity curves like this business. And you really have to study those. We launch promotions, we do them at certain prices. We see what the uptakes are and we learn from those things. We're just launching this against a different type of an Advantage structured program and these tiers are different and this take-up was completely different than what we've seen before. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then just to follow-up on your point about SDC, I think I know the answer to this, but your view is still that any overlap between SDC cases and Align cases is low-single-digit percentage-wise, is that still correct? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I think we've always said it's about \u2013 back when we were actually comparing data with these guys, back before our lawsuit, and it was about a 10% overlap is what we saw overall. We don't have any information that would change that at all at this point, Steve. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks very much. Joe, any update on the timing for mandibular advancement in the U.S. or the palate expansion product that you talked about at Investor Day? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, John. We're expecting in the fourth quarter is what we said all along. Our communications with the FDA have been nothing bad or anything that would suggest that we're not on course. So I'd just say we're still sticking to our plan of being able to launch this product in the fourth quarter United States. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then how about the palate expander product? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Palate expander, we're still working through that. When you think about it, our Invisalign First product is a palate expansion product but it's not a rapid palate expansion product. So we're digging into that six- to eight-year, nine year marketplace with Invisalign First. We're still working through \u2013 in fact, I went through it this morning with a team. We're still working through the rapid palate expander and we'll give you an update on that as there's more to talk about. We're still thinking it's trialing in 2019 like we indicated at the most recent investors' conference. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just, John, any kind of key puts or takes you want to call out as we start thinking more about the outlook for 2019? I assume FX will be a bigger factor in the coming year? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. We're not giving the 2019 guidance, as you know, John. But FX is a piece of it. We call it out. It is what it is. And then everything else is on our operational performance. But we'll give a good update on 2019 at the next call. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. You're welcome, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, if I look at your slides that you provided, slide 30 specifically, you can see a step-down Q3 to Q4 on the pricing side both worldwide and internationally. Were you running some kind of program similar to this back then? And then we saw recovery over the next several quarters. Is that something kind of like what we should expect this time around? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, what we see, Matt, that comes through some of those slides and trends is FX effect. So, if there's foreign exchange that comes through there, it shows up as well. So, some of that, especially when you look on the international side, you can see some of the FX effects there. Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Sure. Just to punch a little bit further on that question specifically though, the moderation that you should get from the promotion going away, maybe some more mix benefits going forward. This should be kind of the low watermark maybe here in Q3 for the ASPs with the gradual increase over the next several quarters. Is that fair? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I think what we're expecting is kind of the Q4 ASPs that we're kind of calling should be that low point and that's how you should think about things going forward. Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then as the follow-up question and actually to talk about something positive in the quarter, even though there was a lot positive. On the scanner side specifically, can you parse out a little bit where that performance came from? Because that should be a pretty good leading indicator for the business going forward. DSOs, international, et cetera, would you mind just providing a little more color there? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Matt, it's Joe. When you look at it, every region we had a lot of strength in iTero. You start with we have now major penetration into China and great uptake there. Last year, we were approved in Japan and that's been good too. So, really all up and down Asia it's been strong. In North America, it's been strong across our individual doctor base but also, as you mentioned, the DSOs have been very strong also. And then also in the quarter, we did see increasing momentum with iTero scanners over in Europe too, which is our most difficult competitive market. We have good momentum there too. The launch of the Flex product line and iTero 2 were really great launches. Customers loved the product too so the response has been terrific. So, everything has been working extremely well with that business. But remember, that's just a wonderful footprint for us for future Invisalign business once we have those scanners in place. Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: All right, Matt. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks. I wanted to just clarify. I think you had said you're still expecting mandibular expansion \u2013 I'm sorry, the mandibular product in the fourth quarter, best of your ability to predict the FDA. Is it right that that's not factored into your Invisalign case volume guidance or your 4Q guidance? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. We don't factor it in, but honestly within one quarter of the launch of that, we wouldn't expect anything material, Richard, to report in that sense. And that's not anything to do with mandibular advancement. It's just the way things work around here in the sense of doctors will try this, they'll do a few cases, they'll get used to it. And then, as we move into 2019, we'll give you some idea of what we think mandibular advancement United States uptake would be. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe one other one. I noticed that the percentage of cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas was flat and it's been increasing almost every quarter for quite some time. I'm just wondering if that's somehow linked to some of the kind of anomalies that we saw around trends with ASPs or if there's any other explanation there? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: No, Richard, there's no correlation with the ASP side. Remember, last year, we ceased allowing 3Shape to be able to submit scans. And so those doctors would have to go back to PVS impressions, and we think that's pretty much what drove that. Obviously, our scanner sales have been really strong in United States. So we think that's just basically a re-submittal because of the situation we have with 3Shape right now. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. And then maybe just one last one. You said that you didn't get an expected kind of reaction in the marketplace from kind of the promotions across kind of both parts of the market, complex and simple. I guess what's your hypothesis as to why it didn't work on the low end of the market? Or do you have kind of a running assumption as to what maybe you got wrong or why it didn't work? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I think, Richard, first of all, it's not low end, it's low tier. So we have an Advantage Program. An Advantage Program has several tiers. It starts at Bronze, it goes all the way up to Double Diamond, okay? And so, when we talk about that, these are still broadly their comprehensive cases, okay? When you put these promotions in place, you want to make sure you're sensitive in the sense of who you're incentivizing across these brackets, right? What we're saying is we didn't have strong enough incentives on what we'd say the lower end of our Advantage tier program. And, obviously, that'd be the change we'd make going forward. Makes sense, Richard? Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: I thought we lost you. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Erin Wright - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks. I won't ask about ASPs, but the Invisalign Experience locations, could you provide any sort of new metrics around in terms of conversion rate or traction or any sort of key performance kind of metrics there. And how will the economics work for the doctor-led Invisalign Experience locations with the rebranding and all? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Erin we haven't given any statistics yet on our Experience centers. And we only had four stores, and now we're expanding the other eight stores right now. As we move into 2019, we'll be more transparent with that information. The doctors can engage in several ways. The doctors are actually engaged with the store. These products have a certain premium assigned to them, because we actually attract the patients and send the scans to the doctors or whatever. So, depending on what it is, Signature, Signature Plus or Deluxe, there's obviously a lab fee for the aligners but there's also a certain fee for those types of products. And then we're talking about the halo effect too. The halo effect, sometimes it's the doctors who aren't even associated with the program at all, we're still seeing a significant increase in Invisalign sales to those doctors just because of just the raising the awareness of Invisalign and doctors in that specific geographical area. And those are areas of anywhere between 10, 25, up to 50 miles we start to see that kind of response. Erin Wright - Credit Suisse : Okay. Great. And then you've previously alluded to financing initiatives for customers that seems to make sense here, but I don't really hear you speak much about it. I guess where does that stand today on that effort? And that remains purely a third-party relationship today? Thanks. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Hi, Erin. Yeah. This is John. Yeah, the financing, it continues. It's primarily in the U.S. and it's something where it's financing that's not on our balance sheet's third-party company that we work with. And really we're just trying to find easier ways for our end consumers to be able to use Invisalign and make things easier for them. So we continue to do it. It's part of the conversion that we try to use. And it's been rolled out across the U.S. for a few quarters now. Erin Wright - Credit Suisse : Okay. Great. Thank you. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. So I guess for the 35% case growth in the quarter, which obviously accelerated pretty nicely. I'm just curious if there's any color on how much of that volume growth was maybe tied to what we'll call the overly enhanced promotional activity. Or are you more of the mindset that maybe you would have had essentially the same case volume growth overall if there were no alterations to the loyalty program? Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, we can't nail it exactly, but we can tell you it's 1% to 2% on the North America volume. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. One other quick one \u2013 again, if you're slightly off on where you want to be on your ASPs because of this activity, just kind of thinking out loud without giving anything away for next year, just curious if you also think you could potentially increase list prices maybe a bit more than normal to get you where you want to be on ASPs for 2019, just as another lever that you could pull if you wanted to when thinking about optimizing price. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Well, you don't want to comment on price going into a year. We never do that, Steve. But we have raised price every year in the last three years. Obviously we raised price in this quarter, too. And it's been part of our strategy. It fuels a lot of the things we would do. We talk about Invisalign Experience and our marketing campaign and driving customers' adopters, also all the technology we invest into. So it's been a pretty large part of our strategic plan. But I don't want to comment on 2019 in that sense. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird and Company. Please proceed with your question. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good evening, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Hey, Jeff. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, Joe. So let me start just on the Invisalign Experience. It sounds like you're moving that into some private practitioners or some other offices here in the fourth quarter. Any discussions on moving that into the DSO channel where you could almost supercharge that or really get into 600, 800 offices at a time? And in those cases, I think you alluded to it, Joe, a little bit in your comments just a second ago. But my sense, at least from the conversations I've had is that the gross margins are actually accretive in cases that come through that kind of channel because you're kind of doing some of the work to get the patient into that office. Is that a fair way to look at that? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Jeff, it's a really fair way to look at it. I mean, we talked about Aspen last quarter. I mean, the whole idea of the Aspen piece and their uptake of iTero scanners was to put what we used to call a store in store. We now call it an Invisalign Experience thing in the doctors' offices within Aspen. And part of what we've done in the stores is we've created obviously consumer material. We've created a lot of things. From a customer engagement standpoint, turning customers into patients, we put those in place and we'll be able to employ in those DSO stores too. So, that's been a big part of our strategy and it's one of the reasons you see such a big uptake in the DSOs that we've been selling to and reporting. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Fair enough. And then, again, there hasn't been enough ASP questions here tonight but I just want to understand, John, your comments. You get some of the promotional activities right-sized in the fourth quarter. Currency probably is a little bit bigger of an impact going forward. So, fourth quarter you would expect ASP to be down sequentially a bit versus 3Q, is that right? And then we kind of see a recovery throughout 2019 or at least a little bit trending up in 2019, as some of those currency headwinds in the back half come off and maybe some of the promotional activity headwinds do as well? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Jeff, what we would see is \u2013 you're right, on the FX, you see it come down a little bit from an ASP standpoint in the fourth quarter. But then from the fourth quarter, we expect it to be about flat, just given the mix and other things that we've talked about in terms of what we see in the business. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just to clarify that, so whatever our fourth quarter ASP, wherever that ends up, that you would expect holding flat, then moving throughout 2019 sequentially? John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yes. That's how we would look at it. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra form Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Just a couple based on the margin outlook for the business. So, just working through that flat pricing outlook, how do we think about the gross margin implication on the aligner business. I mean, you have these plants coming online. Is it similar type of kind of ramp that we look at a step-down from 3Q in the aligner gross model and that kind of remains flat or slightly increases going forward into 2019? And then, just a question on the marketing strategy, as kind of Raph steps aside, you have a number of new programs going on here. You have a new marketing leader coming in. You have an orthodontic summit in a month. How do you kind of like look at your dental segment and your customer base, the orthodontists here? Are we in a world where you're trying to get greater productivity from your top dentists and let the less productive guys I guess to call it less of a focus on that? Or is there room for everyone here? How are you looking to approach that? Thank you. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Ravi, I'll take the gross margin question. Yeah, as we said, coming online with some of the manufacturing, it's at certain amount of costs that we need some of the volume now to be able to spread those costs over. So we guided in Q4 to reflect that. And then, as we get more efficient related to that manufacturing, both the manufacturing and the treatment planning that we have kind of globally, we'll start to see some of the efficiencies related to that manufacturing and treatment planning that will affect our gross margins. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: And Ravi, it's Joe. Your question on the segment and top dentists versus \u2013 or top orthos versus lower brackets, I'd just end it by saying there's room for everyone. You have to segment this market always between general dentistry as we call GPs and also orthodontists. But when we talked about at Investors Day, we see a market that we used to measure as 12 million case starts a year as potentially 300 million. But what we specifically talk about with our doctors, particularly on the ortho side, is this is a massive what we call analog to digital conversion, right? If you really want to get the productivity of a digital-based orthodontic system that ends up in plastic, and that's what our process is, is you really have to do predominantly a majority of your business has to be in digital. And those doctors that walk forward that want to go through that journey with us, we have a number of programs to take them through from financing to how you encourage more consumers, how you set up your practice, all those things, so you can make it as efficient as possible. On the general dentistry side, we often work from a restorative standpoint to make sure that we can work within those restorative workflows and make sure that it's profitable for those docs and they understand how to use these things. Ravi, one thing I want to make certain, and maybe it's just me being overly sensitive. Don't take Raph's announcement in any way as any indication that he had some responsibility for this promotional aspect for what went on. Raph's been tremendous for us. After running our international business, coming in and running marketing and strategic development and also business development, he's been critical to this business. This is not some kind of smoke and mirrors. This is Raph making the decision from a family standpoint that he's had issues with that he has to deal with right now. We support Raph in that from a family standpoint. This has nothing to do with him. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. A lot of questions have been taken but I just want to follow-up on a couple points. One is, are you getting any sense that the pretty substantial price difference in the quarter, the discounts, are they being passed onto customers by the dentists? I know it's tough to measure those channels sometimes and it's aggregated, but are you getting any sense that the dentists themselves are being squeezed on pricing by the end customer and they have to do something to adjust? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: We don't have any data, Michael, to hold up with that. I'd say, remember there's a million points of light in this business too because there's so many doctors overall involved. But I don't feel this has to do with having these promotions actually in some way and have that passed onto consumers. It's just not the feedback we get or what we think is going on. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. And then a follow-up just real quick on the DSOs. I think you mentioned 40% growth in the quarter as a customer grouping. And the mix is shifting, still a small part of the overall business, but is there anything that's different there in terms of how much price you're able to get with those customers versus some of the stand-alone docs? Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: From a DSO standpoint, obviously these are large contracts we put in place. And there's significant price discounts in the sense for the volumes that the DSOs offer. So, when we talk about mix, there's a certain amount of mix associated with DSOs. When you see these kind of growth rates, 40%, it's obviously some aspect of the mix that we're talking about. So, when you think about that too, Michael, is that we don't have to spend as much OpEx on the DSOs. And it's really important to understand. A lot of them since they're general dentists, they use their own patients to generate their demand. The normal GP dentists would have 1,500 to 2,000 patients per office. We could help them mine those patients to understand which ones would want orthodontic treatment or could stand for orthodontic treatment or not. We don't have to have the amount of sales coverage that we'd have with individual doctors. So you're going to have a lower overall ASP on those businesses, but we feel that from an OpEx standpoint we're not spending as much money too. So, from a gross margin standpoint, it's still positive for us. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: Yes. You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Cooley from Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Good evening, and thanks for letting me just hop in here at the end. Just two quick ones for me. Maybe, Joe, to start with, you mentioned in one of the prior questions price elasticity curves for the market. Could you maybe just give us your views, as the market continues to evolve, what level of margin you think that your higher echelon volume providers expect to maintain and maybe how that differs versus the lower tier provider as these markets evolve, just in terms of profitability by caseload? And then, just from a clarification standpoint, John, if I'm doing the math right, just kind of doing the puts and takes on the one-timers there on the tax rate in the quarter, am I right in that it's about $0.05 to the positive when we look at the net effect there for the 3Q? Thanks. John F. Morici - Align Technology, Inc.: Yeah, just on the tax, we just gave kind of the highlights of the overall that affected tax. We had guided 21% and ended up at 19.5%. So you can pretty much say that it's 1.5% of our tax was a few things that came in a little bit favorable compared to what we guide. But those two were just kind of the big puts and takes for the quarter. Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. Thanks. Joseph M. Hogan - Align Technology, Inc.: As far as the price elasticity curves by docs going forward or whatever, I don't have any comments on that or really any projections of what that's going to be. When we talk about those things, we talk about segments. It would be lower segments or comprehensive segments or teen segments and those kinds of things. But we don't necessarily have that data by doctor or doctor tiers and where it's going to. And if we did have them, not so sure we'd share that anyhow. We just like to keep it at high level. But I'll just tell you that we're aware of these price elasticity curves from a specific \u2013 not just demographic, but a specific area of the marketplace all over the world. And we'd have to do promotions and things to test those. And obviously, we respond to those either favorably or not depending on what signals we get. It's an important part of why we do these programs. Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Shirley Stacy - Align Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Well, thank you, everyone. That concludes our conference call today. If you have any further questions, please contact Investor Relations. And we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences and at the Invisalign Ortho Summit next month. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights in the fourth quarter and the full year, then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Clear aligners and intraoral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results, discuss our outlook for the first quarter and share our thoughts for 2019. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year. Q4 revenues were better than expected, reflecting higher Invisalign ASPs and volume growth of 31% year-over-year. As well as another record quarter for iTero scanners with revenue up 55% year-over-year. Q4 sequential growth was driven by a strong quarter for EMEA with record growth for teens as well as continued traction with Invisalign Lite and iGo. Q4 operating margin of 22.6% reflects higher doctor training and manufacturing costs as well as higher legal fees than anticipated, partially offset by sequential improvement in Invisalign ASPs. For the quarter, we trained a record 5,270 new doctors in Q4, which includes about 3,000 international doctors, of which, half were in EMEA and half were in APAC. For the year, we achieved record revenues of nearly $2 billion and had over 1.2 million people start treatment with Invisalign clear aligners for the first time, resulting in our 6 millionth Invisalign patient, a teenager from China. These results reflect record revenues and volumes for both Invisalign and iTero. Across customer channels and country markets and continued strength from teens, which grew 40%. The total number of teenagers treated with Invisalign this year was over 333,000, representing 27% of our volume. Finally, in 2018, we trained a record number of new Invisalign doctors, nearly 20,000 worldwide. And for the first time, more than half of them were international doctors. Now let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter results starting with the Americas region. For the Americas region, Q4 Invisalign case volume increased 21.7% year-over-year and was down sequentially off a record Q3 volumes, which benefited from strong uptake of promotions last quarter, predominantly by high-volume Invisalign doctors. On a sequential basis, Q4 reflects growth from the Americas GPs, offset by America's orthos, particularly high-volume doctors. Year-over-year growth for Q4 reflects continued adoption of Invisalign treatment from both orthodontist and GP channels, which were up 24.7% and 17.3%, respectively. We also saw good growth from our DSO partners across both GPs and orthos, up nearly 50% year-over-year. For the full year, Invisalign volume for the Americas region was up 24.2% compared to 2017. Americas orthos were up 27.2% and Americas GP dentists were up 19.8%, the second highest annual growth rate for orthos and the highest annual growth rate for GPs in 6 years. For Q4, we trained a record 2,290 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region, of which, 1,725 were North American doctors and 565 were Latin American doctors. In total, we trained 7,885 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas in 2018, an increase of 19%. For international business, Q4 was a great quarter with Invisalign case volume up 12.2% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the EMEA region, offset somewhat by seasonality in the Asia Pacific region. On a year-over-year basis, strong Invisalign volume growth of 45.3% reflects increased utilization and continued expansion of our customer base in both EMEA and the Asia Pacific region. In Q4, we trained nearly 3,000 new Invisalign doctors internationally with roughly 50% in EMEA and 50% in APAC. In EMEA, Q4 was a strong quarter, up 42.7% year-over-year, driven by record Invisalign volumes in all country markets as well as strong growth in the teen segment, which is up 75.1% from the prior year, reflecting continued success of our Teen 360 program. For the full year, EMEA was up 38.6% led by Iberia, France and the U.K. as well as our key expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe. During 2018, we went direct in Turkey, Israel and Russia, adding to our expansion country markets. For APAC, Q4 was down sequentially as expected due to seasonality -- seasonally slower period in the region, up 49.3% year-over-year with record Invisalign volume in almost every country market led by China, Japan, ANZ. Q4 results reflect continued strong growth from teenage patients as well as adults, with GP dentists up 77.1% year-over-year. During Q4, we trained 1,530 new doctors in APAC, of which half were in China. We held several clinical education events across APAC designed to help increase doctor's confidence in adoption of Invisalign treatment, including how critical the iTero scanner is to practice growth. For the year, Invisalign volume from the international doctors increased 45% led by growth from China and our core EMEA country markets. In total, international volumes represented 41% of worldwide Invisalign case shipments. Despite our record results, we're still very clearly underpenetrated in APAC overall and specifically in China. As the second largest market for Align, China represents enormous growth potential, and our ability to expand and drive penetration across the region relies on our ability to be closer to doctors and their patients, communicate in local language and as much as possible, operate like a local company. Late in Q4, we began fabricating Invisalign aligners in our new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China, our first aligner fabrication facility outside of Juarez, Mexico. There's a temporary facility that will be replaced by our own building in 2020. Over the next year, we will continue to build our manufacturing abilities in Ziyang and ramp up production to serve the rapidly growing Chinese market. However, it would take a couple of quarters to fully transition aligner production from Juarez to Ziyang, and we would expect manufacturing overhead in Ziyang to be underutilized during this period. Product and technology innovation continues to be a key growth driver across our regions. Over the past year, we launched several new Invisalign offerings for both comprehensive and non-comprehensive treatment to give doctors more tools and choices to treat a greater range of cases, from adults to teenagers and now even kids as young as 7 years old. In mid-2018, we launched a new Invisalign Go product with a more user-friendly iTero digital chair-side experience and greater flexibility to treat a wider range of mild to moderate cases such as crowded or gapped teeth that require teeth straightening prior to restorative treatments. We also began offering Invisalign First, designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients' malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion. We're pleased with the initial uptake and customer feedback. In 2018, we shipped nearly 5,000 Invisalign First cases to over 1,300 doctors, primarily in North America, EMEA, Australia and New Zealand, and Japan. And in October, we received FDA approval for Invisalign with mandibular advancement feature in the U.S., which is the only clear aligner product approved to simultaneously move teeth and the mandible in young patients. In Q4, we began shipping mandibular advancement in the U.S. Late in the quarter, we are seeing initial uptake along with continued ramp globally. To date, over 17,000 teenagers have used Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement, led by China, Canada, France and Spain. Overall for the teen market, in Q4, over 87,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 37.3% year-over-year, driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions, driven by both the Americas and EMEA regions. For Q4, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North America orthos increased 23.7% and international doctors were up 63.7%. For the full year, total teen cases worldwide grew 40.3% to a total of 333,000 teenagers, or 27.1% of our total volume. Our consumer marketing efforts are designed to build the category and drive demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. We invest over $100 million each year in consumer marketing and programs, including TV, digital, social media, PR, event marketing and more recently, our patient concierge and Invisalign Experience program. Our goals are to make the Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. In Q4, we continue to see strong digital engagement with consumers and had nearly 4 million unique visitors on invisalign.com sites for a total of 17 million over the year. Other key metrics show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our fourth quarter slides. The impact of the digital technology on our world and specifically in our industry is challenging our customers to evolve just about every aspect of their practice, especially how they engage with consumers and turn them into patients. What worked for doctors in the past from a marketing, conversion or workflow perspective will not work today. Consumers expect more and are demanding different types of digital-driven expenses. Many doctors don't know where and how to start. The work we are doing with our integrated consumer marketing platform, patient concierge service, and Invisalign Experience program has given us better insights and information that we're sharing with doctors to help them reshape their practices. For example, the Invisalign Experience program is designed to reach consumers in a retail environment where they shop, play and dine and educate them on the benefits of Invisalign treatment and value of getting a better smile and connect them with an Invisalign doctor. One of the ways we do this is through the Invisalign store, which is owned and operated by Align. Invisalign stores bring the brand directly to consumers in a contemporary, interactive digital environment. Consumers can browse, ask questions, learn about Invisalign treatment and technology, and the benefits of straightening their teeth. Visitors are offered a complimentary iTero intraoral 3D scan and a visual simulation of what their smile might look like after Invisalign treatment. Interested consumers are connected with a local Invisalign doctor's office of their choice to discuss potential treatment options. By the end of 2018, we finished with 12 locations in the United States, and these stores are helping us learn more than ever about reducing barriers to treatment for potential patients so that they are excited about getting a better smile with an Invisalign doctor. In addition to providing potential leads to participating Invisalign practices, we're also seeing a positive halo effect and increased growth rates for all of the Invisalign practices in the surrounding area, whether they participate in the store network or not. Over the past year, more than 55,000 consumers visited Invisalign store and nearly 10,000 received a complementary scan. While we are still early in the development of our Invisalign stores and the overarching Invisalign Experience program, we're excited about its potential and the positive impact we can have on demand creation for Invisalign practices by engaging directly with consumers. The Invisalign Experience program is just getting started and continues to evolve. In October, we announced that we're partnering with a few Invisalign doctors in selected U.S. cities to pilot new ways to reach consumers and connect them directly with doctors to start Invisalign treatment. These Invisalign Experience locations are owned and operated by doctors under a special license from Align and are intended to help doctors integrate consumer friendly design and consultation workflow into their practices and test new Invisalign Experience branding and explore a consumer focused approach to consultations and Invisalign treatments starts in a variety of settings, including in-office, retail and mobile. We'll continue to share our learnings as we get more of these pilots up and running. Finally, I want to spend a few minutes talking about digital technology and the transformation in our industry from an old analog process to an end-to-end digital workflow. Align is helping doctors on their digital journey, which starts with an iTero scanner and ends with stronger practices and better smiles for their patients. As a leader in digital orthodontics, we are best positioned to help Invisalign-trained doctors find more efficient ways to drive digitalization in their practices and support those practices and to help them improve their productivity over time. To that end, last year, we launched project [PNO] we now call -- we have renamed it ADAPT, Align digital and practice transformation, with several small orthodontic clinics across EMEA, APAC and North America with the objective to demonstrate that a fully digital practice can be productive, efficient and profitable. Process involves detailed analysis of the current practice data and workflows performed by experts and continuous improvement in workflow. While it's still early, the initial results from the ADAPT study are incredibly promising. Based upon the study on practice development, we've come to the conclusion that the benefit fully from technology and to own the digital transformation of their practices, doctors need to organize their workflows and premises so that approximately 80% of their organization is built around this digital transformation with clear aligners. This means that doctors who commit to digital transformation had the potential to do more, see more patients and expand their practice or take more time off. Whatever their goals, with Invisalign plus iTero together, we can help them see the benefits they want from a fully end-to-end digital workflow. For iTero scanner and services business, Q4 was a very strong quarter with better-than-expected revenues, which were up 13% sequentially and 54.8% year-over-year, driven by strength in all regions and customer channels. Record Q4 volumes reflect continued commercialization of the iTero 2 Element and Element Flex scanners, especially for restorative GP dentists in North America, the continued rollout of our major DSO partners and increased sales internationally, including Italy, Japan and China, where we began manufacturing the iTero Element this past year. For 2018, we had an outstanding year for iTero scanners with volumes up 77.2% year-over-year. Cumulatively, over 11.5 million orthodontic scans and 3.2 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submission continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with digital scanner in the Americas increased 72.6% from 65.3% in Q4 last year. International scans increased 57.5%, up 41.4% in the same quarter last year. What's really exciting to see is that within the Americas, 88.7% of cases submitted by North American orthos were submitted digitally. In China, it went from 0 to 45.9% in 1 year. This means that within 1 year or 2, nearly all Invisalign cases will be submitted digitally, primarily through an iTero scanner. We're very excited about the continued progress we've made with iTero business overall, and remain confident that will continue to help drive our overall growth and help increase adoption of Invisalign treatment. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $534 million, up 5.7% from the prior quarter and up 26.7% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For the full year, revenue of about $2 billion was up 33.5% year-over-year, reflecting a record 1.2 million Invisalign shipments and 31.9% year-over-year growth, with strength across all regions and customer channels as well as record iTero scanners volume, which was up 77.2%. For clear aligners, Q4 revenue of $445.6 million was up 4.3% sequentially on higher-than-expected Invisalign ASPs and strong Invisalign volume from EMEA. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 22.4% reflected strong Invisalign shipment across all customer channels and geographies. Q4 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially by approximately $5 to $1,235, reflecting price increases and lower discounts, partially offset by higher growth on non-comprehensive cases and includes a $10 of unfavorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down approximately $70, reflecting promotional discounts, higher growth on non-comprehensive cases and includes $25 of unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by price increases. Total Q4 Invisalign shipments of 333,800 cases were up 4.5% sequentially and up 30.9% year-over-year. For Americas orthodontists, Q4 Invisalign case volume was slightly lower than our Q4 outlook, primarily due to longer cycle times in Latin America, and was down 2.9% sequentially and up 24.7% year-over-year. For Americas GP dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 3.2% sequentially and up 17.3% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 12.2% sequentially and up 45.3% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the fourth quarter was $88.4 million, up 13% sequentially due to volume increases in Americas and EMEA. Year-over-year revenue was up 54.8%, primarily due to higher scanner units across regions. Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 71.7%, down 1.9 points sequentially and down 3.8 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.1%, down 1.2 points sequentially, primarily due to higher number of aligners per case, higher freight cost, reflecting faster international growth, higher training cost due to more doctors trained in the quarter and manufacturing spend driven by operational expansion in China, which was partially offset by slightly higher Invisalign ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin was down 3.5 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher number of cases per -- aligners per case, lower ASPs, higher training costs and freight charges and regional expansion of our manufacturing-related activities in China and EMEA. Scanner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 59.9%, down 4 points sequentially and down 2.1 points year-over-year, primarily due to manufacturing and freight costs and lower ASP. Q4 operating expenses were $262.6 million, up sequentially 6.5% and up 26.1% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses primarily reflects our continued investment in sales and R&D activities along with higher legal, consulting expenses, partially offset by seasonally lower advertising spending. Year-over-year, the increase in operating expenses reflects higher spending commensurate with growth. Our fourth quarter operating income was $120.5 million, down 3.8% sequentially and up 9.9% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating income is primarily attributed to lower gross margin and higher operating expenses as mentioned earlier. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating income primarily reflects higher revenue offset by higher sales and marketing, R&D, legal/consulting spending and unfavorable foreign exchange. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 22.6%, down 2.2 points sequentially and down 3.4 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin, as mentioned earlier. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin as described earlier and about 0.5 points impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. With regards to fourth quarter tax provision, our tax rate was [8.5%] [18.5%], which includes approximately $1.9 million in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.20, down $0.04 sequentially and up $1.07 compared to the prior year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of the fourth quarter, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $744.5 million, an increase of approximately $131.3 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations. Of our $744.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $432.5 million was held in the U.S. and $312 million was held by our international entities. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $439 million, up approximately 4.5% sequentially. Our overall day sales outstanding was 74 days, down 1 day sequentially and up 5 days as of Q4 last year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $241.3 million, up $79 million compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $187 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $54.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. During Q4, we repurchased $50 million of stock against our stock buyback authorizations and have $500 million still available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program. Before we move to the Q1 outlook, I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2018 results. In 2018, we shipped a record 1.2 million Invisalign cases, up 31.9%. This reflects 45% volume growth for our international doctors and 24.2% volume growth from our Americas doctors. Shipments of our iTero scanner were up 77.2% versus 2017. Total revenue was a record $2 billion, up 33.5% year-over-year with Invisalign revenues of $1.7 billion. Full year operating income of $466.7 million, up 31.9% versus 2017 and operating margin at 23.7%. Free cash flow was $331.4 million. For the year, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of Align stock for $300 million. 2018 diluted earnings per share was $4.92. With that, let's turn to our Q1 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For international, we expect Q1 to be up sequentially as the EMEA market maintains momentum from Q4 and APAC is seasonally flat sequentially as some markets observe the Lunar New Year holiday. For Americas, we expect Q1 to also increase sequentially with strong growth from North America orthos and a slight increase in North America GPs. We expect Latin America to be down sequentially given this is their summer holiday season. We expect our iTero business to be down slightly from a record Q4, consistent with seasonal trends and capital equipment market. And we continue to expect minimal volume for SmileDirectClub. With this as a backdrop, we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign's case volume is expected to be in a range of 340,000 to 345,000 cases, up approximately 25% to 27% year-over-year. We expect Q1 revenues to be in the range of $525 million to $535 million, reflecting increased volume and flat ASPs versus Q4 2018. We expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 70.3% to 71%, reflecting our higher start-up costs in China and increased doctor training expenses. We expect Q1 operating expenses to meet a range of $290 million to $294 million, which reflects our sales force expansion and increased legal expenses. Q1 operating margin should be in a range of 15.1% to 16.1%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 16%, which is higher than 2018 due to nondeductible officer stock compensation based on recent IRS guidance and our lower stock price. We expect approximately $3 million to $4 million equity loss related to our share of SmileDirectClub's net losses. And diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $80.9 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q1 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.78 to $0.84. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q1 to be approximately $60 million to $65 million. And we expect depreciation and amortization to be $19 million to $20 million. Now let me turn to our view for the full year 2019, notwithstanding the impact of foreign exchange rates. We expect total revenue growth for the company, Invisalign and iTero, to be in the middle range of our long-term operating model of 20% to 30%. We anticipate Invisalign ASPs to be flat from Q4 2018, reflecting continued growth from international regions, increased share of the teen segment and uptake of non-comprehensive products. We anticipate Invisalign volume to be in the middle of the range of our long-term model target of 20% to 30%. We anticipate gross margin and operating margin to improve over the course of the year. We anticipate gross margin to approach our long-term model target of 73% to 78% by Q4. We will continue to fuel growth globally and expect to invest in international and operational expansion as well as sales and marketing initiatives, including nearly 100 new sales reps in Americas hired at the end of Q4 and additional GP sales reps in EMEA beginning in Q1. These investments also include continued litigation expenses to protect our intellectual property and extend our competitive advantage. Given our continued growth and expansion internationally, during the year, we intend to reorganize our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. The proposed corporate structure may also allow us to obtain financial and operational efficiencies after they are implemented. As a result, we will incur expenses in the near-term and expect to realize the related benefits in subsequent years. We expect our operating margin for the second half to be in a long-term model of 25% to 30%. For the full year, we anticipate operating margin to be below our long-term target as it includes approximately 1.5 to 2 points impact from increased legal fees and the planned corporate structure reorganization. We expect equity loss for our investment in SmileDirectClub to be $3 million to $4 million per quarter. We expect our tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 24%, which includes about $8 million of excess tax benefits. 2019 tax rate is higher than 2018 primarily due to a release of unrecognized tax benefits that will not repeat. We expect our earnings power in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half with second half operating results to account for somewhere in the range of 50% to 55% of our full year results. We expect capital expenditures for 2019 to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John, and thanks to those who joined our call today. Overall, 2018 was a great year for Align, and I'm very pleased with the strong performance for Invisalign and iTero across all key regions, customers channels and products. This year, not only do we celebrate our 21st year in business, we also achieved several major milestones, including our 6 millionth Invisalign patient and $2 billion in revenue for the first time. It took nearly 20 years to reach our first $1 billion in sales and only 2 years to reach our second billion dollars. We also delivered in our strategic growth drivers with new product and technology innovation, expansion of our manufacturing and treatment planning operations, and raising awareness of Invisalign treatment with consumers and engaging with them in more innovative ways than ever before. As I step back and look ahead to 2019 and beyond, I want to reinforce the importance of the investments we're making to drive growth globally. The underlying opportunity for doctors and their patients is expanding based on digital technology that Align has spent over 21 years developing. And while we have a huge amount of accumulated expertise and knowledge in digital technology and orthodontics, we have to ensure that we have the capabilities to further expand and regionalize our operations, extend our competitive lead and protect our business from companies willing to take shortcuts with respect to intellectual property. It is incumbent upon us to drive the transition to a fully digital workflow and continue to deliver new products and services that not only benefit Invisalign doctors but their patients and consumers alike. Following our Ortho Summit in November, I met with hundreds of Invisalign doctors and their staff, I had the opportunity to travel to our regional kickoff meetings and connect with Align team members at every level of our organization to hear their detailed plans of their upcoming year. While I spent more of my time at the Americas kickoff because of my interim role as the Americas leader, I can say unequivocally that across the company, the excitement and level of engagement surrounding our business and market opportunity was palpable. Overall, the demand profile globally is solid and nothing we see in the environment suggest otherwise. We're running the place we know and are confident we can bring greater efficiencies, economies of scale and know that adding sales, training to get closer to customers in local markets creates sustainable competitive advantage. Finally, as most of you know, one of the key orthodontic journals in North America is the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics, and they often flip through it and ask why there aren't more clear aligners profiled. This week, I was caught off guard when I opened the December issue and found it dedicated entirely to clear aligner therapy. Bob Keim is the editor of the JCO and has been to many of our Invisalign Summits. In meetings with him and reading his editorials, I knew he supported Invisalign treatment and clear aligners in general, but it was never clear to me today extent he believed in clear aligner technology as we've seen in the most recent issue of the JCO, especially the editor's column, \"The End of Braces?\" If you haven't had a chance to read the JCO, you should. Bob could not take a stronger position for clear aligners. He acknowledges that he may take some flak for being so bold, but I believe his strong endorsement is a major breakthrough for Align and digital orthodontics. With that, I want to thank you, again for joining our call. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. We'll see many of you in Chicago Midwinter Meeting next month as well as industry and financial conferences throughout the year. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess, just to start on ASPs. Joe, could you maybe talk through the progression of ASPs that you saw over the quarter? On a worldwide basis, certainly seems like you guys were able to stabilize ASPs in 4Q relative to 3Q and looking at the implied guidance from 1Q, seems like that's expected to continue, and in the full year, you're calling for that to be at the kind of level we should look for. So I guess, just how did they progress throughout 4Q? And then just related to that, what are the major pushes and pulls as you think about ASPs over the course of '19? Joseph Hogan : Bob, that's a big question, but I'll make it simple, okay? We had an issue in the third quarter in the Americas with our Advantage Program that I think kicked off this ASP concern. As we said, we retracted that $300 that we offered on teens and also adults at that point in time. After that, basically, out ASPs are what they normally are, in the sense of mixes and matches across the spectrum of EMEA in different places. So I mean, that's the total -- you want to talk about we have an exchange hit this quarter also but again, I think we prepared you for that in the last quarter. So overall, the only change is we didn't have an advantage issue in the third quarter as in the fourth quarter. Robert Jones : Yes. I guess just to follow on, on that, Joe. I mean, I think the question really is as you think about '19, obviously, those programs go away. I guess, the expectation looks like here in the slides that you're still thinking that it's going to be flat to the 4Q levels. So just trying to understand a little bit better what could move the ASPs up over the course of the year as we think about some of the things that hopefully, would not reoccur in '19 what happened in '18. Joseph Hogan : Yes, John will jump in on this. John Morici : Bob, this is John. So the couple of positive mix that we talk a lot about, the international growth, we continue to see strong growth internationally. Mandibular advancement in the U.S. contributes overall to our team growth, which are comprehensive cases and those help. And we are also seeing growth on the comprehensive side. So we think those three, we've seen some balance and that's what we would expect for 2019. Robert Jones : Great. And then I guess just as a follow-up from me, John, while I have you. If you think about the margin outlook for the year, it looks like you guys are calling for the growth in operating margins to get into the long-term ranges in the back half. Just at a high level, I guess, how much visibility and control do you guys have over that trajectory into the back half of '19 around the margins? John Morici : Yes, Bob. It really starts with some of the manufacturing efficiencies that we expect to get as we start to ramp up in China and continue to ramp up with our treatment planning. We'll see that continue to ramp as we move through the year. We have other products and programs that will also help us from a mix standpoint as well. So we feel really good about how we're -- how we view the year and the expectation of margin improvement throughout the year. Robert Jones : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit more about the reorganization expenses. Are you sort of thinking of those on an ongoing basis or more onetime? I guess, my question stems in part because I was wondering if you were thinking about perhaps potentially backing those out of your 2019 results? John Morici : Elizabeth, this is John. This is a onetime. I mean, it's -- as the company expands and grows internationally, it's looking at some of the efficiencies that we can gain through that change. And we report numbers on a GAAP basis. We'll continue to do so, but we'll give you highlights as the year goes on as update. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, also could you just talk a little bit more about the sales investments that you guys are making into the Americas in terms of any particular details you could provide on that? That will be helpful. Joseph Hogan : Yes, Elizabeth. It's Joe. Look, in Americas, we're still really underpenetrated in the marketplace, particularly on the GP segment, and so we decided we'd add 100 salespeople. We feel really good about that investment giving us good short-term returns. We've done this before almost in every cycle since I've been here. It's a play we know how to run, and we know the importance of it overall. So don't look at it as an anomaly. It's just a continuation of building out our sales force and taking advantages of some of the man out there. Elizabeth, I'll also tell you. It's a high touch thing. You have to touch doctors in this business to drive sales. It's really -- and it -- this doesn't happen on itself. It's -- there's a constant touch to it. So we're really aware of that. Often, our treatment is much different than what these doctors have done before. Our salespeople, we train them well clinically but also from a business standpoint so that they can talk about clinically how to use a product line but also from a business standpoint how you integrate it into the practice. So adding salespeople is really important. Elizabeth Anderson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. Please proceed. Jonathan Block : Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I think the paranoia is going to sort of move from ASPs to volumes and margins tomorrow. So maybe on the margin side, John, for '19, you mentioned expectations to be below your long-term op margin goal of 25% to 30%. Specifically, you called out 150 to 200 bps from increased legal fees in the reorg. So a couple of questions there. Is that reorg all specific to '19? And then if we were to normalize for the 150 to 200 bps, would your '19 op margin approach the lower band of your long-term 25% to 30% goal? And then I got a quicker follow-up. John Morici : Yes, that's the right way to look at it, Jon. So this is 2019 expenses. And these expenses, we think we would have been in the long-term range that we have of 25% to 30% if we didn't have these expenses. Jonathan Block : Okay. One question, short answer. I'll take it. And then maybe, Joe, for you, on the vols. Just any more color. I mean, any thoughts on the North American ortho weakness? I do have a hard time believing that all the weakness was Latin America just looking at the size of that business. But anything more North American ortho weakness? Is this a pause before mandibular and Invisalign First greater hold in 2019? And maybe, if you don't mind, any thoughts on what MAF and First could contribute to North America this year? Thanks, guys. Joseph Hogan : Yes, Jon, look, I - the America's growth this year, I know we had the blip in the third quarter overall, but 2018 is a good year for us. If you look at the last 6 years, this is actually the second highest growth profile we've had. America's growth is about 17% on an average over those 6 years. The orthos grew -- this is the only -- this is the second -- from a percentage standpoint, best year we've had from an ortho standpoint. What happened between the third and fourth quarter, again, we think it was a -- that I mentioned on my opening, was the uptake that we have at that Advantage Program in the third quarter. And that was repeated in the fourth quarter, and we think we have this quarter-over-quarter kind of discrepancy. GP is at an all-time high from a growth standpoint overall. And then obviously, from a Brazil standpoint, too, it's starting to become material in the sense of the size of that business, and we're looking for good contributions this year. So Jon, I hope I'm answering your question. But I'd say then if you look at the volume overall, you see how strong EMEA has been. The expansion of EMEA, in the areas like Turkey and Russia and in the Middle East, has been important to us. But also France is growing well. Spain has been strong. Italy came back. We saw it. We've had great success with Go in -- with the GPs out of the U.K. but also in Germany, too. So we really feel great about that region. And then APAC, again, we see strength. We've seen strength in China. We see strength in APAC overall. Japan's growth has been phenomenal. And then bleed that in with our iTero growth, too, that you see across the spectrum. Overall, we feel good about volume. Jonathan Block : Okay, fair enough. Thanks for your time guys, Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of housekeeping items, John, in terms of the fourth quarter. Could you quantify the impact in Latin America from the longer cycle times? And you expect that to normalize in the first quarter? And then in terms of the fourth quarter OpEx, it looks like it was about $12 million above your guidance, which is very atypical and unusual. Can you point us to the areas of spend that -- or perhaps accelerated or brought you in above your plan? John Morici : Yes. So for the fourth quarter in Latin America, I mean, it's a growing business, as Joe said, and it's a couple of thousand cases that were kind of in transition on a -- from -- right at the end of the fourth quarter. And then as far as spend, were you specifically talking about spend in fourth quarter or compared to the guide in the first quarter? Brandon Couillard : Yes, the fourth quarter OpEx relative to your guidance. John Morici : Yes. We saw added litigation expenses as we've been going -- as a part of our process that we have on the legal side. There's some added costs that we're showing there. And as Joe said, we added some salespeople, and some of that, those hires and those expenses came into fourth quarter. But we wanted people on the ground and ready to be able to sell and give us volume as soon as possible into 2019. So some of those costs hit there as well. Brandon Couillard : And coming back to ASPs for 2019. It would seem to imply that worldwide ASPs for the year would be down about 3% year-over-year. I understand currency is probably half of that. Mix is another dynamic. But would it be your expectation that promotional activity would be sort of consistent year-over-year? Or is there some cushion built-in perhaps for more, I guess, promo activity in '19 relative to last year? John Morici : I would say there's nothing that specifically that we're looking at additional promotions or others. We look at the business as various products and new products that come out, changes that we make. We look at promotions to better drive volume and drive uptake across the regions. So they vary by region, but nothing out of the ordinary. And we were pleased to see where ASPs finished and have a good expectation of -- given the positive growth internationally, the positive growth that we see on teens, and we're seeing strong non-comprehensive growth. All that taking into account keeps us flat for ASPs. Brandon Couillard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good afternoon, Thanks for time here. I wanted to focus on how you thought about incorporating any potential contribution from the sales force additions in the outlook for 2019. If I think back to -- in past years where there had been substantial adds to the sales force, something like 6 months after those [pit] hit the Street, we saw a benefit. So in 2019, are you modeling in any benefit from these rep adds that you may have already? If so, can you give us a sense for how big those might be? And I'm just curious. As we think about the outlook for the year, let's call it 25% on volumes, 25%, 27% in the first quarter, it just doesn't look like there's any anticipation of acceleration or benefit from those hires. John Morici : Yes, Steve. This is John. Yes, 6 months to 9 months is kind of the range you would expect to really start seeing those salespeople that you add once they're fully trained and have their territories and kind of hit. So we should see an acceleration in the second half given the adds that we have. And as we see, we factored in into our guide as much as we can see now based on those adds. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. And then I would agree with the comment that was made earlier about where the paranoia is going to shift. And so I just wanted, given in part in response to the many e-mails I've gotten here in the last 45 minutes or so, give you a chance to just comment on your thinking on competition. Is there any sign of competition being relevant in the field that you can pick out at this point or still the view that it's just not material, not something that people ought to be thinking about? Joseph Hogan : Steve, it's Joe. We -- obviously, we're seeing Ormco down in ANSI, and I think we saw recent announcement that they are going to kind of pace themselves as they go through 2019. I think you're seeing the same thing out of 3M, too. So honestly, we know you guys do surveys, and we read your surveys. We do our own or whatever. We know some of the docs out there trying these product lines. And we have access to some of the software that's going on out there and the product lines that they're representing or whatever. But I don't want to -- I don't diminish it. But as far as 2019 goes, we're not thinking about any major competitive issues that we're going to face in any of our key areas or key geographies right now. We think this will take some time for them to ramp. We've talked about this before. This business is not easy. You have to be able to hit on a lot of cylinders. You got to have a good sales force that touches the customers and can make that doctor feel really strong about the product line. Secondly, you have to have really good treatment planning and consistent treatment planning that can deliver. And third, you got to have an operation organization that can deliver these things in sequence and on time and on high quality. And putting those things together is difficult. And so 2019, we're not factoring in a huge amount of what we think is competitive pressure. Steve Beuchaw : Okay, got. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Erin Wright : Hey, thanks. A couple of international ones here. I guess, can you speak to the dynamics in terms of fundamental demand trends in China given the broader macro dynamics? And could you also speak to the competitive landscape and how that's evolving there? And then also on Brazil, just as you build out that market, any sort of surprises there that you're seeing in the broader traction in Brazil? Joseph Hogan : Yes. Erin, it's Joe. From a China standpoint, look, our demand there has been great. I think as I talked about in my opening, it's a really underpenetrated marketplace. And so -- and there's a lot of demand for our product lines. So our manufacturing investments we're making there, our treatment planning, all those things that make us a local company, we think will allow us to really penetrate that market at a higher rate. So look, I mean, we're not numb to the international scene right now, where people are concerned about China demand. We don't have anything to report right now that would say that we have a diminishing or a paranoia over China demand as we go into 2019. As far as competition over there, Erin, Angela Align is the most credible competitor that we have there. I would say that Angel has really focused on kind of Tier 3 cities in areas of China where we really focused on in the first 5 years or so of our logistics in China in Tier 1 or two cities, and moved into Tier 3. We don't feel that Angel is throttling our growth there at all. They are a fast follower. We see them in different areas that come after us. But we -- there's not a whole lot of head-to-head competition we feel right now, and I think that reflects not a whole lot about Angel being either good or bad. It just reflects the size of this marketplace and the investments you have to make in the sales force, how you really have to service that marketplace. There's a lot of work that you have to do. The channels just don't exist right now in the sense that you have to build those channels and really make them viable. So right now, we consider them a competitor and our largest competitor, I'd say, in the world, in the sense of a number of clear aligners that they supply. We don't look at them right now as slowing us down in China. And the Brazil surprise. I'd say that the surprises were always in Brazil. It's the Incredible uptake of our product line there. You saw the 1,300 doctors that we've trained there recently. They're so excited about the product line. It's -- we talked about Spain often in the sense of the uptick of our product in Spain and the growth there. We see the same kind of enthusiasm and the same kind of, what I would call, Latin enthusiasm for what our product can do and really bring to that area. So we look to make major investments there and increasing our sales force and our presence in the Brazilian area. We really feel good about Brazil from a standpoint of future growth of our product aligner. Erin Wright : Okay. Great. And a broader question on promotional activity. I'm just curious kind of what other promotional activity could you implement that isn't necessarily prized-driven, whether the co-marketing arrangements or other types of incentives. Is this something that it is in your game plan for 2019 or something that you're planning? Joseph Hogan : Erin, there's no lack of creativity in our commercial forces as promotions go, so there's a lot of adult supervision that we have to supply as we do those things. And what -- you can look at our [Adapt] program as a good one. That's a program where we're trying to take doctors to 80% Invisalign and really demonstrate, as I mentioned in my opening, is that when you get to a digital practice, when you get to 80%, first of all, no one goes back, no one goes back to wires and brackets. You really set a precedent that you have control over your practice. You don't have 30% of your cases resulting in emergencies. Doctors aren't spending 45 minutes a day with patients. It's just a much -- but you have to get to 80% to make that work. We'll continue to put money into that. That's not like a promotional program that we would offer at a lower price. That's just a program we work with docs that really want to get there. There's always promotional programs that we do that we offer aligners to staff at orthos that are starting up with us or also with GPs or whatever so that they can understand the product and have that experience and be able to communicate that well to patients. They come into the practice. Those are ongoing promotions that we do in all 3 geographies, too. We do have seasonal promotions at times in different countries at different areas. But I'd say that we have a -- this is outside of the third quarter issue obviously we reported on kind of ad nauseam over the last 6 months. We have a good handle right now on what promotions that we'll offer throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed. Ravi Misra : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to get into the kind of the gross margin outlook in the commentary that you were providing. Can you help us understand maybe what the pushes and takes are between the 1Q guidance and kind of the 4Q guidance ramp? And especially in terms of what's that fixed overhead that's strapped there, kind of the ball park? Is that somewhere around $10 million, $15 million a quarter right now that's annualized into your COGS on that that's going to fall off once the China sales ramp? John Morici : Yes. Ravi, it's John. It's not that high. But when we think of our operation that we've had to date, really it's been a -- it's treatment planning in Costa Rica, and it's been manufacturing in Mexico. We are now -- as we've been expanding our treatment planning and now expanding out to China manufacturing, it's -- we want volume. We want to better push volume through those centers and get as much productivity as possible. So as we see some of the volume in -- the margin impact in the fourth quarter, that continues a bit into the fourth quarter. But as that volume comes through and as you don't have to add as much overhead, you see more and more productivity to be able to come through those whether the treatment planning or the China manufacturing. And so we expect to see this kind of quarter-over-quarter of improvement through 2019 as we get more and more productive at these facilities. Ravi Misra : So it sounds like that's really going to be led by a step-up in the clear aligner gross margin versus the scanners? John Morici : Yes, definitely. When you look at kind of where we're seeing that volume leverage as we expand out globally, it'll be on the clear aligners side, and we should see that progress through the year. Ravi Misra : Right. And then maybe just 2 more questions. Just on the -- one on the orthodontics and then another kind of just on the consultations through the Invisalign brand experience. So just on the orthodontics step-down. I'm curious. That's the first time in, gosh, I think about 12, 14 quarters. I've seen that number stepped down. Any kind of impact -- I know you're saying that the impact from Ormco. 3M was kind of limited. But how about some of the other direct-to-consumer manufacturers there? Is that playing into that at all? And in the sense that, that end-user volume might actually be going down? And then second, you talked about the 85 -- I think the 85,000 people that have visited the store and gotten a consult. What's the conversion rate on that? Are those getting scans to actually becoming consumers of your product? Joseph Hogan : Ravi, Joe again. From a standpoint of Americas and orthodontics standpoint, again, I'll tell you we had our second best year in history following from the standpoint of overall orthodontic growth. When you talk about SDC, my feeling on SDC is they don't really take orthodontic cases. Remember, the normal orthodontist in the United States is 75% to 80% teen. You won't see many teens being done by SDC, and so those cases would primarily come out of GPs. Adults, kind of simple cases that are going on. As I mentioned, we had our highest GP sales rate ever in North America in 2018. So neither of those dimensions do I think that we or experience competition enthralling the business in some way whether it will affect us in 2019. As far as the Invisalign stores and the scan ratios, all those things, look, we just -- we're still working through this as well. We haven't released that information from an overall standpoint yet, and at some point in time when we think we're ready and we really have that ironed out. And I'd say that, Ravi, not that we're hiding anything. It's just we found that when you look at CCAs, we call it clear order in this business, this can take anywhere from 4 to 6 months to 7 months to really iron itself out. We see patients going and get scanned. And then there's a huge halo effect because when we do this local advertising, it benefits not just the doctors in the program but also in a broader sense, any doctor that's within that 10-mile or 15-mile range. So when we're really -- when we're ready to report this, we'll report it in a broad sense to that halo effect, the whole, what you talked about, the conversion rate and also what that means from a timing standpoint, okay? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed. John Kreger : Thanks. Joe, a few times on the call, I think you talk about your view that it's sort of critical to get your customers to really make the digital conversion of their practices. Can you just talk a bit more about what that really means? And is that an expense on your part? Obviously, it's got some positive implications for volumes if and when it happens. But what are the sort of practical implications of getting an ortho practice to make that transition? Thanks. Joseph Hogan : John, that's a good question. There's 3 key parameters, right, is first of all, there's extended payment terms that you have to deal with. Because when you go with a clear aligner product versus wires and brackets, their cost overall are about 4x from a variable cost standpoint of which you'd have with wires and brackets. So you just have to get ready for that cash play and try in some way to extend those kinds of payments. Secondly, you have to look at their workflows. Because when you really go to a full digital practice, it changes completely really. We find out in our [Adapt] program that you need fewer chairs but you'd need more consultation rooms to put people in, to show them simulations, to talk them through what it would be. With no emergency cases, it completely redefines in the sense of how a day goes in a doctor's office. It's not 30% of the time are people scrambling around trying to find someone that can fix something to occur with wires and brackets in some way. And then third is a demand component, is you're going to have to drive more demand within that practice, which Invisalign does. And so obviously, with $100 million spend that we do a year in attracting patients and moving them into doctors, how we pipe those patients into doctors, how they prepare themselves for both teens and adults to do that. So it's on those 3 dimensions. And John, specifically on the Adapt program, we're just going through that program right now and how we'll offer that to customers and whether it will cost to actually do that to customers at that point. And after we've done probably 5 to 8 of these and have them complete, we'll have a better story in the sense of -- a more complete story in the sense of here is how we'll do it, what those costs will be. But don't look at those as being overly broad. Remember, we have iPro today that we basically use to take customers through clinical kind of episodes. So we have our concierge service that grabs patients to move them through doctors, too. So the big components of operations that you need to work around the Adapt , we have those in place. We just have to modify them more to this 80% or digital treatment play. John Kreger : Very helpful. One quick one, John. As you think about the '19 outlook that you described for us, what sort of number of stores is that envisioned by year-end? John Morici : Yes, we have 12 as we noted now. It's really not a material change from that. We're evaluating what's best locations, what makes sense for us. But we really want to drive productivity and conversion at the stores we have before we go on a larger scale. John Kreger : Okay. So we shouldn't expect that to be materially different by December of '19? John Morici : That's correct. John Kreger : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed. Steven Valiquette : Thanks, good afternoon, everybody. So I guess just given the ramp in investments in 2019, likely some slower EPS growth. I kind of feel that 2019 is maybe somewhat similar to what Align went through back in 2015, where that was, let's call it, somewhat of a throwaway year for earnings growth because of heavy spending. But then the company came out of that and really had 3 strong years of growth in 2016 through 2018. I know it's a different management team back in 2015. But should we draw really any sort of parallels through 2019? Or maybe you're just setting yourself up for another strong earnings growth cycle in the next couple of years beyond 2019 with the investments that you're making this year? Joseph Hogan : Steve, it's Joe. I think first of all, I'd say we play offense in this business. So even though we talk about restructuring or if we talk about adding salespeople, when we talk about defending our IP, all of those things are, to me, setting a foundation for future growth in the business. When you sit back and you look at this business, we're incredibly underpenetrated based on consumer preference for clear aligners to move teeth and also the size of the market that digital opens up even beyond, the 12 million orthodontic case starts that we talk about globally. So please don't call 2019 a throwaway year. Hopefully, the earnings and the growth that we're projecting here are substantial. And we haven't even mentioned the law of large number on you guys over the last 3 years, right? Because we continue to build these huge percentages over top incredibly larger numbers than what we had previously. So I look at this as -- don't -- look at is as these are aggressive investments in a young business to lay a foundation to allow us to be better in the future. And that's -- we have to take these. Steven Valiquette : Yes. I guess a quick follow-up to that, which is the, how important is consistent EPS growth at Align at this stage of the corporate life cycle? Or it's just still mainly about driving top line growth for all the things that you just mentioned? John Morici : Steve, this is John. It's both. I mean, we want to drive top line. We want to be able to grow this business. As Joe mentioned, we're vastly underpenetrated, and we have products and technology to be able to increase that market. But at the same time, we want to be able to grow profitably. And as we layer on some of these investments, we expect -- whether it's China or sales force addition or others that we're adding in, over time, we'll be able to see those benefits. And that over time, as we laid out, is over 2019. We should see that sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter as those investments start to pay off as we move forward. But we want to make sure that we're returning the most back to our shareholders, and that comes from revenue growth and the volume that we drive as well as doing this from a profitability standpoint. And we're very aware of the long-term growth model, and we stick with that. Steven Valiquette : Okay, got. Thanks. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Steve. Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB-Leerink. Please proceed. Richard Newitter : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, I was just wondering -- I know you guys are still -- it's still really, really early days in China, and the opportunities are enormous, including your growth rate in that region, haven't really shown any slowdown. But can you just talk a little bit about what -- we've seen some headlines and some other companies talking about the macro slowdown in China and the consumer discretionary realm. Can you give us your thoughts from the way you see things? Clearly, you're investing, so I would imagine there's nothing there that would suggest there's any slow in growth. But what are you seeing kind of at the ground level in terms of the macro? Joseph Hogan : I mean, we - like I mentioned before, Richard, this is -- the growth that we saw throughout 2018 was really strong in China. I mean, obviously, we're making these investments in China. It's a commitment. They are the second largest country in the world right now. The under-penetration, the opportunity there is huge. Look, I mean, we're up with global events. We see the issues going on with China and United States. And hopefully, they'll come to a trade deal sooner or later. I look at that investment. When I talked about manufacturing there, it is moving closer and having a Chinese business and being able to operate in that country with a lot of fluidity. But it also makes me feel good that we have a good insurance policy in the sense of the trade dynamics between the two countries, too. So right now, again, we haven't seen what other companies are reporting. I think the penetration piece we're talking about is probably maybe the variable of difference between the two. We're not saying that we're recession-proof ever. I think that's a ridiculous position to take. But what we've seen right now in the growth rates and what we've been experiencing, right now, we're looking for a good 2019 in China. Richard Newitter : Excellent. And just if you could maybe just -- maybe you mentioned it earlier, mandibular advancement. What's contemplated? Or how are you thinking about the contribution in 2019? Should we think of that launch kind of hitting the ground running right off the bat? Is that more of a gradual cadence? And what's contemplated in the outlook? Joseph Hogan : I'll take the high level of it. John, take the specific level. But remember, MAF was just approved in November of 2018. As you can see, we have -- I expect our normal uptick in the United States, which is -- what those will do, 2 or 3 cases and get used to it. It's a phenomenal product. It really is. To think you straighten your teeth. It can move your mandible forward in that sense and build bone. It's just -- it's incredible. But when it's something that big and that revolutionary, doctors -- orthos are conservative anyway. And obviously, they're going to take their time in the sense of proving it. Now [indiscernible] MAF has been outside the United States for a while, too. So we have, I think, 17,000 cases we talked about that we've gone through it. What's really interesting, too, is we have several updates from [Jelco] and the engineering team on MAF also. When teeth are shorter, how you arrange your aligners to make it work, making sure the wings are a lot stronger than before. So this is approved in the United States. We think we've significantly improved the product over the last 12 months, too. Now we find, too, is just the great halo effect around MAF and Teen. If you start to do more MAF, you do more Teen. And so we're looking forward to that. But again, it's new days in the United States, and we'll give you updates as we go through the year. John Morici : And so when we look at our forecast and we think about flat ASPs, this is one that helps us. This is a positive move back to our ASPs because it's a full case, it's a teen case, it's complicated. Like Joe said, it gives us more and more teen volume, and we look at that as favorable mix and favorable growth for us. Shirley Stacy : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to catching up with you at subsequent conferences. And if you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day.",

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the first quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Clear aligners and intraoral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results, discuss our outlook for the second quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. Our first quarter was a very good start to the year with revenues, volumes, gross margin in EPS all above our guidance. Record Q1 revenues and Invisalign volumes were up 25.6% and 28.3% year-over-year respectively. Reflecting continued strong growth across all geographies and customer channels as well as strong iTero Scanner and Services revenues, which are up 55.1% year-over-year. Q1 sequential growth was driven primarily by North America and EMEA volumes reflecting strength across the Invisalign product portfolio. We saw a nice uptick in adoption of Invisalign treatment with a record utilization overall as well as expansion of our customer base, which totaled 57,000 active doctors worldwide in Q1. Now let's turn to the specifics around our first quarter results starting with the Americas region. For the Americas region, Q1 was a solid quarter with Invisalign case volume up 7.1% sequentially and 21.8% year-over-year reflecting growth in both our orthodontic and GP Dentists channel. Q1 we trained 1,700 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region of which 1,400 were North American doctors. On a sequential basis Q1 Invisalign volume growth reflects record utilization for the Americas region overall driven by North American Orthros at 18.3 cases per doctor with good initial adoption with Invisalign mandibular advancement in North America driven by the mid-Q4 launch in the U.S.  We also had solid performance from GP Dentists with continued momentum from Invisalign Lite, Invisalign Go. Invisalign Go provides a simple pathway for dentists to integrate mild to moderate tooth movement and to comprehensive care. And it makes it easy for GPs to refer out more complex cases to orthodontics in the network. Year-over-year Q1 Invisalign volume growth in the Americas region was driven by continued strength in the Ortho channel, especially from our high volume doctors with 25.9% growth as well as an increase of 15.5% from the GP channel. In March, we announced the collaboration with Digital Smile Design or we call it DSD, a leader in holistic digital dentistry solutions for dental clinics, which features the Invisalign System and iTero element scanners as a digital solution of choice for tooth movement and scanning. As part of the cooperation Align and DSD will deliver dedicated education programs, enable simplified, streamlined integration of digital end-to-end workflows into GP practices and offer doctors more opportunities to learn about digital tools and treatment planning support. We also continue to make great progress in Latin America, led by Brazil. In Q1, Invisalign volume and Latin America was up significantly year-over-year reflecting our ongoing investments as we continue to build our business in the region. Training over 300 Invisalign doctors during the quarter. Next month I'll be in Brazil with the executive team hosting a major customer event with more than 200 doctors discussing the future of digital orthodontics including the science and technology behind both the Invisalign System as well as our iTero Scanners. We\u2019ll also have local social media influences on hand as we kick off our very first Invisalign consumer campaign in Brazil and plan to live stream portions of the event to more than 500 doctors across the region.  For our international business Q1 was another good quarter with strong Invisalign volume growth at 38.5% year-over-year reflecting increased Invisalign utilization and continued expansion of our customer base in both EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. On a sequential basis international volume was up slightly reflecting strong growth in the EMEA region and offset somewhat by seasonally lower period in Asia Pacific as expected. In Q1 we trained over 2,400 new Invisalign doctors internationally split roughly between each of the two regions. In EMEA Q1 was a strong quarter with volumes up 37.4% year-over-year driven by growth across the region with record Invisalign volumes in all but one country led by Iberia and France. We saw strength across the Invisalign product portfolio with continued momentum from Invisalign First and Invisalign Go. We also continue to see strong growth across our key expansion markets as well, led by the Nordics and Benelux. For APAC, Q1 Invisalign volume increased 40.4% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong growth from nearly all country markets, led by China, Japan, and ANZ. We also had a strong uptick in teenage patients in Q1, due in part to a teen promotion in China offered along with our Teen-edge sales program, intended to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment with teenagers. We also had strong growth from GP Dentists, which were up 63.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Q1 was flat as expected, due primarily to a seasonally slower period with the lunar New Year holiday. During Q1, we trained nearly 1,100 new doctors in APAC, over half of which were in China, and we opened our second state-of-the-art training facility in China, located in Shanghai. Our new manufacturing facility in Ziyang, China is continuing to ramp, and while we are making good progress, we still expect it to take a couple of quarters to fully transition aligner fabrication from Juarez, Mexico to Ziyang, China to serve the Chinese market and expect manufacturing overhead in Ziyang to be underutilized during this transition period. Overall for the teen market, in Q1 nearly 100,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 41.1% year-over-year driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions \u2013 especially in APAC and EMEA regions. For Q1, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North Americas Orthodontists increased 29.2% and International doctors were up 67.2%. Invisalign First and Invisalign treatment with Mandibular Advancement continue to ramp globally and are helping to increase our share of teenagers and younger patients worldwide. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased to see that use of Invisalign treatment among teenagers continues to outpace adults and that Invisalign First is driving a really strong growth kid and tweens in the kid/tween segment. We\u2019ll continue to drive utilization and growth in our Americas\u2019 teen business this year with the first Invisalign Teen Summit in July. We know that Summits increase engagement and Invisalign adoption, so for the first time we\u2019re focusing a Summit program completely on teen treatment and teen culture, including a tie-in to 2019 VidCon, the top teen culture and community event. Teen Summit is designed to turn low teen submitters into high teen submitters by combining Invisalign specific clinical and practice \"how tos\" with an immersive teen culture experience. Our consumer marketing efforts are designed to build the category and drive demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor\u2019s office. We invest over $100 million each year in consumer marketing programs including TV, digital and social media, PR, event marketing and our Patient Concierge service. Our goals are to make the Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor\u2019s office. In Q1, we continued to see strong digital engagement with consumers reaching nearly 4 million unique visitors on Invisalign.com sites worldwide for a total of 53 million visitors to date. Other key metrics show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q1 quarterly slides. In March, we launched a new online tool called SmileView at the International Dental Show IDS in Cologne, Germany. SmileView is designed to help prospective Invisalign patients visualize a new, straighter smile before they opt for Invisalign treatment. Within 60 seconds of taking a smile selfie using the SmileView online tool with their smartphone or tablet, prospective patients can see what their new smile and straighter teeth may look like, with their own facial features. SmileView is available on line, or in GP practices in beta testing in the UK and the U.S. and we are getting really positive feedback. In North America, we continued to invest in strong digital plans for adults and teens. Our teen focused content developed by Awesomeness TV, the fastest growing youth channel and teen influencer program helps strengthen our brand presence among teens and parents, making Invisalign relevant and fun. During South by Southwest, we reached adult consumers with an immersive experience with a RealSelf House and Modern Beauty, where consumers can learn more about Invisalign and see a simulation of their future smile using Invisalign SmileView technology. And Invisalign was voted by consumers as a Most Worth It treatment, continuing to demonstrate continued strength of consumers. In EMEA, we held a recruitment drive for our Influencer Program called Invisalign Smile Squad generating over 100 plus new influencer applications and 350 plus doctor registrations to take part in the program. And our Parent of Teen campaign went live in UK and France \u2013 raising awareness amongst a new consumer audience. Q2 will see the launch of our revised patient journey with media campaign strategy for focused markets, better integrating new conversion tools like SmileView and Concierge into the journey. In APAC, we continued to build awareness for Invisalign treatment through use of paid media and our influencer campaign, including expansion of our influencer program in the region and a pilot Invisalign First social media campaign to target parents of younger children. To leverage increasing consumer awareness and demand, we also began to expand the Invisalign Concierge program that connects interested consumers with Invisalign doctors for treatment into new countries. Globally, in the second half of the year, we will launch a new consumer advertising campaign that emphasizes the importance of doctor led treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, while also differentiating our brand. On the professional marketing side, we recently launched two dedicated professional Invisalign brand campaigns that feature Orthodontists and GP Dentists. The Ortho as Hero campaign focuses on Invisalign orthodontists as critical leaders and the heroes of transformative, life-changing smiles, especially for teen and younger patients. The campaign showcases modern orthodontics practices that leverage digital approaches to treatment and are warm and inviting. The Go Beyond campaign is designed to celebrate dentists who go above and beyond every day to serve their patients. It also demonstrates the relevance of tooth movement to General Dentists and the importance of integrating Invisalign within comprehensive dentistry. This was launched in North America, and is now being rolled out in the EMEA and APAC regions. For iTero scanner and services business, iTero revenues increased 55.1% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength growth across all geographies and customer channels. On a sequential basis, revenues were down 9.8% sequentially, as expected, reflecting lower scanner sales following a strong Q4 and consistent with the seasonality in the capital equipment business partially offset by continued growth in services revenues due to the increasing install base. During the quarter, we launched the new iTero Element 5D Imaging System for comprehensive preventative and restorative oral care at the International Dental Show. The iTero Element 5D scanner is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3D, intra-oral color and NIRI images or near-infrared images and enables comparison over time using iTero TimeLapse. Integrated 3D, intra-oral color and NIRI technology of the new iTero 5D Imaging System aids in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions above the gingiva without using harmful radiation. The iTero Element 5D scanner is available for sale in the majority of European and APAC countries, and is not yet available in the United States or Latin America. Cumulatively, 13.5 million orthodontic scans and 3.6 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q1, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 76% from 67.3%. In Q1 last year, international scans increased to 59.3% up from 43.5% in the same quarter last year. Within the Americas, 91.2% of cases submitted by North American Orthos were submitted digitally. And China remains at 45% for the quarter. We continue to anticipate that in another year or two, nearly all Invisalign cases will be submitted digitally \u2013 primarily through an iTero scanner. Given our continued progress and increased use of digital scans for Invisalign case submission, we continue to get questions regarding interoperability with other third-party scanners. With recent product introductions, we want to make sure we are clear about which scanners are not qualified to submit Invisalign case submissions. We developed an interoperability matrix that has been distributed to our sales and customer facing teams to help inform doctors. It also included our Q1 2019 conference call slides. So please reference it for more detail. However, to ensure there is no confusion in the marketplace then I quickly reiterate our interoperability position on this call with two new scanners, the Trios 4 and Primescan. Regarding the Trios 4, Align will not qualify Trios 4, or any future 3Shape scanner product, for Invisalign interoperability in the U.S. or globally. Regarding Primescan, Align has received a request from Dentsply/Sirona to evaluate Primescan for Invisalign case submissions and we are considering that request. Until we make a decision to move forward and can conduct testing, Primescan is not qualified for Invisalign case submissions. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to update you on two other important topics. Our plans to reorganize Align\u2019s corporate entity structure to better align with the growing international nature of our business, and the recent settlement agreement with Straumann. First, our plans to reorganize our corporate entity structure : Given the rapid expansion of our business globally, we must continue to scale and optimize our operations to help support our growth and financial profile. In March, we announced internally that we would be making changes to our EMEA headquarters located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Specifically, we will relocate our current EMEA Headquarters and move the majority of our corporate functions : Finance, IT, HR, Legal, and Regional EMEA Marketing from Amsterdam to Switzerland. We will begin the transition to the new headquarter location mid-year and expect to complete it in 2020 early. We will maintain an Amsterdam office to support local commercial operations. In addition, in August we will be relocating our current Order Acquisition or OA facility from Amsterdam to Poland to create a centralized operational hub for EMEA co-located with our new Treatment Planning facility that we just opened. This new hub in Poland will include iTero business operations, customer success and clinical support teams, and IT operations. As we evaluated our options, relocating our EMEA headquarters to Switzerland quickly became our top choice on many factors including : a more favorable and stable operating environment. An opportunity to accelerate our transition to a more decentralized commercial structure for EMEA that reflects the localization we\u2019ve been working toward. A more centralized geographic location in Europe within EMEA\u2019s largest potential market. An available talent pool to support key strategic roles required in the new EMEA headquarters. While we expect these proposed changes will allow us to obtain financial and operational efficiencies, it was a difficult decision to make and we are committed to supporting our impacted employees throughout this transition. Moving onto the settlement agreement with Straumann. On March 28, we announced a settlement with the Straumann Group to settle patent disputes with ClearCorrect, who was purchased by Straumann in 2017. As many of you know, for years Align has been engaged in complicated, multi-country, multi-court patent litigation with ClearCorrect. The settlement with Straumann ends all current and pending litigation and provides $35 million in settlement fees to Align. In addition, we have signed a non-binding letter of intent, LOI with Straumann for an iTero development and distribution agreement. If we reach an agreement, Straumann will purchase and distribute 5,000 iTero scanners over the next five years and co-fund development with us to integrate Straumann\u2019s digital workflow into those scanners. The letter of intent we\u2019ve signed is non-binding, which means either one of us can walk away from the LOI. However, if we don\u2019t reach a development and distribution agreement with Straumann by early July, Straumann will pay us an additional $16 million, for a total of $51 million. We have always been passionate about defending our intellectual property and the hard work and innovation by the Align team that it represents. We\u2019ll continue to do that and to protect our technology through all the ways that our legal system provides. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenue for the first quarter was $549 million, up 2.8% from the prior quarter and up 25.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth includes $16.5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. For Clear aligners, Q1 revenue of $469.2 million was up 5.3% sequentially on strong Invisalign volume from North America and EMEA, and higher than expected Invisalign ASPs. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 21.7% reflected strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies. Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially by approximately $10 to $1,245 reflecting favorable impacts from FX and product mix shift, partially offset by higher promotions. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign ASPs were down $65 primarily reflecting promotional discounts, unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift, partially offset by price increases in July 2018. Total Q1 Invisalign shipments of 349,000.2 cases were up 4.6% sequentially and up 28.3% year-over-year. For Americas Orthodontists, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up 9.5% sequentially and up 25.9% year-over-year. For Americas GP Dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 3.5% sequentially and up 15.5% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 1.3% sequentially and up 38.5% year-over-year. Our Scanner and Services revenue for the first quarter was $79.8 million, down 9.8% sequentially due to seasonality as Q4 is typically stronger due to end of the year capital equipment purchases. Year-over-year revenue was up 55.1%, primarily due to higher scanner units across regions and related service revenues. Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 73.2%, up 1.5 points sequentially and down 1.7 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 74.9%, up 0.8 points sequentially primarily due to improved manufacturing leverage, approximately $4 million of one-time benefits related to freight refunds and rebates, and seasonally lower training costs, partially offset by higher number of aligners per case. Clear aligner gross margin was down 2.1 points year-over-year primarily due to higher number of aligners per case, lower ASPs, partially offset by favorable manufacturing leverage, and one-time benefits related to freight refunds and rebates as described above, along with lower doctor training costs. Scanner gross margin for the first quarter was 63.6%, up 3.7 points sequentially and up 4.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs and one-time benefits related to freight refunds along with manufacturing efficiencies. Q1 operating expenses were $314.4 million, up sequentially 19.7% and up 37.2% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses reflects continued investment in sales and R&D activities, along with higher legal/consulting expenses, as well as increased compensation related expenses due to higher headcount and our planned annual increase in employee compensation programs, partially offset by seasonally lower advertising spending. Additionally, our Q1 operating expenses include impairments and other charges related to Invisalign Store closures of $29.8 million. Our first quarter operating income was $87.7 million, down 27.2% sequentially and down 10.7% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating income is primarily attributed to higher operating expenses offset in part by higher gross profit. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in operating income primarily reflects higher operating expenses commensurate from growth, which includes charges related to our Invisalign Store closures. Our first quarter operating margin was 16%, down 6.6 points sequentially and down 6.5 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily due to higher operating expenses and the Invisalign Store closure costs, partially offset by higher gross margin. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily due to higher operating expenses and Invisalign Store closure costs and lower gross margin. The Q1 operating margin impact from the store closures was approximately 540 basis points. With regards to first quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 10.4% which includes approximately $12 million of excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation from restricted stock vesting during the quarter and approximately $8 million of discrete tax benefit related to the tax impact on the Invisalign Store closure costs. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.89, down $0.31 sequentially and down $0.28 compared to the prior year. Invisalign Store related closure costs, net of tax, impacted Q1 diluted EPS by approximately $0.28. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31st, 2019, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments were $732.5 million, a decrease of $11.9 million from the prior quarter which is primarily from $50 million used to repurchase approximately 205,000 shares of our stock. Of the $732.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $372.6 million was held in the US and $359.9 million was held by our International entities. Q1 accounts receivable balance was $479.3 million, up approximately 9.2% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 78 days, up four days sequentially and up four days from Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $117.2 million, up $39.9 million compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $35.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow for the first quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $81.9 million. During Q1, we've purchased on the open market approximately 200,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $243.42 per share, including commission for an aggregate purchase price of approximately of $50 million. We have $450 million remaining available for repurchase under the May 2018 Repurchase Program. Also, during the first quarter, we adopted the new lease standard and now record operating leases \u2013 lease assets and related liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, however, there was no significant impact to our operating results. With that, let's turn to our Q/Q outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. For International, we expect Q2 volumes to be up sequentially reflecting seasonally stronger periods for both EMEA and APAC regions. For the Americas, we expect Q2 volumes to be up sequentially reflecting growth across all key markets, as well as a seasonally stronger period for North America orthodontists with the beginning of the summer teen season. We expect our iTero business to be up sequentially coming off of a slower period for capital equipment in Q1. And, regarding Smile Direct Club, we expect almost no clear aligner volume from SDC in Q2. With this as a backdrop, we expect the second quarter to shape up as follows : Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 380,000 to 385,000 cases, up approximately 26% to 27% year-over-year. We expect Q2 revenues to be in the range of $590 million to $600 million, up approximately 20% to 22% year-over-year. Our Q2 revenue outlook assumes almost no SDC volume compared to the same quarter a year ago, when aligners supplied to SDC contributed $8.6 million to revenue. We expect Q2 gross margin to be in the range of 71.5% to 72.5%. Q2 gross margin is sequentially lower than Q1 due to the one-time benefits of approximately 1% realized in Q1 that we do not expect to repeat. We expect Q2 operating expenses to be in the range of $277 million to $282 million, which includes a one-time benefit of approximately $30 million from our Straumann settlement gain, net of our estimated costs for the iTero development agreement. Q2 operating expenses reflect continued investments in sales, marketing and R&D including increased consumer media/advertising spend, as well as higher legal fees and costs related to our corporate structure reorganization announced last quarter. Q2 operating margin should be in a range of 24.5% to 25.4%, which includes the expected benefit from the Straumann settlement gain mentioned above and approximately 2% negative impact to operating margin due to higher legal fees and costs related to our corporate structure reorganization. Note, as we described on our Q4 earnings call in January, we expect the impact from higher legal and corporate structure reorganization costs to be about 1.5% to 2% for the full year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. Diluted shares outstanding is expected to be approximately 80.6 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q2 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.47 to $1.54. Q2 diluted EPS guidance includes $0.28 gain from the Straumann settlement and $0.10 gain from the SDC equity settlement, net of the income tax effects, and approximately $0.09 expense related to the corporate structure reorganization costs and higher legal/litigation costs. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect CapEx for Q2 to be approximately $85 million to $90 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $20 million to $22 million. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks John. Overall Q1 was another solid quarter and I'm pleased with the continued progress we're making and executing on our strategic growth drivers and I'm excited about the opportunity we have. Just want to highlight those four growth drivers here for the quarter. From an international expansion standpoint Invisalign volume was up 38.5%. On our Ortho/Teen Utilization our worldwide Invisalign Teen patients growth was over 41%. GP Treat and Refer, leading with iTero scanners, our worldwide GP volumes for Invisalign were up 27.3% and 15.5% for GPs in the Americas. And iTero scanner revenues were up 55.1%. Consumer and patient conversion with Invisalign treatment, we engaged with 4 million consumers globally in Q1 and are building the most recognized orthodontic brand in the industry. In Q2, we have a number of exciting programs and initiatives heading into the summer season kicking off with the AAO in early May, and the Invisalign Symposium on the Digital Practice in London, which is our first ever truly global event and designed to foster a global community of Invisalign doctors. The symposium will bring together 300 of the most experienced and most high volume Invisalign orthodontists from across the world to discuss the digital orthodontics and the challenges and opportunities digital transformation provides their practices. Finally, before I open the call up for questions, I want to take a minute to welcome Raj Pudipeddi who joined Align last month as Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, CMO, reporting to me. Raj joins us with more than 24 years of business leadership experience and brand building experience for companies including Procter & Gamble and Bharti Airtel, an Indian telecom leader. He has an outstanding track record of delivering results across the North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Raj also brings great consumer acumen and marketing expertise in terms of building brands, launching new products and accelerating digital businesses globally. His knowledge and understanding of how to leverage big data and consumer personalization will be instrumental as we continue to lead the transformation of digital orthodontics and dentistry and help millions of consumers get a smile they love with Invisalign doctors. Raj is a strong addition to our leadership team and I am thrilled to have him on board. With that, I want to thank you again for joining our call. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. We\u2019ll see many of you at the American Association of Orthodontist Meeting in Los Angeles next month, as well as the upcoming financial conferences including BankAmerica Merrill Lynch, Northcoast, Stifel, Goldman Sachs and William Blair. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erin Wright With Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Erin? Shirley Stacy : Hi, Erin, are you there? Operator : Please check as if your line is mute. Erin Wright : Apologies. Can you hear me now? Operator : Yes. Shirley Stacy : Hi, Erin. Joe Hogan : Hi, Erin. Erin Wright : Hi. So on the gross margin, how should we be thinking about the run rate for the remainder of the year? I understand there was an onetime factors in freight refunds, rebates. Are there other moving parts we should be thinking about in the second quarter from a gross margin perspective? And more broadly, can you characterize how we should be thinking about that longer-term leverage to that metric over the next few years? Thanks. John Morici : Hi, Erin, this is John. Yes, what we saw \u2013 in Q1, we saw good improvement in our gross margin, we talked about 4 million of some of the unusual, you strip that out. What we expect as we go forward in our Q2 guidance is that progression, we're going to continue to improve our gross margin, some of that comes to some of the operational efficiencies in China and other places that we'll see as the year progresses. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then can you speak to some of the incremental cost and opportunities associated with this reorganization of your corporate entity structure? Are there incremental costs there from what you said in the fourth quarter? And what are those longer-term financial efficiencies that this can generate from a tax perspective or from an operational perspective as well? John Morici : Yeah, Erin, this is John again. So no additional than what we had talked about. We laid out from a reorganization standpoint about 1% in total for the year. And that'll really progress with Q2 on, but really what we see is a more agile organization and one, that can accommodate changes to any global changes that might come up around taxes or anything else. So that's really the benefits that we have. EMEA is growing so much as centralized as that location, but it also gives us an operating structure that we can use in the future. Erin Wright : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon guys, can you hear me okay? Hey Joe, how are you? Joe Hogan : Great. Jeff Johnson : Let me start with you and then \u2013 Hey, all. So let me start with you, Joe, and then I have a question for John as well on the margin front. But Joe, with the store shut down here in April, I guess, what are you seeing impact wise on volumes maybe in the near-term, whether that's 2Q or over the next couple quarters? And then how might that impact how you allocate some expenses this year? Is there some way you can reallocate those expenses into other kind of growth initiatives, whether that's with DSO or other private docs or what have you? Joe Hogan : Hey Jeff, first of all, I mean I think we \u2013 when we announced this issue with SDC having to close the stores, they just said it wasn't going to be material from a revenue standpoint and what we \u2013 for the year and so we're sticking with that overall. I mean, obviously there'll be some case loss from a store standpoint. The other part of your question is we shift some of that spend back into advertising back into other activities that we have going on to help to drive that demand. So we are \u2013 we will reallocate that expense, it's reallocated into marketing and sales and be able to do that. And we expect to have good results from that too. We have I think good experience and understanding what that investment return rate is. Jeff Johnson : All right, that's helpful. Thanks. And then John on the margin front, I mean if I exclude some of the onetime costs in the 1Q, it seems like your operating margin probably would have beaten by maybe 500 basis points or so relative to your guidance. And then if I take into account the gains in 2Q, it seems like margins are going to be down 400 basis points, 500 basis points year-over-year, and the 2Q, which is kind of worse than we were thinking. So I guess I'm just trying to get my arms around kind of volatility around margins. Is there more volatility x the noise in the base business going on right now? Is there just conservatism in your base business guidance for 2Q? How should we think about kind of recent and future margin trends? John Morici : Yes, so from a \u2013 you\u2019re talking about specific gross margin, when you look at that, we're seeing good improvement from some of the manufacturing efficiencies and things that happened in the first quarter. We expect that to continue, we saw ASPs up $10 in Q1, which helps contribute to that. But this is about being able to continue to leverage the manufacturing and the other operations that we have. And that should continue to get better as the year progresses. And so that's similar to what we talked about at the end of Q4 as well. This is something that we \u2013 we\u2019ll get those efficiencies as the year progresses. Jeff Johnson : Well, let me just clarify, I guess that question and focus just on the first quarter x the charges in the 1Q, it seems like your margin probably beat even at the operating line by almost 500 basis points relative to your guidance because I think your guidance did not anticipate these onetime store closure costs in that. So what drove that upside and how did you get the 500 basis points of upside in the quarter? John Morici : Yes. So really when we saw, as we looked through it Jeff, we saw like I said some improvement on the gross margin standpoint, some of the OpEx leverage that we are able to achieve in the first quarter as well and that started our year in a very strong position from an operating margin standpoint. And then as we go through the year as we've talked about, there'll be some litigation and some reorganization costs that we've been calling out, as we go through. But it was really a strong start to the year from a gross margin standpoint and then managing the op-Expenditures and we saw that leverage really show up in Q1. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Joe Hogan : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hey, Jon. Jon Block : Great. Thanks guys, good afternoon. I'm also going to ask a margin related question, and then on pivot. But just John big normalized EPS be it for 1Q, obviously there's been sort of no shortage of news flow over the past couple of months. So I just wanted to check in, I'm going to drill down or make sure that I'm clear on the op margins. In other words, if I were to check it on the 2H 2019 op margin, should I get back to the 25% to 30% OM range, that you will alluded to last quarter? That's sort of part A of number one. And then part B would be, your 2Q revenue guidance, the revs are slightly ahead with the cases of smidge below. So do we assume a sort of flattish 1Q to 2Q ASP? And then I'll ask my second one. John Morici : Okay. Yes, from an op margin standpoint and what we tried to do is lay that out a little bit in the slides for you, Jon, but when we look at as we've reported on a gap basis, just talk to the high guide of 25.4% from a guidance standpoint. And we're staying within there because that's GAAP, within there is a Straumann settlement of approximately 5 points. And then we have some of the corporate structure and reorganization costs, as well as the legal cost. And you back out or add back a couple of points to that. So that gets you to 22.5% or so from an op margin standpoint in Q2 on an operational basis. Jon Block : John, I'm sure if I could jump in there really quick. I didn't mean 2Q, I meant 2H, last quarter you talked about 2H 2019 op margins falling back in your long-term guidance range of 25% to 30%, here we are today. Do you still have high conviction in 2H 2019 the op margins are 25% to 30%. John Morici : Yes, sorry, Jon, yes. In the second half the conviction that we have and what we expect to have in the second half is consistent, it's the 25% range in the second half of the year. Jon Block : Okay. And then the implied ASPs for 2Q flattish with 1Q, is that the quick ballpark demand? John Morici : That \u2013 there is a little bit of FX from 1Q to Q2, but essentially flat. Jon Block : Okay, great. And then for 1Q 2019, Simon EMEA growth rate is now within 300 bips relative to Julie's, which I view as a good thing from a diversification standpoint and congrats to Simon, who I know has been chasing Julie for several years. But I'm just curious how we should think about that going forward, especially with the scanner that's technically newer in China. And Joe, you talked about the teen opportunity in China. Do we think that, call it closer to parity Joe is here to stay? Or is there anything unique in one market or the other, teen I go scanner that can cause APAC to sort of separate again. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Hey, Jon, I think first of all you've got to take cyclicality into \u2013 in fact when you look at China and APAC versus EMEA, EMEA goes around the dark side of the moon right after the second quarter, China has really strong third quarter like they always do, get to Lunar New Year in the fourth quarter, you got a stronger EMEA in the first quarter. So I think you can't do this kind of an apples-to-oranges comparison when you look at what Simon did this quarter. So what I would take away from this one is you got a continuing growth rate in EMEA and continuing penetration rates there that are terrific. We still have a great business in APAC from a growth standpoint overall. So I love the competition between those two. I'm cheering for them both, Jon. Jon Block : Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Nathan Rich : Hi, this is Nathan Rich on for Bob this evening. Maybe just going back to ASPs, it looks like you saw a pretty nice step up sequentially in the quarter mostly on the international side. Could you maybe just talk about what came in better than expectations in the quarter? And then you kind of talked about the 2Q guidance for ASPs to be flat, but it does seem like you're seeing some nice progression there relative to your kind of full year guidance for ASPs to be flat to 4Q of last year. So how should we think about the progression of ASPs going forward over the balance of the year? John Morici : Hey Nate, this is John. Similar to what we've said in the past where we see better comprehensive cases like we saw I think compared to what we had expected, driven by mandibular advancement and other products that we have, that was in the teen growth that we saw, the 41%. That all contributes to higher ASP that showed up in Q1. And when we think about \u2013 as we're looking forward, take FX out of that, we think that the \u2013 it's pretty balanced. We'll have that \u2013 overall, we'll have a good international growth, we have that growth in the comprehensive cases with teens, but then we have the low stage mix shift that we see, where the low stage is growing faster than our comprehensive cases. But in balance, we think it's \u2013 it balances out. Nathan Rich : Okay. That makes sense. And then, Joe, maybe one for you. The ortho utilization in the quarter was very impressive. Can you maybe just talk to kind of what's resonating in the market and where you think this could go? It seems like you should still have a lot of traction with some of the recent launches, like MA and the marketing initiatives that you guys talked about. So just curious to get your thoughts on where you think this could ultimately end up? Joe Hogan : Nathan, overall, when you look at what's going on, I'd say there's two prime drivers in that ortho segment. One is what you mentioned is you have our MAF product now that was qualified in November of last year, you have our Invisalign teen product, which we're doing a lot of cases, seven-year old patients, eight-year old patients that we really never touched before. So that's obviously a big driver from an increased utilization standpoint. Secondly, I think it's just increasing awareness of the preference of consumers for clear aligners and I think orthodontists know that and we see more and more orthodontists really adopting that. Thirdly, when you think about the segment overall is \u2013 from a long-term standpoint, like we talk about, that's our second strategic imperative, is we see a lot of runway in teens. And that's why we're having our Teen Summit coming up this year, we'll have a lot of focus on our top 300 in London this year also on teens and we see more and more uptake on that as we work with orthos on the teens and we go directly to consumers and parents about it. Nathan Rich : Great, thank you. Shirley Stacy : Nate, thanks. Next question, please. Joe Hogan : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed. Glen Santangelo : Thanks and good evening. Joe, I just want to follow up on the previous sort of ASP question because I almost look out a little bit differently, right. I mean, you clearly had a decent uptick on an international basis and your worldwide ASP was up slightly. Does that kind of imply that North America might have been flat or even maybe down? And I know there's a lot of moving parts and I think, John, you talked about some of those like mix and promotional discounts and FX. Could you just peel back the onion a little bit on North American ASPs and give us a sense because I think it's important, given the market's focus on the competitive landscape? So just give us a sense for what's going on there. Joe Hogan : Yes. Glen, when we look at the ASPs, totally like you said, up about $10 on a worldwide basis. In North America, slightly down from Q4, but from a standpoint of \u2013 really coming from a mix standpoint, it's just a matter of how and what type of cases the doctors are taking on, whether it's more comprehensive or some of the low-stage. And remember from a low-stage standpoint, those are some of our highest margin rate products. So when we look at that in total, we'll go to where the volume is and what makes sense for our business. Glen Santangelo : Maybe I'll just ask one follow-up question on your utilization. Within North American orthodontists, you saw a healthy sequential uptick in the number of cases, maybe \u2013 any idea what drove that and maybe could you give us a better sense for where maybe market penetration stands now for clear tray aligner and maybe what your market share numbers might look like to give us a sense for how much runway there maybe to go? Joe Hogan : Hey, Glen. It's Joe. On the utilization for orthos, think about two big vectors there, it's just our product line in teens, MAF and our Invisalign First product line. It really brings us into, what is about 25% to 30% of the teen market that we couldn't access before, before we had those products. Overall, I just think we have good momentum in that sense and we're going to continue to see continued increase in utilization as more and more doctors gain confidence in those products. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Glen. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question is from Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed. Ravi Misra : Hi, thank you for taking the questions. So I guess, just following up on that, Joe. Can we just talk a little bit about how the Invisalign First and mandibular advancement are contributing to that growth rate in that kind of teen, the strong teen growth number that you put there? And a little bit related, can you maybe touch upon what you're seeing out there with the competition and how your strategy is evolving now that the store closure has become underway? Thanks. Joe Hogan : First of all, Ravi, I'll just say, again, the utilization rates that you referenced and all and for teens, again, it's new product. We feel we're still having underutilization in teens. I mean, we're still in the United States, 9%, 10% from a teen standpoint. I'd say from a clinical standpoint, we can handle 80% to 90% of those cases, depending on how you want to rate them. Many of our Invisalign docs say they can do anything in teen than they can in Invisalign. So we have a long way to go from a growth standpoint. From a competitive standpoint, we really have no competitors in those kind of products. Okay, those are highly proprietary products that \u2013 it just take a lot of history and knowledge to be able to make them and have them function well in the marketplace. As far as how we're competing out there with Invisalign stores or whatever, look, Invisalign stores or what they always have been was how do you drive more demand for our product line, it was way instead of \u2013 we've been advertising consumers for years. This was a way of just taking those advertisement kind of capabilities and bring them in the store and exciting patients, moving those patients to doctors. It was nothing different in our business model. I mean, it's a shame in the sense of what the arbitrator ruled, but look, we respect that decision and we'll move on in the sense of continuing to generate demand the way we know how to generate demand. From a competitive standpoint, SDC is a different kind of competitor. Obviously, they have high growth rates, we have high growth rates too, we show we can mutually co-exist in the marketplace and we continue to both grow. Ravi Misra : Great, thanks. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Ravi. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed. Joe Hogan : Hey, John. John Kreger : Hey, how are you? Joe Hogan : Good. John Kreger : So I'd like to go back to China. Can you just talk about the next steps there? What do you have to do to continue growing as quickly as you have? We noticed that the number of doctors trained in APAC and China declined a little bit compared to where it was at the end of 2018. Is that in any way related to the slowing economic outlook in your opinion or is that seasonality? And can you just talk about how you expect the competitive dynamics in China to change, now that Straumann is making an entrance via a partnership there? Joe Hogan : Hey. Look, it's \u2013 you're back to Joe here. Look, China is great growth market for us, we have \u2013 we're manufacturing in China now. We've put treatment planning in Chengdu. We handle all of our Chinese doctors right now out of China itself. We have two wonderful training centers, one in Shanghai, one in Chengdu. We feel very capable in China, we lead in China. Straumann's move with a third or fourth tier player from a clear aligner standpoint, I don't see that as a dramatic effect on this market now or in the immediate future at all. John Kreger : Okay, great. And then just one quick clarifying question on operating margin. So if you strip out the one-time gains and losses that you've discussed, does your full year outlook that you discussed a quarter ago for operating margin that's below the long-term outlook, does that still hold? John Morici : Yes. Yes, it does. John Kreger : Okay, thank you. Joe Hogan : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brandon Couillard : Thanks, good afternoon. Joe, two part question on the scanner business. First, would like to get your perspective on how you sort of see the competitive landscape developing, number of new launches, all the ideas? And do you anticipate any stepped up level in just noise or evaluations as customers kind of digest these new intros? And then secondly, could you give us a sense of the relative growth rates in the scanner business between O-U.S. and North America? And then I guess, thirdly, any help you can give us in terms of the expected timing of the U.S. approval for the new iTero 5D? Joe Hogan : Starting with your broader question on the scanner business is \u2013 look, we feel really good about our scanner. I mean, 5D leads, I mean, obviously, you see the 3Shape product came out, but you got two separate scans that kind of use the near-infrared. And I mean, we're so focused on workflow of GPs, we just known over the years that, goodness, GP's time is such an important commodity in that sense and you want to do things as fast as you possibly can. So combining the near-infrared together for caries detection and tooth cracking together with just a normal digital scan is a big breakthrough for us in the industry. And we've gotten great feedback. Obviously, they're starting off well. From a standpoint of U.S. approval, it's the FDA. Right. I won't talk too much about it, but there are some issues in the sense of how the FDA wants this one to be designed from a disease control standpoint. But we have a good vector on what needs to be done, it's going to take a little bit longer, just like our MAF product did, but we're confident. And I would say late fourth quarter early first quarter next year, we'll be able to get approval. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. And a couple for John, housekeeping items. First, could you quantify the impact of the China facility on gross margins in the first quarter? Secondly, were there any legal or corporate expense or corporate reorg expenses absorbed in the first quarter? And then lastly, the $0.10 SDC equity gain in 2Q, just confirm, is that below the line? John Morici : Well, I can answer that one first. Yes, that's below the line. That's the equity gain that we will have. And then the corporate restructuring costs, very small amount in Q1, it really started in Q2 and handles the rest of the rest of the year. And then in terms of the China gross margin or the impact on costs, I mean, we saw higher utilization in those plants, drives efficiencies and we see that come through to our bottom line. So as we described earlier, it starts in Q1 and it progresses through the year. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Brandon. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please proceed. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, good afternoon. Could you talk a little bit about the feedback that you guys have received on the doctor-owned experience centers, now they're sort of switching over more to that strategy? JoeHogan: Elizabeth, it\u2019s Joe. We have about two of those out there right now. Feedback is good. I mean, we've had Invisalign stores out there for years, basically, and these are ones just dedicated Invisalign stores with brand and all. And feedback has been terrific, uptick has been good. So overall, it's a good place for us to invest. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay. And if you, the new plan for sort of that growth going forward there, you don't anticipate sort of any major changes versus what you've been sort of seeing recently with those? Joe Hogan : No, I think we'll just \u2013 we will continue with the pace that we've been going and there's a lot of interest out there. We're just working through it right now. But overall, the interest from an orthodontic standpoint has been extremely good and also from the GP practices. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed. Steven Valiquette : Hi. Thanks, good afternoon. So I just have a question here around the Straumann settlement. The $35 million initial payment, I mean, that seems pretty straightforward. But for the extra non-binding part of the agreement, seems like the potential for Straumann to sell 5,000 extra iTero scanners would be much more positive for Align versus just receiving an extra $16 million from them. So I guess the questions are, first, do you agree or disagree with that? But then also, secondarily, just from the Straumann perspective, what would be the incentives for them to sell iTero instead of just paying you the $16 million? So just curious to get more color around this. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Well hey, Steve, it's Joe. First of all when you look at Straumann, they have their own internal scanner, but it really doesn't fit the broad application base that you need for both clear aligners and also for the restorative aspect of GP. So they primarily use 3Shape for those kind of scans today. So your comment about which is better, the $60 million or this. It's a good question. I mean, you have to assume with the 5,000 that they would sell will be 5,000 we can't sell. And, I mean, that's not necessarily true or a discrete variable in this whole equation. So, look, ideally, I think having the scanner sold by Straumann and having a good restorative workflow together would be helpful. But I wouldn't, it's not a live or die proposition. I feel we have good distribution in the marketplace. We have good coverage in three different regions and we'll be able to function well in either scenario. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Kevin Farshchi : Thanks for squeezing me in. This is Kevin on for Matt today. First one just quickly on iTero. Assume the seasonality in Q1, likely the low watermark there and assume the outlook for the sequential increase in Q2 that you provided, but can you put any numbers or a trend around the iTero growth for the second half of the year? The comps there are obviously difficult, but I assume you have a bigger specialized sales force just on that and then you're lapping some DSO partnerships. John Morici : Yeah. Kevin, this is John. So good growth in Q1. What we expect is to be able to continue to, globally, be able to have more and more iTeros sold. We think it's a great scanner, new 5D and so on really contributes to that growth. But we've seen good growth so far. Really no change in what \u2013 in how we think about it for the total year, but it's going to continue to expand and work through as many doctors as possible. Kevin Farshchi : Okay, sounds great. If I could squeeze one more in for Joe. It seems like the initiatives in Brazil are continuing to ramp up with those 3,000 docs trained and you've obviously been highly under index there historically as a percentage of Americas, despite it being a big market. Can you frame up that opportunity a little bit and talk about the type of revenue contribution you can get this year and in the coming years from that region? Is it upside to the plan? How do you think about that region? Thank you. Joe Hogan : Well, I mean, I think it's in our plan for 2019 is already baked in there from a Brazil and Latin America standpoint. I could tell by your question, you do recognize the opportunity that we have in Latin America and also Brazil, given the focus on orthodontics in both of those regions. And look, your comment also, we were late to the game there. And that's why you see us making significant investments now in the sense of training doctors, putting people in place and building infrastructure there. So, we haven't broken out those numbers yet. When they really become material to the business, we will do that. But right now, we're not making any projections or specifics about it. But rest assured, as you know, this is a big opportunity for us, it's a good product at the right time and we feel we have good leadership there and good momentum. Shirley Stacy : Thanks very much. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please proceed. Michael Ryskin : Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just two real quick ones. One on the mandibular advancement, it's been a few months now since it's been out in the States. And you mentioned that you saw a positive adoption response in 1Q. Could you go a little bit deeper? Did it show up materially in the numbers? Do you think it contributed and sort of how does it feel going into the ramp for the rest of the year? John Morici : Hey, Mike. This is John. It certainly helps. It's a slow adoption. I mean, these are doctors that they just started trying some of these cases, they want to see and experience it for themselves to be able to see that it works in the way they want. So it's a slow rollout and adoption, but it gets that some of the key parts of our business that we want to grow, which is teen. Michael Ryskin : Got it. I was just trying to get if that contributed to the North American ortho boost in the quarter. And then a quick follow on. The China fabrication facility you mentioned is still being underutilized, continues to ramp. Any thoughts for when you think you could hit full ramp or close to it? Is it later this year? Is it early 2020 just to give us a sense for how that moves through? John Morici : Yes, Mike. This is John again. So we will see a progression and we saw a good improvement in Q1 and it will continue to improve as you utilize that facility more and more, but that will take the rest of this year. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Mike. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question is from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please proceed. Jaime Morgan : Hi, this is Jaime on for Rich. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to circle back on competition. I know some of your competitors have recently launched more price favorable lines geared towards the GP channel. So I was wondering, if you're seeing \u2013 or running a little bit more in that channel? And then also just kind of a sense of the ortho channel as well as you're now several quarters into seeing some competition. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Hey, Jaime, it's Joe. Just a quick question for you, would you tell me who that competitor is with the price favorable lines of GP? Jaime Morgan : I believe Henry Schein had been \u2013 they had launched a new product, geared... Joe Hogan : Yes. We haven't really seen Schein, felt Schein in the marketplace at all. And we don't even know what their pricing is frankly. And so we really haven't had to respond to that piece. I think if you look at the marketplace, you'd say that ClearCorrect traditionally has been in that GP segment. They're obviously owned by Straumann now. Straumann has been taking them throughout that channel. But we really haven't felt a higher degree of competitive pressure since it is a piece either. So I just find your question interesting. I know there's a lot of speculation out there right now, but we don't necessarily feel that.  And remember, ClearCorrect always had a price favorable line from a GP standpoint. And we're basically being able to fight that with technology and coverage in the marketplace. Shirley Stacy : Thanks for your question. We'll take one last question, operator. Operator : Our last question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS Investment Bank. Please proceed. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking one last question. Appreciate it. Just any color around the doctors trained in the quarter? Noticed a sequential decline. There's always some seasonality to this, but just the number of docs trained was pretty meaningfully lower both O-US and in the Americas. Just any color around that. John Morici : Hey Kevin, this is John. From a doctor's standpoint, Q1 is typically lower from a training standpoint. So things build as you go through the year and we saw that from Q4 to Q1, but nothing more. We want to work with doctors that want to come with cases and really get into being able to use more and more Invisalign. So, some of it's just the timing of making that all happen, but nothing more than that. Kevin Caliendo : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone. This wraps up our first quarter conference call. If you have any follow-up questions, please follow up with Investor Relations. We hope you have a great day. We look forward to seeing you at future meetings. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the second quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Clear aligners and scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results, discuss our outlook for the third quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open-up the call to questions. Our second quarter revenues were at the high-end of our guidance reflecting Invisalign volume growth primarily from international doctors as well as very strong sales from iTero Scanner and Services. Q2 Invisalign volumes were 24.6% year-over-year compared to 30.5% year-over-year in second quarter 2018 reflecting continued adoption from teenage and younger patients as well as increased utilization and expansion of our customer base with total over 60,000 active doctors worldwide. From a product perspective, we had good growth across the Invisalign portfolio with non-comprehensive products outpacing comprehensive led by Invisalign Go globally. Total Invisalign case shipments for Q2 were lower than expected, primarily due to softness in China related to a tougher consumer environment and slower growth in young adult cases in North America. Now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results starting with the Americas Regions. The Americas region Q2 Invisalign case volumes was up 4.2% sequentially, 16.5% year-over-year compared to 22% year-over-year in Q2 2018 reflecting growth both in the Orthodontist and GP channels as well as continued strength from teenage patients in Invisalign Go. In Q2 we trained approximately 3,000 new Invisalign doctors in the Americas region of which more than half were the North American doctors. On a sequential basis, Q2 Invisalign volume growth reflects increased utilization for the Americas region overall driven by North American Orthos at 18.9 cases per doctor, with continued adoption of Invisalign with Mandibular Advancement and Invisalign First used to treat patients as young as six years old. We also had solid performance from GP Dentists with continued momentum from Invisalign Lite and Invisalign Go. Invisalign Go is uniquely designed for GPs and features a digital chairside experience using the iTero Intraoral Scanner and streamlined tooth movement capabilities. It's a really great product and we're very pleased with its performance including with our DSO partners who are using it to help their providers introduce Invisalign treatment into practice. Invisalign Go integrates well with the DSO model, which remains a very important part of our overall business as we continue to see DSO growth rates outpacing the non-DSO doctors significantly. Year-over-year Q2, Invisalign volume growth in the Americans region was driven \u2013 continued to strengthen the Ortho channel with 19.7% growth, compared to 25% year-over-year as well as increase of 11.6% from the GP channel. In Q2 we saw adult case growth from North American orthodontists reflecting a more crowded competitive environment, especially for young adults in the 20 to 29 year old demographic who really value convenience and costs. We know there's about a 10% overlap with our adult demographic with SDC. If you have an increased awareness for the direct-to-consumer clear aligners and heavy advertising spend from DTC players case starts may be shifting away from traditional practices. We also believe that doctors are sampling alternative products and are taking advantage of wires and bracket bundles that essentially gave clear aligners away for free or at very low prices. These competitive dynamics are not surprising and were validated during our recent customer visits. Nonetheless, they appear to be working themselves out in the first few weeks of Q3. We've seen improving trends in North America. In July, our executive team and I spent a week meeting with over 200 orthodontists in four major U.S. cities Fort Lauderdale, Dallas, Denver, and LA, and did not hear anything that gave me pause about a competitive performance standpoint. That's not to say that we didn't get feedback about how to make things better, especially around to help doctors to compete more effectively against DTC offerings. But doctors consistently told us that the Invisalign system is the best product, there is hands down technically and clinically. Given the changing DTC landscape, we're focused on further differentiation and Invisalign treatment for both consumers and doctors. In Q3, we're increasing investment in consumer demand with a new advertising campaign for North America and expanding marketing programs such as our concierge service, which connects potential patients with Invisalign doctors increasing conversion and stickiness. In addition, we're launching new sales tools and professional marketing materials. We'll also expect to see increased productivity from the 100 plus sales representatives we added in Q1. We'll also look for opportunities to leverage the Invisalign product portfolio, the doctors to treat patients as needed and compete with DTC offerings. Expanding on products like Invisalign Go and Lite will help close the gaps many doctors see with DTC patients who are looking for price and convenience. Finally, in Latin America, we continue to make great progress led by Brazil in developing the emerging clear aligner segment in the world's leading market for beauty and cosmetic procedures. In Q2, Invisalign volume in Latin America was up significantly year-over-year reflecting our ongoing investments as we continue to build our business in the region. Training approximately 1,300 Invisalign doctors during the quarter. For our international business, Q2 was a good quarter with strong Invisalign volume growth of 36.7% year-over-year reflecting increased Invisalign utilization and continued expansion of our customer base in both EMEA and the Asia Pacific region. On a sequential basis, international volume was up nicely reflecting growth in both EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. In Q2, we trained approximately 3,500 new Invisalign doctors internationally, over half of which were in the Asia Pacific region. In EMEA, Q2 was another strong quarter with volumes up 39.0% year-over-year driven by growth across the region with record Invisalign volumes in all but one country market led by Iberia. We saw strength across the Invisalign product portfolio with continued momentum from Invisalign Go. We also continue to see strong growth across our key expansion markets as well, led by Central and Eastern Europe. APAC Q2 Invisalign volume increased 33.1% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from nearly all country markets led by China, Japan and ANZA. We also had strong growth from GP dentists, which were up 52.4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Q2 Invisalign volume for APAC was up nicely led by Japan, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We also had a uptick in adult patients in Q2, following a very strong quarter for teen cases in Q1 in conjunction with a teenage promotion to help drive trial and adoption in the very important teen segment. During Q2, we trained over 1,900 new doctors in APAC, over 40% were in China. Notwithstanding current consumer sentiment, we remain confident in the long-term opportunity in China and will continue to invest in our manufacturing operations and training centers to ensure that we operate like a local company and have the capabilities to expand and scale our business as the environment improves. We are also focusing on what we can influence directly to help mitigate consumer sentiment in China. We are expanding our reach and scope in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities across China, including investment in a GP dentist sales force and sales programs centered on Invisalign Go. In the last year since the launch of Invisalign Go in APAC, we have learned that doctors benefit from a differentiated approach in training and support and will align our resources accordingly. We\u2019re also increasing consumer marketing spend in APAC including new advertising like our Doctor Centered ad that is launching in North America next week. Finally, in the second half of this year, we expect to have dozens of Invisalign pop-up centers in China to ensure we educate consumers and connect more with Invisalign doctors. Outside of China, we have strong growth across APAC including Japan, ANZA, Hong Kong, Taiwan. We will continue to drive adoption and utilization by investing through sales & marketing programs, and clinical education with new training centers like the one we just announced in Taiwan. Through this center, we have also launched the first integrated postgraduate Invisalign training program in Asia with National Taiwan University Hospital. Clinical education and peer-to-peer learning is one of the most impactful ways we help drive adoption of Invisalign treatment. During Q2, we engaged directly with thousands of Invisalign trained doctors around the world providing them with the ability to learn from clinical experts and practice development leaders, and share their experience and insights with each other. In April we held the 2019 Invisalign China Forum, in Xi\u2019an, attracting over 1,300 industry practitioners and gathering together over 40 experienced orthodontists from all over the country. During the two-day forum, participants held in-depth discussions on frontier topics such as adolescent orthodontics, extraction in orthodontic treatment and digital dentistry. In May, 300 high volume orthodontists from 37 countries across the Americas, EMEA and APAC participated in the inaugural edition of the Invisalign Symposium on the Digital Practice in London. The two-day doctor event featured specially designed sessions, combining plenary interaction and small group of working sessions, covering such topics such as : understanding consumers, practice optimization, challenges of building a digital practice, among others. I was able to address specifically on the digital practice and driving the evolution of digital orthodontics with supporting talks on digital transformation and healthcare and the power of digital treatment planning along with practice optimization with ADAPT. ADAPT is Align\u2019s consultative program to provide practices with personalized support to help doctors and staff navigate the journey from a braces model to an aligner model in a timely, efficient, and profitable manner. Emphasis is on digital workflow, finances, and consumer acquisition and early results from test sites in the Americas, EMEA and APAC show significant improvements in conversion, revenue growth, practice profits, and other key metrics as practices shift to a digital model and increase their Invisalign share of chair. In June, we hosted the first Invisalign Scientific Symposium in EMEA, located in Valencia, Spain. The Scientific Symposium focused on evidence based success cases for Invisalign treatment in growing patients with dedicated focus on treatments with Invisalign First and Mandibular Advancement Feature, bringing together nearly 200 of EMEA\u2019s most experienced Invisalign doctors. In July more than 175 general dentists from all across Europe attended the second annual Invisalign GP Growth Summit in Berlin focused on peer-to-peer learning and emerging industry trends.  We also just hosted our first Invisalign Teen Summit with about 300 doctors and staff in Los Angeles. The Summit program was focused completely on teen treatment and teen culture, and included a tie-in to VidCon, the top teen culture and community event where Align has a multi-year relationship and strong brand presence. Teen Summit is designed to turn low-teen submitters into high-teen submitters by combining Invisalign specific clinical and practice \u201chow tos\u201d with an immersive teen culture experience, social media support and training, and insights from teen influencers Speaking of teens, in Q2 over 100,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 32.2% year-over-year driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions. For Q2, year-over-year Invisalign teen patient growth for North Americas Orthodontists increased 25.0% and International doctors were up 44.4%. Invisalign First and Invisalign treatment with Mandibular Advancement continue to ramp globally and are helping to increase our share of teenagers and younger patients worldwide. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased to see that use of Invisalign treatment among teenagers continues to outpace adults and that Invisalign First is driving really strong growth in the kid/tween segment. In fact we reached our 7 millionth Invisalign patient during the quarter, a child in the U.S. being treated with Invisalign First. Since the launch of Invisalign First a year ago, kids under 10 years old have become our fastest growing demographic, up 140% year over year, which also bodes well for continued adoption of teens too. Our consumer marketing efforts are designed to build the category and drive demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor\u2019s office. We invest over $120 million each year in consumer marketing programs including TV, digital and social media, PR, event marketing and our Patient Concierge service. Our goals are to make the Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor\u2019s office. In Q2, we continued to see strong digital engagement with consumers \u2013 reaching nearly 4.3 million unique visitors on Invisalign.com sites worldwide for a total of 57.5 million visitors to date. Our other key metrics show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q2 quarterly slides. During the quarter we developed a new consumer advertising campaign for our three largest markets, the U.S., Canada and China. This new multi-channel campaign, which launches across North America this Monday, educates consumers on the significant benefits of Invisalign treatment, highlighting our patented SmartTrack technology based on years of research which moves teeth more predictably and comfortably combined with the personalized care of a doctor. We are more than doubling our media investment behind this new multichannel campaign to extend our reach across adults and parents of teens, increasing our reach/frequency from 50% to over 70%, in order to capture even more of our target audiences. In the U.S. our new campaign will run across all media channels including broadcast and TV networks, connected TV such as Hulu and other streaming services, digital media and all social media channels. In Canada, our new ad will go live on digital channels first and then we will layer in TV in the coming weeks. And China will follow suit in the second half. Q2 was another outstanding quarter for our iTero scanner and services business, with revenues up 82.4% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength across all regions and customer channels, including large account DSOs. On a sequential basis, revenues were up 30.4% sequentially, reflecting higher scanner sales following a seasonally weaker Q1, especially in North America and Asia Pacific. Increased services revenues reflect higher subscriptions from installed base growth and multi-year deals. During the quarter we saw continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D imaging system in EMEA, APAC and Canada, since its commercial launch at IDS in the first quarter of this year. Cumulatively, over 13.7 million orthodontic scans and 3.6 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners. Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submission continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q2, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 77.3% from 69.6% in Q2 last year. International scans increased to 60.8% up from 47.8% in the same quarter last year. Within the Americas, 92.3% of cases submitted by North American Orthos were submitted digitally. We continue to expand the iTero portfolio to address doctor\u2019s needs and enable them to more easily adopt Invisalign treatment in their practices. In June, we announced the iTero Element Foundation, extending the portfolio to offer dentists digital workflow capabilities to address their restorative and patient monitoring intraoral scanning needs.  The streamlined workflows to dental laboratories includes an option for on-demand chairside milling and exclusive TimeLapse technology for patient communication and monitoring with the iTero Element Foundation, which provides dentists with capabilities beyond basic STL export scanners. Software upgrade pathways are also available for Invisalign clear aligners. The iTero scanner and services business has become an integral part of our business and is key to our end-to-end digital workflow. We believe that every exam should begin with an iTero digital scan because it's a better experience, it improves treatment outcomes and it provides doctor with a chairside tool that enables patients to visualize their future smiles at chairside in less than a minute without any goop \u2013 which increases treatment acceptance and drives practice growth. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to mention the decision to terminate discussions regarding the possible development and distribution agreement that was disclosed as part of the patent settlement agreement with Straumann. As part of this settlement, Align and Straumann signed a non-binding letter of intent to assess the possibility of a five-year global development and distribution agreement whereby Straumann would distribute 5,000 iTero Element scanners. Additionally, we considered exploring the possibility of offering existing iTero users access to Straumann\u2019s prosthetic and surgical planning workflows. In June, after months of deliberations, we announced the decision to terminate these discussions, and as a result, we received an additional $16 million from Straumann for a total of $51 million settlement. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results, total revenue for the second quarter was $600.7 million, up 9.4% from the prior quarter and up 22.5% from the corresponding quarter a year-ago. Year-over-year revenue growth includes approximately $19 million or 4 points of unfavorable foreign exchange. For Clear aligners, Q2 revenue of $496.7 million was flat sequentially due to Invisalign volume growth in most geographies, partially offset by lower Invisalign ASPs and lower SDC volume. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 14.6% reflects strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies, partially offset by lower ASPs. On June 1, we had a minor issue with a standard software release that impacted some ClinCheck modifications. It was addressed and communicated to customers quickly. However, it required some Invisalign doctors to re-review their treatment plans. This disrupted the workflow for many doctors, which was compounded by an increase in call volumes into our Treat Operations and Customer Care center that degraded service levels and customer experience. While it\u2019s impossible to quantify, on the margin it probably didn\u2019t help the quarter. Q2 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially by approximately $15, to $1,230 primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange and discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 Invisalign ASPs were down $85 primarily reflecting promotional discounts, unfavorable foreign exchange, higher deferrals related to additional aligners and product mix shift, partially offset by price increases. Total Q2 Invisalign shipments of 377.1 thousand cases were up 8% sequentially and up 24.6% year-over-year. For Americas Orthodontists, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up 3.7% sequentially and up 19.7% year-over-year. For Americas GP Dentists, Invisalign case volume was up 4.9% sequentially and up 11.6% year-over-year. For International doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 13.4% sequentially and up 36.7% year-over-year. Our Scanner and Services revenue for the second quarter was $104 million, up 30.4% sequentially reflecting growth across all regions and channels including DSOs, partially offset by lower ASP. Year-over-year revenue was up 82.4%, primarily due to higher scanner units across regions and related service revenues, partially offset by lower ASP. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 72%, down 1.2 points sequentially and down 2.6 points year-over-year. Gross margin was impacted by approximately 1 point year-over-year due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 73.7%, down 1.2 points sequentially primarily due to costs from seasonally higher doctor training and freight. Clear aligner gross margin was down 2.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased aligners per case and lower ASPs, as just described. Scanner gross margin for the second quarter was 63.6%, flat sequentially and up 4 points year-over-year primarily due to increased manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by lower ASP driven by mix. Q2 operating expenses were $255.8 million, down sequentially 18.6% and up 5.3% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating expenses reflects a benefit of $51 million related to the Straumann litigation settlement, partially offset by our continued investment in sales and R&D activities. Additionally, Q1 operating expenses included $29.8 million related to Invisalign store closure costs. On a year-over-year basis, operating expense increased due to sales and R&D activities and was partially offset by the Straumann settlement. Second quarter operating expense included a $51 million benefit from the Straumann litigation settlement, which increased Q2 operating margin by approximately 8 points and diluted earnings per share by $0.57, respectively. This settlement was higher than anticipated in our Q2 guidance because it included an additional $16 million benefit from the termination of development and distribution agreement, along with $5 million that we would have incurred for development. Our second quarter operating income was $176.5 million, up 101.2% sequentially and up 43.8% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating margin was 29.4%, up 13.4 points sequentially and up 4.4 points year-over-year. The sequential increases in both operating income and operating margin are primarily attributed to the $51 million benefit related to the Straumann settlement recorded in the second quarter and the Invisalign store closure costs recorded in Q1 2019. On a year-over-year basis, the increases in operating income and operating margin primarily reflect the benefit from the Straumann settlement partially offset by lower gross margin and continued investments in sales and R&D. Interest, other income and expense of $17.4 million includes the $15.8 million gain that is related to our sale of our equity investment in SmileDirectClub during the second quarter. With regards to second quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 22.2% which includes approximately $10 million of tax expense related to gains from the Straumann settlement and the sale of the SDC equity investment. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.83, up $0.94 sequentially and up $0.53 compared to the prior year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments were $765.9 million, an increase of $33.4 million from the prior quarter which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations, partially offset by $49.5 million used to repurchase approximately 161,000 shares of our stock. Of our $765.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $582.4 million was held in the U.S. and $183.5 million was held by our International entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $520.1 million, up approximately 8.5% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, DSO was 77 days, down one day sequentially and up nine days from Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $177.4 million, up $37.6 million compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $45.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow for the second quarter, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $132 million. During Q2 2019, we purchased on the open market approximately 161,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $307.48 per share, including commission for an aggregate purchase price of $49.5 million. We have $400.5 million remaining available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program. With that, let\u2019s turn to our Q3 outlook and the factors that inform our view. Starting with the demand outlook. As we exited Q2 and now into the first weeks of Q3, we are seeing improving volume trends. For International, we expect Q3 volumes to be down sequentially reflecting a seasonally slower period for EMEA, partially offset by a seasonally stronger period for the APAC regions. However, given the uncertainty in China, we are reflecting a more cautious outlook for APAC growth. For the Americas, we expect Q3 volumes to be up sequentially reflecting growth across all key country markets, as well as a seasonally stronger period for North America. Orthodontists with the peak of the summer teen season, along with increased media spend and the launch of our new customer advertising campaign as Joe described earlier. As we typically see, we expect overall Invisalign volume to be flat to slightly up from Q2. We expect our iTero business to be down sequentially coming off another very strong quarter and record growth in Q2. Year-over-year, the iTero business continues to grow across all regions. And, regarding Smile Direct Club, we expect no clear aligner volume from SDC in Q3. With this as a backdrop, we expect the third quarter to shape up as follows : Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 370,000 to 380,000 cases, up approximately 16% to 19% year-over-year, on a tough comp from Q3 last year which had record shipments that benefitted from the teen and adult promotions by approximately 2% higher growth rate. We expect Q3 revenue to be in the range of $585 million to $600 million, up approximately 16% to 19% year-over-year. Our Q3 revenue outlook assumes no Smile Direct Club volume compared to the same quarter a year ago where aligners supplied to SDC contributed about $8 million to revenue. In addition as just mentioned, in Q3 2018 we had higher Invisalign volumes due to the promos, but lower ASPs. We expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 71.9% to 72.5%. Q3 gross margin is up slightly compared to Q2 as we expect improvement due to price increases and manufacturing productivity. We expect Q3 operating expenses to be in the range of $305 million to $312 million. Our Q3 operating expenses are expected to be significantly higher sequentially as a result of the benefit of $51 million Straumann settlement in Q2 which reduced operating expenses. We are very pleased with the settlement and are putting the funds to work by stepping up our investment in consumer advertising with a brand new campaign and stepping up our reach and coverage. The new ads focus on the significant technical and clinical advantages of our Invisalign system and differentiates our doctor centered model for consumers. It will launch next week in North America and soon after in China. These ads will carry on throughout the second half of 2019. Q3 operating margin should be in the range of 19.8% to 20.5%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. Diluted shares outstanding is expected to be approximately 80.6 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q3 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.16. In addition, we expect to repurchase at least $100 million of our stock in the open market in Q3. As we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect capital expenditures for Q3 to be approximately $50 million to $55 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $24 million to $26 million. Given our Q3 outlook, I want to make a few comments on our full year. Based on the current growth rates in our business to-date and our planned investments for the remainder of the year, we now anticipate 2019 total revenue growth rate to be at the low end of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. We also expect Invisalign revenue and volume growth to be at the low end of our long-term operating model target. We anticipate operating margin to be below the low end of our long-term model at approximately 22%, which reflect the impact from increased legal fees and the planned corporate structure reorganization, as well as increased investment in consumer marketing, Invisalign store closure costs, partially offset by the benefit from the Straumann settlement. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Joe for closing comments. Joe Hogan : Thanks John and thanks for joining our call today. Before we close I want to comment on a few things that I think are important to remember given our lower than expected Invisalign volumes this quarter and a more cautious outlook for China in Q3. First, our fundamentals are squarely in place and our outlook for the reminder of the year is clearly within our long term model \u2013 on top of a record 35% last year. We don\u2019t believe the second and third quarter, in anyway, reflects our full potential. Our product technology, operational scale and consumer brand awareness are all significant advantages \u2013 in a huge market that we are addressing with only 10% share today. The opportunity to bring better smiles to millions is not a zero sum game and we are working hard to ensure that we continue to gain share. So while we acknowledge competition, we also embrace it because it drives our own innovation, which is ultimately great for the millions of global patients who have yet to reap the benefits of this. Finally, before I open the call up for questions, I want to take a minute to congratulate Simon Beard, who has taken on a new role as Senior VP for the Americas. I also want welcome Markus Sebastian to our executive management team as the new Senior VP of EMEA. As many of you know, Simon was responsible for the market development and operational execution of all products and services in the EMEA region since 2014. Under Simon\u2019s leadership, the EMEA region has consistently grown more than 30% compound annual growth rate with strong performance across the entire region and customer base. His knowledge of the market and ability to drive strategic programs and initiatives across the region have delivered exceptional results and make him the ideal leader for the Americas region. Markus joined Align a year ago and has been responsible for Align\u2019s core Europe commercial organizations focused on the orthodontic channel. He has also served as interim GM of Germany and France country markets. Markus is an experienced leader and general manager with a proven track record in global commercial operations and sales, strategic marketing, product development, and change management processes. His deep understanding of the healthcare markets in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S. are an asset to Align. We are very glad to have Markus assume responsibility for the EMEA region. With that, I want to thank you again for joining our call. I look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming financial conferences and meetings, including the Invisalign GP Summit in November in Las Vegas, where we will also host an analyst meeting. Stay tuned for more information. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Erin Wright : Thanks. Can you parse out some of the components of this sequentially, slower growth in America is where maybe there were pockets of stronger growth that you could at least call out that were obviously offset by some of those competitive dynamics that you were speaking to. And how should we be thinking about the quarterly progression there? And also where are you seeing most of the competitions coming from? Is it mostly DTC or is it some of component of the GP offerings as well? And how do you expect that to progress? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Hi, Erin. First of all, when you look at the Americas, this is split up \u2013 as the America side includes Latin America and Brazil, which is growing over 100%. There's terrific growth down there. So our focus is mainly when we talk about a little bit of a slow down, it's been in the North American marketplace in the U.S. and Canada. When you talk about segments that have done well is what I read in my script too is when you look at teens or we call them tweens between seven and 10, they're up 140% year-on-year in the Americas. It's our fastest growing group and that reflects the technology that we've put in place around Invisalign First, which is made for dental expansion in that age of patient and also our Mandibular Advancement product also that I think you know about too. So that's been a terrific segment for us. Our adult segment too has been strong. It's that 20 to 29 year old that we saw some amount of slow down over time. But when you get into the older classifications, we're still seeing really good strong growth in those areas. So I feel well about our portfolio that I talked about in my script, which is iGo and also our Lite product, can address that segment of 20 to 29 that we think is looking for a price point and also some convenience. We're sure that we can offer through our ortho channels and also our GP channels too.  On the competition in general is how I framed your second part of your question, when you think about DTC versus I would interpret that as just standard competition. It's really hard to say exactly how to break this up. But in general, we feel that when you look at that specific consumer segment, it's more of a DTC segment. It's not necessarily a traditional segment that they would be appealing to. So in general, I feel good about our positioning. I think our position with orthos and GPs continues to be strong. I mean, you look at our most \u2013 it was great to be in this field. We were in Asia last week. We were also in North America that I mentioned, the previous week. And we've been involved with a lot of customers. And just what I said in my script, I mean there's \u2013 we know that things are being trot out there from consumer standpoint. We feel so good about the feedback we get about the clinical capabilities of Invisalign, the consistency of it. It's interaction with iTero, which is it's really a master in the marketplace. And then all of them reaching out to say how they want to compete against that DTC segment, we're the only company that can really join hands with them and help them to compete in that area. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Erin. Next question please. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jon Block : Great guys. I'm going to try to ask too, an awesome one at a time. So the first long-term guidance is 20% to 30% rev guide, but the guide for next quarter is 17% at the midpoint, it looks like high teens, Joe for the back half of 2019. I know you had some commentary, but I guess the real question is one or two quarters don't make a trend, but how do we put sort of that high teens 2H year-over-year growth guide versus the long-term of 20% to 30% and what would drive the reacceleration and then I'll ask hopefully a tighter follow-up. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Yes, hey Jon. General from a teen standpoint, you know what our product portfolio is and how well it competes in that sense. When we talk about the slow down right now \u2013 the part of it is \u2013 a huge part of it is China and China obviously is a big teen season as we roll into China now. And we're confident we'll be able to perform in that marketplace too, Jon. And there's still demand there. There's just \u2013 after what we saw in the second quarter, we have some basic uncertainty there and that's reflected in what \u2013 and what our guidance is. But it certainly doesn't decrease our confidence in the sense of our portfolio, our positioning and the movements that we're making in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities that I mentioned in my script. It's a really important part of us expanding in that geography and just giving us more mass in the sense of being exposed to broader patients across that area. So overall, I feel good about that. Jon Block : Okay. And then just the follow-up there, can you just expand a little bit on the competitive dynamics? You said things seem to work itself out in early 3Q. So what was that Joe? Was that commentary specific more to the traditional ortho channel or there might have been some trialing and then they said, hey, we don't have a comparable product or maybe we could just split what those comments were specific to? Joe Hogan : Well, they're specific \u2013 they're specific in North America in the ortho channel that you mentioned, Jon. And we see in the first basic 24 days in July, we're seeing a significant uptick in that part of the marketplace. So we say work that out. It just \u2013 it just seems that we've had doctors tell us they've tried these products, they haven't been satisfied with the software or the results that they've had to-date or whatever. And then we see an inflection point from a growth standpoint as we move into July being not significant. Secondly is when we look at Asia in the July orders also including China, we've seen an uptick in China also. So just in general, I\u2019m talking about, and we're talking about as a team is from a volume standpoint, we've seen an increase in that sense. It gives us confidence that those things are working themselves out. Jon Block : Okay. Thank you. Joe Hogan : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. Glen Santangelo : No worries. Joe, I just want to talk to you about \u2013 and clearly the competitive landscape seems like its getting worse, but yet you raised your prices on July 1. I mean, are you seeing any price sensitivity in the market? And then when you think about the competitive landscape, put the DTC channel aside for a second. But when you think about the traditional players that are also now selling into the GP in the ortho market, are you seeing any sort of price sensitivity from your customer base at all? Joe Hogan : Hey, Glen, I start to say, our markets always been price sensitive. And when you look at our portfolio in the sense of how we put things together with our comprehensive product and then our Lite products, products like E5 and E7, the iGo that I talked about too, these have all been positioned to hit a certain price point, not just for doctors, but for doctors with their patients too. When you talk about competition increasing or whatever, again, it's out there, the traditional players that we know about. I'll talk about the DTC channel in a second. But in general what we find is there's no scale yet. There's no scale on the software side. There's no scale on the supply side. There's a ways to go. There's no challenge in the teen segment results, , it's primarily simple cases on the adult side. And so it's not that we don't take it seriously, it's just that we feel that we have really strong sales force. The iTero integration with our product line is so strong in that way. It makes it easier for doctors to work with us and to work with patients also. Our operations are unmatched in the sense of \u2013 now we produce half a million to 600,000 aligners a day. It's not easy to do those things.  So overall as the landscape changing, sure it is. I mean, our key patents ran off at the end of 2017 as you know, we're in the 2019. And we're seeing competition slowly ramp up, but we're not saying that it's been material this quarter. We're just recognizing that it's been out there. On the DTC channel price again, I'll go back to our portfolio, the products like Lite, products like iGo, our simpler products like E7 specifically, those are designed for simple cases. Basically that's what DTC does. They do social six, lower crowding, things that are orthodontically simple. These products have been aligned for that too. Our job to get those products in our doctor's hands and to get in front of the patients and show them what an opportunity is to work with a doctor and its product line to getting the kind of outcomes that they expect. And also they give them a chance to be able to work with the doctor, hand-in-hand if they don't like the treatment at some point in time, they can continue to progress with that doctor to make it better too. Glen Santangelo : Okay. I appreciate those comments. Anything regarding ASP, slight downtick sequentially, was it mix, was it discounting or any anything you can add on that front? Joe Hogan : For primarily it was exchange, right. And that's what we're leaning into. John, you can\u2026 John Morici : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 like you said, Glen, its down about $15, $10 of that was exchanged and then the rest of it was mix so nothing material from the previous quarter. Glen Santangelo : Thank you very much. Joe Hogan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, just starting in the Americas region, why do you think the DT channel \u2013 the DTC channel was having a negative impact now, you kind of talked about that perhaps having a positive halo effect. And then could you speak to the productivity of the 100 new reps that you've hired and whether or not those are ramping in line with your expectations or not? Joe Hogan : Yes, hey, Brandon. First of all, on the DTC piece is, I think it's \u2013 there's light and dark in that, right. I do feel that Smile Direct Club and Candid, they've raised the category for awareness significantly. And we hear throughout our doctor base, whether the orthodontic side or GP side, the patients come in asking about clear aligners much more than they have before. So it forces that conversation that gives them an opportunity to engage at a level that I feel is just our advertising alone, it would have never gotten to that level. So that's a positive side. The negative side is it's \u2013 there's some price competition, that segment offers $2,000 or less kind of a case for simple case and it's pushed some of the doctor office models and it's pushed our portfolio too. What we're saying is we've always know there's a 10% overlap and educating our customers, having customers be able to, which is our doctors, having this customers be able to use an iTero scanner to help to communicate and visualize exactly what the treatment plan would be. Giving patients some off ramp in the sense that they have issues during the treatment time that they can be addressed by a doctor directly, all those things are things that we just have to make sure we take better advantage of with our doctors and the channels that we work with in order to take advantage of that increased interest that we see out there. From a new rep standpoint. It was second part of your question, Brandon. We put roughly 100 in North America last year. We watched these statistics. I do, really closely and it's amazing to watch the productivity, what happens. It's like clockwork. It takes nine months. We're certain before they're really up to speed and you can see the productivity versus what our normal territory managers would have. And as we move into the third quarter, right now, I'm looking at those statistics. We see they're almost, we call it, breadth and reach. And the number of accounts they're calling on and the depth of those accounts are almost equal today. So as we go into the second half of this year, we're really confident about higher productivity with these reps and combine that with our new consumer ad campaign and the breadth of that consumer ad campaign that John talked about. We think will help to drive that demand and with the concierge service increase also, which is significant, will allow us to be able to take advantage of that demand in a way we really couldn't in the past without \u2013 with those resources. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Thanks for the follow-up. John, could you help us reconcile some of the components of the higher OpEx outlook or the reduced operating margin outlook for the second half. And is the legal and corporate reorganization spend still 150 to 200 basis points in terms of headwind for the year now? Is there any reason that extends perhaps into 2020? John Morici : No, Brandon. Its the one and a half to two points of expenses that's for the full year for that legal and reorganization. And we don\u2019t expect that to continue into next year. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Brandon. Next question? John Morici : Thanks Brandon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Misra : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones, number one, I think you had said on the last call the gross margin profile at the end of the year, you'd still be kind of towards the low end of that 73% to 78% range. Is that still the case? And then secondly, just a little bit more detail if I may ask for on the dynamics in your North American business. Just curious, are you seeing the detailing more on your lower volume GPs or orthos or who is really feeling the most competitive pressure in terms of your customer base? Thanks. John Morici : On your first question, Ravi, on the gross margin improvement, we still expect to see sequential improvement. So we've guided up from Q2 for gross margin in the third quarter and we expect that improvement to continue into the fourth quarter. Joe Hogan : Hey, Ravi, it's Joe. Your second question is dynamics of that, it's a really good question. When we look at that on the GP side, I mean, its hit-and-miss both on the orthos and the GP side. Our orthodontic data for the second quarter indicated there was really a reduction in number of adults that were going through orthodontist. And we know we recognize that. On a GP side, it hits the GP side also but what we see with our DSO specifically is they're up significantly in growth. I mean, there've been focused on Invisalign to hit it harder. So within that segment of GP, I think the individual practices its hit a little bit harder, the DSOs have really grabbed products like iGo, they\u2019ve institute that in the organization and done much better with it. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson [Evercore ISI]. Please proceed with your question. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Shirley Stacy : Hey, Elizabeth, we can barely hear you. Joe Hogan : Hi, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Anderson : Sorry about that. Can you hear me better now? Shirley Stacy : That's better. John Morici : We got it now, yes. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay, perfect. Sorry about that. So just in terms of mix in between your comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, can you talk about if there were certain like areas in particular, the non-comprehensive products where you saw like a shift between the first and second quarters? John Morici : Elizabeth, when you look at that our comprehensive held and they're really well, you remember \u2013 it's really important to remember the comprehensive, our larger size docs like diamond, diamond plus, platinum rely almost exclusively on those product lines because the discount that we give them really it makes it easier for them to be able to move up and down the portfolio. They liked that product line, the comprehensive side only because you get the five year additional aligners. So when you move to the non-comp in that increase, our Lite product line stood out really well. Our E7 did extremely well and also iGo by far was a real winner in that piece. So you remember a product like iGo too has one individual additional aligner that's offered with it too. So for those kinds of simple cases that also gives the doctors confidence to be able to attack those things with more of a middle range kind of a product. Elizabeth Anderson : And from an R&D perspective, I know you sort of over time have had like a steady drip of new products, Mandibular Advancement Invisalign First. Is there anything you could sort of talk about that you guys are working on in terms of further clinical advancements? John Morici : We'd have to chill you, Elizabeth, if we told you that. It's top secret. Okay. It's no a mystery that we've been working on what's called a rapid palatal expander. So when we talk about Invisalign First, you think about that a dental arch expansion product. So you take your teeth that are in your arch and you basically expand those teeth. A palate expander actually takes \u2013 from a morphological standpoint it just widens your mouth completely. That is something we've been working on. I feel we have a good line of sight on how to get that done. There'll be several \u2013 it will be more quarters before we introduce anything like that. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John Kreger : Thanks very much. Joe, can you just expand a little bit more on what you're seeing in China? If you're willing, how much is it slowing? Are you seeing any signs of market maturation and are there any competitive pressures that you're seeing there? Are you seeing it just in terms of a little bit more reticence on the part of the consumer to spend? Joe Hogan : John, I\u2019ll start with the end of your question. It's a little more reticence on consumers to spend. I mean, you've seen that in other consumer channels, when you look at what's going on, particularly with some U.S.-based companies and obviously the issues that we have between the United States and China right now. As far as the competition goes, John, I'd say Angel Align is a very confident competitor in China from a overall standpoint, but it's not that we feel that there's been any dramatic change in the sense of their competitive positioning or their ability to do certain cases or others. But maybe we recognize them as a confident competitor, it's just when you look at the different cities too, Tier 3, Tier 4, there's a huge GP area in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 city. That's why we put, iGo and the GP sales force to go into it. The Tier 1 cities are more orthodontic. And so we do segment in that way. When you talk about maturation or some kind of saturation, we just don't feel that. Again, we're moving into the teen season in China in the third quarters, normally the biggest quarter, obviously there's still a lot of spending that goes on in China around the teen side. And so, no, I honestly feel that this is consumer sentiment in general. It's reflected in other consumer-based businesses. It's not to your point, broadly driven by competition or by any kind of, I'd say saturation of clear aligners in that marketplace. I think we still have a long way to go before we'd ever reach that point. John Kreger : Great, thanks. And maybe one quick follow-up for this young adult demographic that you\u2019ve been talking about. What other levers do you have to really kind of improve the convenience that they perceive with Invisalign versus other options beyond sort of that classic price trade off? Joe Hogan : Well, I\u2019d say young adult is, how many doctor visits that they have to make John. And there are some technologies I don\u2019t want to get into right now, but there are more remote technologies that would allow doctor to the CDs patients, less frequently from an office standpoint to be able to monitor their progress remotely. And I think those kind of things that they hit the convenience side, but it also hits the cost side because the less time they spend in an office there\u2019s less doctor time associated with it. So it\u2019s lower cost too. So there is a convenience and a price point, we think of technology, and doctor understanding of specific kind of products and where \u2013 when and where to use them will allow us to be able to get us that segment better. John Kreger : Great, thank you. Joe Hogan : All right, John, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good afternoon. Joe Hogan : Hi, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : First, just one more clarification on China. It embedded in the outlook for the back half. Am I hearing you right that you assumed China actually gets worse? And then John Kreger asked this, but could you put any numbers around China and 2Q and what you\u2019re assuming for the balance of the year? John Morici : Yes, Steve, this is John. We assume China kind of stays as we\u2019ve seen. So we saw some of that slowed down in the second half of the quarter, second quarter. And we assume that that continues not knowing how that consumer sentiment is going to change over the next few months. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. And then the email that I\u2019m getting most frequently here is how are they thinking now about the LRP the 20 to 30 growth range beyond the next couple quarters and what are the drivers there? Joe, I appreciated that you\u2019ve called out that the competitive trialing might be in China. We all would imagine gets better. Is that the whole story we feel good about the LRP because of those two things? Joe Hogan : Yes, we\u2019re sticking to the 20%, 30% with competence, Steve, is nothing that really changed in that sense. And John, you\u2026 John Morici : That\u2019s how we\u2019re allocating resources and investing for that long-term growth model of revenue 20 to 30%. We\u2019re making investments where they\u2019re appropriate and looking for return on those investments to work with our long-term growth model. Joe Hogan : Yes. Steve, I just reemphasize China\u2019s not going away, right. I mean that\u2019s a big market. It\u2019s a phenomena. The other part that I think we talked about it, but it\u2019s not we just got back we were in Asia last week. It\u2019s not necessarily apparent as the rest of them \u2013 the rest of when you look at APAC is so strong. You have Japan approaching 50% growth rates or more. You have just incredibly strong region overall. We think we\u2019ll get through this China\u2019s situation. It\u2019s going to continue to be our second biggest marketplace. And I feel really good about our investments over there too, because I think it addresses this consumer sentiment piece that we can be more like a Chinese company than be viewed as a just an American company. Steve Beuchaw : Okay, that\u2019s clear. Thanks so munch. Joe Hogan : All right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay? Joe Hogan : Yes. Hi Jeff. John Morici : Hey Jeff. Jeff Johnson : Hey, all. John, I wanted to go back to Brandon\u2019s question just on margins, obviously you reiterated the 150 basis points to 200 basis point impact from the legal and the reorg, and what have you for the year? But the rest of the take down kind of in the second half guidance from a margin perspective ending up around 20% or so. Is that just the increased spend to try to reinvigorate top line or what other kind of levers that 20% operating margin instead of kind of the mid-20s we were thinking? John Morici : Yes. That gets us low branded are Jeff from the investments that we\u2019re making in marketing. So we\u2019re making those media investments in the third quarter, we\u2019re expected to continue to the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s a reflection in the overall op margin rate that I gave. Jeff Johnson : Fair enough. And Joe, maybe just a question on [indiscernible] in kind of your confidence that those software glitches issues, whatever the saving issues where all of that rolled into one competence that you\u2019re past that number one. And then maybe talk about your employee base in Costa Rica. Obviously you\u2019ve had a couple of competitors go down there and open treatment planning facilities in pretty close locations. Was that impacting in the second quarter at all? Does that impact over the short-term going forward? Just how to think about that? Joe Hogan : Yes. Jeff on the software release we had, I mean it was unfortunate, but we \u2013 it\u2019s contained and we know exactly what happened and that\u2019s been cleaned up broadly across the world. On the \u2013 when you think about Costa Rica too, we\u2019ve had a lot of pressure on that organization. It\u2019s not necessarily, because competitors have moved down there and we have lost some employees to them. It\u2019s just been our capacity. We\u2019ve had \u2013 our growth has been phenomenal. You still look at the stack rates, they\u2019re huge. It takes us \u2013 I think I\u2019ve mentioned before, Jeff, it takes us about six months to add capacity, basically people, technicians to Costa Rica to really get them up to speed where they can deal with customers. And we are a little bit behind the curve on that and customers felt it. This software that we released that you referenced put \u2013 did put pressure on them, because they \u2013 we had to go back and redo some cases in that, obviously put pressure on them, put pressure across our whole customer base when we did that. But it has nothing to do with SDC obviously has treatment planning down there and some of our more traditional competitors have moved people down there, but we haven\u2019t had an attrition rate that\u2019s significantly different in that area than what we\u2019ve had before. So we\u2019ve added capacity there. We\u2019re going to add more capacity in the second half of this year. So that we can take care of some of the increases in volume we see at times. Because if you \u2013 when you do see these increases in volume, it\u2019s not like they go away in two weeks, they ripple through this organization for 30 days or 40 days and we need to be able to have some little extra capacity to allow us to be able to address that. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Matthew O\u2019Brien: All right, thanks, afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, as I think about the quarter and the outlook for the business, I continually hear that Align has better products from clinicians. That\u2019s clear. It\u2019s just it seems like in the marketplace that message is being heard. So I\u2019m wondering what you can do to turn things around there. I know there are some of these investments, but can you be more specific on how you turn things around in North America somewhat quickly with these investments and the same goes for China where it\u2019s a consumer product, it\u2019s not a medically necessary product versus us encountering kind of a slow bleed as you have more competition in both geographies over the next several years. Joe Hogan : Matthew, I\u2019m not sure how to talk about the competition part more than what I have so far, right. We \u2013 I think we\u2019ve categorized them well. We know what their capabilities are. It\u2019s somewhat limited. When you say how to get at that, when some of these cases are offered for free or they\u2019re offered for $800 or $750, some more of those are going to try it. If I was an ortho, I tried too, given where we\u2019ve been in the marketplace and where our prices are or whatever and so. I think that\u2019s just part of the competitive environment or whatever, but we\u2019re being very clear about we don\u2019t see a systemic loss to our traditional competitors in any way. So I don\u2019t want to infer that at all either. From a China\u2019s standpoint, look China, again, I think we talk about that in a few other calls, a few seconds ago, China continued to be strong. Consumer sentiment, there is consumers sentiment. We\u2019re going to continue to invest there. We\u2019re going to put more salespeople in place. We\u2019ll follow through with continuing our training centers or manufacturing centers all we put in place. And we expect to China continue to grow and be \u2013 for the foreseeable future, the second largest area that we sell to. John, you can\u2026 John Morici : Sorry. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Okay. And then everybody is focusing on the negatives here and there\u2019s I get that, but there was some positives in the quarter. I\u2019d love to hear a little bit more about you started touching on it a bit, but the iTero number, I know there was some seasonality to it was just phenomenal again. Some of that\u2019s DSO related I\u2019d love to hear a little bit more about outside the DSOs what was driving that. And when we expect to see a lot more of that volume from all the iTero placements, and same thing goes with doc training, I think those are some of the best numbers that we\u2019ve seen in a while, when some of that training may manifest into higher volumes for the entire organization. Joe Hogan : I appreciate a positive comment like because there were a lot of good things in this quarter. One thing you missed is you look EMEA up 39% in the consistency of the growth across that EMEA region. It\u2019s really been amazing in that sense. I mentioned the other parts of APAC too strong growth that we saw. And again, we verified that last week when we were over to see the team. And in North America side, I mean when you look at these tweens, 7 to 10, up 140% and some of our other age groups, they\u2019ve been very extremely strong. DSO marketplace has been great for us. And GP is still growing double-digits and is not taken for granted in this business because we\u2019ve had some terrible, you\u2019d go back years ago of GP growth that we saw double-digits. We\u2019re continued to do well in that segment. But you pointed to iTero specifically in, I mean, it was a really an amazing quarter for iTero. So you have world-leading technology in iTero and with our 5D launch, it wasn\u2019t available in the United States. It\u2019s not yet. We\u2019re still working through the FDA, but in other parts of the world it hasn\u2019t made available. We\u2019re seeing both orthos and dental \u2013 dentists or general practitioners are really interested in that product line too. We have good sales force, combined with our iTero sales force. It\u2019s direct, but also with our Invisalign sales force too. And more and more, as it\u2019s no secret that dental is going digital. To starts the whole digital piece, the front end of it as a scanner, having to kind of technology we have with iTero. You can see in some of the statistics that I mentioned in my opening, 13.7 million scans done. I think 3.8 million that were done for restorative scans, meaning they had really nothing to do for the most part with Invisalign in that sense, kind of shows you the versatility of that product line too. So those areas are very strong in the area. Talked about doc training, we did have some terrific numbers across all geographies for the quarter. That\u2019s always a strong leading indicator of doc\u2019s interest in future Invisalign cases. It breaks down differently by different regions to how fast they\u2019ll go. But as an overall, signal in the sense of what\u2019s in front of us and the interest from a doctor\u2019s standpoint, the doctor training thing is good and I\u2019m glad you picked up on it. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Thank you. Joe Hogan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Joe Hogan : Hey, Steve. Steven Valiquette : Hey, guys. So nothing get too granular on what transpired over the past three, four months, but just coming back to the June quarter case volume for a moment. I guess, when you guys provided guidance for 2Q, obviously, that was in late April. Then you guys we had a lot of conferences through mid-June, with the message and everything seemed, okay. I guess, I\u2019m just wondering if most of these negative pressure points hits you maybe late in the quarter and in the month of June in particular. And when we come back to your comment that in North America, you\u2019re seeing improving trends in the first few weeks of Q3 and you just comparing July to June in particular. Just curious to kind of get little more color of how things kind of transpired throughout the quarter as we think about some of these pros and cons in the results. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Hey, Steve. Like you said, not to be over granular though. I think China by far was one where \u2013 when you\u2019ve got the June and all, it was more difficult than what we had anticipated. Our China team is terrific too. So you do count on these guys to be able to deliver toward end of the quarter. And we see that, time and time again, it just didn\u2019t materialize and that consumer sound, that piece became more and more visible to us, as we got through the quarter in that way. In North America, I\u2019d say in general, we were good with the team volume was up 24%, same as what we had in the previous quarter up 24% too. So there wasn\u2019t really a team issue from a North America standpoint. But we did see some slowdown, as we went into the quarter also. As you think about July in general and we talk about that increase, we\u2019re not just comparing it to June, we\u2019re talking about the entire quarter, the first and second quarters and what we at, when we talk about that increased us, we wouldn\u2019t mention it. Steven Valiquette : Okay. I appreciate the after color. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ryskin : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Quick one on the follow-up quarter and then one just to follow-up again on something that, Steve just touched on with the last one. First, start with the 3Q, if you just sort of look at your commentary on international, sequentially down with the China pressures and you\u2019ll get U.S. North America. Even if you\u2019ll count for the 2% impact you had at Q2 last year. It seems like it\u2019s a pretty aggressive cut the North America outlook. So I\u2019m just wondering how much conservative is little to that, especially since your point on improving trends in the first part of July. I guess I\u2019m saying is \u2013 was it really kitchen sink guide or sort of what\u2019s your outlook there. John Morici : Mike, this is John. Really, there\u2019s no change in how we guide, we look at a lot of factors and understanding of the market being a few weeks into the quarter. So we\u2019re \u2013 no change in terms of how we guide. We\u2019re just trying to put the pieces that we see. And as we mentioned with 2Q, we had some slow down, primarily China in June. And we want to be reflective of what we see. So no change in how we guide. We give our best estimate at a point in time. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Michael Ryskin : All right. I appreciate that. And quick follow-up again, just going into the sort of the bridge in 2Q, if you look at where international came in versus expectations may have been a little bit life, but it feels like the majority of the delta was actually in North America and especially on your comments on just June softness in China. We know roughly how big your China businesses for you. So it shouldn\u2019t have been that meaningful of an impact, especially if it was only a one month dynamic. So is there anything going on outside of China? I mean, is there anything that you can comment on in terms of your local presence there? You\u2019ve got the manufacturing as they built out. You\u2019ve got some of your other facilities that you\u2019re establishing there. Any other dynamics and play besides just the June consumer sentiment? John Morici : Nothing that we saw out of the ordinary, Mike. It was \u2013 we looked at the demand that we saw \u2013 some of the pressure that we saw in June. But it was around the consumer sentiment, like, Joe said, that China team delivers quarter-after-quarter. So we felt very confident that we\u2019ve got a great business there in terms of the investments that we\u2019ve made in treatment planning and now manufacturing and training centers and so on. So we\u2019re continuing to invest in grow, just calling a number that we see. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Mike. Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question, please. Operator : Our next comes from the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Rich : Thanks for squeezing me in. John, actually just had a question on the ASP outlook, and how we should be thinking about that sequentially. And as you look going forward, do you have any change in kind of promotional activity or discount? It\u2019s kind of big into how you\u2019re thinking about, where ASP is trend from here. John Morici : Yes, Nate. When we think about ASP is and really what we saw at the end of \u2013 we guided for at the end of last year was essentially flat ASPs. We have puts and takes as you know, with our business between international growth and comprehensive versus non-comprehensive. But what we\u2019ve seen through this year and our Q3 guide is consistent to the fact that notwithstanding FX, we expect it to be about flat as we go through. So we have puts and takes to it, but from an overall ASP that is flat. And the promotions that we have, like we have every quarter, no different, in terms of how we\u2019re thinking, we\u2019re trying to drive, increase utilization, trying to drive growth in our business and promotions continuous as usual. Nathan Rich : Okay, I appreciate that. And then just with the case guidance for 3Q. Is it possible to just kind of give us a sense in terms of orders of magnitude in the step down in the growth rate? How much was from the slowdown that you saw in China versus maybe a more competitive environment in North America? Just as we think about the relative impact of those factors. John Morici : Yes, Nate, most of what we saw, that slowdown or the guidance that we gave was related to China. Like you said, we saw this in June and that\u2019s a reflection of how we\u2019ve guided. So the majority of that was related to China. Nathan Rich : Okay. Thanks a lot. John Morici : All right, Nate. See you. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Nate. And thank you everyone for joining us. This concludes our conference call today. If you have further questions, please contact myself or Madelyn Homick in Investor Relations. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Please refer to these files for more detailed information.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights for the third quarter and briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and intra-oral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. For Q3, I'm pleased to report revenues, volumes and earnings above our third quarter outlook, driven by better-than-expected volume across the Invisalign portfolio in Asia Pacific and Latin America, reflecting record highs for both regions and improving trends in the North American orthodontics channel. Notwithstanding EMEA summer seasonality, we saw continued adoption from teens and especially young patients using Invisalign First across the board. Q3 Invisalign volumes were up 20.7% year-over-year, driven by the growth across the product portfolio as well as the expansion of our customer base, which increased by 5,900 new Invisalign doctors for a total of 63,000 active doctors worldwide. The iTero scanner and services business was up 16.5% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth across each region, and down sequentially as expected coming off a record second quarter.  Now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results, starting with the Americas region. For the Americas region, typical Q3 summer seasonality for adult case starts in North America was offset by the growth in North American teen market as well as the strength from Latin American orthodontists. Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year on tough comps. Recall in Q3 '18, we had a teen and adult promotion that drove approximately 4 to 5 points of growth in the Americas. In Q3, we trained over 2,700 new doctors in the Americas region, of which nearly half were Latin American doctors. On a sequential basis, Q3 Invisalign volume growth reflects increased utilization for the Americas region overall, driven by the North American Orthos at 19.1 cases per doctor, where we saw improved momentum throughout the quarter and good growth from teens in Invisalign First patients. North American GP volume was seasonally lower in Q3, and we're seeing improving trends into fourth quarter, reflecting benefit from our investment in sales resources added at the beginning of the year. New and existing reps are continuing to ramp up, and we would expect further progress over the remainder of the year. We also had continued strength across comprehensive and non-comprehensive products in Latin America, led by Brazil. Year-over-year, Q3 Invisalign volume for the Americas region was driven by continued growth from both the Ortho and GP channels, including the DSOs. The DSO channel remains an important channel and consistently grows faster than non-DSO practices.  For our international business, Q3 reflects increased growth in Asia Pacific, especially from our teen segment in China, partially offset by sequentially lower volume in EMEA due to the summer holidays for Invisalign practices in most European countries. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign volume increased 32.1%, reflecting strength across our product portfolio with continued expansion of our customer base. In Q3, we changed -- we trained over 3,100 new Invisalign doctors internationally, with 60% in the Asia Pacific region. In EMEA, Q3 Invisalign volumes were down sequentially as expected, reflecting more pronounced seasonality in the first half of the quarter and strong momentum in the back half, led by Iberia in the U.K. Q3 volumes were up 29% year-over-year with broad-based growth across the Invisalign product portfolio and continued momentum from Invisalign Go treatment.  We also continue to see strong growth across our key expansion markets as well, led by Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa. In Q3, as part of our corporate structure reorganization, we reallocated order acquisition for EMEA from the Netherlands to Poland. This site will serve as a centralized facility for order acquisition, local sales and support. In addition, this location will also offer treatment planning to support all of EMEA country markets except for Spain and Germany, where we'll continue to support their local markets.  For APAC, Q3 Invisalign volume increased 35.1% year-over-year, led by Greater China and Japan. We continue to see strong growth from GP dentist, which was up 53.2% year-over-year, especially in Japan, where adoption of Invisalign Go continues to exceed expectations. On a sequential basis, Q3 Invisalign volume for APAC reflects continued momentum in China, especially from teen cases and growth from Taiwan and Korea. We also saw increased adoption of Invisalign First in Japan and ANZ and Taiwan as well as positive results from Teen Edge professional marketing programs, which are helping to drive Invisalign growth. During the quarter, we opened the treatment planning facility in Yokohama, Japan, to better support Japanese doctors in local language and local time zones. APAC remains a huge growth opportunity for Align, and this investment reflects our commitment providing our customers with continued support as we grow and scale our business across the region.  Teens and kids continue to make up the largest portion of the orthodontic market and represent a huge growth opportunity for Invisalign treatment to replace metal braces worldwide. Over the past 2 years, we introduced 2 product innovations to help doctors treat more patients in this segment. Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement addresses roughly 45% of teen cases and is the only clear aligner to move the mandible forward while straightening teeth at the same time. Invisalign First treatment is the first clear aligner product designed with features specifically for growing patients as young as 7 years old, and Phase 1 addresses 20% of the orthodontic case starts each year. Both products have continued to grow and helped increase utilization for Invisalign treatment worldwide.  In Q3, 130,000 teenagers and kids as young as 7 years old started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, an increase of 31.5% year-over-year, reflecting continued adoption across all major regions, especially China. Cumulatively, nearly 2 million teens or younger patients have used Invisalign clear aligners.  In Q3, we continue to see strong dental engagement with consumers, reaching over 4.5 million unique visitors on Invisalign websites worldwide for a total of 62 million visitors to date. Our digital approach to teen marketing continues to drive awareness and interested teenagers into Invisalign practices. Other key metrics show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q3 quarterly slides.  In addition, we launched a new advertising campaign for North America at the beginning of the quarter. The North American campaign was launched across all key media channels with a reach to over 140 million consumers, combining a robust paid media strategy across prime broadcast, cable and connected TV channels with paid search and social media. While still new in the marketplace and very early in the cycle, we're seeing a positive response from doctors and consumers. In the last few weeks, all KPIs metrics have shown strong momentum with more than a 50% increase in Doctor Locator searches and in leads scheduled from our Smile Concierge service.  Finally, as many of you may have seen, we recently announced marketing relationships with several professional sports teens, including the San Francisco 49ers, the Toronto Raptors, the Carolina Hurricanes and the New England Patriots. Align is always looking for ways to evolve our brand marketing to be relevant to potential patients where they work, live and play.  Over the last few years, many sports brands have evolved their own brand programs to engage with fans in a variety of ways and through multiple touch points. Partnering with teens who have an omni-channel approach to brand marketing and engagement gives us direct access to large, loyal fan bases and helps us reach individual consumers and whole families through a variety of existing fan platforms. With the right team partners, we can create awareness for the power of winning smiles. And as always, the goal is the same for us : to build awareness and demand for Invisalign treatment and connect engaged consumers with Invisalign doctor practices in their markets.  For Q3, iTero scanner and services revenue was down sequentially as expected and up 16.5% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth across all regions and customer channels, including large DSOs. Year-to-date, iTero revenues were up 47.3%, reflecting continued adoption of digital dentistry. Cumulatively, over 18 million orthodontic scans and 4.3 million restorative scans have started with iTero scanners. Heartland Dental, one of our largest DSO partners, recently celebrated their millionth iTero scan, highlighting how important iTero and Invisalign workflow is in their doctor practices, which now includes 900 offices across the U.S. and is enabling them to add nearly 200,000 digital scans per month.  Use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q3, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased from 78.7% to 71.9% in Q3 of last year. International scans increased 62.5%, up from 53.9% in the same quarter last year. Within the Americas, 92.9% of cases submitted by North American orthos were submitted digitally. We continue to expand the iTero portfolio to address doctors' needs and enable them to more easily adopt Invisalign treatment in their practices.  In August, we announced the commercial availability of the iTero Element 2 scanner in China, with the first made in China iTero Element 2 produced in our manufacturing facility in Ziyang. The launch exemplifies Align's continued innovation and investment to advance digital dentistry in China.  In September, we announced a global distribution agreement for the iTero Element family of intraoral scanners with Zimmer Biomet Dental. The agreement enables us to leverage Zimmer Biomet Dental's extensive direct global sales force and network of dental clinicians and laboratories to help to further drive the penetration of iTero scanners and services in their growing digital restorative market. The collaboration also offers Zimmer Biomet Dental customers access to Invisalign clear aligners through the iTero platform to facilitate a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment approach. We know that a key differentiator in the evolution to a digital practice and dental ecosystem is clinical education. Through this collaboration, the iTero scanner becomes the exclusive intraoral scanner used in the U.S. and European Zimmer Biomet Institutes, which trains thousands of doctors annually in an interactive learning environment, with the ultimate goal of improved clinical outcomes. We also joined Zimmer at the Japan Society of Oral Implantology Meeting in Japan and at the EAO in Portugal, where the iTero intraoral scanners were showcased.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenue for the third quarter was $607.3 million, up 1.1% from the prior quarter and up 20.2% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Year-over-year revenue growth was favorable in all regions. For clear aligners, Q3 revenue of $516.3 million was up sequentially due to Invisalign volume growth in most geographies and higher ASPs. Year-over-year clear aligner revenue growth of 20.9% reflects strong Invisalign shipment growth across all customer channels and geographies and higher ASPs. Q3 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially by approximately $30 to $1,260, primarily due to price increases in all regions, partially offset by promotional discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Invisalign ASPs were up $30, primarily reflecting price increases in all regions, partially offset by promotional discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. Total Q3 Invisalign shipments of 384 point -- 385,400 cases were up 2.2% sequentially and up 20.7% year-over-year. For Americas Orthodontists, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 5.6% sequentially and up 16.4% year-over-year. For Americas GP Dentists, Invisalign case volume was down 4.1% sequentially and up 7.4% year-over-year. For international doctors, Invisalign case volume was up 2.5% sequentially and up 32.1% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the third quarter was $91.1 million, down 12.4% sequentially as expected, reflecting lower volume coming off another strong Q2, partially offset by higher ASPs. Year-over-year, scanners and services revenue was up 16.5%, driven by increased services revenue off of a higher installed base and higher volume.  Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 72%, flat sequentially and down 1.6 points year-over-year. Gross margin was impacted by approximately 0.3 points year-over-year due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 73.5%, down 0.2 points sequentially, primarily due to increased aligners per case, partially offset by higher ASPs and seasonally lower doctor training. Clear aligner gross margin was down 1.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased aligners per case, partially offset by higher ASPs. Scanner gross margin for the third quarter was 64.1%, up 0.5 points sequentially and up 0.2 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs and increased manufacturing efficiencies.  Q3 operating expenses were $310.4 million, up sequentially 21.3% and up 25.9% year-over-year. The sequential increase reflects the benefit of $51 million related to the Straumann litigation settlement recorded in the second quarter. Additionally, the third quarter includes a $6.8 million benefit from the early termination of our Invisalign store leases. The year-over-year increase reflects our investment in consumer advertising with a brand-new North American campaign launched in August, continued -- and the continued investment in R&D, geographic expansion and go-to-market activities, partially offset by the benefit from the early termination of our Invisalign store leases.  Our third quarter operating income of $127.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 20.9%, down 8.5 points sequentially and down 3.9 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to the $51 million benefit related to the Straumann settlement recorded in Q2, partially offset by a $6.8 million benefit related to the Invisalign store lease terminations in the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily due to lower gross margin, as described earlier, and the increased investments in our geographic expansion and go-to-market activities, partially offset by the benefit from the early termination of our Invisalign store leases in the third quarter.  Operating margin was impacted by approximately 0.6 points year-over-year due to the unfavorable foreign exchange. Interest, other income and expense for the third quarter was $1.3 million, down $16.1 million sequentially and flat on a year-over-year basis. The sequential decrease reflects the $15.8 million gain related to the sale of our equity investment in SmileDirectClub during the second quarter.  With regards to third quarter tax provision, our tax rate was 20.2%. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.28, down $0.55 sequentially and up $0.04 compared to the prior year.  Moving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2019, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short- and long-term investments, were $782.4 million, an increase of $16.5 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations, partially offset by $200 million used to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares of our stock. Of our $782.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $513.9 million was held in the U.S. and $268.5 million was held by our international entities. Q3 accounts receivable balance was $531.8 million, up approximately 2.3% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 79 days, up 2 days sequentially and up 4 days from Q3 last year. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $234.5 million, up $138.3 million compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $26.6 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow for the third quarter defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, amounted to $207.9 million.  During Q3 2019, we entered into and completed an accelerated stock repurchase agreement, ASR, to repurchase $200 million of our common stock, which was completed in September of 2019. We received a total of approximately 1.1 million shares for an average price of $176.61 per share. We have $200.5 million remaining available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program.  With that, let's turn to our Q4 outlook and the factors that inform our view, starting with the demand outlook. Q3 was a solid quarter, and momentum has continued to build into Q4, across all regions. For international, we expect Q4 volumes across to be up sequentially, reflecting strong uptick from EMEA, as doctors come back from summer holidays. For the Americas, we expect Q4 volumes to be up sequentially, reflecting growth across all key country markets as well as momentum in North American Ortho and GPs along with increased media spend and the launch of our new consumer advertising campaign, as Joe described earlier. We expect our iTero business to be up sequentially in Q4 to reflect end of the year capital equipment purchases and investment in growing the iTero business across all regions.  With this as a backdrop, we expect the fourth quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 400,000 to 407,000 cases, up approximately 20% to 22% year-over-year. We expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $640 million to $650 million, up approximately 20% to 22% year-over-year. Our Q4 revenue outlook assumes no SDC volume compared to the same quarter a year ago when aligner supply to SDC contributed about $5.8 million to revenue. We expect Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 71.7% to 72.4%. Q4 gross margin is up 0.4 points compared to Q3 as we expect continued improvements in our manufacturing efficiencies associated with higher volumes. We expect Q4 operating expenses to be in the range of $318 million to $323 million. Q4 operating margin should be in the range of 22% to 22.7%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. Diluted shares outstanding is expected to be approximately $79.4 million, exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together, we expect our Q4 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.42. In addition, we expect to repurchase at least $100 million of our stock in the open market in Q4.  As we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect capital expenditures for Q4 to be approximately $30 million to $35 million, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be $22 million to $24 million.  Before turning the call back to Joe, I want to update you on our corporate entity reorganization. On January 1, 2020, our EMEA headquarters in the Netherlands will officially move to Switzerland. Our new Swiss location will serve as the headquarters for all regional, commercial and operational activities in EMEA and will be supported by the existing network of local offices established across the region. Our new corporate entity, Align Technology Switzerland GmbH, will assume all responsibility for the sale and distribution of the Invisalign system, iTero intraoral scanners and associated Align goods and services in EMEA, previously provided by Align Technology B.V.  Our local and global teens have been working diligently to ensure a very smooth transition while supporting our doctors, suppliers and employees, many of whom have decided not to relocate to Switzerland but will stay on in transitional roles as needed. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication in supporting this major company initiative. While it is never easy to make this kind of change, especially when it impacts team members who have helped build the EMEA business and have contributed so much to our overall success, we are very excited about our new operations in Switzerland.  Now I'll turn the call back to Joe for closing comments. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John, and thanks for joining our call today. Overall, Q3 was a solid quarter for us across the board with increasing momentum in APAC and North America that has carried us over into Q4. As you can see from the high end of our guidance, the implied full year growth rate from Invisalign volume is 23.5%, with international growth in the mid to high 30s. . Overall, our business remains very healthy with numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpenetrated market. We remain confident in both the enormous opportunity ahead to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry with our doctor customers, and in our ability to execute our strategy to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment globally.  With that, I want to thank you again for joining the call. I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming financial conferences and meetings, including the Invisalign GP Summit in November in Las Vegas. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Erin Wright with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Erin Wright : In terms of the higher OpEx spend, are you seeing the returns from the North America, I guess, stepped-up marketing and media spend as you expected? And how should we be thinking about that level of spend into the fourth quarter just based on the responses that you're seeing from the marketing campaigns so far? And will this, I guess, contribute to the accelerating kind of volume trends in the fourth quarter as well as momentum into 2020? Joseph Hogan : Erin, it's Joe. Yes, we're seeing, as you can tell from the statistics we just recorded, we have a real large take-up when you think about doc locator searches, which is a primary or concierge service and what they're handling. Remember, the concierge service takes those customers and then directs them directly to doctors that we have a high degree of certainty that they'll actually convert them into Invisalign. As we move into the fourth quarter, expect the same amount of investment. Also in the Americas too with the improvements you're seeing is also our sales force and the additions we put together. As we said at the beginning of the year, it usually takes at least 9 months, 6 to 9 months, to see some kind of traction that we're seeing with the sales force, too. So both the advertisements from a North America standpoint and the added salespeople, we think, are really contributing to that momentum we just reported. Erin Wright : Okay. Great. And then my follow-up, just on China, in particular. Can you speak to what you're seeing across that market, just given some of the commentary you had in the previous quarter around the softness in that geography? If you could give us an update there, that would be great. Joseph Hogan : Well, the momentum we reported in China that we -- when we had our announcement in the second quarter, continued throughout the quarter. So I think we had 26% growth in China in the second quarter. As we move into the third quarter, we're in the upper 30% range. Overall, we're just seeing good uptake. We had a good teen season there. We've hired 40% more people in China also. It takes them a while to actually become acclimatized, be trained and have them effective in China also. So we feel good about the momentum in China.  I think the economic situation there with reporting the slowest growth we've seen in 30 years, we know we have a headwind there because that continues, it reported in the second quarter, too. But overall, we think we've made the right adjustments and we have the right focus right now to continue some good growth there. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Stephen Beuchaw : I'm sure there'll be a lot of questions about Invisalign and appropriately so, so I want to go a different direction and ask about a couple other things. One is actually the iTero number in the quarter. I know it's normal seasonally to see things make a move like this, but I wonder, as you saw trends for iTero in the quarter, where -- there was actually a lot going on operationally, given what you were doing with Zimmer, which I'm sure was a significant time investment for the sales force where you had a product launch coming in a key region. Do you think there was any disruption in terms of the commercial effort around iTero during the quarter? John Morici : Steve, it's John. No, there's no disruption. I mean, we are -- if you look at iTero for -- on a year-to-date basis, it's up 47%. You're going to have some timing that happens by quarter, but we feel very good where iTero is. It's the front end of our digital ecosystem, very critical to our business, and you're going to have fluctuations by quarter. But we feel very good where iTero is so far this year. Stephen Beuchaw : Okay. And then sorry, Joe, for leaving you out here, but I got a couple for John. One is on the transition in Europe, can you speak to how much duplicative costs you might be -- might have been carrying between the Switzerland operations and the Netherlands operations and what that could mean for the tax rate over time as you change the domicile of the organization. And then I wonder if you could give us an update on what you think prospectively the impact of facilities' manufacturing capacity utilization is going to be going forward on gross margins? John Morici : Yes, Steve. In terms of the changes that we make and making in EMEA, it's really to simplify some of the organization that we have and in light of many of the tax changes and other structures that we had to create. So look at it from that standpoint. It simplifies things a little bit from an entity standpoint and gives us some flexibility to changes to our tax -- to taxes that happen globally. From a facility standpoint, we're putting in manufacturing where it makes sense. We've talked a lot about China manufacturing, and that continues to ramp up. Treatment planning globally would be closer to our customers. That's very important to us. And there's always a transition period in terms of that productivity, as they become more and more productive, but we feel very good about the investments that we've made and the gross margin that we see now and what we're forecasting. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger : Joe, what's your sense about the underlying health of consumer spending on orthodontics at this point? Is it getting better or worse? And I'm curious if you think the -- all the money going into some of the direct-to-consumer-oriented models like SDC, is that proving to be a net benefit to Align or a little bit of a detriment as you weigh sort of awareness versus any competitive shifts? Joseph Hogan : John, first of all, I think you picked up in your survey and other people do too when we picked it up is, I mean, we see good consumer spending right now from an orthodontic standpoint. Align stands out in that spending when you look at it specifically. As far as how that's driven, obviously, we've put a lot more into consumer advertising, and some of the DTC competitors have done that also. I do think that, that raises consumer brand awareness. No question. I think the consumers go to the Internet to try to answer those questions. They'll go to their doctors to try to answer those questions, too. So I can't deny, John. I think that our advertising and some competitive advertising in that sense probably does raise all boats to a certain extent. John Kreger : Great. And then one quick follow-up. The utilization among your North American GPs has been kind of flat over the last couple of years. What is your thinking about the best way to drive that higher over the next year or 2? Joseph Hogan : First of all, John, I think you know that. You've been with us for a long time. We add so many GPs every year. 150,000 of them, we train significant numbers of them each year. And so you end up with a dilutive effect in that sense. So the numbers that we reported, it always is around 3.4% to 3.6% from quarter-to-quarter. But back to your question, I think the way to do this is : one, obviously, our DSO approach is a good one because as I talked about it being a force multiplier before you work with these strong DSOs, they have their own training for their groups. They help quantify workflow and do different things that for years in this business, I think we thought we just needed 1 product, but we've learned over time, like a product like iGo really isn't a product, it's a system. It's a system that really works with GPs to identify patients that qualify for this. It fits well with their workflow. It allows them to be confident when they're in front of patients that they can handle those cases, and we stand behind them. So overall, it's right products, right systems, working with DSOs that help us to become -- drive better penetration, too. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Ravi Misra : Can hear me okay? Shirley Stacy : Yes. Sure. Ravi Misra : Great. So just a question on the gross margin, not to pick too much at what I think was a pretty good quarter, just why aren't we seeing, given the kind of pricing uptick that looks like it emerged in the third quarter, why aren't we seeing more of a flow-through on the clear aligner gross margin in the fourth quarter? And maybe if you could help us think about pricing in the fourth quarter for the ASPs. I think last quarter, you said it would be about even with the second quarter, and that's pretty much a lot better than that. So do you feel more confidence in your ability to take price here? John Morici : Yes. Robbie, this is John. As we've discussed, I mean, we've taken price up in the third quarter, and you see that show up in ASPs. We're also investing to -- in our manufacturing and treatment plant to be closer to our customers. Sometimes that offsets -- and in third quarter, there was not much change from Q2. In Q4, we talked about our guidance, which is up sequentially in gross margin. It's a reflection of more volume productivity that we expect to continue to see at these manufacturing sites. And we'll continue to see that benefit. When you look at the ASPs, as you mentioned, like I said, at $1,260, was a good increase of $30 from Q2. We were able to -- when we think about the forecast to that, it will come down slightly. The mix was really high from a comprehensive standpoint in Q3. So when we take it down to Q4, it'll be, we think, closer to $1,245, which is very consistent that we've talked about as being essentially flat as we go through this year. Ravi Misra : Great. And then if I can just maybe squeeze in a follow-up to the implications on teen there with the comprehensive, just if you could confirm or maybe provide some color. As that -- as you get deeper penetration at that market, it looks like you've been doing 30% growth here the last few quarters. How should we think about the mix shift on the pricing? That should be kind of a good guy, right, with the more comprehensive cases? Joseph Hogan : Yes, Rob, it's Joe. Yes, you're right. It's a mix shift. Remember, from a teen growth standpoint, and we're reporting really good above 30% teen growth globally, but we're still the -- our utilization rates in that marketplace are way below our clinical entitlement, I would say. Today, we can handle almost all teen cases. So with that in mind, though, it is a mix-up. It is primarily a comprehensive marketplace. It's primarily an ortho marketplace in how it works. We feel really good about our portfolio to be able to address the teen patients right now. And long term, we see that as a counterbalance on ASPs that we all think about. Operator : Next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block : Joe, maybe first one for you. Just any comments, maybe I missed it, but sort of on comprehensive versus non-comprehensive growth this quarter. And then with the GP summit approaching next month, is there any plan to more aggressively sort of pursue call it this lower acuity cases through that channel? And then I've got a follow-up. Joseph Hogan : Yes. I mean, Jon, honestly, I mean, from a comprehensive standpoint, obviously, still 70% of our portfolio more goes that way. But with the introduction of Lite, iGo, products like this, we made an adjustment on E5 this quarter, E7, all these other products. I mean that part of our product line has traditionally been growing faster and with the comprehensive thing is. Now it's a law of small numbers versus large numbers, but we do see increased growth in that area. When we look at the GP channel, we do look at the GP channel as a way to get at patients, what we call kind of a sub-acute kind of on a patient base to do that. So I mentioned iGo on the last call also as being a system that allows us to do that. Obviously, Lite does that also. So you'll see us, Jon, increasingly focused on that channel, but also think about working really closely with GPs on not just the product line, but the system itself with iTero, how to be able to do treatment planning quickly and to give the GPs confidence that when they adopt these cases, that they'll finish and they'll finish well. Those are the 3 critical variables we know we have to hit to really drive significant growth. Jonathan Block : Got it. Very helpful. And then just maybe John, the reorg for this year, is there sort of a refined number? Is that 1.5% or 2%? Or is it still in that range? And then sort of part B to that question is it follows up on Ravi's. Just to be as specific as possible, the gross margin is in sort of flattish Q3 to Q4, is it a globalizing the supply chain headwind? Or is it more aligners per case headwind? And I'm asking that because the more aligners per case, that probably continues with teen, et cetera, but the globalizing supply chain, that seems more of a '19 event than a '20 event. So any more detail you can give around gross margin would be helpful. John Morici : Yes, Jon, it's really both. I mean, when you look at, especially as we do and work with our doctors doing more and more complicated cases, as comprehensive grows and Invisalign First and teen and so on, those end up being more aligners and end up impacting our gross margin. The globalization that we're doing, that's much more short term. As we said, getting close to our customers is very, very critical to us. Treatment planning, manufacturing. But as you get more and more capacity there and scale that, you see productivity improvements. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Shirley Stacy : Kevin, you there? Kevin Caliendo : Yes. Sorry, I apologize. Did you take the same price increases internationally as you did domestically? That's the first quick one. And then just looking at the trend, quarterly trend in case growth and overall revenue growth, is seasonality shifting as international sales grow as a percentage? And how should we think about that going forward? Joseph Hogan : Kevin, Joe. On the pricing piece, yes, it's about the same. I think there's some mix and tucks on Lite versus comprehensive. But basically the same price increase globally across the board. On the revenue growth, the seasonality of it. I think the biggest thing that you can think of, there's really a couple of trends in this business is, one, in North America, you move into the third quarter, it's teen season and GPs tend to decline. But the biggest mix is in Europe, where you basically go down for vacation, I mean, lights go out for us for a long period of time, and then obviously come back in September. And then you got China on the other side that kind of compensates for that in the past. So those are the big, I would say, countercyclical or cyclical movements that we have in the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Richard Newitter : I have two, Joe. Just the first one. Just last quarter, you gave a little bit of color on anecdotally what you're seeing out in the field from doctor-directed competition and some of the discounting that might be taking place. I was just curious if you could comment on the -- on the trend into the current quarter and what you're seeing there? Anything that's surprising you or different from what you saw last quarter on those? And I have a follow-up. Joseph Hogan : Richard, on the -- with that comment I made last quarter had to do with doctor-directed to DYI model and primarily North America and some kind of young adult segments. We actually saw that stabilize and actually start to improve in the third quarter from an order endpoint. So actually saw good momentum in the right direction there. Richard Newitter : Okay. And I was just referring to the more traditional competitors that recently started launching products where there might be some trialing. That's what you're referring to as improving, not the DTC... Joseph Hogan : No. Actually, I'd say both. I mean the traditional competitors that are out there, we acknowledged them last quarter, which we thought we had to, but there's no fundamental change in that, what we saw in the second quarter versus what we saw in the third quarter. Richard Newitter : Okay. And then just on China, Joe. I get the sense that you just have improved visibility relative to kind of where you were sitting at this time last conference call. Is that the right kind of directional takeaway from the call as you see the trends into the fourth quarter? Clearly, it picked up in China in the third quarter. And what would you say, your long-range plan top line greater than 20% growth for the foreseeable future. What would you say your confidence level is kind of today versus maybe 3 months ago, particularly with -- now that you have more data points in hand on China and some of those North America trend last quarter that were in focus. Joseph Hogan : Rich, I'll keep my comments kind of in this year. But I'd say, what China shaped up to be is pretty much what we called in the second quarter. We said the teen season is going to come in China. We thought that would be a lift. We've hired the salespeople. We're looking for that to take hold and be able to move the business forward. And so to say we have better visibility, I think we have the same visibility that we had quarter-to-quarter. Actually, from an execution standpoint, I just think the steps that we've taken with some of the pressure on consumer demand that we reported in the second quarter, the operational steps that we took in China on the ground, we're seeing a good result for it and we feel good about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Maybe just a couple of housekeeping items. Joe, any update on the timing of the U.S. approval for the 5D scanner? And then any color you can share with us as far as mandibular uptake in the U.S.? Joseph Hogan : Brandon, on the 5D scanner, the FDA is the FDA, and we feel confident we'll get through here. Early part of next year would be the -- my best forecast in that sense. I could tell you, from a 5D standpoint, the uptick around the world has been good. The carries detection piece to be able to see cracks or deterioration in teeth has been terrific. And so it's really been a changing aspect to the clinical GP practice to be able to see carries in a way that you really can't see them without a near infrared technology. So we're actually really excited about that. And we're excited to get it into North America. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Jeffrey Johnson : Joe, I want to go back to China, just you did talk last quarter that you would lose that kind of teen tailwind as you go into the fourth quarter and next kind of normalizes that to some adult patients and all that. But it sounds like, as you've said on this call, you're starting to see some good traction with some of the sales force adds and other efforts in that area. So should we look at Q2 as kind of that 26% number that you brought up again this quarter from 2Q, is that kind of where our -- the baseline should be from here, and you think, at least going forward, somewhere in there or above, given some of these recent efforts? Joseph Hogan : Jeff, obviously, we think we did well in the third quarter in China. Some of it was obviously the teen season. But actually, we had some pretty good adult growth, too. We're moving out of teen season there. As we talked about, the momentum going into the fourth quarter has been good there, too. As far as the baseline, Jeff, goes or whatever, hey, China is a growth market for us. We wouldn't be putting manufacturing in over there. We wouldn't be putting treatment planning, we wouldn't make the investments we're making, unless we feel that China is going to continue to be the second largest market that we're growing with. So I think that's the way you have to think about it going forward. What is it, Jeff? Shirley Stacy : There you are. Hang on. Sorry, what did you say? Jeffrey Johnson : I said Shirley has got a quick hook tonight. So thank you for keeping the on for a follow-up... Shirley Stacy : Well, we're trying to get to as many analysts as we can, but go ahead. Joseph Hogan : She's upset about that with [indiscernible] Jeffrey Johnson : Well, as an Illinois fan, I won't comment on that. Joe, I do want to ask on the direct or kind of channel in the third quarter. Obviously, you've seen some states enact as your hurdles for some of those models and all that. I'm sure it's too early to see anything like that in your number or numbers. But I'd be interested, kind of what are you doing with your doctors to kind of try to combat some of that competition? Are you having any success in kind of helping these doctors understand where they need to be price point at? Is there other channel support you can provide? Just what are you doing to really kind of combat that direct-to-consumer angle? Joseph Hogan : Jeff, first of all, when we think about things that you're talking about, having a doctor in the center of this thing, having an X-ray, you're moving teeth through bone, people think that -- I think majority of people or patients out there think that teeth just hang from gums. They don't actually understand that the teeth are boned in. And actually seeing what's going on in the bone is a pretty good indicator if you should go through orthodontic treatment or not.  But with that said, with the GPs, I talked about in previous caller is the iGo product really is the best platform that we have right now in the sense of how to really educate doctors to go after these patients. And what I'm hearing more and more from GPs is they're having more and more of a dialogue with their patients. Their patients are coming in, they're asking questions now. They're saying, \"Hey, what does this mean? What can you do for me? What's your price point for being able to straighten my sixth anterior teeth?\" And we are trying to give them as many tools as we possibly can as far as workflow tools, which we have with iTero and iGo, and then products that they can really have a lot of confidence in.  So I would say our initial push on that in United States has been improving significantly. You'll see it at the GP Summit, what we're rolling out and the kind of focus areas we have around that. But obviously, we'll have a very strong focus in that area, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : A lot of my questions at this point have been taken. But I just wanted to know if you could comment on the rise in inventory in the quarter? It seems like it just ticked up a little bit quarter-over-quarter but sort of has been rising year-over-year. And I just wanted to know if that was -- if there was something in what you guys were doing or something else behind that? John Morici : Elizabeth, this is John. Really nothing out of the ordinary. When we look at the inventory, it's primarily on the iTero side. And it's really how we manufacture and much more level loading from a manufacturing standpoint. And really the rise that you saw in the third quarter is really anticipation of the volume that we expect in the fourth quarter. So that's all it is. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Andrew Stafford : This is Drew on for Matt, and congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to touch on consumer financing. I know you've talked about it a little bit in the past, and you're working through a third-party provider. Are you hearing any demand from customers asking for more options there? And would you have interest in expanding that program further? John Morici : Yes, Drew, this is John. Of course, we want to do whatever we can to try to help turn those consumers into patients at a doctor. So financing is a piece of it. And we're working with companies, not just in the U.S. but other places as well, to try to remove some of that friction, give more options to those consumers, understand what the monthly payments are, how much down and so on. So there's a lot more that we can do there. We're making some progress, and you'll see new ways that we'll be coming to help, again, remove some of that friction for those consumers. Andrew Stafford : Okay. And then just on the deal with Zimmer, maybe you could provide some thoughts on sort of why you chose them as a partner than maybe some of the geographies you'll be focusing on early on? Joseph Hogan : Drew, it's Joe. On the Zimmer, we're really pleased to have them as partners. When you look at the history of that company from an implant standpoint, they're one of the leaders out there. They actually needed a digital front end, and that's what iTero really supply to them.  When you look at our product line in conjunction with that, when you look at modern kind of treatments like that, implantology, is there's often a lot of space creation that has to take place in the sense of if a tooth is out of a mouth for a period of time, your teeth start to move over to fill that space. And more and more dentists do not want to remove enamel to put that implant in. So using aligners to be able to separate those teeth and allow an implant to be able to be a lot less invasive than it would be if you didn't account for that spacing.  So overall, we're excited about it. I mean they're obviously strong all over the world. They complement us in so many places, including China. And so we're really excited about having a partnership, and we think we're starting off pretty well in the sense of the training and all that we reported. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays Bank. Steven Valiquette : So not to beat China to death here, but when you talked about some of the things you did to improve results over there, whether it was on the investments in the GP, dentist, sales force, sales program centered on Invisalign Go or even just the increased consumer marketing spend, I guess, I'm curious if any one of these variables really stood out as the driver of the improvement? Or was it a little bit of everything. And then also, do you have any sort of high-level data points just on cases per doc in China on an absolute basis or even sort of relative to the rest of Align overall? Joseph Hogan : Steve, on the variables of improvement, unfortunately, we're a multi-variable equation when you get to aligners. Things are sold in binary here. But I think you do add a point to the two big ones, which would be just an increase in consumer focus and then the sales force that we put in place. That's -- our GP effort, we're just really moving into that, too, and we're arranging that properly also. But those efforts, we think, are contributing also. But I'd say it's a mix of those 3 variables. I can't weigh them for you, really. Steven Valiquette : Okay. What about the cases per doc in China? Any color on that? Joseph Hogan : No, we don't want to give any color on that one. Right now, it's just -- I'd say you have to look at it as we're driving penetration there, and we're training a lot of doctors as we ramp up in China. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Just two quick ones here. First, on ASPs. I think guidance would put you at something like $1,250 for the year. Do you think you can kind of maintain that level of ASP going forward? And can you kind of just talk through what kind of the key factors would be as we think about ASPs going forward? And then just a very quick follow-up. John, just wondering if there was any catch-up benefit to cases in the quarter, kind of post that ClinCheck disruption that you highlighted in 2Q. John Morici : Well, I'll start with that one first because there was really no catch up or no benefit from that. As we had said in the second quarter call, it's really de minimis. There wasn't much of an effect that hit -- that affected the quarter. So there really wasn't an impact in the third quarter.  In terms of ASPs, there's going to be puts and takes. And we've talked a number of times about what those puts and takes are. As we grow in comprehensive, like we had a strong comprehensive quarter in the third quarter, ASPs are higher, growing internationally, generally at a higher ASP.  But then you also have significant growth in the low stage, and that can affect the mix as well. So what we've said all year, and as we look at things, we thought it would be relatively consistent. The puts and takes would kind of offset. Notwithstanding any FX changes, we thought the puts and takes would offset. And we saw that in the third quarter and we are guiding that in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : I'll try to be brief. First, just one quick follow-on on the ASP. Obviously, really nice improvement in the third quarter. I was wondering if you've got any -- I realize it doesn't show up in the numbers, but maybe you've got some qualitative pushback or feedback from docs on the price increase, sort of what was the response there? Because this was the biggest quarter-over-quarter move in quite some time. And also maybe if you saw some divergence in results from some of your highest utilization docs that are getting the advantaged discounts that can absorb it versus some of the lower-tier docs that are paying more close to the full price and, therefore, maybe weighing some of the other doctor-directed options? Joseph Hogan : Michael, it's Joe. On the ASP piece, obviously, we raised price. John talked about it, some of the exchange aspect, whatever. But I think one thing I want the analysts who follow us to remember, like we said before, ASPs will fluctuate. But sometimes, our ASP is going down meaning our gross margins go up. Our lower-end products actually have a higher gross margin than our comprehensive product line. I know it's counterintuitive, but that's actually how it works.  So I mean, I think, keep that in mind going forward. If you see some of that lumpiness from an ASP standpoint start heading down, don't take as a trajectory for lower gross margin. It's just those 2 are separate that way. And John, do you want to add anything on your end? John Morici : And so like we said, you're going to have some offsets, but we're trying to grow from a -- all the way from low stage, the more simple cases, all the way to the complicated cases. And we believe in those traditional orthodontic case starts that we have product that can help move teeth, but the market expansion and some of that market expansion is going to be at those lower-stage products that are at a lower ASP, but we look at that as incremental business for us. Michael Ryskin : And on the -- quick follow-up on the EMEA headquarters move you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you're expecting some turnover in personnel. Any expectation for disruption to the business in early 2020, sort of how are you bracing for that? How are you preparing and just to make sure that it's a smooth transition going into January next year? Joseph Hogan : Yes, it's Joe again. Look, what we did in EMEA, which was fortuitous in a sense, about 3 years ago, we began to decentralize. We had a really big headquarters staff out of the Netherlands. It dictated a lot of what the regions did and had to do that because it's a relatively small business back then, and we needed to keep specialization at headquarters.  Over the last three years, we really moved that out into the countries, moved it into France and Spain and Germany and different areas. And so we really embedded in those countries some real talent that I feel has good continuity will take them through. Now there's some overall headquarters talent that we don't want to lose that we're working hard to save, but I don't see it being a big, big disruptor for the business at all. John Morici : And this has been something that -- Mike, this has been going on all year. We have a complete transition plan, very clear as to who's moving and how things are happening so that come January 1, it's very clear. So it's something that, as we've talked about on these calls since the beginning of the year, we've talked about this move and we feel really good about the plan that we have now and be able to hit the ground running in 2020. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and, of course, at the GP Summit in November. If you have any follow-on questions, please contact Madeline Homick in Investor Relations. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the fourth quarter and full year then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, clear aligners and intra-oral scanners. John will provide more detail on our financial results, discuss our outlook for the first quarter and share a high level thoughts about 2020. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year with record revenues and volumes. Q4 Invisalign shipments increased 23.9% year-over-year and marked another major milestone with our 8 millionth Invisalign patient who started treatment in December. This rate of growth is really amazing to me given our 7 million Invisalign patient was just this past May seven months ago. For Q4 iTero scanner revenues increased 20.2% year-over-year with strong growth especially from international doctors. On a sequential basis Invisalign volumes were up 7.4% driven by strong growth in North America, EMEA and Latin America with all-time highs in those regions. We also saw strong growth from Invisalign Go systems across all regions reflecting continued progress with GP dentists as well as a ramp up from Invisalign Moderate which launched at the beginning of Q4 in North America. For the quarter we shifted Invisalign cases to approximately 67,000 doctors of which 7.2 thousand were first-time customers. We also trained over 5,500 new doctors in Q4 including 3400 international doctors. For the full year total revenues of $2.4 billion reflect record revenues up 22.4% year-over-year includes $2 billion in clear line of revenues and 2019 Invisalign volumes were up 24.2% year-over-year and iTero scanner revenues were up 38.5% year-over-year. During the year over 1.5 million people started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners worldwide including 447,000 teens and younger patients which is up 34.1%. Now let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter results starting with the Americas region. For the Americas region Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 4.9% sequentially and up 19.3% year-over-year. On a sequential basis Q4 results reflects strong growth from North American GP dentists as well as continued strength from Latin American doctors. Year-over-year growth for Q4 reflects continued adoption of Invisalign treatment from both orthodontist and GP dentists channels which were up 20.5% and 17.3% respectively. Latin America volume was up 79% year-over-year led by continued strong growth from Brazil. For the full year America's Invisalign volume was up 17.5%. For international business Q4 was a great quarter with Invisalign case volume up 10.5% sequentially driven by strong growth in EMEA region rebounding from Q3 \u201819 summer holidays and offset somewhat by slower growth in A-Pac specifically China. On a year-over-year basis strong Invisalign volume of 30.1% reflects increased utilization and continued expansion of our customer base in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific region. In Q4 we trained over 3400 new Invisalign doctors internationally and roughly 55% EMEA and 45% in A-Pac. For the year international volume was up 34% year-on-year and EMEA Q4 was a strong quarter volumes were up 37.3% sequentially driven by growth and all core markets primarily from Spain and Italy as well as from the teen segments which was up 50.6% from Q3 19. On a year-over-year basis Invisalign volume was up 31.5% driven by growth in all core country markets including a teen segment which is up 38.7% from the prior year. For the full year EMEA volume was up 34.2% led by Spain, Italy and France as well as our key expansion markets led by Turkey, the Middle East and Africa region and Russia. For A-Pac Q4 was down sequentially as expected following a very strong Q3 19 teen season in China as well as less than expected volume from adults partially offset by strong volume growth from Japan. We believe the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and economic uncertainty remained a headwind for our consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases. On a year-over-year basis A-Pac volume was up 28% driven by growth across the region led by Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia. For the year A-Pac volume was up 33.7%. Overall for the teen market in Q4 approximately 116,000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners an increase of 33.1% year-over-year driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions. For the full year total teen cases worldwide grew 34.1% to approximately 447,000 teenagers or 29.3% of our total volume. I'm pleased with our progress treating teenagers and younger kids and continued strong adoption of Invisalign clear aligners globally. For 2019 Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement was up 85% year-over-year and Invisalign First was up 455% year-over-year for a cumulative total of 41.5 thousand cases and 32.4 thousand cases to date respectively. Product, technology and innovation continues to be a key growth driver across our regions. Over the past year we\u2019ve launched several new Invisalign offerings for both comprehensive and non-comprehensive treatment giving doctors more tools and choices to treat at greater range of cases from adults to teenagers and now kids as young as seven years old as well as new treatment options and technology designed to appeal to consumers who are considering or starting Invisalign treatment. In Q4 we introduced the Invisalign moderate package, a 20 stage treatment option designed for consumers whose treatment goals fall between the existing Invisalign light and Invisalign comprehensive packages and can be completed in the range of 5 to 12 months. We\u2019ve launched SmileView an online tool designed to help prospective Invisalign patients visualize a new straighter smile before they offer Invisalign treatment. Alliance new SmileView visualization tool is designed to drive awareness and demand for teeth straightening using Invisalign treatment by engaging consumers and allowing them to see a simulation of what their smile could look like. We also upgraded my Invisalign mobile app which previously focused on patients already in treatment but now includes several new features to help potential patients who are seeking information about teeth straightening treatment including an in-app version of SmileView. Consumers can use the app to take a selfie and instantly visualize how their smile can transform after Invisalign treatment. Our consumer marketing efforts are designed to build the category and drive demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. We invest over a 100 million each year in consumer marketing programs including TV, digital social media, PR, event marketing as well as our patient concierge program. Our goals are to making Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. In Q4 we continue to see strong engagement with consumers and had over 5.3 million unique visitors on invisalign.com sites for a total of 18 million year-over-year. Other key metrics showed increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q4 quarterly slides. For iTero scanner and services business Q4 is very strong quarter with better than expected revenues up 6.6% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year driven by strength from all regions. Q4 volumes reflect continued commercialization of the iTero Element 2 and Element Flex scanners especially for orthodontists in North America to continue rollout with our major DSO partners and increased sales internationally especially in Japan. 2019 was a great year for iTero business with total revenues up 38.5% year-over-year cumulatively over 20.5 million orthodontic scans and 4.7 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. Use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submission continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization. For Q4 total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 79.5% from 73.5% in Q4 of last year. International scans increase to 64.7%, up from 57.5% in the same quarter last year. What's really exciting is to see that within the Americas 93.3% of cases submitted by North American orthodontists are submitted digitally now. We are pleased with the continued progress of iTero business and remain confident that will continue to help drive our overall growth and help increase the adoption of our digital platform Invisalign treatment. With that I'll turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $649.8 million up 7% from the prior quarter and up 21.7% from the corresponding quarter a year ago for clear aligners Q4 revenues of $543.6 million was up 5.3% sequentially with strong Invisalign volume from EMEA and North America. Year-over-year clear aligner revenues growth of 22% reflects strong Invisalign growth volume across all regions. Clear aligner revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.3 points year-over-year from foreign exchange. Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially by approximately $20 to $1,240 primarily due to discounts mix and unfavorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis Q4 Invisalign ASPs increased approximately $5 primarily reflecting price increases in all regions and increased additional aligner revenues partially offset by promotional discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift. Total Q4 Invisalign shipments of 413.7 thousand cases were up 7.4% sequentially and up 23.9% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the fourth quarter was $106.2 million up 16.6% sequentially due to volume increases in EMEA and Americas. Year-over-year revenues were up 20.2% primarily due to volume increases in EMEA, A-Pac and the Americas as well as higher services revenues from our increased installed base. Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 72.6% up 0.06 point six points sequentially and of 0.9 point year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.1% up 0.6 point sequentially primarily due to lower freight and training costs and lower number of aligners per case partially offset by lower Invisalign ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin was flat year-over-year primarily due to lower training costs and a slight increase in Invisalign ASPs offset by an increase in aligners per case. Scanner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.9% up 0.8 point sequentially primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by lower ASPs and up 5 points year-over-year primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and higher service revenue and scanner ASPs. Q4 operating expenses were $320.8 million up sequentially 3.4% and up 22.2% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses primarily reflects our continued investment in sales and marketing and R&D activities partially offset by lower litigation expenses. Additionally the third quarter included a $6.8 million benefit from the settlement of our Invisalign store leases. Year-over-year the increase in operating expenses reflects higher spending commensurate with go-to market activities offset by lower legal expenses. Our fourth-quarter operating income was $151.2 million up 18.9% sequentially and up 25.5% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 23.3% up 2.4 points sequentially and up 0.7 points year-over-year. The sequential increases in operating income and operating margin are primarily attributed to an improved gross profit and reduction in litigation expenses. Operating margin was impacted by approximately 0.6 points year-over-year from foreign exchange. The third quarter operating income included a $6.8 million benefit from the settlement of our Invisalign store leases which increased Q3 operating margin by 1.1%. On a year-over-year basis the increase in operating income and operating margin primarily reflects higher gross profit and operating leverage partially offset by continued investment in R&D geographic expansion and go to market activities. With regards to fourth-quarter tax provision our tax rate was 22.2% which includes approximately $5.8 million of tax benefit related to a tax audit settlement. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.53 up $0.25 sequentially and up $0.33 compared to the prior year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019 cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including both short and long term investments were $868.6 million an increase of approximately $86.7 million from the prior quarter which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations. Of our $868.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $590.1 million was held in the U.S. and $278.5 million was held by our international entities. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $550.3 million up approximately 3.5% sequentially. Our overall day sales outstanding was 76 days down 3 days sequentially and up 2 days as compared to Q4 last year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $218.2 million and free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $175.6 million. Our business continues to have a very strong cash generation. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $42.5 million primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. During Q4, 2019 we\u2019ve repurchased $100.5 million of our stock against our stock buyback authorization and have $100 million still available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program. Before we move to the Q1 outlook I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2019 results. In 2019 we shipped a record 1.5 million Invisalign cases up 24.2%. This reflects 34% volume growth from our international doctors and 17.5% volume growth from our America's doctors. Shipments of our iTero scanner were up 29.7% over 2018. Total revenue was a record $2.4 billion up 22.4% year-over-year with clear aligner revenues of $2 billion up 19.8% year-over-year. Clear aligner revenue growth was impacted by approximately 2.6 points year-over-year from foreign exchange. 2019 iTero scanner and services revenues were a record $38.1 million up 38.5%. Full year operating income of $542.5 million up 16.3% versus 2018 and operating margin at 22.5%. 2019 operating income also includes a litigation benefit of $51 million and Invisalign store closure cost of $23 million for a net positive impact on operating margin of approximately 1.2%. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1 point year-over-year from foreign exchange. Free cash flow was $597.6 million up $266.2 million versus 2018. For the year we\u2019ve repurchased over 1.8 million shares of alliance stock for $400 million. 2019 diluted earnings per share was $5.53. Before I comment on the demand outlook I wanted to take a minute to talk about the corporate structure reorganization to relocate our European headquarters from the Netherlands to Switzerland in Q1 and the implication to our GAAP financials. As a result of the corporate structure reorganization to relocate our European headquarters from the Netherlands to Switzerland in Q1 our Q1, 2020 GAAP tax rate will reflect a significant one-time tax benefit associated with the recognition of a deferred tax assets related to the inter entity sale of certain intellectual property rights. This deferred tax benefit will be amortized starting in 2020 and will continue into subsequent quarters and years. The period over which this tax benefit will be recognized depends on the profitability of our Swiss headquarters and therefore is uncertain at this time. Management ordinarily assesses the health of our business with regard to these types of one-time events and believes this reorganization will make it difficult for investors to assess our core underlying financial performance where we to report solely based on GAAP. Therefore, we will supplement our GAAP information with non-GAAP measures going forward. Beginning in Q1, 2020 in addition to our GAAP results we will present non-GAAP measures that exclude the aforementioned tax impact along with certain other items that may not be indicative of our fundamental operating performance including discrete cash and non-cash charges in order to present investors with greater transparency into our core business operations. We will present GAAP, non-GAAP and a reconciliation in our earnings release in conference call materials. With that let's turn to our Q1 outlook and the factors that inform our view. Q4 was a strong quarter with record volumes and we expect to enter Q1 with this momentum from both the Americas and the EMEA regions. For the Americas region we expect Q1 to increase sequentially with growth from North America orthodontists and GP dentists. For international we expect Q1 volumes to be down sequentially. We expect demand to be up sequentially as momentum continues from Q4. However, we expect the growth to be offset by a sequential decrease in A-Pac primarily due to the expected impact from the novel coronavirus in China. We expect our iTero business to be down sequentially following a seasonally strong Q4 and consistent with seasonal trends in capital equipment market and fewer sales in China. Many of you have been following the news regarding the recent outbreak of the novel corona virus in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei providence in China. China is one of our largest country markets and represents roughly 8% of our total revenues. It is home to hundreds of employees across China. Thankfully we are not aware of any employee or family member who has contracted the novel corona virus. The situation in China is very fluid and we are closely monitoring it. We are in contact with all relevant agencies globally. The Chinese government has implemented travel bans and has essentially shut down public transportation in Wuhan. It has also issued public warnings to avoid all non-essential medical and dental procedures for the time being. Some government-run hospitals and private clinics are following suit by instructing patients to stay home unless it's an emergency. While we do not believe there is any impact to our product safety due to the stringent health and safety procedures ingrained in our manufacturing processes, we are taking additional precautions across China to minimize the risk of spreading illness to our internal teams including additional protections and health screening procedures as well as travel restrictions. Given the increased uncertainty and disruption to our employees doctor's practices, their patients and consumers we believe it is prudent to reduce our outlook for Q1 to reflect the increased risk. Therefore, for Q1 our outlook reflects approximately 20,000 to 25,000 less Invisalign cases and $30 million to $35 million less revenues for Invisalign and iTero product sold in China. In addition, we are also absorbing $3 million to $4 million in idle China manufacturing plant and treatment planning capacity which results in approximately 0.5% gross margin impact. With this as a backdrop we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows. Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 396,000 to 406,000 cases up approximately 13% to 16% year over year. We expect Q1 revenues to be in the range of $615 million to $630 million up by approximately 12% to 15% year-over-year. Our supply agreement with SDC was terminated December 31, 2019 and hence our Q1, 2020 revenue outlook does not reflect any SDC volume as compared to the same quarter a year ago when non Invisalign aligners supply to SDC contributed about $5.7 million to revenue. On a GAAP basis we expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 71.5% to 72%. Q1 gross margin is expected to be down sequentially from slightly lower ASPs driven by lower mix of China volume, in idle China manufacturing and treatment planning capacity in our facility in Ji'an. On a non-GAAP basis we expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 71.7% to 72.2% excluding stock-based compensation from gross profit. We expect Q1 GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $345 million to $350 million which reflects our continued investments in go-to market activities along with our annual increase in employee compensation expenses. On a GAAP basis Q1 operating margin is expected to be in a range of 15.4% to 16.5%. On a non-GAAP basis we expect operating margin to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% excluding stock-based compensation from operating income. On a GAAP basis our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately negative 1400% which includes approximately $1.4 billion of tax benefit associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the intra entity sale of certain intellectual property rights resulting from our corporate structure reorganization. This deferred tax benefit will be amortized starting in 2020 and continue into subsequent quarters and years. The period over which the tax benefit will be recognized depends on the profitability of our Swiss headquarters and is therefore is uncertain at this time. On a non-GAAP basis excluding the one-time benefit from the intra entity sale of certain IP rights as mentioned above and the tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, we expect our tax rate for Q1, 2020 to range from approximately 22% to 23%. Diluted shares outstanding should be approximately $79.1 million exclusive of any share repurchases. Taken together we expect our Q1, 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $18.65 to $18.74. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.28 from excluding the one-time tax benefit from the intro entity sale of IP rights as mentioned above and the stock-based compensation related expenses. In addition, as we continue our operational expansion efforts, we expect capital expenditures for Q1 to be approximately $95 million to $100 million. And we expect depreciation and amortization to be $23 million to $25 million. Now, let me turn to our view for the full-year 2020. As I just described, the situation in China surrounding the novel corona virus is very fluid. While our Q1 outlook includes our best view of how the corona virus will impact our business in the first quarter. It is very difficult to predict and forecast the longer-term impact. Therefore we are providing you with our best view of 2020 prior to the novel corona virus outbreak so that you can use it as a baseline from which to build your models for the year. This means that you will need to make your own assumptions about how the corona virus outbreak impacts our business over the remainder of 2020. Beyond the Q1 outlook in our commentary for 2020 below, we will now provide specific 2020 guidance at this time. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and update these comments when appropriate. With that, our outlook for 2020 notwithstanding the impact of foreign exchange rates and the novel corona virus is as follows. We anticipate total revenue growth for the company Invisalign and iTero to be at the low end of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. We anticipate Invisalign volume to be at the low end of our long-term growth model target of 20% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, we anticipate 2020 operating margin to be slightly above our 2019 operating margin of 22.5%. We also expect our long-term operating margin range of 25% to 30% to remain unchanged. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 2020 operating margin to be approximately 3.5% higher than our GAAP operating margin excluding stock-based compensation from operating income. On a GAAP basis, our 2020 tax provision will include approximately $1.4 billion of tax benefit in Q1 associated with the recognition of a differed tax asset related to the intra-entity sale of certain intellectual property rights. This differed tax benefit will be amortized starting in 2020 and continue into subsequent quarters and years. The period over which this tax benefit will be recognized depends on the profitability of our Swiss headquarters and therefore is uncertain at this time. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time tax benefit from the intra-entity sale of certain IP rights as mentioned above and a tax benefits related to stock-based compensation we expect our tax rate for 2020 to range from approximately 22% to 23%. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks John and thanks to those of you joining our call today. Overall, 2019 was a great year for Align and I'm very pleased with the strong performance for both our Invisalign and iTero businesses. Not only did we celebrate our 22nd year in business but we also achieved several major milestones including our 8 millionth Invisalign patient, 2.4 billion in revenue for the first time. As we kickoff 2020, we're very concerned for the safety and health of our employees, customers, doctors, and their patients in China. The wellbeing is our top priority and we are doing what we can to ensure that they are on good hands. We're working with our local teams to donate medical supplies and provide funding to help combat the outbreak. Like SARS in 2003, the corona virus is already having a major impact on China and may expand to other countries around the world. I saw and experienced this impact as the CEO of [GE] Healthcare. We expect that like SARS emerged before it, in time the virus will be addressed, the markets will assume an equilibrium and our business in China will continue to grow. The timing of this is uncertain but the future growth opportunity for our business in China is certain. While we are mindful of the increased uncertainty in China and its impact on our Q1 outlook, it's important to take a step back and remember that our business is broad and deep. We have a strong growth in other regions and are seeing strong momentum in the Americas, across EMEA and an in all other countries and APAC especially Japan, Australia and New Zealand, South-East Asia, Taiwan, and Korea. In closing, I want to share with you a few thought of you regarding the future of our industry. Never before I have seen an amount of change in products, technology, distribution channels and business models. Align has always believed that the market opportunity for clear aligners is significantly larger than the underlying orthodontic case starts each year. We believe that over 300 million people want a better smile and the best way to access that potential patients is through doctors. Using a digital approach with iTero scanners and the Invisalign system. Our partnership with doctors is a critical part of how we win with consumers and we will continue to insist that patients visit a doctor in person for Invisalign treatment. If I could leave you with one thing is that Align is not just a provider of the best clear aligner in the industry and our clear aligner is not just a piece of plastic. Align is founded on digital, IT data, artificial intelligence, software, algorithms, digital scanning and 3D printing. We are the largest mass customized business the world has ever seen. Each Invisalign aligner is the output of millions of lines of code in 1000s of digital actions that allow us to ship 0.5 million customized Class II medical devices a day. As a digital leader, we must continue to provide doctors with the best technology and tools to help them treat any patient. In 2020, we expect to bring several new products and systems and services to market. But we must provide more than just individual products. In digital, you pick a platform not a product. You pick a company you believe in for the long-term. Digital dentistry is being driven by products like iTero scanners and Invisalign clear aligners. And we believe our digital platform is setting the foundation for the future of dentistry. Aligner and doctor partners are sitting on the edge of one of the biggest areas of growth that dentistry has ever seen. And we are excited about what this means for our business and continued growth prospects in 2020 and beyond as we continue to transform smiles and change lives. With that, I want to thank you again for joining the call. I look forward to updating you on our progress. As the year unfolds, we'll see many of you at the Chicago Mid-Winter Meeting next month as well as the industry and financial conferences throughout the year. Including our Analyst Meeting on May 12 in New York City. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Rich : Hi good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. Joe, maybe just to start on China. The revenue headwind that you guided to, I think it's kind of 60% or so of your kind of total China volume. Can you talk maybe just about what you've seen so far in January that kind of that you used to kind of inform your estimate of the case and revenue impact and if we continue to see this play out, can you kind of think about how to think about how we should trend the impact going forward. Joseph Hogan : You know Nathan that that we framed it as well as we can in the first quarter. I mean, that's and that's what we can see right now. I think our responsibility when you think about it is we're through January right now, we can take a look at our order rates. And we can responsibly make the prediction that John just did that we're going to 20,000 to 25,000 cases that we think are going to be pressured on. Then unfortunate part of this whole thing is we say we're on the dark side of the moon right now because of Chinese New Year and our order rates drop off to a point that you hardly see them. And it's not just now, it's been every year since and since. The government there is extended the holiday's for another week or so and it could go on. We really don\u2019t have, we just take our best guess on that 20,000, 25,000, and we're not ready to project, I'm not ready to project anything into the second quarter and the rest of the year. Remember, going back to SARS, I talked about I was involved in that at GE Healthcare is that I remember took six months from the initial infection rate all the way to not to that ended but it actually stabilized and things got back in gear again, so. We know that it'd be more than the first quarter it will be impacted but none of us were ready to give any kind of a forecast just to extend to that. Nathan Rich : That's fair. And then, maybe just a question on the America's GP growth. There is a nice acceleration in the quarter, utilization also takes higher. You've obviously put a lot of investment into that channel. Can you maybe just talk about some of the traction that you're seeing among the GP base that you serve? Joseph Hogan : Yes. There is, it is multiple levers we pull in that sense, all right. We have more of a segmentation around GPs today from a sales standpoint. You'll see that accentuated as we go into 2020. We have a product called iGo that it just fits the workflow aspect and sees produce extremely well. Then you have to add to that the extra salespeople we put in last year. A lot of those salespeople were making GP cost but there is just and you know there is only so far it go for the orthodontic community. And the last part of that, we have a huge amount of increased advertising from a consumer standpoint. I read about the consumer hits for new interest in Invisalign which are pretty outstanding when you look at it from a year-over-year basis. So, it's really all those variables we see are being put in to place to help to drive that growth. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Nate. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my call. Shirley Stacy : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Caliendo : Just a quick one on China. Hi. So, quick one on China. The how is it impacting the training of the doctors in China. Obviously, it's impacting your revenues. But is it impacting the overall expansion of your business there as well so that as we think about the number of doctors and think about the number of dentists there that will be in registered Invisalign users. How do we think about the impact this is going to have on that as well? Joseph Hogan : Kevin, honestly it's a good question because that is a variable in the equation just to think of. So, right now you can imagine when you have a contagion like this, you don\u2019t want a lot of people hanging out together and Chinese government knows that and we know it too. Our training facilities are in Shanghai and also Chengdu. There is obviously there is infection rates in those areas but they're not like the major provinces that have been impacted so far. But my anticipation is after the holidays you would just have to watch and see exactly what develops in the different provinces in China and what that means. If it's not and you know a big issue in Shanghai or Chengdu or whatever obviously we'll bring doctors and train them. But we're not in a position to even guess on that right now. But is a great question, it's a key variable and you must think develop will certainly come back after the first quarter and let you know. Kevin Caliendo : And just one quick follow-up, as we talk about sort of expectations around margin expansion embedded in your 2020 guidance. Can you just a little bit of apples to apples on what you expect if we were to sort of back-in to your non-GAAP gross margin or operating margin expansion, what's sort of embedded in the non-GAAP side year-over-year? John Morici : Yes Kevin, this is John Morici. Yes, we would expect it to be slightly up both on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis for operating margin as well as growth margin. Kevin Caliendo : Okay great, thank you so much. Joseph Hogan : Yes, thanks Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John Kreger : Hi, thanks very much. John, first one's for you. Just to clarify that the full-year '20 commentary that you gave us, does that reflect a weaker first quarter from China but the rest is up to us or does it not reflect the Q1 hedge, I just wanted to clarify that. John Morici : It's the latter, it does not reflect any impact from China. John Kreger : No impact from China. Okay, that's helpful. And then Joe, again just ticking on the China theme. If we think about over the last year the rates of growth that you guys have experienced in that region have been all over the place. From your perspective, what do you sort of view sort of the new normal there in terms of once we get beyond the infection outbreak, is a 20% is it a 50% - do you have an update if you're on it. Joseph Hogan : John, I don\u2019t. I mean, because obviously we're in the storm right now and just trying to get through what that looks like. As I said in my script, if you think about, as we came off the third quarter, we had a really good teen season, we didn\u2019t have as much of an adult pickup in the fourth quarter as we'd hoped. But again it was double digit growth and it's still robust growth but not the 50% to 60% that we had joined in China for several years, so. I'd say John I'd like to give that to you, I can't reliably give it to you now but its double digit growth. We continue to make our investments, we are continued to be excited about. China is our second biggest market and we don\u2019t think that's going to change but we certainly got to get through this cloud before we can give you something definitive in that sense. John Kreger : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jon Block : All right, thanks guys. Good afternoon. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Jon. Jon Block : So, let me throw out a couple of growth rates on China just that kind of you some implied that. I mean with 20,000 to 25,000 fever cases in 1Q. It seems like you're implying that China's down 50% year-over-year in the first quarter in case volumes. And that would even be considering corona virus just sort in that there from the entire quarter from a Rev Rec standpoint. So, is that in the ballpark that we're seeing sort of that magnitude of a de-sell. Then maybe the follow-up to that first question would be more importantly what do you think about these cases, are they lost, are they delayed, are they some sort of a combination with you? John Morici : Hey Jon, this is John. I think you're in the ballpark I think when you look at what we see from China. I mean, it's certainly last year was significant growth in Q1 and this year obviously impacted by the corona virus It's difficult to say from other cases lost or delayed and so under certainly for this time period they're not they're not happening it's difficult for us to see afterwards after this period of time to see whether those cases come back or not but at least for the first quarter here we're assuming that they're not going to come into the quarter. Jon Block : Okay got it. And then maybe to shift gears and I don't want everything lost on China Joe you highlighted and I think for the first time quantified the number of map and teams and Invisalign first cases pardon me. I think the summation was around 75,000 at 450,000 team cases for the year. So this has quickly become 15% to 20% of your teen cases maybe you can just talk to that do you still see hyper growth for those two offerings into 2020 and beyond and maybe there's an update on palatal expansion as well? Thanks guys. Joseph Hogan : Hi Jon I'm really excited about the [map] gross when you see that and you remember map 2 it's kind of age contained, it's a growth aspect between like you know 10 years old and 12.5 years old that really fits but when you take map and you combine that with first that is about 20% to 25% including palatal expansion of the team marketplace. So the idea that that's 15% to 20% of our team cases you talked about matches are pretty well in the sense of what we're seeing in the marketplace overall. I do think you'll continue to see this hyper growth out there. It is a great solution. We look at teens first and how it works. You don't see it John but we continue to improve map all the time. We learn about anchorage on back molars and certain kinds of teeth and whatever. We program those things. We have silent releases but piece by piece we get better at being confident and moving those class two things forward. So overall we're excited about it. I'm confident about the technology. Lastly on the palate expansion piece we know how to make this. We have the right kind of software to develop it. The trick is finding something that you can actually scale from a manufacturing standpoint and get consistent properties with it. And I feel we've been closing in on that rather fast. So we'll give you more of an update as we go into the investors conference in June, I mean in May on a more specificity around that kind of a launch date. Jon Block : Fair enough. Thanks for your time guys. Joseph Hogan : Okay. All right. See you John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Richard Newitter : Hi thanks for taking the questions. John I have two for you. Just going back to your comment on your experience with SARS the last time and the impact on the business you are running there at GE, can you maybe just give a little bit more color what's the definition of stabilization and kind of maybe just talk through some of the visibility that was able to come into focus and how that happened over that six-month time period? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. John Morici : Yes. It just really interesting is to say when I talk about stabilization it means infection rate is how when you start to get to that plateau about not an increase in infection rate but a decrease and you'll see that that's kind of the deceleration and that indicates that it's kind of under control. Again what I learned in 2003 about China is and I think in the Western world we missed this sometimes, it's how much influence the overall government influences there. You can see they change holidays. They lock down cities. They take drastic measures to try to deal with these things. It's something it\u2019s really unheard from a Western world standpoint. I think we kind of have to respect that that it's a society that will respond to these kind of things in a way that we're not necessarily used to which is actually good for the population because they're just trying to isolate it and contain that thing because depending that virus hasn't quantified yet with exactly it's infection rate meaning how many people are infected per person is infected but the numbers are jumping around but this is in the area of SARS and so I think the best proxy we can have right now is a SARS side. So that's the two things as one is when a plateau is when fewer people are being infected you see that curve start coming down and then secondly is how fast the Chinese government will move and that's why we're staying close with what's going on there and just staying behind the government and trying to support their actions. Joseph Hogan : Okay Rich. Richard Newitter : Okay. That's helpful. Great. Joseph Hogan : No, nothing. Richard Newitter : Okay. Just to follow up here on I appreciate the operating margin guidance excluding the China factors here but let's just say there is some extended impact moving through the year. What's your, how are you thinking about your approach to operating margins if there were to be kind of an extended shortfall in revenues in that region and would you kind of go full blast on the spend or is there a target that you'll kind of look to on preserving leverage, thanks. John Morici : Hey Rich this is John. It's probably too early to tell that now. I mean like we said we're kind of in the dark side right now of the extended Chinese New Year. We'll see how things progress as we come out and make that assessment. I mean as we've talked about a number of times in our business there's a lot of different leverage that we can pull or not pull based on the conditions that are going on in a particular market and we would assess that as well with China. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple here and hello one was asked a little bit earlier just about the deferral of these cases. I mean if they're locking everybody down in China at this point it's not like they're going to be getting brackets and wires. So I'm just trying to figure out you know why this wouldn't come back in eventually and then if it were to come back in say in Q4 timeframe or something like that could you do upwards of 50,000 cases in a quarter? So like all of us have come running back to you fairly quickly if be all clear with signal? Joseph Hogan : You know Matt could we do 50,000 cases yes. I mean we have capacity. We have both treatment capacity and we have bleed off capacity obviously through Mexico and Costa Rica if we were overwhelmed in China what we have there too but Matt my experience in this business is if things don't happen like that that you don't get this kind of a bow wave that comes after something like this and so it's not that you lose those cases from an adult standpoint they just get pushed out into the future but they don't come back to you all at once. It's just latent demand. The only exception I would make to that that I would guess that the teen season because teens are kind of times based on their age that you have a little more what I call bolus effect there. You have a bow wave that you've really capitalized on teens but it wouldn't occur that way with adults. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Okay. Can you give us, so it's fair to assume that this is not lost revenue. It will come back at some time. Can you give us any sense for the split between the two teens versus adult over in China? Joseph Hogan : No, at this point in time given what we're seeing over there I can't even guess that. If you're asking for historical splits I don't think we've shared that data in the past and just know that our third quarter is always our biggest quarter in China and it's the biggest because it is teen season. So if you take that look at historically you'd see what those numbers look like on adult versus teen. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Got it. One quick one for John just on gross margin. It's come down over the last kind of three years to the low 70s in 2019. A lot of moving parts here but how do we think about that metric going forward? Are we kind of getting close to the bottom on that metric or should we expect more kind of annual erosion of that metric? John Morici : Well, I think you saw that our gross margin improved a 60 basis points in Q4 from Q3 and we would look into the future to expect that with the cases that we do sometimes more difficult versus even the non-comprehensive cases we know how to drive that gross margin and we'd expect to see improvement in 2020 and beyond. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Thank you. Joseph Hogan : Thank you Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Beuchaw : Thanks for the time here. Hi, I wanted to try to maybe put a rosier lens potentially on China for just a second. So we can consider the possibility that things do resolve. One is and I am sorry if I missed this but did you try to grow through the fourth quarter and then the second part of it is if this ends up isolated to Wuhan or the province surrounding Wuhan how does that change your view on the impact of the business? Joseph Hogan : Hey Steve it's Joe. It would obviously change it because now you segment what the issue is in China but I don't have a guess in the sense of what that would mean. I mean when you think about it obviously Shanghai is a big part of our business and more north of that Beijing is to I'd say the coastal provinces or whatever have always been pretty big. So I think your comment would be if it's just isolated to Wuhan or generally isolated Wuhan the effect won't be as dramatic but I can't, I really can't quantify it Steve. And I find it kind of surprising that it\u2019s not that the infection rates going to reach the other provinces the way it has Wuhan it's just the Chinese government will take the same steps there to make sure that whatever infection is they do have in those regions don't end up being like Wuhan. Does that make sense? Stephen Beuchaw : It makes a lot of sense and I'm sorry did you give China growth for 4Q? Joseph Hogan : No, we didn't Steve. It's similar growth that we saw in Q3. Stephen Beuchaw : Okay. Perfect. Thank you and then John just a couple of quick one\u2019s for you and then I'll drop back into queue. One is are you willing to give folks a sense for how much of the benefit on the margins in 2020 there is tied to the wind down of the Netherlands facility or some of the legal expenditures winding down and then can you give a sense for what your assumption is for pricing year-on-year and the outlook for 2020? I really appreciate that color here. Thank you. John Morici : Yes. When you look at some of that litigation and some of those entity restructuring programs it was about, it impacted us in 2019 by about a point of margin. So essentially that's a benefit for us in 2020 and that's part of our expansion but when we look at the expectations for 2020 and a comparison versus 2019 we would expect margin expansion and whether using GAAP or non-GAAP based on the leverage and the investments that we're making. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe, I don't have a question about China. Actually I want to talk about the U.S. I am curious if you've seen any, just curious to get your latest views around just the competitive environment between DTC and then the office and also notice you put Frank Quinn in a new role in terms of head of the U.S. curious about the rationale behind that and whether that's a reflection of a bigger focus on perhaps the DSO channel? Joseph Hogan : Brandon that's a good question actually. That's a good deep question. First of all I mean you saw our growth in the Americas for the fourth quarter. It's good. It's accelerating in a GP channel and good progress in the Ortho channel. So obviously I feel good about, I talked about in a previous caller in the sense of the investments we've made in sales people and advertising products and all that we have in those different channels and we look at that going forward we feel good about that capability. From a DTC standpoint we've always stuck with what we said. I mean we know that DTC will go after some of the same patients we do but we haven't necessarily felt an impact in that sense and you see us pushing hard in the sense of our product and portfolio to go after that. We talked about 100 million patients that we think want treatment from an orthodontic standpoint in North America. Other competitors, honestly they're out there. I can't say that we've made any price moves against them. We haven't necessarily felt that we have lost any significant volume in any consistent way and so I don't have anything different to report from that standpoint and I did the previous quarters that we had a discussion. I think when you're hearing about that too Brandon it's what I think we've been consistent for the last two years. When I talked about at the end of my script about this digital platform there's a lot of work you have to do to compete in this marketplace. It's not like just I could produce a plastic aligner and then I can have a material difference in how aligner is effective in the marketplace. There's just so many things you got to be good at in this business from a logistic standpoint, from a manufacturing standpoint, your digital platform, how it serves consumers and what it does with docs. You got to be able to play really well on multi dimensions and I'm not saying that none of our competitors will reach that they're just not at that scale right now but I think that it's made a tremendous difference to us in any way. Brandon Couillard : Thanks and then there is question about \u2013 Speaker: I am sorry. On Frank I'm sorry, on Franky, but Frank is a great commercial leader. I know he's associated with DSOs and he helped to put us on the map with DSOs with his leadership but overall Frank he came here with good external experience from a sales and dental standpoint. He has really helped the business that way and I thought he is a perfect pick for us to really help to I say to really help us not just extend what we do but to put a lot of focus from a commercial standpoint in our business. So we're excited about Frank. He has a good relationship with Simon. He has great experience from Europe also and taking some best practices there and implementing them. So we're excited about Frank and Simon probably the North American team. Brandon Couillard : And a question about the Invisalign moderate. Any early feedback you can share on that rollout as an international launch in the works and just curious about your thoughts in terms of whether you might see more trade up from Invisalign light rather than more so than trade down perhaps from a more comprehensive case for those patients? Joseph Hogan : Yes, I think we haven't actually documented much trade up from light product line. It's most of it have been trade down from a comprehensive but remember when you trade down on this product line it still has a gross margins. It's accretive to our business and decretive in that sense. So we're allowing more choice for our patients, allowing more choice for our doctors. But we're not doing this to an extent that it really hurts our operating profit. Brandon Couillard : Thank you. Joseph Hogan : Yes. See you Brandon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Johnson : Hey guys thanks. Good afternoon. Joe I missed the prepared remark. So I'll go back to the transcript on that but just a question one other on China just maybe you addressed it but are you seeing any bleed outside of China any of the tangential markets where patients there also has been to go to hospital settings dental settings, dental office settings things like that any early indications of anything brewing like that? Joseph Hogan : No, Jeff nothing like that so far. We haven't seen anything anywhere around the world in that sense. Hong Kong has been kind of locked down since the protest or whatever so it's hard to get its signal out of there one way or another but Taiwan, Korea some of the neighboring countries Southeast Asia we haven't seen anything. Jeffrey Johnson : All right. That's helpful and then in the GP summit late last year Joe you made a big effort I thought to kind of at least put in people's head the idea of around a $2500 price point, $3,000 price point things like that. We've anecdotally been hearing some guys dropping their prices there to compete more against the DTCs. We did some survey work though and didn't find that at all in fact I think GPs and orthos both thought their price points that they charged patients going up over the next 12 and 24 months. Just what are you hearing on a more consolidated basis. Are these docs willing to kind of go aggressively after this lower comprehensive or non-comprehensive market and use some of your newer product to do that and really get after that 100 million patient population in North America. Joseph Hogan : Yes, Jeff it's funny. It\u2019s not funny but it's really interesting there's a lot of noise out there right and it's just your question is how do you pull signal from noise out of this whole thing and what we feel is obviously there's a lot of doctors both GPs and orthos. There is a segment, a significant segment of them that see really a clinical build meaning if you don't have to do a complete bite reconfiguration on. You can responsibly move anterior teeth to give a good smile without having to move molars and other aspect of what's going on. Those doctors see this progressive as a maybe I'll fix the anterior teeth for a lower price and then move to a full bite correction at some point in time the patient wants to go. But we see both orthodontists and GPs a certain segment of them really engaging in that sense. So we feel the comment there's enough doctors out there that want to hit this kind of a price point and we'll do it in a very efficient way. Someone look at it doing with maybe two or three touches with a patient rather than constant touches every few weeks and using remote monitoring and those kind of things to see how patients are going. So we actually feel that we can that there are doctors out there with a limited product that will engage in that sense and be able to go after these what we'd call price sensitive DTC patients who are looking for just really an aesthetic correction not a bite correction. Jeffrey Johnson : Yes. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. My China questions also have been addressed. I'm going to go non-China for a moment. Just the question on the total ASPs. For the portion of ASP that was down sequentially due to the promotional discounts that you alluded to just curious some more color around that whether that's related to maybe a higher volume is being achieved by individual practitioners? It sounds like what happened in mid 18 that nobody probably wants to relive if they can help in or perhaps related to maybe a greater mix a DSO business maybe more discounts for groups maybe less related individuals. Just more color around on the discount that you alluded to. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Yes, I think Steve as you look at it we run promotions on a regular basis to be able to drive volume, drive behavior. We see a mix effect of that as well where in Q3 there was more ortho cases and in Q4 more fortunately GP cases but as we said as I've said really throughout the 2019 we expected our ASPs to be relatively flat throughout the year notwithstanding FX and if we looked at where things were a year ago we're up $5 and if you look at the FX impact to that it was a negative $15. So you're going to have puts it takes as you go to the quarters but we saw relative consistency throughout the year on our ASPs. Steven Valiquette : Okay. All right thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ryskin : Yes, thanks. Same a lot of the China questions have been sort of flushed out. I want to follow up on Steve\u2019s questions just now is sort of how do you think about that moving forward the ASP component as we move through 2020? You highlighted some of the moving pieces you had in 2019 and historically and you've also got a shifting portfolio mix, shifting geographic mix especially with some China events going on? Just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about both discounts promotions, the advantage program and the mix shift evolving over the last couple years of [indiscernible] how do you envision ASPs trending down? Joseph Hogan : Yes, it's a good question Michael. I mean you think of it, just think of them separately for once and then we will go together. So if you look at separately if you look at the comprehensive product relatively consistent. There's not going to, from a promotion standpoint everything else you would expect consistency in those ASPs. Same way from a non-comprehensive product. But when you see the interaction between the two as non-comp grows faster you could see ASPs to be flat to be slightly down as a result of that mix and as we've said and as we saw in the fourth quarter where ASPs even if it's at a lower ASP it still comes with a higher gross margin and we saw that in the fourth quarter. We expect that going forward. So when we look to the future ASPs of course get the headlines but we're really focusing on driving that gross margin and operating margin. Michael Ryskin : Great and quick one if I may as well on the scanner segment on iTero. Strong end to the year but still sort of not nearly at the same pace you had earlier and I\u2019ve realized part of that is the stat comps but there's also been a lot of noise in the market with some other competitor entrance throughout 2019. Can talk about anything you're seeing at iTero if it's tied to so your DSOs where you sort of exhausted the pool of the installs that you had when you sign on board with them or if it's something from a competitive landscape you're seeing. Joseph Hogan : I still felt great about the growth iTero business for the year at the 38% and you're right I mean even you look at the capital equipment market in any medical business the fourth quarter is usually the biggest one at people are looking at the what they're going to do from a CapEx standpoint they buy. So it was a tough comparison year-over-year but still growing 20%. I think the best way to think about this Michael there's competition out there. We feel really good about our digital platform that iTero represents, how it competes against any scanner really out there and you see that it's doing well on restorative to as well as from an orthodontic standpoint. So we think we're really competitive but I think the back your question is like how do you model that thing going forward. I think you model that at our 20% to 30% growth rates that we have given you for our business in general and that's what we've done through the many years we've had iTero so far is keeping that range. Sometimes we've been outside that range on the upside or whatever but long-term your model I think of 20% to 30% and a significant amount of that being some services revenue to that really helps in that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Follow-up on iTero, I guess what's the early feedback on the 5D scanner and how should we think about the overall opportunity on that track? Thanks. Joseph Hogan : The doctor feedback, Erin it's Joe, on the 5D scanner has really been great .I mean the ones that really use it to scan every patient when they come in, they're picking up caries or cavities at a rate that are almost 2x of what they can actually visually see or see through an X-ray and that's driven a lot of new business through those docs and so a lot of this information comes in, I mean obviously outside the United States because the FDA hasn't approved that yet. So we see this near infrared technology that we're being used to see cracks in teeth and caries in teeth. It's really helping from a cash flow standpoint, from a doctor and the cases they're seeing and secondly it's helping patients in that sense be able to identify issues that you can get at a little more proactively before they really become an issue. As far as 5D in the United States I think we've said that I'm never going to guess when the FDA says yes. I've been in class 2 medical device business for too long but our expectation is in sometime in the first half that it will get 5D approval through the FDA. Joseph Hogan : Thanks Erin. Next question please. Operator : Next question comes from line of Chris Cooley with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Chris Cooley : Thanks for squeezing me in and also thank you for taking a shot at China. Now that's a really fluid situation for you guys this evening. Just from my perspective can we go back to 30,000 [feet] and just looking at the guidance for 20 in terms of growth ex-China you're talking about towards the lower bound of the LRP plan there to say 20% to 25%. Why wouldn't growth inflect higher after the deceleration and from \u201818 to \u201819 it was pretty meaningful. Could you maybe just help us parse that out whether it's the challenging part of comps? If it's a difference in the consumer mix, competition? Just want to try and understand why that wouldn't inflect back up with the strong volume growth that you're seeing globally here in 2018 and 2019 independent obviously of China. Thanks. John Morici : Yes, Chris this is John. It's a good question. I mean when we look at the investments that we're making, we invested to as you said that long term growth model where there's international expansion and we continue to expand and grow in two countries. We want to continue to grow our utilization whether it's on the ortho side or the GP side. We look at how we exited. We felt really good about fourth quarter. We feel good about coming into this year and what we want to make sure that as we invest and as we continue to grow we can give you information that we see and as we look at the year and as we look at our investments this is the best information that we can get. Of course as we invest we always look for additional opportunities whether it's growth in other markets, increase utilization and so on and those are things that will do. China gets a lot of the headlines now because of what's happening there but the rest of our business is a good growth opportunity for us and we're making investments within those areas. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Hogan : Hi Ravi. Operator : Ravi your line is live are you on mute. Ravi Misra : Hi. how are you? Sorry I was on mute. Two quick questions. Thanks for squeezing me in. just on the balance sheet both of them. Number one just inventory days have been creeping up throughout the year. Historically there's been a pretty good working capital business. Can you help me understand why that's the case and what's the kind of new normal expected there and secondly with almost 870 million on the balance sheet just in terms of capital allocation maybe help us think about any changes to the current kind of philosophy of share repurchases. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Hey Ravi, this is Joe. I will take the first one on iTero or the balance sheet with inventory. The majority of that increase is on the iTero side as we transition through products with Element 1 to Element 2 and then to 5D there's just some timing related to that but that as we start to sell more 5D and as we increase our volume on iTero that inventory will come down. On the Invisalign side it's pretty consistent to what our growth has been. John Morici : On the cash on a balance sheet obviously there is company's amazing cash generator in that way. I just want to emphasize Ravi we're not into the general dentistry business. So don't look us going out to broaden the portfolio in any particular way. We're building what we talked about when I closed about a digital platform and investing in that digital platform is where we're focused on. So we have our Investor Day in May we will re-approach in a sense of the share buyback and what we think we'll be doing with that cash in the future. Shirley Stacy : Thanks Ravi. Thanks everyone. That concludes our conference call today. We appreciate you taking the time. As a reminder we did send out information today the date for our Investor Day in May 12 in New York City. If you have any questions please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. I hope that you and your families are well. Given the significant disruption to our business caused by the extraordinary measures taken by governments, public and private institutions, and businesses around the world to fight the spread of COVID-19, most of the performance metrics I would normally discuss are less meaningful. Therefore, on our call today, in addition to the highlights from our Q1 results, I'll discuss the trends that we're seeing through early March prior to the escalation in the COVID-19 cases that resulted in shutdowns across Europe and North America, and compounded the initial impact from similar shutdowns in China beginning in January. I'll also talk about our view of recovery and strategy to help our doctor-customers navigate this challenging environment and ensure our business continuity. John will provide more detail on our financial performance and comment on the current trends across our business globally, including the momentum we're beginning to see in China. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. With that, let me start with a few comments on our first quarter results through early March. At that time, China was progressing in line with our original guidance for Q1, which include approximately 20,000 to 25,000 fewer cases and $30 million to $35 million less revenues for Invisalign and iTero products, and other regions were performing ahead of our Q1 outlook. However, the situation quickly changed in mid-March as most governments in EMEA and North America closed down non-essential businesses initiated stay-at-home orders. As a result, the vast majority of Invisalign practices shut down and stopped seeing patients, and our business fell off sharply. We believe the incremental impact of COVID-19 on our Q1 results was approximately 50,000 fewer cases and approximately $85 million less revenues for Invisalign and iTero products.  At the same time, while EMEA, North America and other parts of APAC fell off in mid-March, we began to see improvements in China as the country started to open up again. While it's still early in the recovery process and the situation is different in every city and for every practice, we're working closely with our doctors to support their current needs and ensure they have a game plan to resume operations in a very different environment for the foreseeable future. More on that in a few minutes. Now let's go through our first quarter results. For Q1, total revenues were $551 million, down 15.2% sequentially and unchanged year-over-year, reflecting significantly lower-than-expected sales of Invisalign clear aligners and iTero scanners due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues from clear aligners were $481.6 million, and iTero scanners and services were $69.4 million. Clear aligner shipments were 359.4 thousand cases. Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, shipment volumes were up 2.9% year-over-year, reflecting solid growth from non-comprehensive products driven by Invisalign Go systems across all regions, as well as Invisalign Moderate. This was offset by a lower mix of comprehensive products primarily due to the shortfall in China. For the quarter, we shipped Invisalign cases to approximately 61,000 doctors, of which 4,100 were first time customers. We also trained over 4,600 new doctors in Q1, including 2,600 international doctors. Overall for the teen market in Q1, 104,000 teens and preteens started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, representing 29% of total cases shipped, reflecting growth from EMEA and the Americas regions and across comprehensive products. During the quarter, we reached another major milestone with our 2 millionth Invisalign teenage patient, treatment of orthos. A student and athlete, we started treatment recently with Dr. Tom Hartzog, a U.S. based orthodontist in Kentucky. Dr. Hartzog has been a terrific practicing orthodontic for about 30 years and credits Invisalign with revitalizing his practice at a time when a lot of doctors think about slowing down. He says his approach is to lead with Invisalign, and he's got a new digital mindset now, and we're excited he's going to share more about that at our upcoming Invisalign Team Forum Virtual Edition, this July. The teen segment represents the largest portion of existing orthodontic case starts each year. And as we head into the summer season, the busiest time in orthos practice, we are working to help doctors capture as much of the teen season as possible under the circumstances. Now let's turn to specifics around our first quarter results, starting with the Americas region. For the Americas region, through early March, solid sequential growth was driven primarily by North American GP dentists and DSOs, along with continued strength in Latin American doctors. On a reported basis, Q1 Invisalign case volume was down 5.5% sequentially and up 5.2% year-over-year, reflecting significantly less-than-expected Invisalign case shipments in March due to the impact of COVID-19. Year-over-year growth for Q1 reflects growth from both orthodontists and GP dentist channels, which were up 5.6% and 4.6%, respectively. Latin America volume was up 83% year-over-year led by strong growth from Brazil. For our international business, through early March, with the exception of China, the EMEA and APAC regions were performing well. On a reported basis, Q1 Invisalign case volume was down 22.3%, sequentially, reflecting significant decrease in APAC, primarily China, due to the impact from COVID-19, partially offset by growth in EMEA. On a year-over-year basis, international shipments are flat, reflecting growth from EMEA, offset by a decline in APAC. For EMEA, Q1 volumes were down sequentially and up 11.1% on a year-over-year basis driven by growth in Spain, the U.K. and Germany, along with our expansion markets led by Central Eastern Europe and Benelux, including the teen segment. For APAC, Q1 was down sequentially as expected, reflecting a significant reduction in volume in China due to COVID-19. On a year-over-year basis, APAC was down 18.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting a longer duration of COVID-19 measures implemented in China, and was the only region down year-over-year. Japan, Taiwan, Korea and India saw continued year-over-year growth in Q1. And as noted earlier, we began to see signs of improvement in China in early March as the government began to relax some, or all of the restrictions and business began the road to recovery. Our consumer marketing is focused on building the clear aligner category and driving demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. In Q1, we saw strong digital engagement globally, including 7.1 million unique visitors to our websites and 274,000 leads, both metrics growing by more than 40%. Consumer engagement growth for Invisalign was enabled by the launch of our new consumer campaign, Invis, strong media spend and a robust omni-channel presence. Our Invisalign concierge team is nurturing consumer leads and virtually until doctor's office is open, which is key to realizing and converting consumer interest into cases. Further, our modeling indicates that consumer marketing drove incremental growth in Q1 and reinforces our strategy to invest in brand building and maintain high visibility with consumers through the COVID-19 crisis. Other key metrics showing increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q1 quarterly slides. For iTero scanner and services business, Q1 revenues were down sequentially as expected, following a seasonally strong Q4 and consistent with trends in the capital equipment market. Q1 also reflects the impact of COVID-19 across all regions in especially North America, Australia, China, Japan and other APAC countries. On a year-over-year basis, iTero scanner revenues were down 13.1%, due to lower sales in North America and APAC region primarily due to COVID-19 despite increased revenues in EMEA and Latin America, reflecting the addition of Zimmer Biomet distribution agreement, the introduction of our iTero 5D going direct to Mexico and additional LATAM distributor markets. The total year-over-year decrease in scanner revenue was slightly offset by increased services revenue from a larger iTero installed base. Cumulatively, over 23 million orthodontic scans, 5.2 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. For Q1, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 80.5% from 76.1% in Q1 last year. International scans increased 68.7%, up from 59.3% in the same quarter last year. We're pleased to see that within the Americas, 93.6% of cases submitted by North American orthodontists were submitted digitally. I'm also pleased to share that we received FDA 510(k) clearance for iTero Element 5D Imaging System. The iTero Element 5D Imaging System seamlessly combines three scanning technologies, 3D data, intraoral color photos and NIRI images. NIRI is near-infrared imaging technology, which allows you to see carries in different aspects from a dentition standpoint. It's an integrated scan, and we're excited to bring the advancement in inter oral scan technology to the United States market to help doctors provide better oral care for their patients. At this time, we're mindful of the current environment and the impact that COVID-19 pandemic is having across the world and are focused on customer education and training regarding this new technology while so many dental practices in the U.S. are operating on a limited schedule. We remain confident that the iTero business will continue to help drive our overall long-term growth and help increase adoption of the digital platform with Invisalign treatment. To that end, during the quarter, we announced the acquisition of exocad, a global CAD/CAM software leader, and completed the transaction on April 1st. John will talk more about the acquisition in a moment, but let me say just that the rise in consumer awareness around dentistry extends beyond the benefits of straight teeth and orthodontics. There are significant opportunities for all kinds of treatments, from simple cosmetic fixes to ortho-restorative that can help us accelerate growth of our digital solutions for ortho-restorative cases and really drive growth and adoption of the Invisalign iTero digital platform. I'm very excited about the addition of exocad's proven restorative experience, expertise, and functionality to our platform, and I want to welcome exocad Founders, Till Steinbrecher and Maik Gerth and the entire exocad team to Align. Let me now turn to some of the initiatives we've taken to support our doctors and their patients. We recognize the enormous hardship that COVID-19 has caused Invisalign practices around the world. We're working in every region to support doctors and find ways to minimize disruptions to their businesses and to strengthen the experiences their patients have with Invisalign treatment. We have learned a lot from our doctor partners and teams in the Asia-Pacific region, and we've been navigating the impact of COVID-19 for months. We're applying their experiences and insights across all regions. Many of our customers are sharing creative ideas and suggestions as we all work to manage the situation together. One of the first things we did was address clinical education, an integral part of doctor engagement. Across all three of our regions, we moved most of our education programs to online digital platforms, continuing to provide hundreds of valuable Invisalign and iTero training and education resources, many peer-to-peer for doctors and their teams in a virtual setting. We also identified opportunities to collaborate with Invisalign practices to manage ongoing cases and explore new ways for doctors to conduct consultations. Early on, many doctors began using video calls, text, and patients submitted photos through a variety of platforms to help monitor patient progress, reduce in-office appointments, and ensure continuity of patient care during treatment. It quickly became clear that doctors needed a better way to connect and monitor patients. So, we accelerated the launch of new tools that were still in pilot mode. The Invisalign virtual appointment tool enables doctors to easily set up HIPAA-compliant video appointments to monitor existing patients and to have an initial conversation with patients interested in learning more about Invisalign clear aligner treatment for the doctor. The Invisalign virtual care program can also use video appointments and enables doctors to monitor treatment progress and stay connected with patients through a virtual platform. Patients use the intuitive My Invisalign app to stay engaged in the treatment and convey progress photos to their doctor who review these photos on their Invisalign doctor's site, communicates any needed instruction, and ensures treatment is on track. These tools are available through our Invisalign Doctor Site, IDS, in the My Invisalign app and work as part of the end-to-end digital platform for Invisalign treatment. While both tools are still in early stages of rollout, our goal is to provide doctors with a way to maintain care until patients are again able to visit the doctor's office.  Feedback to-date has been relatively positive, and we believe that doctors will continue using these tools to improve patient experience and increase efficiencies well after COVID-19 restrictions have been listed. We're also supporting doctors through financial and operating challenges and are providing additional resources, including industry experts to help navigate this ongoing crisis. This includes webcast, e-blast and micro sites on IDS again, the Invisalign Doctor Site, with advice on extending aligner wear and holding patients at specific treatment stages; options for redirecting aligner shipments and helping address customer cash flow concerns caused by the pandemic. We're creating programs with partners like LendingPoint that are part of recovery playbooks to help doctors with speed to cash that is expected to launch in May -- on May 1. Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the strength and resiliency of Align and our business model and our view of the path to recovery. There's no question that we are in uncharted territory. And while supporting our doctors in their current situation is still critical right now, planning for recovery is just as important. Overcoming challenges is not new to Align and our employees. Our response to COVID-19, decisions and investments we are making, now to anticipate customer needs and adapt in a dynamic environment are based in part on the lessons learned throughout our history and will further our competitive advantage and position us to capitalize on the market as it returns. We serve a huge under-penetrated market, and our share of more than 300 million people who want a better smile is less than 3%. Teens are an important segment, and our share is a small fraction of the market. And yet, we know that teens remain the heart and soul of orthodontic practices and will drive their recovery. There's no single blueprint for us to follow in this recovery. Our underlying business is healthy. We have an excellent balance sheet with no debt. And over the last 5 years, we've grown a business that has generated 25% compounded revenue growth and consistently delivered 72% gross margins, 22% operating margins and generated cash flow from operations in excess of 22% of revenues each year. We also have operational resiliency in terms of global manufacturing that has taken us years to develop and is simply unmatched, and is a key reason why we're able to continue operations in the crisis and expect to ramp up quickly in recovery. The core components being supply chain, digital treatment planning, treat aligner fabrication, AFAB, supply chain. During normal business, we carry enough buffer stock in our warehouse to handle 2 disruptions to the supply chain. So if a batch go sideways, we can handle that twice. After COVID-19 broke in China, we anticipated that we needed to mobilize existing suppliers and add 3 to 6 months of additional inventory so that we could weather the potential storm. For many of our suppliers, we have alternative redundant suppliers in case of shutdown in one geography impacts a supplier. Treat, the investments we have made over the years in having Treat in multiple locations, allows us some flexibility in business continuity to respond to customer needs. Before COVID-19, we had evaluated potential for doing treatment planning from home or remote locations and the implications to hardware needs, data security and productivity. When COVID-19 hit China, we ramped up our ability to do that and started transitioning our CAD designers to do treatment planning at home and have been successful in that sense. We are confident we could have maintained 80% of our normal output, but volumes fell off before we could prove that point. China hit first, so we load balanced with our other Treat locations. So as this went from east to west, we didn't have significant issues in our treatment operations. This is our model, and we'll continue to strengthen it going forward. Aligner fabrication, we have aligner fabrication operations in Huang, China and Juarez, Mexico and plans for a third facility in Europe that we're looking to accelerate into 2021. Our facilities have excess capacity built in. And while we never have 100% redundancy, we do have the ability to shift production volumes based on that excess capacity. Worst case scenario, if one of these facilities goes down, then customers wait a little longer for their aligners, but production will continue, and we believe we can recover swiftly. In short, when we have an issue in one part of the world, we have designed our operations to enable us to load balance across facilities. We've had to do this, because of our growth and huge growth spurts that made it necessary to remain flexible. Additionally, the steps we've implemented during COVID crisis like work-from-home for CAD designers gives us even more flexibility, and we'll leverage that going forward as we evaluate facilities requirements and potential cost savings. Beyond our business strength and operational resiliency, we are at the forefront of digital dentistry. And this pandemic has exposed the weakness of analog approaches and strengthens and benefits the digital technology in every aspect of our life. There's been a lot of concern over the years about digital driving us apart and keeping people from interacting. People focused on their screens in social media rather than with each other, interacting with businesses online rather than in person, et cetera. I think what we're seeing through this terrible situation is that digital actually unites us. It keeps us connected, gives us flexibility and options. Without digital technology during this crisis, how would kids go to school? How would any of us be productive working from home? How would universities and public health experts, model the curve without data mining and AI? I am proud and thankful of our digital platform is able to Invisalign patients moving forward in treatment, while physical practices are closed, that it can connect doctors and patients to monitor issues and track treatment, that because of digital, we can get a replacement aligner for some new retainers to a kid sheltering in place. And together with doctors, we're going to leverage that power of digital for dentistry and orthodontics more than ever. Doctors are not going back to before. We all know that digital dentistry is the future, and that is a part of why Align is weathering this pandemic and why I believe we are well positioned for success going into recovery. With that, I'll now turn it over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenue for the first quarter was $551 million, down 15.2% from the prior quarter and up 0.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For clear aligners, Q1 revenues of $481.6 million, was down 11.4% sequentially across all regions driven by Asia Pacific. Year-over-year clear aligner revenues growth of 2.6% reflects growth from EMEA and the Americas, offset by APAC. Clear aligner revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately $6 million or approximately 1 point year-over-year from foreign exchange. Q1 Invisalign ASPs were up sequentially by approximately $15 to $1,255, primarily due to lower net deferrals due to a decrease in primary case shipments across all regions. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign ASPs increased approximately $10, primarily reflecting price increases in all regions and increased additional aligner revenues, partially offset by promotional discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. Total Q1 Invisalign shipments of 359,400 cases were down 13.1% sequentially and up 2.9% year-over-year. Our scanner and services revenue for the first quarter was $69.4 million, down 34.7% sequentially due to volume decreases in all regions. Year-over-year revenues were down 13.1%, primarily due to volume decreases in North America, partially offset by increases in EMEA and LatAm, and increases in service revenue off an increased installed base. Moving on to gross margin, first quarter overall gross margin was 71.6%, down one point sequentially and down 1.6 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense, overall gross margin was 71.8% for the first quarter, down one point sequentially and down 1.6 points year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 73%, down 1.1 points sequentially and down 1.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower volumes and higher cost per case, partially offset by an increase in Invisalign ASPs. Scanner gross margin for the first quarter was 61.8%, down 3.1 points sequentially and 1.8 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing variances, lower ASPs and partially offset by higher service revenue. Q1 operating expenses were $324.4 million, up sequentially 1.1% and up 3.2% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses reflects higher legal and outside services. Year-over-year, the increase reflects our continued investment in sales and R&D activities, including increased compensation from additional headcount and consumer marketing spend, partially offset by the $29.8 million charge related to the Invisalign store closure costs recorded in Q1 of 2019. Our first quarter operating income was $69.9 million, down 53.7% sequentially and down 20.3% year-over-year. Our first quarter operating margin was 12.7%, down 10.6 points sequentially and down 3.3 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating income and operating margin are primarily attributed to lower volume, revenue, and gross margin as a result of the COVID-19 impact. Operating margin was impacted by approximately 0.8 points year-over-year from foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in operating margin and operating margin primarily reflects lower gross profit and higher operating expenses related to go-to-market activities, partially offset by the $29.8 million charge related to the Invisalign store closure in Q1 2019. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and impairment, and other costs related to Invisalign store closures in the prior year, operating margin for the first quarter was 17. 1%, down 9.3 points sequentially and down 8.1 points year-over-year. Interest and other income expense net for the first quarter was an expense of $16.9 million, including a $9.2 million hedge loss related to the anticipated exocad acquisition. Excluding the hedge loss, interest and other income expense net was $7.4 million expense on a non-GAAP basis. With regards to the first quarter tax provision, our tax rate was negative 2,745%, which includes a onetime tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the intra entity sale of certain intellectual property rights, resulting from our corporate structure reorganization completed during the quarter. This deferred tax benefit will be amortized starting in 2020 and continue into subsequent quarters and years. The period over which the tax benefit will be recognized depends on the profitability of our Swiss headquarters and is still under assessment and review with the Swiss tax authorities. Excluding the tax benefit related to our corporate structure reorganization and the related tax effects on stock-based compensation and other non-GAAP adjustments, the first quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 33.2% compared to 29 -- 20.9% in prior quarter and 22.8% in the same quarter a year ago. The non-GAAP tax rate was higher-than-forecasted due to lower-than-expected profits in regions outside the U.S. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $19.21, up $17.68 sequentially and up $18.32 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis diluted earnings per share was $0.73 for the first quarter, down $1.03 sequentially and down $0.52 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet, as of March 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $790.7 million, a decrease of approximately $77.9 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to the annual bonus payout and the purchase of an additional San Jose, California facility combined with slower AR collections. Of our $790.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $119.2 million was held in the U.S. and $671.5 million was held by our international entities. Q1 accounts receivable balance was $533 million, down approximately 3.1% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, DSOs, was 87 days, up 11 days sequentially and up 9 days as compared to Q1 last year. We expect DSOs to increase in Q2 as a result of anticipated lower collections. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $9.8 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $46.1 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to negative $36.3 million. Under our May 2018 repurchase program, we still have $100 million available for repurchase of our common stock. On April 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of privately held exocad global whole needs, GMBH, a global leader in the dental CAD/CAM software market for a purchase price of approximately $430 million in cash. The acquisition of exocad broadens our digital platform reached by adding technology that addresses restorative needs in an end-to-end digital platform workflow to facilitate ortho restorative and comprehensive dentistry and also brings exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design of the Align Technology portfolio. We expected to complement and extend our Invisalign and iTero digital solutions paving the way for new seamless cross-disciplinary dentistry in the lab and at chairside. exocad also broadened our platform reach in the digital dentistry with close to 200 partners and more than 35,000 licenses installed worldwide. Now, let me turn to our outlook. As Joe described earlier, through early March, our business was performing well, and we believe we would exceed our Q1 guidance. However, things quickly changed in the latter part of March as the majority of Invisalign practices in our core markets in EMEA and the Americas regions closed their offices and stop seeing patients, which caused Invisalign case receipts to drop rapidly and continue into April. At this time, due to the fluid market condition caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not providing guidance for Q2, and we are withdrawing our prior commentary regarding our full year 2020. What I can offer is the following directional commentary. For China, which was the first major country impacted by COVID-19 and was shut down almost overnight at the end of January, as reflected in our Q1 guidance provided on the January earnings call. It has shown continued improvement beginning in early March. Our case receipts or orders in China are currently running at 80-plus percent of mid-January's level, but with fair amount of variability week-to-week in between various provinces and cities. Keep in mind that there is about a three to four week lag between case receipts and orders to case shipments. China provinces are not uniform in their recovery, but all continue to improve. Guangdong, Shanghai and Ziyang are now at or above pre-pandemic levels. Beijing and Hubei's slower recovery is consistent with later reopening and/or heavier restrictions. Early indications of patient flow is also positive, but it's too early to determine, if it is pent-up demand due to the lockdown. We also heard today that China is lifting travel restrictions within China, which should facilitate business. APAC, excluding China, is still very fluid as Japan shut down later than the rest of APAC and other countries like Taiwan and Korea are also improving, but our trailing China For the Americas, its unclear how volume will evolve due to staggered lockdown and subsequent staggered re-openings by state. We would expect the situation in the U.S. to be similar to what we've seen in China with recovery starting in the states in the middle of the country working its way out to the coast, on a city-by-city basis. In LATAM, it is still fluid as it is shut down later than the rest of the Americas. The EMEA market is beginning to open up, and Germany is making good strides. We are monitoring each market to see how each is responding to the various government isolation regulations and is still fluid and a lot of variability week-to-week. For iTero, as a result of COVID-19, we did see some deferral purchase decisions at the end of the quarter, and I would expect that to continue. We finished Q1 with $791 million in cash and cash equivalents. Since then, we have closed our purchase of exocad for $431 million on April 1st. Align's priorities during the pandemic are to take care of our employees, customers and shareholders. With these priorities in mind, we are taking actions to ensure the business is well positioned to weather the pandemic. In order to maintain our financial health, we are taking the following actions; holding our current headcount level steady to support the initiatives Joe discussed while making sure we are prepared for the market recovery; controlling discretionary spending such as travel and meeting-related expenses; slowing some of our capital expenditures; and working with many vendors who have allowed us to increase payment terms, while providing extended payment terms to many of our customers. As always, we are balancing future investments to drive growth in a vastly underpenetrated market versus making the appropriate cost reductions and cash actions that have less impact to the business. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks John and thanks again for joining us today. Before I close, I want to take a minute to talk about some of Align's actions to support relief efforts in the communities in which we live and work. One of the things that makes Align a great place to work is the concern our employees have for the world around us and their commitment to helping others. The passion is core to our purpose of transforming smiles and changing lives. And in this time of need, how we support our employees and customers and serve our communities is more important than ever. Early on in the outbreak, we donated RMB1 million to the Chinese Red Cross to support relief efforts and what were then some of the hardest hit areas. More recently, we committed $1 million to the Align Foundation, Align's donor advised fund through Fidelity Charitable. And our teams have been working together to source and supply additional personal protection equipment, or PPE, and medical supply donations for frontline health care workers in the communities we serve. Here's some slides to give you more details on this. Finally, thanks to the ingenuity and diligence of our manufacturing engineering team, we're able to leverage our 3D printing technology and manufacturing expertise to produce face shields and medical swabs for COVID-19 testing kits. Through our network of connections with hospitals across the globe, we are donating them to hospitals with the most critical needs. As our existing 3D printing equipment is highly customized for aligner fabrication and can't be reconfigured, we acquired some new separate 3D printers to specifically help with relief efforts. I'm extremely proud of what our employees are doing individually to make a difference in what Align is doing as a business overall. In summary, we're all operating in a tough environment. And even as we start to see signs of recovery in some geographies, we don't know when we'll get back to normal or even near-normal operations. As always, we're committed to the safety and well-being of our employees, doctor partners, their staff and patients. That remains our top priority in the weeks and months ahead. That and working with our stakeholders and communities to get through this together. With that said, I want to make it clear that we are not resting on our laurels waiting for the business in better days. Align Technology believes in playing offense and investing for our future. And that includes, first and foremost, protecting the jobs of our employees and keeping them ready to pivot for a fast recovery. That means no furloughs, no reduced salaries, staying focused on our long-term strategy. Employees remain our most strategic asset. Closing the exocad acquisition in early April to help expand our digital platform for the ortho restorative treatment. We are very excited about this opportunity. Adding resources to support international expansion. For example, approximately 100 new sales reps in China, improving virtual treatment options, and releasing new products and digital tools to meet our customers' needs like Invisalign virtual appointment and Invisalign virtual care to help doctors and patients connect while practices are closed and beyond. Key to expanding our digital platform in a post-COVID-19 environment, investing in marketing in media to reach of consumers while they're at home during the pandemic and keep our brand top of mind, something that other companies have stopped to conserve cash. Extending our working capital to help our customers manage their cash flow and expenses. We are very aware of the near-term volume challenges of consumer sheltering in place, closed ortho and dental offices and possible delays in new treatment as consumers go back to work and evaluate their priorities. But we're still focused on investing in a vastly under-penetrated market and believe that Align is uniquely positioned for recovery and continued growth coming out of the pandemic. COVID-19 will continue to have significant implications to the world and to our industry. Our digital platform has made it possible for thousands of doctors and patients to continue Invisalign treatments throughout this global disruption, thanks to the digital orthodontics and Invisalign aligners, digital treatment planning and virtual monitoring and care. I think coming out of this, more doctors than ever will have experience the benefit of digital treatment and digital tools for their practices and many we have seen firsthand the limitations and frustrations of the traditional analog approach to patient treatment like wires and brackets. With that said, I want to thank you again for joining the call. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. Now I'll turn the call over to our operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Rich : Good afternoon. Thanks for the question and hope you and Align team are all doing well. Appreciate all the color you gave on the call. I guess, Joe, maybe starting with China, serving potentially as a guide for how the U.S. and EMEA might recover. Was there anything that you would call out in terms of either the types of cases or the channels that started to come back first, I guess, in China? And as we think about, if China does serve as a guide for the U.S., does that sort of mean that we're looking at sort of like 3 to 4 months for kind of those case receipts to get back to that 80% level that you referenced in your remark. Joe Hogan : You know first of all you know China is China, right. China has a very rigid lockdown procedures they were into this first; I don\u2019t think you can really take up that from China in this vector work at United States from a Western geography in general. We also see as John indicated in his written script, is that this is coming up in China by city. And we see Beijing and Wuhan area and all Hubei Province being behind in that sense. So I think as you look at the United States, too, New York and California will come up differently than the middle part of the nation is what we're seeing right now, too. So you talked about some segmentation in the sense of how it's come back in China, too, remember, it's primarily a comprehensive product base that we have in China. And it's pretty much stay. I mean we're selling some moderate there and some different things. But it's primarily coming back as a comprehensive piece. So again, I don't think that's a vector that we'll use when you look at other areas, too. So I mean there's no question, Nathan, the other countries will come back. I'm just very reluctant to take a vector from China and really relate that to the Western economies in different countries because it's all being handled differently around the world. Nathan Rich : Okay. Joe, I appreciate that. I guess just a quick follow-up. I mean when you think about these practices kind of opening back up, and you made some comments about how you're supporting customers, are there any changes that you're thinking about from like a marketing or levers that you've kind of used in the past, maybe gearing those up as you think about helping volumes start to kind of get back to more normalized levels? Joe Hogan : And we honestly feel that, particularly in the orthodontic community, there'll be a much harder leaning toward a digital kind of environment because with the chance of re-infection rates with COVID-19 and concerns about future shutdowns or slowdowns, as we mentioned in our scripts, you just have a lot of variability and flexibility that you can use in a digital format that you can't use in an analog format. So we'll be going to our customers with programs that really help them through to figure out, how to convert more and more of their volume to a digital environment. Not that, we haven't done that before, but we'll be very specific about it. And as we move into teen season, teen season in second quarter, you'll see us really focused on teens because we know Orthos will be focused on teens, too. And that's a different demographic. It segments differently in a sense of our product lines like first and math. And we'll also be ready with PPE equipment and other things. They'll prepare doctors for the concerns that they're going to have of protecting their patients and also their employees, too. Did I miss anything, John, or anything you'd add? Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Nathan. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Joe Hogan : Hey, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : Joe and John, can you sort of just talk about the flexibility you have in your cost structure, how much of OpEx is discretionary or variable? It sounds like you're focused on kind of holding Align in terms of headcount and marketing. But how should we think about the leverage you have to kind of control costs during this period right now? John Morici : Hey, Brandon, this is John. Yes, as we said, there are levers that we could pull. Just as we accelerate growth, there's levers we pull. And when we look at our existing OpEx, as we look to spend some of our marketing dollars, where we spend it, how we spend it, there's levers around that spend. As with the travel restrictions and less conferences and so on there's a lot of other operating expenditures that can be pushed out and not spent currently. So we're focused in on and still investing for the future to be able to work with our doctors, as Joe has mentioned, on a lot of new technologies and making sure that we keep the employees and the focus that we have on our structure that we have, but we'll modulate as we needed -- as we need to going forward, if it's needed. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Thanks. And then a follow-up for Joe. As you think about sort of the leverage you have to drive demand, would you expect to be somewhat more aggressive in terms of ASPs? And are you planning to adjust your Advantage program levels or hurdles to give that as a bit of a break given they've had their offices closed? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Brandon, we've already extended up from an Advantage tier standpoint with our customers, when they went into that. So, I don't know, how much of an effect that will have on an ASP standpoint, because we basically be holding them to where they are. But overall, it's not price. It's our strategy here as we come up out of here. It's how do we support our customers in a digital environment. We're trying to explain how do we -- how do we really support them from a PPE standpoint and an export standpoint. We talked about loans, different things from a cash flow standpoint. We know many of them are going to be challenged in that way. And we have been offering some payables relief and deferral going forward. So it's a broad aspect of needs, we think, our customers will have. Advantage is one part of that, but it's what we can bring to these customers holistically to help their practice and help them grow. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jon Block : Great, thanks guys. Joe Hogan : Hey Joe. Jon Block : Joe, you mentioned protecting employees, no furloughs or salary cuts. I'm just curious about the competition. And has anything changed in the marketplace around the competitive landscape? We've heard some chatter about sort of, call it, cut back in the orthodontic divisions -- of some of the other players, but maybe you can elaborate on what you're hearing or seeing out there. Joe Hogan : Hey Jon, I won't be specific, but I mean, most of our competitors have had layoffs or cutbacks in some way. We've been just been blessed with a really strong balance sheet going in. This allows us to have the flexibility and do it as we do. We're a growth business. You know that Jon well. We're set up for 20% to 30% kind of growth, and we have to position ourselves for that. In that sense, making sure that our production capacity is ready, that our employee base is ready, too. Our sales teams are really critical in that sense, too and it's wonderful. We can see some of the investments like Invisalign Virtual Assistance and things that we're working with customers right now, that we can launch those products and continue to drive those products going forward with a full force engineering team also. So, from a competitive standpoint, I mean, we're seeing varying degrees of cutbacks and moves in that sense. But we're not focused on that, Jon, really. We're just focused on what we think we should do, what's important in our portfolio, and how we can help our doctors out. Jon Block : Okay. Helpful. The second one is a little bit long. But just some Swift. I know you kicked off a pilot recently. I think it's an important sort of initiative long-term to better get after the lower acuity market. I'm just curious, Joe, you kicked it off when there was a lot going on, so did you get enough of a signal during that time to share some takeaways from the Swift initiative? And then could we see you lean on that a little bit more in coming months? Because it is a little bit more price-sensitive for the consumer. It has a monthly. And in this environment of job uncertainty might really resonate. So curious your thoughts there. Thanks guys. Joe Hogan : Yes, Jon, when we launched Swift, timing couldn't be worse in that sense because COVID hit pretty far after that, but we got a pretty strong signal in that, that we think we understand at least part of the demand equation. We're going to look at rolling that out in a broader sense going forward in the United States and maybe in different parts of the world. But I think when you talked about the price point on ASP and different things, and obviously, we broach that with the doctors who are part of the Swift program. But Jon, you know this; I want to make sure our colleagues understand. This is -- our margins on this product line are accretive to our gross margin area and how we're going into it. So, it's really important in how we position that going forward. But again, those 300 million patients out there, we know there's some price sensitivity and then there's some clinical aspects from a simplicity standpoint that we're going out with that product line. And we think it will respond real well in a broader sense as we begin to roll that out. Jon Block : Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys. Joe Hogan : Thanks Jon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hi Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Hey there. Thanks for the time here. I also wanted to ask in a way about Swift, but with a very different angle. As we think about the operating environment prospectively for some amount of time, people are going to be concerned about safety. And so I wonder to what extent, and you definitely alluded to this in your prepared remarks, can you flex some of the technology that you have with Swift and some of the things you have in development to decrease the amount of face-to-face contact? Again, I know you alluded to this, but I wonder if you could take it a few steps further, give us more context, a little bit more insight into your plans. How do you think about making Invisalign treatment achievable with a minimum of in-person interaction for those who might be concerned about that even in an environment where PPE is more widely used? Joe Hogan : Steve, that's top of mind as we do things today, too. So actually, even before COVID, when we designed Swift, Swift was designed for basically 2 to 3-doctor direct contact and that's it. And that was part of making the equation for doctors a profitable equation, too. Then you roll in our remote monitoring capability we just rolled out, which gives doctors a tool to be able to do that, and we'll be able to enhance that tool going forward. There's limited amount of attachments in IPR on things like Swift, too. And it's not that our clinical protocols are going to, in some way, decrease in the sense of what the clinical capability are and what we can do. We're also cognizant in the sense of time and mouth. And we'll adjust that. We might tie those things differently to help doctors, too. But there's a lot of different things that we're contemplating. We talked about at the conference last year about direct printed attachments and those kinds of things that in the future and not-too-distant future, will allow a lot less contact and a lot of speed from a productivity standpoint with doctors and patients be able to do those things. So it's the right line of questioning, Steve. So remote monitoring, a digital platform that allows us to anticipate exactly when you'll be seeing a patient and what will need to be done in that sense, not duplicating treatments at the office that don't need to be done and keeping up with patients in a sense remotely and only calling them in when something goes away or a doctor has a concern in some way. So we feel our digital platform and things we have in the pipeline, Steve, we're really well positioned to address that. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Good. Good to hear. The second question I wanted to ask actually relates to the practice in the U.S. So it's been -- well, for some of us months, but for -- in practices, certainly many weeks. How do you think about the most likely, as you talk to the orthodontic and dental societies, the most likely path forward for practice reopening in the U.S.? And I know it's a complicated question because there will be a lot of regional variation in staging, but to what extent -- to any extent you can, can you give us your sense for how you guys are thinking about that and your planning specific to the U.S.? Joe Hogan : Yes, Steve, I think it's going to be -- it's certainly not going to be uniform in the sense of how we go about that, whether it's in the states or anywhere around the world, there are going to be certain government restrictions. I think there's going to be certain -- when I say restrictions, too, it's going to be equipment that's available from a PPE standpoint, what patients are going to be prepared to do? We see some -- if you look at treatment planning alternatives or when patients enter an office right now, they're not even coming into the office. At the time, they stay in their car until they're summoned in some way to make sure that there's less interaction and proper social distancing within the office itself. So I can't really tell you yet. The only thing is I think there's going to be a lot more caution about, obviously, transmission of the disease. That's going to include how you stage patients, how often you see these patients. And I think from a dental versus orthodontic standpoint, they are obviously going to be different protocols because of the different procedures that take place there. Steve, there's an interesting article in the New York Times yesterday that really did an X/Y kind of a graph on different types of professions that interface with customers and which ones are most time from an intimacy standpoint and could transmit a virus. And dentistry came up almost on the top of that whole thing. So I mean that's going to be watched closely, and I think we have to make sure we work with our customers -- I mean doctors and to help them through this, too. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks for all the -- for the perspective there. Joe Hogan : Yes. Thanks, Steve. Shirley Stacy : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Joe Hogan : Hi, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Anderson : Hope everyone is doing okay. I want to ask a question on the sort of digital access of what you guys can do in the near-term. I know you said that, you were sort of unveiling the app as sort of like a beta test, and you were rapidly rolling that forward and allowing more access and training and things to that. Can you speak to any more of the details in terms of sort of like the uptake or how the training is going or the case use of that for like ongoing patients? Shirley Stacy : Elizabeth, just to make clear, you're talking about Virtual -- appointment of Virtual Care, right? Elizabeth Anderson : Yes. Yes. Joe Hogan : Elizabeth, you're talking about just training of doctors online rather than face-to-face? Elizabeth Anderson : Oh, no. Sorry. I meant on the Virtual Care side. Joe Hogan : Okay. And so your question is on the workflow of that. Is that -- Elizabeth Anderson : Yes. As you said -- you said they were going slow and sort of like how have you seen uptake of that so far? Is it -- I assume that there's some sort of training that has happened beforehand or how have you been able to roll that out considering that -- data testing right before you this all happen. Joe Hogan : I get it, Elizabeth. Look, first of all, we've been -- we didn't just roll -- we just rolled this out. We've been working on it for over a year. And so we actually rush this to the market. And as we rush into the market, we were cautious in a sense of how many doctors we -- you had in the program. And we started here in the United States, and now we're gradually moving it to broader to more doctors in the U.S. and across the world, too. We had to train the doctors to do this, but the great thing it is on our IDS platform. And it has a great user interface that the team put together. So from the feedback that, I've gotten from the teams and the doctors, too, that user interface has been pretty simple in how they've been able to put that piece together. And remember, the whole idea there is just that how do you stay -- and these kind of lockdown periods or future workflows where patients don't want to come into the office all the time to see a doctor, how in the world can you track treatment and how can you communicate? And it's gone really well. And we will have actually more doctors who want it that we can give it to right now. We just want to make sure we don't burden them, and we just roll it out piece-by-piece to make sure that it's robust enough to handle more and more doctors over time. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay. Perfect. And so just on -- you did a virtual visit with some of that in the first quarter -- over next set of patients? Joe Hogan : Yes. More than 2,000 doctors, we have more than 2,000 doctors trained right now -- trained and beginning to use Virtual Care. And obviously, we have tens of thousands of doctors out there that we'll want to roll this out, too, and we think they'll have an interest in it. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. Thank you. Joe Hogan : And we've had over -- just I'm getting some other data here, too. We have over 3,500 appointments right now that have been done through Virtual Care. Elizabeth, if we think about this, too, it just makes sense, right? I mean in everybody's kind of -- in today's COVID environment, it obviously makes sense to try to eliminate patients trying to have this person-to-person contact. But I mean going forward, too, in a digital kind of environment, having these kind of tools just make sense from a productivity standpoint for both doctors and patients, too. So we'll continue to invest pretty heavily in this to get better and better at it. This is our initial launch, but you'll see more and more iterations to help to enhance this Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hi Jeff. Jeff Johnson : Thank you, guys. Hey Joe, how are you? Good afternoon. Just two questions, I guess. One, we've seen some news in the last couple of days from one of your DTC competitors on some patents they were able to get and some better business bureau recommendations on some advertising. I would love your view not so much on what that means for them, but does that have any implications for you either on the Swift product where some of that is kind of a monthly fee? I don't think any of that would trip any of the stuff in their new patent, but also if they have to rein in a little bit of their advertising. I would assume that's a good thing for you, but would just like to get your view. Joe Hogan : Jeff, overall, that's not a model that competes with us. We go directly to doctors in everything we do, work through a doctor base. And so from what we know of the -- I haven't looked at the patent or whatever. I just read most of the information that's out there. That has to do with Invisalign. And we have to do with just scanning a patient in a store and transferring a file that the -- never really reaches a doctor in any way except from a teledentistry standpoint. So, we don't see it being an issue for us at all. Jeff Johnson : Sorry, I was on mute. Thank you. And then just my follow-up question. Obviously, we're all going to be watching PPE. We're all going to be watching patients' willingness to go into these offices. What are you hearing from the doctor side? From an orthodontist standpoint, the office is maybe a little cleaner, less aerosolization, if that's even a word, of fluids and what have you. So, are your orthodontists, especially kind of chomping at the bit to get back? I'm sure they are financially. But do they feel safe? Do they feel like this will be an environment they can bring their staff back into it can bring patients into things like that? Thanks. Joe Hogan : From an orthodontist standpoint, Jeff, you're right to segment those two because, obviously, dentistry is a lot different than orthodontist and whatever. The orthodontists that we look to, I would say that they're not concerned, but they're cautious in the sense of what they have to do, the precautions they have to make with the patients and also with their employees internally. They are anxious to get back. But I mean there's a good degree of caution to make sure that they come back in the right way, in a thoughtful way, too. And again, I think this could vary by state also in the sense of how it's applied and what kind of regulations are put in place. But I know there's -- they're really interested to come back. And the ones that really went into this was a significant amount of Invisalign feel good that they've been able to stay in contact with their patients and be able to send passive aligners with different things that's helped in any kind of course correction or holding patients to where they are. So, on the dentistry side, I mean, that's obviously going to be different. But when you think about it, an Invisalign is one of the least invasive procedures that you're going to see in dentistry. And we'll certainly be emphasizing that and trying to work with doctors to help them through. And we talked about iGo and the growth of iGo, and that's a great -- when you think about you think when we talk about a digital platform, that's a terrific product for GPs in the sense of being able to leverage that and then send a more difficult cases of the orthodontist side. We'll be working with GPs to really help through that transition. Jeff Johnson : Understood. Thank you. Joe Hogan : All right, Jeff. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John Kreger : Hi thanks very much. Joe, could you remind us what's the lag time between order receipt from a customer -- from when -- to the point where you can actually ship the aligners? Joe Hogan : So we call it CCA, and CCA would be in order. And I'd say, John can correct me on this; I'd say it's four days to five days. John Morici : But from an order to an after shipment, it could be three to four weeks because it's the back and forth. He's describing kind of initial to the actual shipment. It could be three to four weeks depending on how much back and forth. As you know, John, getting that treatment plan just exactly the way the doctor has and wants it takes a number of iterations. And then the actual manufacture and shipment can do. So on the outset, it could be 4 weeks in total. John Kreger : Okay. Great. So from a fabrication standpoint, for a region like the U.S. that got locked down in mid-March that backlog probably would have -- would be reasonable to assume that kind of carried through to mid-April. John Morici : Well, there's still going to be back and forth that goes on. So I mean you have patients that have not been able to make it into the office to look at the final plan for doctors to meet other things that go on. So it's going to vary by this until the doctor actually approve the treatment plan and then it gets manufactured. So remember, our business is a made-to-order business. I mean there's no inventory. And as things change in the environment, when there -- people can't come to the office to seek treatment or to make sure that they're going to prove that treatment plan, things shut down right away. And it takes some time to see that ramp back up. John Kreger : Great. That's helpful. And then anything you can give us in terms of contribution from exocad since that'll be in there for the full second quarter? John Morici : Yes. Nothing on that John that we're giving on any forward guidance other than what we've had in our prepared remarks. Shirley Stacy : Thanks John, next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Caliendo : Thank you. First question, you're talking about a digital and analog world. But if I think about Align a year from now, and hopefully, we're through this, competitively, not just with other manufacturers, but against wires and brackets. I mean, is there a marketing pitch here that the orthodontist can go and say, hey, instead of using wires and brackets or you can even pitch to the orthodontist, that there might be a greater demand to use clear aligners versus wires and brackets simply because you're able to keep patients out of the -- keep them out of the orthodontist office or the dentist office more frequently? Is that something that you've contemplated that could necessarily be a positive for market share for you? Joe Hogan : Kevin, prior to the COVID-19, we have a program called ADAPT where doctors -- orthodontists come to us and say, look, you want to go primarily 80%, 90% Invisalign. How do we do that, right? And so how do you do that, you're going to crank up your volume in a significant way. And to do that, you just needed to drive more productivity. And so we were pushing that piece is you don't have to see patients as often, right? You might have patients come back every 3 or 4 weeks to adjust wires and brackets. Likely, they're going to come back doing their episode with a wire that comes out, and it's an emergency procedure, about 20% of an orthos time that doesn't have wires and brackets or emergency cases. We talk to doctors about how you can really control your schedule much better in a digital environment and how patients don't have to come back so often. We talk about 7 weeks, 8 weeks seeing patients. Now that becomes even more magnified when you think about profitability of infection and concern about COVID-19. It's not just a productivity play. It's a way of being able to treat patients in a way that's safer for your staff and safer for those patients, too. So we'll certainly be emphasizing that. And -- but it goes -- it just goes along with a digital platform. It is -- it's much more productive. And doctors will need less time per patient. And I mean, we know that well from the millions of patients that we've done. Kevin Caliendo : One quick follow-up. The DSO spiked. I know you made some comments earlier about offering payment terms and loans and the like. Does that explain the bump-up the nine day you said expect DSOs to continue to move higher? So what was the impact of, I guess, would be improved payment terms for the doctors on your DSOs? John Morici : Yes. It varies by doctors and so on. But as they have working capital concerns, we're in a fortunate position to be able to help out. So we work with them to kind of manage their cash flow in terms of paying us. And then the DSO impact is obviously impacted by lower revenue as well, which causes that to increase. So -- but we're working closely with our customers, and making sure that they can help weather the storm, stay close with them. And as they start to ramp up, we want to be their partners with them, and cash is an important part of that. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks. Stay safe everybody. John Morici : Thanks, Kevin, you too. Shirley Stacy : Operator, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Jaime Morgan : Hi, guys. This is Jaime on for Rich, this afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a housekeeping one. You guys had said in the beginning of your prepared remarks, incremental impact from COVID-19 was about 50 fewer cases and, I think, $85 million less revenue. So I just wanted to make sure that, that is something -- like the way that we should be thinking about that is incremental to what you had originally contemplated in your 1Q guidance of, I think, about 20,000 to 25,000 case impact in a $30 million to $35 million revenue impact? John Morici : That's correct, Jaime. You would think of that as incremental to how we guided. Jaime Morgan : Got it. So the fair way to think about that in total would be about $115 million to $120 million of impact to revenue from the coronavirus in the first quarter? John Morici : That's correct. Jaime Morgan : Got it. Okay. And just last one for me. Any sort of update on where you guys stand with launching the Palate Expander product? Joe Hogan : Hi, Jaime. I'll take that. We're still -- we have the design. We're still working that piece. We have to find an effective way to manufacture it. So I don't have a date that I can give you, but I can tell you that it's high on our priority list. Jaime Morgan : Thank you. Joe Hogan : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Stacy Shirley for any closing remarks. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you at upcoming virtual financial conferences in the future. If you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations, and hope you have a great day. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

With that, I'd like to the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. I am pleased to report Q2 results and continued progress across all regions and customer channels that reflect our COVID-19 recovery efforts, and those of our customers. Practices across every region have reopened and are seeing patients and many of those practices are embracing digital treatment in new ways and more purposely than ever before. In particular Invisalign providers are using the virtual tools we expedited over the last few months to minimize in office appointments and deliver doctor-directed personalized treatment that meets the needs of the moment, trusted, safe, convenient, and reflecting the digital option. The initiatives we have prioritized globally over the last few months, including support for doctors to ensure treatment and business continuity a shift to online education, and training, ramping availability of virtual tools to keep doctors and patients connected throughout the treatment, and continued investment in consumer marketing, and concierge program, and personal protective equipment or PPE are helping doctors navigate this evolving environment and come back stronger as their practices have reopened. We have received consistently positive reactions and feedbacks from doctors in support of our efforts over the last few months. While it's too early to know for sure how extensive and sustainable the digital transition will be. Interest in digital solutions is building even among doctors who were not early adopters or advocates prior to the pandemic. The positive feedback and momentum is not just around Invisalign treatment. It includes digital workflow around iTero scanners and general dentistry. Doctors are telling us that iTero is central to their practice and to their practice workflows and its key to driving digital treatment. With that let me turn to results. For Q2, total revenues were $352 million down, 36% sequentially and down 41% year-over-year reflecting significantly lower sales in Invisalign clear aligners and iTero scanners due to a full quarter\u2019s effects of COVID-19 pandemic on practice closures. Revenues from clear aligners were $298 million and Imaging System and CAD/CAM services were $54 million. On a year-over-year basis while clear aligner shipments were 222,000 cases down 41% year-over-year, we are pleased with the continued progresses we seen from our recovery efforts throughout the quarter. For the quarter, we shipped Invisalign cases to approximately 48,000 doctors, of which 3,000 were first time customers, reflecting lower doctor activity due to practice closures primarily in Americas GP channel. We also trained approximately 3500 new doctors in Q2 including 2350 international doctors. While our inability to hold in person courses due to COVID-19 result in fewer trained doctors in the second quarter, we continue with a significantly larger number of Invisalign doctors through online virtual education courses, summits, and forums. For the teen market in Q2 71,000 teens and preteens started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, representing 32% of total cases shipped, reflecting growth from APAC across comprehensive products. By the end of the quarter we started to see recovery in the Ortho channel with increases in Invisalign comprehensive treatments in the teens and preteens segment across most regions with positive growth predominantly in the APAC in the teen segment. Invisalign first continues to accelerate among young patients as well and reflects greater resiliency as parents continue to prioritize orthodontic treatment for their kids. Overall, both non comprehensive and comprehensive shipments were down, but with increased adoption of our moderate product among the Ortho channel. Last week, we held our Teen Forum-Virtual Edition, taking what was a popular teen-intensive program for orthodontists launched last year and recreating it as a virtual experience. 6:29 In order to facilitate broader attendance among our customer doctors, we scheduled two teen virtual events. The first took place on July 17th and the second will be held this Friday. The program is designed to help doctors understand the highly visual online and on-demand world of today\u2019s teens and provides the know how tools and confidence to differentiate and grow their Invisalign teen practices. Approximately 800 customers have registered for this full day session that combines live and on demand sessions, clinical practice investor presentations, panel discussions, and invaluable insights from experts with successful teen practices. Now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results starting with the Americas. For the Americas region Q2 Invisalign case volume was down 53% sequentially and down 52% year-over-year reflecting significantly fewer Invisalign case shipments due to the impact of COVID-19. For Q2 reported utilization was down for NA Orthos and GP both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, however utilization increased in June especially among certain orthodontists doing more Invisalign treatments with teen shipments recovering faster in North America, in late May, and through June. As part of our recovery programs we enabled doctors to switch their patients into Invisalign treatment by buying their wires and brackets. This program was well received and as a result doctors converted approximately 2500 wires and brackets cases to Invisalign clear aligner patients. In the GP segment the timing of officer openings and case prioritization are slow to recovery in this key segment as compared to the orthodontic segment, but the GP segment is catching up. In terms of timing of the recovery in the Americas, the US continues to lead followed by Canada and LatAm corresponding to the timing of the pandemic related shutdown and reopenings in each region. For international business Q2 Invisalign case volumes were down 17.2% sequentially reflecting a significant decrease in EMEA again due to the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by growth from APAC which was ahead in the recovery curve in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea. On a year-over-year basis international shipments were down 27.1% reflecting a decline in EMEA partially offset by slight growth in APAC. For EMEA Q2 volumes were down sequentially 44% and down 46% on a year-over-year basis across all markets with more softness in the GP channel compared to. ortho We continue to see momentum within Invisalign first for Invisalign treatment in young patients. Overall we saw slower deceleration in teen shipment growth than adults driven by Germany and France. The expansion market had less decline and only accounted for five points decline in EMEA. We also rolled out a recovery 360 program in EMEA with over 3700 Orthodonists enrolled resulting in a stronger partnership perception by our customers including an increase in our Net Promoter Score or NPS. Using a combination of our adapt consultants which I'll be describing more later and territory managers, we held practices with the workflow and scheduling, increased our doctors engagement with their patients through the use of education, and communication tools, and provided business by ability, access sustainability materials to the doctors. In May over 1400 attendees from three regions, 75 countries participated in our virtual Invisalign scientific forum in EMEA. At the end of June we held a virtual GP growth Summit with over 1300 doctors from over 42 countries who signed up to gain insights on business, dentistry, health, and chain management. During the summit we launched our GP recovery program and we received great feedback on the tools and approach we provide to support business recovery. During the quarter we also offered over 150 online and on-demand education events which reached over 20,000 GPs cumulatively. In July we launched the Invisalign Gold Plus system in UK, in Nordic, and Benelux which offers a wider treatment options, enables dentist to treat more patients with confidence, and can be easily integrated into a wide range of restorative treatments in their practice. For APAC Q2 volumes were up sequentially 41% reflecting improving trends as practices reopened and got back the business, as well as COVID-19 recovery measures we implemented in China. On a year-over-year basis APAC was up 3.4% compared to the prior year and was the only region up year-on-year. As mentioned earlier we saw positive growth in APAC in teen shipments led by China reflecting a strong uptick recovery programs. In the GP segment we saw growth in the non comprehensive cases with Invisalign Gold and the launch of [indiscernible] in China continuing to further demonstrate doctor confidence in treating young patients with Invisalign. Throughout the region Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea successfully managed recovery efforts and performed better than expected. During the quarter, we reached a major milestone with our 1 million Invisalign patient in APAC, an athlete in modern day and fencing who is being treated by Dr. Yogart in Tokyo, Japan. Earlier this month we held the Invisalign Teen forum in China in a virtual from broadcast of four venues in Beijing, Shunde, Wuhan to approximately 8000 participants. The forum focused on the innovations and applications of digital technology in clear aligners as well as theories in clinical practices for teen patients. The forum brought together outstanding orthodontists from leading dental colleges from approximately 30 academic institutions. We believe that our global clinical education programs are the best in the industry and we\u2019ve been even more valuable to doctors throughout the pandemic. We launched a new improved digital learning environment for our doctors this year offering a comprehensive learning platform with role specific content for orthos, GPs, and their teams. They improved functionality enables more online learning opportunities with Spotlight features for what's trending now recommending learning paths based on doctors experiences in extended categories including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry, and team education. To date over 85,000 doctors have access to recorded lectures and completed self pace learning models and watched how to videos and over 3 million sessions. Among the ortho channel over 30,000 unique users have engaged with the digital learning side with an additional 50,000 unique users from the GP channel. We are encouraged by the digital training utilization rates among our doctors which has helped them continue their Invisalign treatment learning journey during the pandemic. Feedback from the participants describes the courses as engaging, providing broader reach to online events, and a strong desire that Align continue to provide these virtually. They also acknowledged Align\u2019s agility, and providing relevant tools and content to help them during the lockdown. We see this as an ongoing opportunity to enhance doctor learning to direct feedback and continuous improvement. Building on the benefit of clinical education and training today we announced a global launch of the Align digital and practice transformation or ADAPT service. This is our first customized consulting services in support offering for doctors and was developed based on years of learnings from practices that saw strong growth, and practice transformation when changing their practice to digital. Initially available to Invisalign and iTero doctors in select segments of the EMEA market and then in the US, the global program is now generally available in EMEA and APAC regions that will be available in the US in the second half of this year. The ADAPT program is an expert in independent fee based business consulting services offered by Align to optimize clinics, operational workflow, and processes to enhance patient experience, and customer, and staff satisfaction which will turn translate into higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices That goal of ADAPT program is to support digital practice transformation for doctors and their staff. ADAPT is designed for orthodontists as approximately 200 total cases start per year who are seeking to build their future business. Driven by a team of independent business consultants, analysts, and program support specialists, ADAPT offers a customized on-site consulting service to each participating practice. The program combines a review of business operations and practice workflow data with Align's expertise and digital workflow optimization, practice support, business transformation, marketing, and clinical education support. The pilot version of the program has been successfully developed across EMEA, the United States, Asia Pacific region over the last 12 months. As a result of the ADAPT service participating practices improved profitability of 15% within six months of implementation and increased practice revenue up to 20%. Our consumer marketing is focused on building the clear liner category and driving demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. In Q2 we saw strong digital engagement globally with more than 70% increase in unique visitors as well on leads. Other key metrics showed increased activity engagement with Invisalign brand and are included in our Q2 quarterly presentation slides available on our website. We're pleased with our strong engagement and activity we have seen on our customer platforms over the last few months. I do believe it speaks to the strength of the brand, a consumer interest in treatment even doing a challenges the last few months. In Q3 we're coming into what is typically the strongest part of the teen season with teens and younger kids are home from the summer break and likely to start treatment before heading back to school. And while back-to-school looks very different this year in many countries including United States, this is still a time and practice is orthodontic practices are focusing on younger patients. Teens are the biggest, the most critical part of orthodontic practices and our huge influences and drivers of practice growth. That matters now more than ever as we partner with practices in this recovery. One of the most important ways we partner with customers is by creating demand for Invisalign treatment and to drive teens and parents to the practices for great outcomes and great treatment experiences. We have just launched a new Teen and month-focused consumer campaign designed to do this just that by reaching teens and moms where they are most engaged on digital platform, social channels and later this year national cable TV channels where they sped the most time like Instagram, Twitch for Teens, Instagram, Facebook and people.com for moms. We're going to leverage influences that teens and kids follow interest like Charlie D\u2019Melio. We recently established a new partnership with Charlie, who is a really dynamic kid and accomplished dancer who has a combined following of over 90 million fans on TikTok and Instagram, she's about to become a new Invisalign patient and ambassador for our brand. She'll be sharing her treatment journey in a way that is relevant to teens across social platforms. And our new campaign will get the heart of what, it get to the heart of what Invisalign is and what it isn\u2019t, using straightforward language that teens respond to. Our goal is to tell teens why parents and Invisalign is more of advanced and or more comfortable than traditional braces emphasizing that this is not your parent\u2019s braces. We also want to ensure that they know that doctors are front and center in the Invisalign treatment because it's time to be very candid about the benefits of digital orthodontics and Invisalign treatment specifically. For our assistance and services business which now includes exocad Q2 revenues were down 22% sequentially. We are pleased to see the momentum with Element 5D Imaging Systems in North America and APAC along with sales of iTero element one scanner modeling China and significant sales of the flex scanners modeling EMEA. On a year-over-year basis, system and services revenues were down 48% were slightly offset by the inclusion of exocad CAD/CAM services. Cumulative the over 24 million orthodontic scans are 5.5 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. For Q2 total Invisalign cases in mid of the digital scanner in the Americas increased to 86% from 77% in Q2 last year. International scans increased to 72%, up from 61% in the same quarter last year. We're pleased to see that within the Americas 96% of cases submitted by North American orthodontists were submitted digitally. We also recently announced that the iTero Element 5D Imaging System was awarded best new technology solution for dentistry in the 2020 Medtech awards. The annual program honors outstanding health and medical technology products and companies. We also received an award for dentistry IQ naming the iTero, Element 5D Imaging System as number 10 of 14 products and services to help dentist rebound from COVID-19. With that I turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks John, now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenue for the second quarter was $352.3 million, down 36.1% from the prior quarter and down 41.3% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For clear aligners, Q2 revenues of $298.3 million was down 38.1% sequentially and down 39.9% year-over-year due to volume decreases across most regions. Driven by North America and EMEA and LATAM partially offset by APAC. Clear aligner revenue growth was impacted unfavorably from foreign exchange of approximately $6 million or approximately one point year-over-year. Q2 Invisalign ASPs were flat sequentially at $1,255 primarily due to promotional discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange mostly offset by increased revenue from countries with higher list prices and increased other case and revenue revenues. On a year over year basis Q2 Invisalign ASPs increased approximately $25 primarily reflecting price increases in all regions and additional line of revenue, partially offset by promotional discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. One example of our crisis recovery program that we have implemented in Q2 was a switch program that enable doctors to switch wires and bracket patients into Invisalign clear aligners. Total Q2 Invisalign shipments of 221.9 thousand cases were down 38.3% sequentially and down 41.2% year-over-year. Our system and services revenues for the second quarter was $54 million down 22.2% sequentially and down 48.1% year-over-year due to volume decreases across most regions except APAC. Promotional discounts and a decrease in service revenue partially offset by exocad revenue. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 63.7% down 7.9% sequentially and down 8.3 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to exocad, overall gross margin was 64.4% for the second quarter down 7.4 points sequentially and down 7.8 points year-over-year. Q2 gross margin reflects Align\u2019s decision to maintain our head count and salaries across our operations in anticipation of a volume pick up as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. This decision also enabled us to manufacture nasal tests swabs for hospitals and PPE for use by our own employees as well as our doctors as they reopen their practices. We also postponed iTero subscription fees for one month in the US and parts of APAC. On a year-over-year basis Q2 gross margin includes approximately 0.7% impact from unfavorable foreign-exchange. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 64.5%, down 8.5 points sequentially and down 9.2 points year-over-year due to lower volumes driving higher cost per case and increased freight costs from higher international shipment mix. On a year over year basis, the decreased in the clear aligner gross margin was partially offset by an increase in Invisalign ASPs and continued in efficiency improvements. Systems and services gross margin for the second quarter was 59.2%, down 2.6 points sequentially and 4.4 points year-over-year due to lower ASPs and lower volumes with higher cost per unit and amortization of intangible assets related to the exocad acquisition partially offset by lower service support part. Q2 operating expenses were $297.3 million, down sequentially 8.4% and up 60.2% year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating expenses reflects lower travel spend, decreased compensation related to commissions and lower marketing and media spend, partially offset by higher exocad acquisition cost. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $41.5 million, this is mainly caused by the $51 million favorable litigation settlement received in Q2, 2019 offset by cost controls measures in Q2 of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $265.6 million down sequentially 11.9% and down 7% year-over-year due to the reasons as described above, offset by exocad cost. Our second quarter operating loss was $73 million, down 204.4% sequentially and down 141.4% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating margin was negative 20.7% down 33.4 points sequentially and down 50.1 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating income and operating margin are primarily attributed to lower revenues and gross margin as a result of lower volume from COVID-19 impacts. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.9 points year-over-year from foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis the decrease in operating income and operating margin primarily reflects lower gross profit on lower volumes from the impact of COVID-19 in addition to the prior-year quarter included the $51 million favorable litigation settlement. On a non-GAAP basis which excludes stock -based compensation, acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles related to exocad, operating margin for the second quarter was minus 11%, down 28.1 point sequentially and down 35.6 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the quarter was an expense of $0.5 million including a $1 million hedge loss related to the exocad acquisition excluding the hedge loss interest in other income and expense net was 0.5 million income on a non-GAAP basis. With regards to the second quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 44. 8% which includes a tax benefit related to the impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of forecasted income to GAAP profits recorded last quarter. The second quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 27.8% compared to 33.2% in prior quarter and 25.3% in the same quarter a year ago. The second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the first quarter\u2019s rate primarily due to changes in jurisdictional mix of forecasted full year results. Second quarter net loss per diluted share was negative $0.52 down $19.73 sequentially and down $2.35 compared to prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss per diluted share was negative $0.35 for the second quarter down $1.08 sequentially and down $1.84 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30th, 2020 cash and cash equivalents were $404.4 million, a decrease of approximately $386.3 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to the acquisition of exocad partially offset by a free cash flow improvement. Of our $404.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, $160.2 million was held in the US and $244.2 million was held by our international entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $473.3 million down approximately 11.2% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding, DSO\u2019s was 121 days, up 34 days sequentially and up 44 days as compared to Q2 last year due to doctor office closures that resulted in slower accounts receivable collections. We expect DSOs to remain relatively high has doctor\u2019s offices return resume normal business activity. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $59.9 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $34.4 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $25.5 million. Under our May 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million still available for repurchase of our common stock. Now let me turn to our outlook. Since the last time that we talked, the orthodontic and dental market had continued to evolve in response to government regulations and safety guidance from local, regional and national health officials. We believe that all of our markets have bottomed out and are recovering, albeit at different rates and different times corresponding with regional outbreaks and recoveries from COVID-19 preventative measures as we're now seeing improvements in consumer and doctor activity. Nevertheless, we're mindful that the demand environment remains uncertain. There may be additional waves of infection and governments around the world may strategically choose to shut down cities, states and countries again forcing people to shelter in place and practices to close again therefore we're not providing any forward-looking guidance. While our management team understands the markets remain fluid, we continue to focus on taking care of our employees, customers and shareholders for our employees we are committed to protecting our employees, and do not intend to implement furloughs or salary reduction. For our customers we will continue to be supportive of our customers who are impacted by COVID 19 and are committed to helping slow the spread of virus by providing PPE to doctors. We continue to release products, tools, and promotions to help our doctors recover from the crisis. For our shareholders, we will continue to invest in our strategic initiatives to grow in a vastly underpenetrated market and position our company to capture growth as the market returns to normal. This includes continued investment in Align\u2019s end to end digital workflow as well as increased investment in the Invisalign brand and consumer demand creation as you heard Joe described earlier. We will continue to add resources in markets that give us a good return. I\u2019m very proud of what Align is accomplished while maintaining our financial discipline during this pandemic. We finished Q2 with $404.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, closed the purchase of exocad for $430 million and still delivered free cash flow of $25.5 million despite having the lowest volume Align has had in a very long time. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model, the strength of our balance sheet, and our strong operational focus. I\u2019m also pleased to share that we have established a new line of credit of $300 million with a consortium of banks led by Citibank. This new land replaces our line of credit with Wells Fargo. As a market leader in clear aligners and digital dentistry we are well positioned to continue investing strategically for the future. With that I'll turn it back to Joe for final comments Joe. Joe Hogan : Thanks John. In summary we're pleased with our progress last quarter and by the customer responses to the actions we\u2019ve been taking to support their practices and patients. We have developed a careful recovery approach that accounts for the safety of our employees, our customers, and their teams, and their patients, and are committed to helping doctors navigate this evolving environment, and be successful. One of the biggest lessons we have learned over the last few months is about the critical importance of digital technology. Align has always been a proponent of digital treatment to think about all these things that digital platforms and virtual tools have enabled during the crisis. The people in the businesses, and the customers who stayed connected, the way we\u2019re able to adapt to working from home, the rise of tele consults, the AI that modeled the virus patterns, and informed health experts, and so much more. Consider also the companies that have thrived, most of the companies that are digital with their core, Amazon, Apples, Zoom and Netflix just to name a few. The advantage of digital are much more magnified to practitioners and consumers. This became even clear in our industry when practices were shut down for months. Over and over we heard I\u2018ve been able to help my Invisalign patients progress in progress, but I had to just try to keep my patients in a holding pattern with wires and brackets. Treating orthodontic cases has amplified the clear benefits of digital technology in clear aligners. This is a method self serving. This pandemic has emphasized the benefits of digital technology across many facets of our lives and businesses. Our acquisition of exocad adds additional digital workflows that play in the GP space and lab space. We're all excited about the exocad team and what our investment brings to this new world of the digital dentistry. Align\u2019s digital platform has made it possible for thousands of doctors and patients to continue Invisalign treatments throughout the global disruption. Thanks to the digital orthodontics of Invisalign aligners, iTero digital, records, and simulations, digital treatment planning, and virtual monitoring, and care. At Align we have always believed that digital orthodontics is the best option for teens and adults. As you can see from a peak at our current teen campaign, we\u2019re going to feature this going forward. What\u2019s clear to us is that the momentum we\u2019re seeing in the business and in the dental and ortho practices reflects more than just one thing or one new products or tool or one program or action. It reflects continued improvement and continued execution of our core strategy across our business in every region. We\u2019re going to continue to stay the course while remaining vigilant and agile. We feel good about the progress that we have made and as we continue along the recovery phase of COVID 19 crisis in many regions we are focused on what we can control and impact. We are in a unique position to continue investing to a huge underpenetrated market, to extend our lead, and accelerated growth. With that I want to thank you again for joining our call. I look forward to updating on our progress as the year unfolds. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Rich : Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Joe you highlighted the improvement that you saw in June. I understand sort of the rational for now providing guidance for 3Q kind of given kind of the situation, but can you maybe help us better understand kind of where the business kind of you and so just we have better sense of what the jumping out point is as we think about the back half of the year? Joe Hogan : Yeah I mean we saw dramatic improvement between April and June. Obviously we were kind of in the jaws of COVID 19 with all the shutdowns in April. May was little better and then we\u2019ve seen strong momentum as we\u2019ve moved into June. So I think you can look at that as a significant improvement in our business overall. Nathan Rich : Okay great and then you highlighted the 3000 customers that were new to Invisalign this quarter. Can you maybe just talk about how that compares to maybe what you see in a typical quarter and kind of what you\u2019re doing was going to ensure that those doctors become kind of longer term customers of Invisalign? Joe Hogan : Yeah I mean that\u2019s. I mean when you think about COVID 19 and what the business has really faced in that. 3000 customers thus for us was terrific in that way. You don't actually look for new customers coming in on that. You\u2019re looking for utilization rates on your current base. I mean we felt and I felt really great about the 3000. Obviously that got stronger as the quarter went on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi. Can you talk about. Do you think Asia is a good path to think about in terms of the recovery or do you see sort of significant differences in that geography that should prevent this from extrapolating? Joe Hogan : Yeah I think Asia is so diverse in itself. It\u2019s hard just to extrapolate Asia Elizabeth. .I mean obviously China was kind of first out of this thing, but China has had bumpy road also with the recent issues in Shanghai and different areas, so every one of these regions has its own unique footprint in its own unique model in a sense of how they\u2019ve dealt with the virus, but obviously it in our transcript, but we\u2019ve seen significant improvement in really every region around the world. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay and I think you commented also in terms of your cost structure, in terms of not furloughing in place. Is there any other major changes to the cost structure in the third quarter maybe just in the back of the year generally that we should think about as we\u2019re updating our models? John Morici : Hi Elizabeth this is John. We continue to believe in our model. It\u2019s a vastly underpenetrated market. We're going to make strategic investments to better grow in that market. Whether it\u2019s R&D, sales, and marketing we\u2019re going to continue to make those investments where we see a return. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Beuchaw : Hi good afternoon. Thanks for the time here. I wonder first Joe, could you give us any more color on the breadth of uptake of some of the new digital tools that you referred to and the extent to which practices are making these changes and converting over to something of a virtual experience. I mean is this. Is this 2% of your customer base? Is it a lot bigger than that? Any color is really very helpful there? Joe Hogan : Steve when we talk about digital platform, you really start with iTero on the front end and even in a downturn like we saw with COVID in the capital equipment business. iTero showed up well and particularly with 5D in different areas, but that\u2019s the front end of this whole piece that we talk about on digital platform, then you move through our obviously our treatment planning, and all, but what we added had when you think about the whole breadth of a global digital platform we added virtual care, that knew about and we came out so that. Doctors could talk to our patients remotely and be able to track treatment and actually we had several doctors actually close treatments cases remotely with our virtual treatment capability. And that really extended the effectiveness of the doctor's, and the effectiveness of the digital treatment in that sense too. There is a lot of imaging that we do now in our treatment planning and all too, so it\u2019s not just tracking patients, it's also having images and different things that you can share with the patient is a sense of where they should be around treatment in those types of areas. So it's a broad kind of a digital platform we're talking about. I mean we had tens of thousands of people on our virtual care platform as we rolled that thing out in a matter of 30 days and all around the world. And we\u2019ll continue to update that platform with AI. We\u2019ll make it much more predictive so that doctors don't have to look at every patient. We have a strong roadmap in that sense too Steve so it\u2019s just, it\u2019s the breadth of the digital platform, and how it covers everything from starting with the consumer, turning them into a patient from iTero all the way to the back end up being able to monitor, and treat those patients. Steve Beuchaw : Just one more from me. What I'm trying to get to here is some perspective on what the underlying trend is and I appreciate that you don't want to talk about the exit rate leaving 2Q and you're not going to give guidance for 3Q, but what if I said let's imagine a scenario where we don't have another wave of lockdowns where practices are operating, and what is admittedly a challenging environment, but we don't have any sort of government level, or professional society level. You\u2019ve got to stop doing cases or stop engaging in practices. If that's the operating environment we\u2019re in I mean can you grow in 3Q or the back half of the year? Can you speak at all to what the business would look like in that situation if we don't get more lockdowns? Thank you. Joe Hogan : Steve I\u2019d say we're incredibly optimistic in this scenario that you painted where we don't see another COVID shutdown on a major market that lasts a long period of time. Based on the recoveries that we\u2019ve seen in the latter half of May and then the strong recovery in June, we feel really good about the future of this business in the third and fourth quarter and beyond. John anything to add? John Morici : That covers it. Steve Beuchaw : Okay thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jon Block : Hey guys. Good afternoon hey. Joe I hope you can hear me okay. A similar line of questioning, just sort of emendated with e mails about sorts of trends so let me try to frame it this way. I think with slide 8 you guys have increase in North America utilization for June. I think first part of the question is I just want to be clear. That was for both orthos and GPs up the slide. It was hard to tease that out and if that\u2019s the case Joe was that pure. In other words I\u2019m getting questions on practices reopened in May and obviously there is a lot of backlog, so you\u2019re saying North America grew in June, but was it pure or? Was it a benefit of backlog and maybe you could comment if that growth continued into July would be very helpful for North America? John Morici : Hey John this is John. Some of that is, some of its backlog, and some of it is additional growth that they would have, so the utilization has improved as those doctors have come back to work and they\u2019re seeing patients, and that\u2019s true in North America and that\u2019s true in all countries where we see those doctors\u2019 offices opening up, so it's hard to tell how much is backlog versus how much is more run rate going forward, but we\u2019re a combination of both. Jon Block : And the second part of the questions is Joe I\u2019ve got you. That increase or the year over year growth in North America does that continue to the month of July? Joe Hogan : That momentum continued to be strong John. Jon Block : Okay fantastic and the second part of the question, go from very near term next month to sort of 18 months out, 24 months out. John just as we think about the model longer term I think there Street has you guys from a 2021 perspective. Revenue is higher in 2021 to 2019. Let put away 2020 for a whole host of reasons, but let's look at 2010 versus 2019. Structurally if revs are higher by ex %, should the margin structure also be higher. I look back to 2019, you had someone timers and legal et cetera. You reset the base, but if that were the case I'm just trying to figure out do you think the margin profile would also follow when we look at the earnings power? Thanks guys. Joe Hogan : Yeah, thanks John. So as we look at investing our believing in our long-term model, a long term growth model and that has up margin at the 25+% so that's how we look to keep investing. As you get some benefit through the expansion and other things you might get some leverage as you go but we believe in that long-term model and that's how we look forward on our investments. Jon Block : Okay. Thanks guys a follow up, I appreciate it. Joe Hogan : Thanks Jon. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Misra : Hi thanks for taking the question, I hope everyone is well. So it is just first I wanted to ask you gave us some sort of inclination about what the COVID impact was in Q1, anything that you can provide color-wise on that for Q2? Joe Hogan : Yeah I think Ravi was [indiscernible] you know obviously April was tough as you came out of March into April, you know we saw some stabilization in May and then good progress in June overall so it just a complete kind of beginning and end of the quarter overall and like we just mentioned by John is that\u2019s what continued into July also. Ravi Misra : Okay I guess and I guess it's going to be hard to get a dollar figure out of you guys. How about just on a ADAPT I'm curious about the business model here when you're talking about kind of increase in utilization, can you help us think about how you plan on monetizing that is there some sort of profit-sharing or revenue-sharing that comes to the increased caseload and when does that kind of start to kind of flow through the P&L should we expect this as a 2021 event or when is this a small program that shouldn't really ever material impact to revenue. Thanks. John Morici : Ravi this is John, so you talk about that ADAPT program that we spoke about? Ravi Misra : Yeah. Joe Hogan : Look, we believe the digital transformation and this is the way we see that in testing that we have done to be able to help practices be more efficient moving from analog to digital, we believe in the platform and believe in that process and these are initiatives that will take to help the fact. It will be a service for a fee and those doctors, those practices will see the benefit we have seen it time after time on those practices that they have seen improvement in their efficiency and profitability and we want to be at a provide that service. Ravi Misra : What kind of a upfront payment? Joe Hogan : Well I think you know the way we have built that will be probably different by region but it is not an easy transition for practitioners to go from analog to digital and we have known that\u2019s been one of the fictional point for customers wanting to obviously go digital from a dentistry standpoint, orthodontic standpoint so we have learned a lot and we're using those learnings for customers to reach out and really want to make a commitment for digital transformation and we know we can help, we filed last year in every region and we rolled it out full force now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Steven Valiquette : You guys mentioned the, that braces buyback program which had some success with 2500 patients which is I guess I was curious whether that program as something started turn into substantially larger numbers in the remainder of 2020 or that can maybe a smaller part of the overall picture, also did you do that just in North America or you planning to do that in most regions thanks? Joe Hogan : We have been doing that program in different countries in Asia for a while so I mean how to implement it. We thought of the good time in North America obviously because some doctors being trapped with the large and brackets patients and their inability to be able to help them so, we'll continue that, we\u2019ll continue through this quarter if we, whether we continue or not, it was really based on what consumer needs are and what doctors need are but will make that decision when time comes, we just trying to help in the moment and in the sense of doctors being able to control the practices and I help the patients. Steven Valiquette : Okay, finally my pre-teen daughter was wondering if you can say hi to Charlie D\u2019Melio for when you get a chance. Joe Hogan : Got it, got it surely better than what I will be important for us okay. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Matt O'Brien: Good afternoon, thanks for taking that question. Just for a starters, just as we think about the recovery here in Q2, I look at the adult number on a worldwide basis as it was down 45, teen was down 32 per my math, but obviously in the US or North America that number was much lower so with the higher unemployment rates with more people kind of staying at home, how does the adult market in the US recovered during the back half of the year? Joe Hogan : You know I think it's honestly hard to call them and obviously which are playing out our teams here, and this is a seasonal time for teens and we know we'll get a strong signal here in the third quarter. But we're a lot optimistic about adults, I think there is a lot of just talking to different people in marketplace and you noticed to this seems to be a lot of people with time on their hand, wanting to do elective procedures that they didn't have time to do before, we\u2019re picking this stuff all around the country. So unlike 2008 where a lot of things folded up because people are worried about their personal wealth, people are sheltering in place, socially distancing and especially our demographic that we work through right now, seem to have more time on their hands to be able to pursue these kinds of things so we're also be optimistic on the adult segment going forward third and fourth quarter also. Matt O'Brien: Okay. Thanks and then a follow-up question. Joe just to your point about all this enthusiasm that you are seeing going forward in holding SG&A higher, gross margins and taking a hit right now because you are keeping folks in place, you got all this optimism. The doctoring number was down a little bit but obviously that\u2019s COVID related, so can you just illuminate a little bit more where all this enthusiasm and optimism comes from as we start thinking beyond this year, we are touch points on the dockside in terms of virtual in person way higher, I guess what everybody's trying to get their hands on because of COVID, do you think this could accelerate the adoption of clear aligners versus traditional practices and wires given all the benefits of less office visits et cetera? Joe Hogan : Matthew you asked the million-dollar question right or the billion dollar question all right. We think, obviously our story has always been, we\u2019re way underpenetrating this marketplace based on what consumers want, based on what our technology can do from a clinical standpoint. The consumer experience that's going on, I think we all think that COVID is really shine the light on this of much less invasive treatment, much easier in this sense location standpoint, much better workflow for doctors to keep track of their patient. So, we think if anything this is a time if this could happen, we're not telling you that this is a tipping point in entire thing but we certainly see this isn't hurting our story and it certainly being supported out there not just in United States but broadly around the world. Matt O'Brien: Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hey John. John Kreger : I just following up on Matt's question just if you could give us your sense of how you view the attitude of the consumer right now, they have the sort of forced deferral as practices shut down but now the practices are reopen, what is your sense about the willingness of the consumers sort of step up and make this purchase, does it fell like business is normal or still very much in a wait-and-see mode? Joe Hogan : Well it feels like you know to it a teen season, we talked about this before John, we call this elective procedures but Teens have a certain clinical window that they fit into and it's always a timeframe with parents and we're very optimistic that that kind of Team focus and growth will continue in the third quarter, in China too, in United States and different places. But also this is a different, John this is different than 2008 from what we feel is consumers seem to have more optimism in the sense of economy you see it in the stock market right now we're see it there and they have more time on their hands with many people not working from offices. And so we're optimistic again that there is money out there and there is a willingness of patient to pursue this electric treatments and I think you also have to look at the static market from a surgical standpoint and see what\u2019s going on there too. It seems it support that kind of an idea also. So it\u2019s, this is different than what we have seen in past recessions for sure, I am not a registered economist, neither is John, we're good at visualizing in this business and that's where we can only just a reiterate to you the signals we are seeing in the marketplace. But right now as this comes back, we know that all dental offices are not completely up to speed but that is not necessary based on demand, that\u2019s based on the way that they have to actually face this patients through their practices and make sure that they keep their staff safe and they keep patients safe too. John Kreger : Great. Thank you and then one last one, you mentioned being still very much committed innovation, can you give us an update there, how is an mandibular advancement being adopted and any update on palate expansion? Joe Hogan : Yeah it\u2019s hard to take a second quarter on MA and give you a trend because it was a pretty hard hit overall, obviously bringing shock on my numbers. You know I would say overall mandibular advancement continues to go well, we pair with our team first product, Invisalign first product line which is doing extremely well also and so yeah what you really find around the world, John as you find some doctors just glued to amend that advancement, they would love it, they use it every day, other ones are trying it out, that they have had it on some patients and watching through it. On the first product line, they got to combine that together and so we see significant increase in what I call a clinical penetration because we can do those kinds of cases that we could really have done, you know every two years ago at all. So I would say, the way to look at that is our Teen first product, Invisalign first being the most uptake and a fastest uptake with mandibular advancement right behind it. John Kreger : Great and any update on palate expansion? Joe Hogan : We have all the protocols we know how to do it, we're trying to find manufacturing capabilities that can scale with what we have been in middle out there, that sounds trivial but in a business like this where you have credible amount of volume you have to put through, we still have some work to do in that skillet more. John Kreger : Great thank you. Joe Hogan : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hi Jeff. Jeff Johnson : So what the qualifying questions here if I could, when I saw that like John Black's question on the North American number, it depends on how you read the sentences in your slide deck, was North America up year-over-year in June and then if I take your April, May, June comments and May a little bit better than June a significant better. It seems like June on the kind of global revenue basis had to be down only 10% to 20% or so I don't know if you\u2019ve talked to that at all but when I look at street down 20% in 3Q, it seems like you sitting pretty comfortable with the street kind of the $486 million revenue number where that right now, so just any help you can give us again we want to make sure we get kind of that 3Q at least ballpark accurate? Joe Hogan : Yeah just a top year over year, not just total not from a June standpoint. Not just quarter-over-quarter but June year-over-year, so this is a pretty strong signal. Jeff Johnson : Is that year-over-year in June? Joe Hogan : Yes. Jeff Johnson : Okay, and the [indiscernible] down 20% in the third quarter from a global revenue perspective, it sounds like your June kind of globally was probably down less than that 20% if I cannot see April, May, June comments. So just kind of your comfort at that $486 million number where the 3Q I know that you're not guiding but I would assume you don\u2019t have too many concerns on that number? John Morici : We'll give you an A for trying. That\u2019s a good one Jeff. Joe Hogan : That\u2019s was good one John. No, we are not guiding but trying to give you as much information on people doing surveys and other work as well you can up trying a little around it but just I want to give out for the things we talked about, don't want to give on future guidance. Jeff you're not being Q here, it\u2019s hard to read signal, two noise right now and that's okay. Jeff Johnson : Totally understood, last question. Just on the virtual tools as some doctors come back we are talking to on the therapy and hey I have had patients that I haven't seen in three months are so progressing wow, there may be going to go to a Q3 month instead of every two months follow-up schedule with their clear aligner patients in that. I mean it seems like to me we're getting here if I\u2019m down on even some of these really messed up teen cases o three hours, four hours for tools may be take that lower time, just talk of the efficiency and throughput advantage of that\u2019s going to have braces even that's going to be the real driver even more sale than others digital and what have you it's just the efficiency improvements are getting so good here in clear aligners. Joe Hogan : Yeah, I would say when we say all that digital, it\u2019s just that what allows them to drive the efficiency you're talking about, just so when you have this kind of digital tools, allow you to monitor patients to communicate with patients one on one or you know any kind of AI they can tell patient if they're off-track or on track and we know that interaction also encourages patients with the most important variable Invisalign treatment is compliance, making sure that they have their aligners intact and if doctors are watching and we are keeping up, in that sense it helps also. And so what doctors find out overtime is that they can -- they will have to see these patients like every three weeks, like they do with wires and brackets, they don\u2019t have to -- the obviously the PPE and everything else associated with their staff and all working through these patients. And, if the patient doesn't have to come in from a clear aligner standpoint, you either give them all their aligners upfront or you give them more aligners that allow them to continue to treatment, without having an actual doctor\u2019s visit. So, it\u2019s just tools, they are kind of tools that we use now and from a business standpoint that we have, but it is applied from a clinical standpoint to keep track of patients and to allow doctors to be more productive for sure. Jeff Johnson : Understood, thanks. Joe Hogan : Yeah, thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Richard Newitter : Hi thanks for taking the question. I was just curious, the Switch program that you guys launched this quarter, has it been more effective in teens or adults and then I have a follow-up. John Morici : Yeah, Rich, this is John. It is a program as Joe said that we had in Japan and other places as well, it is something that our doctors and many of their patients who were stuck in treatment and teeth were moving wanted to make a switch to this. It is not necessarily a teen versus adult, it's just patients who want to progress with treatment and did not want the uncertainty of the current environment that they are in or future environment and went to their doctors and their doctors wanted to be able to switch them over and we made it so that they could do so. Joe Hogan : I think Richard, what you are hearing from both of us is, in this case we're not quite sure exactly how many teens and adults were on Switch program, it is a good question, but you got to guess statistically the orthodontic market in the United States is 80% teens and 20% adults. So you can guess the majority of Switches were probably teens, but that is \u2013 let me get that data back to you. Richard Newitter : And the bigger question there that I'm trying to get at with some of the things that you're talking about in a post COVID world and all of the benefits that now kind of pile on to aligners versus wires and brackets. I was trying to ask the question through the Switch program to see if it would -- to test [indiscernible] but it would seem that teen doing the conversion with adult - the conversation with adults and being able to get teens and the parents over the finish line, you have an added level of sell now. Is that what you're actually seeing in the marketplace and is it fair to say that maybe COVID has - has resulted in the much anticipated inflection point for teens, is that fair. Joe Hogan : Well it's fair that it helped. I cannot tell you that the inflection point is here, but we certainly see a lot of uptake and interest and a digital workflow and our digital methodology in light of COVID-19, our experience has been when doctors can really convert most of their practice and that's why ADAPT, once you get over 50%, 60% digital, your practices change significantly and the consumers like it better, doctors tend to like it better, what we talked about you have higher margin and also a dramatic increase like 20% increase from a revenue standpoint. So, yeah, this is certainly - a COVID is certainly been a push for this. We are cautious, we don't want to talk about a crisis that\u2019s just terrible for people, actually enhancing our business, but the fact is it does promote a workflow and a capability that's much more convenient at this point in time given the COVID threat. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ryskin : Hi there, thanks for taking the question guys. I have a couple of quick ones. In your prepared remarks Joe and John, you obviously talked about third quarter, how that's typically the strongest part of the teen season, typically you see the nice little bolus, in the summer as everyone kind of stays home. I'm just curious with the strength that you saw in 2Q, do you think there could have been any sort of pull forward in teens in the quarter, just looking at for the last couple of months everyone\u2019s been home anyway. So any expectations of maybe a little bit of a lull in 3Q or should we expect further pickup from current levels. Joe Hogan : I think Michael when you ask a question like that and you need to think of our business and how broad it is and global it is today. There's a lot of mitigating factors, right, so we cannot tell you if there is a backlog of patients that have come in sooner or whatever. We just know it\u2019s teen season in United States and its Canada and I mean, I'm sorry in China, Canada also and we're June was indicative of a good increase in the sense of teens looking for treatment and we think that will continue. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks, and then another quick one. I realize you don't want to talk about the exit run rate or anything like that, but I think a lot of the assumptions is go forward are that there are no further lockdowns, there are no further sort of quarantine measures implemented, but I just want to ask in the recent weeks [indiscernible] in the Sunbelt, Texas, California, Florida, have you seen any fluctuation in volumes, any early indications there. I guess I am kind of asking of on the one hand you have a full recovery of the economy, on the other half you have full locking out, what if we were somewhat in the middle, are you seeing any indications there? John Morici : Mike, I think you look at \u2013 every area is different, we are seeing a different pace of recovery for the various regions and locations and practices, some practices they are open but then somebody within the practice develops COVID and it shuts down so it varies across. We're doing everything we can to make sure that those doctors have their PPE, they have promotion, they have things in place to be able to help drive volume, but it's very dependent on those specific areas not just in the U.S. but we're seeing this across the other regions as well. Joe Hogan : Mike, right, it is back to Joe again too, I just want you to know we have great enthusiasm for teen and no matter where it is around the world but we can't tell you if there is a surge of teen patients based on a lot of teens not being in school, we cannot tell you if it's a backlog or whatever, but we can tell you we're enthusiastic about the season and that June was a good indication that it's heading in the right direction. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks. Can I ask a quick clarification, okay just this has come up a dozen times in the past five minutes. Your response to Jeff's question on June, do you mean absolute case volume was up in North America in June or utilization is up in June. Joe Hogan : Utilization. Michael Ryskin : Okay, thank you so much, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Joe or John, just a question on China, if you could speak to growth specifically in 2Q I know it is still down year over year, were there any other reasons kind of outside the three that you listed, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan that were ahead of kind of your internal expectations? Joe Hogan : No I cannot say that there was really, I mean we didn't talk a lot specifically about that but Japan, Taiwan, and Korea were exceptions because there were hardly a blip in a sense of what we saw and how they were affected with COVID but really every other country in APAC and most countries around the world we say except for the expansion markets in Asia and obviously COVID was a big impact on them. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Joe Hogan : And then balance of the question John, I think so. Brandon Couillard : John, any chance you could share with us the exocad contribution in the second quarter or to results or should we just wait for the [Q4] for that. John Morici : Yeah, I think we talked about been in the scanner and services segment that we have and I think you can wait for the Q on that but it's - we acquired and it is part of our business and we will put more details into the Q. Shirley Stacy : I think that's the last question. So thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. If you have any follow-up questions, please follow up with Investor Relations. Have a great day.",

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. I'm pleased to report stronger than expected results with record third quarter revenues up 21% year-over-year, reflecting strong momentum across all regions and customer channels for both Invisalign clear aligners and iTero scanners and services. During the quarter, we continued to support doctor recovery efforts with products, programs and virtual tools and training that helped more docs transition their practices to digital technologies and drove record utilization across the Invisalign portfolio. Capping off a record quarter is an achievement of our 9th million Invisalign patient milestone. We also saw a strong response to our new teen and mom-focused consumer campaign with a 118% year-over-year increase in total leads, garnered 3.3 billion impressions, an uptick in consumer engagement from new social media influencers like Charli D\u2019Amelio and Marsai Martin, a 26% increase year-over-year in teenagers using Invisalign clear aligners. Our overall revenue momentum has continued into October and we are encouraged by positive feedback from Invisalign practices regarding the benefits of digital orthodontics starting with an iTero scanner for Invisalign treatment, especially in this COVID environment. For Q3, total revenues were $733 million, up 108% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year, reflecting a sharp rebound in sales for both Invisalign clear aligners and iTero imaging systems as practices around the world reopened and got back to work treating existing and new patients. Q3 revenues for clear aligners were $621 million, up 20% year-over-year, and imaging systems and CAD/CAM Services were $113.4 million, up 24.5% year-over-year. Q3 Invisalign shipments were a record of 496,000 cases, up 28.7% versus prior year and up 124% versus prior quarter, reflecting strong recovery across all regions. During the quarter, we saw increased demand for new cases as restrictions eased and doctors ramped up their practices. This is in contrast to Q2, where doctors\u2019 primary focus was to maintain continuity of patient care for their existing patients through additional aligner shipments and replacement aligners. John mentioned this in his comments last quarter and we'll touch on it again today. For the quarter, we shipped Invisalign cases to a record 70,000 doctors, of which 5,800 were first-time customers, reflecting increased doctor activity as practices have reopened. We have also trained approximately 6,500 new doctors in Q3, including 3,200 international doctors, reflecting increased doctor engagement through our online virtual education courses, summits and forums. Across the business, we believe there are several factors contributing to our strong performance, starting with pent-up demand. Many of our doctors indicate that they are making good progress in working the backlog of patients from office shutdowns. Pent-up disposable income remains a key factor as consumers focus on feel good investments, while many other quality of life options are low. In our new normal, there are far fewer trips abroad, fewer flights, less money spent on gas, dry cleaning, et cetera. More people can afford to allocate that spending to Invisalign treatment, especially when they're working remotely and critiquing themselves on camera so much of the time. That's the Zoom effect that we've heard about across multiple sectors. As we look at our customer channels, we feel the strategy to dedicate sales representatives by specialty alignment is bearing fruit, particularly in the GP Dental segment. Sales reps were able to partner with a wider range of providers within their designated specialty during the downturn and assess mindset and specific needs during the recovery and tailor plans to thrive beyond COVID. A digital mindset has been key and we believe this is the largest influence in the ortho market, and the one we've been laying the foundation for over the last several years. For many doctors, there are still down from normal years in terms of overall production and weekly patient flow. But they have prioritized Invisalign clear aligners as their preferred modality, expanded to the first age group and leverage programs that help to make the transition from analog to digital treatment. We see this both in teen and adult treatment growing with the same provider, increased use of iTero scanners, our Virtual Care, our high overlap of bracket buyback switch. As part of our recovery programs, we offer doctors two programs, either switch their braces in patients into Invisalign treatment by buying their wires and brackets or just buy back their existing inventory. We took out the equivalent of 10,000 cases. Providers actively reduced their analog footprints by proactively switching their patients to sustainable digital care with Invisalign. And for GPs, who already demonstrated a momentum with digital, an active choice was made to position Invisalign as a priority. Scanning every patient with iTero is generating more opportunity from recall patients, even if overall practice capacity is still down. Because doctors in both channels are trying to anticipate what may come in terms of additional waves and office shutdowns, they are hyper-focused on ensuring that they have the best plan for continuity of care and business continuity, which is digital. To support them in this digital journey, we've rolled out My Invisalign app and Virtual Care to 40-plus countries. These tools have been received very positively by our doctors and are quickly becoming part of their practice workflow. Our commitment to continuous innovation is key. We've recently announced our treatment planning evolution and global availability of our next generation ClinCheck Pro 6.0 proprietary treatment planning software. ClinCheck Pro 6.0 moves Invisalign digital treatment planning to the cloud, making its robust treatment planning tools and features available to doctors anytime, anywhere on any laptop, personal computer, tablet or phone. The release includes a new ClinCheck In-Face Visualization tool and enhanced doctor-facing digital clinical tool that combines a photo of the patient's face with their 3D Invisalign treatment plan, creating a personalized view of how their new smile will look. In addition, we also announced today Invisalign G8 predictability improvement with SmartForce Aligner Activation for both orthodontists and general dentists starting in Q1 2021. Invisalign G8 with SmartForce Aligner Activation is our newest biomechanical innovation and the latest in our long history of Invisalign predictability improvements. We continue to focus on building partnerships with doctors. Our data shows that providers who had or quickly developed momentum around digital orthodontics leaned into our comprehensive platform and a variety of our programs and resources to accelerate a digital shift. It's a compelling story of how engagement may be the first step that transformation is achieved through the breadth of product and services only Align can provide. Transformation and support programs like ADAPT, virtual tools, development of Teen Awesomeness Centers, GP Accelerator, Teen Conversion, Aligner Intensive Fellowship, iPro and doctor-led coaching programs that support GP growth. Building on the teen market in Q3, 163,000 teens and pre-teens started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, representing 33% of total cases shipped, reflecting growth predominantly from North American orthos and EMEA regions. In parts of the market, we saw an initial rush for teen treatments earlier in the quarter with a slight change in demand profile compared to what we normally see in a typical season, which may be the result of a different type of back-to-school season as most kids return to school late or through virtual learning. Invisalign First continues to accelerate among young patients as well. In terms of products performance, we saw strong growth across the portfolio and non-comprehensive outpaced comprehensive even with the record adult shipments for the quarter. Growth with the Invisalign Go product also increased among GPs, driven by North America and EMEA, and there was an increase in our express package shipments with North America contributing to the majority of that growth. Overall, both non-comprehensive and comprehensive shipments were up, with continued increased adoption of our Moderate product among the ortho and GP channels. Now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 166% sequentially and 25% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in shipments due in large part to the digital programs and tools implemented during the pandemic to help our doctors as well as our continued investments in targeted marketing and sales efforts. The Q3 utilization was up for North American ortho and GPs both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We saw continued utilization increases during the quarter, especially among our orthodontic customers in the teen segment, the strongest teen quarter in the last six quarters. As we mentioned previously in Q2, we started the Bracket Buy Back program to enable doctors to switch their braces patients into Invisalign treatment by buying back their wires and brackets inventory. We also saw stronger growth in the adult segment. We believe that some of the increase in adult shipments is reflective of how circumstances have changed today, with adults in our target demographic having more disposable directed \u2013 more disposable income directed at getting their smiles fixed. In Latin America, volume was also up year-over-year, led by strong growth in Mexico and Brazil. When you consider the timing of the pandemic and the shutdowns occurring later in Q2 for LATAM, we were encouraged by the growth this quarter. We also saw increased utilization in the GP channel with Invisalign Go and the adoption of Moderate. DSO utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driven by Heartland and also Aspen. For our international business, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up a sequential 88%, led by a significant increase in EMEA. On a year-over-year basis, international shipments were up 34%, reflecting increases through both EMEA and APAC. For EMEA, Q3 volumes were up sequentially 104% and up 38% on a year-over-year basis, across all markets, with strong performances from the ortho channel as well as the GP channel, as many doctors kept their offices open during their typical summer holiday season. Both core and expansion markets accelerated with growth in our core markets led by Iberia, the UKI, Germany and growth in our expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe and the Benelux. We introduced the Ortho Recovery 360 program in EMEA last quarter to support our orthodontists as they started reopening their businesses. As of Q3, over 4,000 orthodontists have enrolled in the program with over 13,000 touch points with sales team members, providing a dedicated support in July and August alone. As a result, we continue to see an increase in net promoter score or NPS with qualitative feedback from doctors showing that they appreciate Align for the support during this difficult time. We also rolled out Your Brilliance Enhanced marketing campaign in select EMEA markets that highlights the skills of our orthodontists and illustrates how partnering with Align and using Invisalign clear aligners and iTero systems and services can help further enhance the brilliance of these specialists. To support our GP doctors, we also launched our GP Recovery 360 program during the quarter with over 2,900 GPs enrolled so far. At the beginning of the quarter, we also launched the Invisalign Go Plus system in the UK in Benelux and had 2,500 GPs attend the event. During the quarter, we continue to offer virtual and hybrid education events for our doctors with online and on demand education events, which reached over 2,000 GPs cumulatively. For APAC, in Q3, volumes were up sequentially 74% reflecting continued improvement within the region. On a year-over-year basis, APAC was up 30% compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we were pleased to see a record number of unique doctors submitting cases and positive growth in the adult segment with growth in GP channels and non-comprehensive cases with Moderate product. In the teen segment, shipments were at an all-time high as doctors\u2019 offices continue to recover. We also saw acceleration from Japan and ANZ. During the quarter, we celebrated the grand opening of our China manufacturing facility in Ziyang. The event was attended by key partners and doctors in China. The state-of-the-art facility replaces our original temporary facility, further establishing our commitment and capacity to manufacture Invisalign aligners and iTero imaging systems in China. Align was also one of the sponsors of APAC Med Virtual Forum 2020, which attracted over 1,000 attendees from the MedTech industry. The forum consisted of panel discussions and live video chat sessions at the Align virtual booth as we continue to establish Align as a global medical company that aims to transform smiles and change lives in the APAC region. Last week, we also hosted the Align APAC Virtual Symposium, a fully digital event that showcased digital treatment technologies and featured practitioners from across the Asia-Pacific region with over 800 participants. Our consumer marketing is focused on building the clear aligner category and driving demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctors\u2019 office. In Q3, we saw strong digital engagement globally with more than 78% increase in unique visitors as well as on leads created, driven by our new campaign, revamped social media strategy and our new invisalign.com website that was rolled out to 15 plus countries. Several key metrics show increased activity engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q3 quarterly presentation slides available on our website. We're pleased with the strong engagement and activity we've seen on our consumer platforms over the last few months, and believe it speaks to the strength of the brand and consumer interest in treatment, even during the challenges of the last few months. As you\u2019ll recall from last quarter, we launched our Mom multi-touch campaign, with incremental support to drive reach, awareness, and foot traffic to practices during the key teen season. We also launched a new multimillion dollar TV campaign designed to reach Mom and Teens across a broad range of networks nationwide including cable and connected TV networks. Align is always looking for new opportunities to reach consumers and be relevant to potential patients wherever they work, live and play. During the quarter we announced that the Invisalign brand is the official clear aligner sponsor of the NFL Football League, so 11 NFL teams working with great sports brands like the NFL is another way to connect with consumers by leveraging the power of the NFL brand and its existing brand platforms. The NFL league partnership will help build awareness of Invisalign clear aligner treatment at a national level, while the team agreement will help us engage within key markets and connect consumers with doctors in those markets. During the quarter, we also extended our innovation to drive engagement with new Invisalign Stickables, designed to personalize Invisalign clear aligners, especially for younger patients. The innovative sticker accessories, designed exclusively for use with SmartTrack material, are available in a variety of designs, colors, shapes and themes, and reflect patients desire to show their personal flair during Invisalign treatment. For our Systems and Services business, Q3 revenues were up 110% sequentially due to higher shipments and services revenues. We continued to see momentum with the Element 5D Imaging System, gaining traction in North America and APAC region. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were up 24.5% due to higher shipments and service. Cumulatively, over 27.4 million orthodontic scans and 6 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. For Q3, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 83% from 79% in Q3 last year. International scans increased to 72% up from 63% in the same quarter last year. We\u2019re pleased to see that within the Americas, 95% of cases submitted by North American orthodontists were submitted digitally. Our Q3 Systems and Services revenue also includes exocad CAD/CAM products and services. exocad\u2019s expertise in restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery, and smile design extends our digital dental solutions and broadens Align\u2019s digital platform toward a fully-integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows, and we are excited about our continued integration progress and product plans. In September, exocad celebrated its 10th anniversary in conjunction with exocad Insights 2020 an annual event for manufacturers and users of dental CAD/CAM technologies entitled \"A Decade of Digital Innovation.\" The event attracted over 300 dental technicians, dentists and over 40 partner companies, as well as 1,600 users of digital technologies in laboratories and practices from 55 countries. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks Joe, now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $734.1 million, up 108.4% from the prior quarter and up 20.9% from the corresponding quarter a year-ago. For clear aligners, Q3 revenues of $620.8 million were up 108.1% sequentially and up 20.2% year-over-year due to Invisalign volume growth in all regions, driven by North America, EMEA, APAC and LATAM, partially offset by lower ASPs. Historically we have raised prices by approximately $50 per case in the third quarter. Given our continued commitment to helping our customers in their recovery efforts, we did not implement a price increase this year. Q3 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially $75 primarily due to higher mix of new cases versus additional aligner shipments as Joe mentioned earlier. Recall Q2 ASPs benefited from more additional aligner shipments as doctors were focused on maintaining treatment progress for existing Invisalign patients. This trend reversed itself after practices reopened in Q3 and demand for new cases ramped up significantly. As a result, our deferred revenue balances increased $93 million from Q2, of which, the majority of this increase is related to clear aligner, and will be recognized with future additional aligner shipments. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Invisalign ASPs decreased approximately $80 primarily reflecting higher promotional discounts and increased deferrals related to additional aligners. In addition, we provided doctors with incentives designed to specifically aid them in the recovery during the pandemic. Q3 total Invisalign shipments of 496.1 million cases were up 123.6% sequentially and up 28.7% year-over-year. Our System and Services revenues for the third quarter was $113.4 million up 110.1% sequentially due to an increase in scanner sales and increased services revenues from higher installed base. Year-over-year System and Services revenue was up 24.5% due to higher scanner sales, services revenue, and the inclusion of exocad\u2019s CAD/CAM services, partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services deferred revenue also increased 28%, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which we recognized ratably over the service period. Moving on to gross margin, third quarter overall gross margin was 72.7%, up 9.1 points sequentially and up 0.7 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to exocad, overall gross margin was 73.3% for the third quarter, up 8.9 points sequentially and up 1 point year-over-year. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 74.7%, up 10.2 points sequentially due to increased volumes driving favorable manufacturing absorption of fixed costs coupled with lower freight costs from increased domestic shipments, partially offset by lower ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin was up 1.2 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing volumes driving favorable absorption and lower doctor training, partially offset by lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was 62%, up 2.8 points sequentially primarily due to favorable product mix shift to higher margin scanners, higher services revenue, partially offset by freight and training costs. Systems and Services gross margin was down 2.1 points year-over-year due to lower ASPs and higher freight and training costs offset by higher services revenue and product mix shift. Q3 operating expenses were $357 million, up sequentially 20.1% and up 15% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased compensation, marketing and media spend, and favorable foreign exchange. Year-over-year operating expenses increased by $46.6 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and marketing and R&D activities, additionally prior year included a benefit of $6.8 million from the early termination of our discontinued Invisalign store leases. On a non-GAAP basis operating expenses were $332.1 million, up sequentially 25% and up 12.8% year-over-year due to the reasons as described above. Our third quarter operating income of $177.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 24.1%, up 44.8 points sequentially and up 3.2 points year-over-year. The sequential increases in operating income and operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage. On a year-over-year basis, the increases in operating income and operating margin reflects higher gross margin and operating leverage partially offset by our continued investment in R&D, geographic expansion and go-to-market activities. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock based compensation, acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles related to exocad, operating margin for the third quarter was 28%, up 39 points sequentially and up 4.2 points year-over-year. Interest and other income expense net for the third quarter was a gain of $7.5 million, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange. With regards to the third quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 24.5% which includes tax benefits of approximately $8 million related to the release of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the closure of an income tax audit. Third quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 16.6% compared to 27.8% in the prior quarter and 18.8% in the same quarter a year ago. The third quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the second quarter\u2019s rate primarily due to reduction in tax benefits resulting from considerable profits recorded in Q3 as opposed to losses incurred in Q2. Third quarter net income per diluted share was $1.76, up $2.28 sequentially and up $0.48 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.25 for the third quarter, up $2.60 sequentially and up $0.77 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet, as of September 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $615.5 million, an increase of approximately $211 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations. Of our $615.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $298.8 million was held in the U.S. and $316.7 million was held by our international entities. Q3 accounts receivable balance was $626 million, up approximately 32.3% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 76.5 days, down 44 days sequentially and down two days as compared to Q3 last year due to strong cash collections as doctor\u2019s offices reopened from Q2 shutdowns. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $211 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $21.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $189.8 million. Under our May 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million still available for repurchase of our common stock. Now let me turn to our outlook. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our Q3 performance and the strong momentum in our business. We made investment decisions that helped drive and capture demand across all regions and all customer channels. We see good return on our investments and strong revenue growth, which has continued into October. We are confident in the huge market opportunity, our industry leadership, and our ability to execute. At the same time, there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and global environment, therefore we aren\u2019t providing specific guidance. With that, I will turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : In summary, we are certainly pleased with our progress in the third quarter. We have taken a very thoughtful approach to recovery and we have persevered in large part by living the values that are important to us as an organization; agility, customer and accountability. In a time of great uncertainty, when swift actions have been required, we have responded like no other company in our industry. Most importantly, we have followed our guiding principles and supported our employees and customers, protecting employee jobs and salaries and working to support the needs of our teams globally, and supporting our customers with PPE, extended payment terms, postponed subscription fees for iTero, and numerous programs to help them through this crisis. We also applied our manufacturing experience and resources to making testing swabs for hospitals and PPE for our own teams and also customers. Instead of going quiet or holding on planned spend, we accelerated our investments in marketing to drive consumer demand to our doctors\u2019 offices and stay top of mind with consumers. We accelerated new digital technology to market so that we could provide virtual tools to our doctors that enabled them to stay connected with their patient and keep their treatment moving forward. We supported doctors and their teams with online education and digital forums that went beyond product and clinical education to help navigate PPE shortages and recovery planning; and we continued to grow the business, not just protecting jobs but adding headcount, continuing our investments in R&D and product innovation as you saw in our Invisalign G8 announcement today and developing our plans for manufacturing expansion. Our actions are a result of the conviction that we have in our business model, supported by the strength of our balance sheet, to drive results that exhibit our accountability to our employees, customers and shareholders. Even in a time that required us to change and adapt, we maintained our long-term focus. I feel this is what good companies do and its proof that being a good company and delivering the type of results we\u2019ve seen this quarter can go hand-in-hand. We have remained a growth business, driving programs in anticipation of recovery, but we acknowledge that there still remains uncertainty due to COVID-19. Our plan is to counter future uncertainty by staying focused on our long-term strategy, living our values, supporting our employees and customers, and keeping the demand drivers we\u2019ve identified over the last few months in mind. The re-direction of disposable income for many consumers; channel focus that allows us to reach and support a wider range of customers within each channel and most importantly, the digital mindset that is really taking hold with more and more of our customers and that we are supporting through innovative products and programs that can help support their digital transformation. We are not ignoring the reality of COVID-19 and how long it may be part of our lives, but we\u2019re also not going to stop driving the business forward for the good of customers, their patients, our employees, and stakeholders. With that, I want to thank you again for joining our call. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year continues to unfold. On November 20 to 21, Align will be hosting the Invisalign Ortho Summit, Virtual Edition, with the theme Digital is the Answer. This Invisalign Summit is the ultimate learning experience for orthodontic practices. From digital practice transformation to great patient experiences, there\u2019s never been a more exciting time to learn about digital orthodontics. Align will also host a virtual Investor Day on November 23, where I also look forward to sharing our views on the incredible market opportunity that we have combined with the unmatched power of Align\u2019s digital platform, technology innovation, global reach, and brand equity. Now with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Rich : Thanks, and good afternoon. Joe and John, obviously, great to see the volumes come back so nicely. It sounds like the momentum continued in October. Could you maybe just kind of help us understand kind of the cadence of growth that you saw over the quarter? And any comments on how October has fared so far, maybe relative to the type of case growth that you saw in 3Q? Joe Hogan : Yes, yes, Nathan, thanks for the question. Look, we just built through the quarter. Every month we saw actually continue to enhance momentum. And the short answer to your question is, we\u2019ve seen that build in October also. Nathan Rich : That\u2019s great. And Joe, obviously, you kind of talked through in detail about what has kind of driven the stronger utilization that you\u2019ve seen and the value of digital treatment. When you kind of take a step back and kind of think longer-term, how has that kind of changed your outlook or influence your kind of multi-year outlook for kind of what you could see from this business over the next several years going forward? Joe Hogan : Nathan, you\u2019ve known John and me and Shirley long enough. I mean, we\u2019re incredibly enthusiastic about this business and bullish about this business. And you can see we\u2019re even more so as obviously we deliver the kind of results we have in 3Q. I think you always have to keep in mind two things here. One is, we\u2019re in a very volatile environment. We understand that and we\u2019ve done some things. We feel that\u2019s really helped our doctors through this and made the company stronger coming out at the other end. But always remember, we\u2019re completely underpenetrated in this marketplace, right? We\u2019re still less than 10% penetrated from an orthodontic procedure standpoint, let alone those 300 million patients we talk about there that should receive orthodontic treatment that aren\u2019t receiving orthodontic treatment. So we remain incredibly bullish with a digital format to be able to go after those patients and be able to continue to drive the growth of this business. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Rich. Next question\u2026 Nathan Rich : Okay. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Yes. Shirley Stacy : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. So, can you speak to some of the contributions from the recovery efforts in switching brackets and wires patients? Or are you continuing to see those contributions and efforts into the fourth quarter? And do you think that will drive the Board\u2019s longer-term shift here? Do you have any indication based on the responses? I guess you\u2019ve seen from practitioners how sticky that is? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Well, it\u2019s \u2013 overall \u2013 hey, it\u2019s Joe. I mean, overall, it\u2019s pretty sticky when we buy their wires and brackets inventory back. And then we introduced in the programs like ADAPT and different things that really allow them to begin a digital transformation within their practices. So I feel that part is very sticky. I can\u2019t sit here and naively say that everyone who starts to move digital in this crisis is going to stay digital. But I can tell you that we have the tools, being able to drive consumer demand and consumer awareness and all those things, helps us to maintain that stickiness. And I think over time, we\u2019ll just have to see how sticky it is as we come out of this COVID crisis. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then on ASPs in the quarter, I guess, is that the run rate we should be thinking about? I know you didn\u2019t take the price hikes, but any other mix dynamics as we think about the next quarter and beyond? John Morici : Hey, Erin, this is John. Yes, the mix that we saw \u2013 we talked about some of the dynamics of all those new cases coming in and we saw that. We also talked about not having a price increase given the conditions that we\u2019re in. We\u2019ll evaluate going forward as to any changes we might make in pricing and so on. But I think from a run rate standpoint, this is a good starting point for going forward. Erin Wright : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hi, Steve. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for the time here. I wonder if you could expound a little bit on some of the numbers that you\u2019ve given here at this quarter, and I believe you did in the prior quarter as well around not just the training numbers, but some of the data that you gave on people who are not just getting trained, but who are new to Invisalign. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know, maybe some do. But what were those numbers a year ago? And do you have visibility into what those training numbers look like out into 4Q or even beyond? John Morici : Yes, Steve, this is John. I think when you look at being able to train like we can now doing much more virtual being able to have that remote training as well as where you can in person gives us a lot of flexibility going forward to be able to expand out our training. So there\u2019s a lot of new capabilities, a lot of new tools that we\u2019ve introduced this quarter to be able to help our customers and train new customers as well as our sales team be able to reach those. So it\u2019s a key part as you know to our growth and we\u2019re going to continue to find ways to be able to connect with new doctors to be able to get them to understand the benefits of Invisalign and ultimately have them use it more and more to grow. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Thanks, John. And then, Joe, one for you. So I\u2019ll let you carry the burden of being the CEO of the first big dental company here in the U.S. to report. Just give a little bit of perspective on how you imagine policy evolves. As you talk to folks around the CDC, AAO, the ADA, any of their counterpart organizations in Europe, do you see any sign that there might be a move toward practice closures? Or are we really past that now that we\u2019ve got PPE in place? I ask because I think they\u2019re just a lot of folks who are looking at the growth, not just at Align, but at some other companies and it\u2019s really attractive growth, but people are just worried about the possibility that we see lockdowns again. So any perspective you could offer there would be really helpful? Thank you. Joe Hogan : Yes, Steve. Steve, I\u2019d tell you, talking to obviously doctors all around the world or whatever. I don\u2019t see that there\u2019s any imminent, a lot of closures in the industry. I mean, there\u2019s frustration with the closures and obviously a lot of disagreement in the sense of when they\u2019re told to close. Fortunately, what we\u2019ve seen with the COVID coming back here in the fall, we haven\u2019t seen the institution of going back and closing these doctors\u2019 offices, which help. I can tell you, Steve, since I\u2019ve been here five years, there\u2019s always a certain segment of the dental industry that is looking to sell or looking to change and get out, but not close down. So I honestly think that there\u2019s still optimism out there. I\u2019ve seen the doctors do a great job in a sense of being able to protect their employees, make sure that they protect their patients and do the things that are needed. I know by reading your material and other materials that we\u2019ve all picked up that most of the doctors are running at 70%, 75% kind of a capacity, but they\u2019re finding a way to make it work. So I\u2019m not looking at any imminent demise in the business in the sense of close downs or anything like that. And I think the offices are getting better and better being able to drive volume through their offices. And again, you know that this is a digital format that we feel that sets a foundation for them to have a much better patient flow through or a much fewer touches in this COVID world, which we hope hopefully will carry over as we move out of this next year. Steve Beuchaw : Really appreciate that. Thanks for all the time here. Joe Hogan : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jon Block : Great. Thanks, guys. Joe Hogan : Hi, Jon. Jon Block : Hey, Joe, actually, first one for you. Sort of qualitatively, can you give us a beat or a signal on teen share of chair? And do you see a broadening out within your ortho customer base? I think that\u2019s the key sort of the broadening out. In other words, are you seeing the one from orthos that we\u2019re always, I don\u2019t know, call it less than 5% Invisalign shared chair. Are they stepping up to the plate because of clear aligner workflow advantages? And if so, how do you sort of ensure that you capitalize on that longer term? Joe Hogan : Yes. Well, I think it\u2019s a couple things, Jon. Obviously, COVID has been an added incentive to move people out of analog into digital because of fewer touches and being able to maintain continuity of treatment, even if things are shutdown. So there\u2019s no question, we saw our share of chair increased in that sense. I think also when you see new products like Invisalign First and those things we\u2019ve introduced in the last few years, that\u2019s \u2013 as you know well, that\u2019s extended our reach from a HDM point within that specific demographic. That\u2019s helped us also. And I think there\u2019s a combination here of further and further realization of how digital processes and orthodontics really can help, can help be more efficient, but also realization from consumers that it is an offering here that is better than wires and brackets, and more efficient, certainly in this COVID kind of environment. So how do we \u2013 how are we certain that we maintain that? Jon, when you look at programs like ADAPT and things, those \u2013 that switch over \u2013 let\u2019s back up for a second. Jon, five years ago, we were fighting for clinical, I\u2019d say relevancy in this industry. That\u2019s not a question anymore. All the docs \u2013 most of the docs out there understand very clearly we can do 80%, 90% of the cases out there. It becomes a business formula. Can we really make money with a digital kind of a system? And those are the programs that we\u2019ve been putting together with doctors with outside experts that can really train doctors as to how digital can work, how can expand their practices and how actually can be more profitable in a digital process. And I\u2019m confident with what we\u2019re building up in that area, we\u2019ll be able to extend that going forward. Jon Block : Got it. Fair enough. I\u2019ll shift over to GP side for the other question. The utilization over four, I think I\u2019ve been waiting 10 or so years for that and I get it. Some of it\u2019s probably pent-up demand. You talked to that a little bit on the call, but what about the other components? Is it some scanner digitizing the front end, the bifurcating of the sales force? I mean, essentially Joe, have you given the tools that you needed to the GP to finally sort of step function that utilization rate higher that was always sort of stuck right around that mid threes for a number of years? Thanks guys. Joe Hogan : Yes. Jon, I feel the answer to your question is yes, we have. I mean everything from iTero and really the inside of iTero and the software programs at all in conjunction with iGo that make it much simpler for doctors that haven\u2019t been associated with digital orthodontics before. Our segmented sales force, for sure. I mean, we\u2019ve piloted this in Europe first and somewhat in APAC. So we knew what to expect. We were just fortunate enough to launch it ahead of this issue, ahead of the COVID issue, and they have the salespeople ready to have that touch with customers to make it work. What I\u2019m excited about this, Jon, we have so much more that we can do to make that work also. And I think with a confidence that GPs are having in this kind of a system, it\u2019s a light touch system, it\u2019s a high revenue kind of a product and it\u2019s gaining more attention in that channel. So, yes, I\u2019m really \u2013 we\u2019re all thrilled here to see the utilization rates, but it is on the back of those kinds of innovations in distribution and also product that we think we\u2019ve been able to drive it. Jon Block : Okay. And if I can just quickly slip in one more, just for a clarification, I think it was all the way back to Nathan\u2019s first question, just to be clear when you say momentum building, I mean, do we take that your October year-over-year growth rate was north of your worldwide 3Q growth rate that you posted? Thanks, guys. John Morici : Jon, you\u2019re right. We see momentum building and that continues \u2013 it continues that growth from a revenue and a volume standpoint into October. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Jon. Next question, please. Joe Hogan : Thanks, Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hi, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. As we think about the outlook for 4Q and as we come out of COVID more broadly, are there any \u2013 I know you guys obviously didn\u2019t cut costs, kept the sales force, because you maybe foresaw some of this growth coming back. Is there anything in terms of investments of the ramp back that we should be considering? Joe Hogan : Well, I think there\u2019s just continuity of investments is the way I\u2019d answer your question. They\u2019re not new investments. We\u2019ll continue to invest in the consumer side, pretty dramatically. You\u2019ll see that we\u2019re doing that all around the world. It\u2019s not just in the United States or Canada. We\u2019re also \u2013 you\u2019ll see investments in Europe and also Asia to a degree that we haven\u2019t made before. We have a series of new products that we\u2019re investing in. We kept that momentum in the third quarter and where we hired engineers to keep that moving. And then these specific programs for doctors like ADAPT that we\u2019re talking about, and AIF and different things, they\u2019re really an important part of this because you have to make sure that these workflow changes, and the way ClinCheck works, like ClinCheck Pro and whatever, they have to be introduced to docs and we got to have the high touch kind of a system to give them the confidence in those programs. So it\u2019s a long answer to your question, but I\u2019d say we maintain and enhance what we have been doing is what you\u2019ll see in the fourth quarter and as we go into the first quarter too. John Morici : The added piece, Elizabeth, from an investment standpoint is investing in operations to stay ahead of the volume. And making those investments we did so in Q3, we\u2019ll continue to make those investments in Q4. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay. But it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s anything totally different that this sort of \u2013 because we could consider catch up or something on that front. Okay. I guess \u2013 yes. Joe Hogan : You go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Anderson : No, I was just wondering, you talked about some of your continued spend on social channels in terms of marketing and that seemed also a continuation plus obviously the buyback program in the quarter. Is there anything else that you guys see changing in terms of your marketing spend going forward? Would you say it\u2019s sort of like a continuation of the types of programs that you were doing in the third quarter? Joe Hogan : Well, I think, obviously, Raj and our marketing team are very innovative and it\u2019s not that we\u2019ll just keep with the same themes. We obviously we run \u2013 we run trials, we do different things, we\u2019ll change them up or whatever based on what we\u2019re experiencing in the marketplace. So our investments will continue to be very aggressive. We\u2019ll continue to be innovative in the sense of how we do these things, but we certainly won\u2019t let off the gas in the sense of the focus that we\u2019ve had over the last few quarters. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Elizabeth. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Young : Hi, this is Jonathan Young on for Steve. Shirley Stacy : Hi, Steve. Hi, there. Jonathan Young : Hey, it\u2019s Jonathan. Hi. So you just from relation to the backlog, you were talking about on the pent-up demand, I guess from your perspective, how much backlog do you think is kind of still out there with the docs before it normalizes out as we kind of move forward? Joe Hogan : Steve, you asked a big question. I mean, from a backlog standpoint, we really don\u2019t know. When you talk from an empirical standpoint, when you talk to many of our docs, they\u2019ll say they cleared out their backlog in July and August. But this is a global business it\u2019s hard to talk about all over the world where it stands, but \u2013 when things came out of lockdown and when they didn\u2019t. So we struggled to be able to quantify a number for you in that sense. Jonathan Young : Okay. And just going back to the comment about the utilization of docs being at about 70%, 75% capacity, I guess, from \u2013 that\u2019s from the capacity standpoint, but from your customer base, are they all largely open at this point or is there still 10%, 20% that still remains close due to random shutdowns globally or locally in certain areas? Thanks. Joe Hogan : No, they\u2019re largely open. Jonathan Young : Great. Thank you. Joe Hogan : Yes. You're welcome Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John Kreger : Hey guys. Joe Hogan : Hey John. John Kreger : Hey. Can you just talk a little bit more about again the uncertainties that prompted you to not guide to Q4 after a very, very good third quarter? And one thing I was thinking about given the rebound in cases in Europe are you seeing any signs of maybe just patient traffic slowing down even if practices aren't closing per se? Joe Hogan : Yes, jump in. John Morici : Yes. I think, when you think about what we've seen in terms of the momentum we see we tried to lay that out, obviously there are still unknowns in the world. I would say COVID in the global economy and so on. But for the things that we can control and what we tried to lay out around the R&D investments, in manufacturing, and marketing and sales we feel really good about our momentum and what we can drive in the future. We just have unknowns that are outside of our control and so that's the reason from a guidance standpoint that we didn't give specific guidance. But we wanted to highlight that we've \u2013 because our continued momentum as we went through the quarter both for revenue and volume, and that continued past the quarter end. John Kreger : Great. Thank you. Joe, a question for you about sort of the strategy to get the attention more of GPs. Can you just talk about how exocad is going and what else your \u2013 what other levers you're pulling to sort of become more of that sort of daily thought process for the typical general dentist? Joe Hogan : Yes, John that\u2019s a good question. Look, I feel great about exocad and obviously when I talked about in the highlights that we just went over is, I mean its digital dentistry on the GP side. You have to go around the world and understand how exocad is, exocad is very embedded in Europe also in various parts of the far-east and in some parts of the United States, but the key is just a digital workflow and it's between iTero France is, it's in a obviously a GPs office and that CAD/CAM piece is either extended in office or primarily it goes to labs. I think it's given us the initial boost that we wanted to in the sense of our relevancy in the GPs office in the sense of an iTero scanner can do these kinds of restorative scans and this kind of restorative workflow. What's really exciting is, when you look at how you can integrate what exocad does in a seamless workflow way with iTero and also Invisalign, it just gives us a lot of degrees of freedom to really change that kind of restorative dentistry. I'm really excited about the progress even in the short amount of time. John Kreger : Great. Thank you. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. John, I think you said leads were up something like 120% year-over-year. How do we think about the relevancy of that metric as a leading indicator of revenue growth, it's not a metric I can recall you really discussing before? John Morici : Well, that's a good question. I mean, we do \u2013 I don't know how we've communicated that before, but it certainly is a term we use internally here at Align all the time. A lead is just what you would guess it is Brandon and it's a strong lead in the sense of a customer wanting to turn into a patient. And we have several ways of touching that customer they can come through our Invisalign app. They could be contacted by a concierge service. Concierge service can take the information and move it onto a doctor's office, but it's a lead and it's a great leading indicator of the interest of patients out there. And it's, again, one of the major attributes of Align of what we bring to the marketplace is to be able to excite consumers and move them into our doctor partner groups. Brandon Couillard : Okay. And then John, any chance you could specifically speak to China growth in the third quarter? And then secondly the financial impact of opening the new permanent manufacturing facility as opposed to the temporary site you have been operating be in terms of revenue growth or profitability or expenses you think you can share there? John Morici : In China, we saw a good sequential growth, continues to grow. I mean, obviously they were the first ones kind of in the pandemic to starting Q1 we saw some growth in Q2 and significantly more growth in Q3. The manufacturing like you said, is gone live it's now greenfield facility where everything's up and running. We're adding more capacity there to meet our demands. But it was a very smooth transition. We learned a lot from having that temporary facility and learning kind of the manufacturing, the scale up that we needed and that transitioned very well into the new facility. Brandon Couillard : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good evening guys. Joe Hogan : Hey Jeff. Jeff Johnson : Hello. Joe, wanted to the start with you again, it's the same thing, Jon Block's trying to feel out here, but was there anything different in your North American ortho customer mix? Did the Diamond and Double Diamond guys come back much faster than the lower-end guys, anything at all like that? And I guess what I'm trying to get at and same thing, like I said, John is sustainability of that 24% North American ortho utilization number, a fantastic number, is that our evidence, is that our proof point there of this move from analog to digital, as you keep talking about it, is that the number to focus in on there and then obviously the GP number as well? John Morici : Yes, I think, Jeff if your real question is about utilization being the key metric, I mean, it certainly is, but who has led that, our Diamond and Diamond Plus docs are already having a big digital aspect of what they were doing. We're able to function extremely well in this environment. Remember our virtual care tool that we bought out really six months before we wanted to do it, it wasn't the best tool in the world, but we've made it better over time. Really gave them that digital interface with their patient base that allowed them to be able to track their patients without having come back to the office that was for a certain period of time. So but to say that it was only those practices would be wrong. We saw no matter what tier they were in our advantage program, we saw them reaching for training, wanting to work from a digital standpoint. The orthodontist recognized the advantages of digital during this whole sequence and again, that's why the program and the things that we've had in place, the investments we made or whatever, they were very timely to help to support that interest. Jeff Johnson : Yes. Understood. And then maybe just a follow-up for John. So John, you seem to imply that maybe ASP is here at this level are good way to think about the next few quarters. Does that mean some of the incentives kind of sustain here? Do you leave them in place? And I just want to understand the accounting. Does the bracket buybacks, does that go against ASPs in any way or is that a cost buried somewhere else in the P&L? Thanks. John Morici : No, that is a cost against as a promotion, so it goes against revenue for the bracket buyback in. And we'll evaluate as we do on a normal basis with promotions, what promotions are working, what's driving that right level of utilization and engagement, whether a new doctor to a doctor that does a lot of volume. We did mention that we didn't increase price and that was something that's just a reflection of what's happening in the marketplace. And look we are very pleased with, when you look at Invisalign ASPs that it's 74.7%. We haven't seen that in several quarters. So, we're very aware of the dynamics around promotions and what that drives, but ultimately its driving profitability and we saw great gross margin growth. Jeff Johnson : Yes. Understood. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. Joe Hogan : Hey, Glen. Shirley Stacy : Hey Glen, you there? We maybe not hearing your line clearly. Glen Santangelo : Hello. Can you hear me now? Joe Hogan : Yes, we can. Glen Santangelo : Hey Joe, how are you? Thanks so much. Joe. I just want to take a step back. I mean a lot of the questions were already asked, but I wanted one of the follow-up to response you said to the earlier question. What's your sense going on with your organic growth rate of this business? I mean, are you seeing that the organic growth rate of just the ortho business in general accelerate through the pandemic, and then as you think about sort of the penetration of clear aligners versus total cases, you sort of cited that you still think we're less than 10% penetrated. Could you maybe talk about the penetration in North America and international, maybe how you see those sort of penetration rates evolving over the next couple of years? Joe Hogan : Well, I mean, obviously we measure ourselves from a penetration rate standpoint overall and we split the market up obviously in teens and adults, ortho versus the general segment with GPs. But if I'm answering your question right, Glen, I mean we have increasing penetration in the utilization we call on different parts of the marketplace. The digital platforms and things that we've put in place are really enhancement to doctors to get on these digital platforms and use the tools and things that we have. So Glen, I think again as I mentioned in the other question on like this is \u2013 remember we're still underpenetrated, it really as digital orthodontics has such a long runway, but it is a different workflow for doctors and it's a different expectation from a patient base, understanding you really can use in digital platform in order to move teeth as efficiently or better than wires and brackets and so. It's so important that we have a strong digital platform that unites the workflow between us and doctors, and doctors and patients that you have a breadth of product, everything from Invisalign First, all the way to express and comprehensive products, and retainers and things in between. Sales forces are incredibly important for that penetration, the sense of how you talked \u2013 how you touch docs and how you move things forward. So I would say Glen, to answer your question here, there's no magic on this penetration piece. It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work and a lot of friction you have to overcome, there's no escaping it, but it's inevitable. Digital is better than analog in a COVID environment or not in a COVID environment. That's our position and that's what we'll continue to drive. Glen Santangelo : And Joe, it seems like you may be expanded your sort of technology lead again with sort of this latest development on the G8 side. Could you maybe just give us a quick update on the competitive landscape? Are you seeing anything else in the market that is starting to get any traction or is it still kind of really just an execution issue for you? Joe Hogan : This is all about execution with us. It's a \u2013 from \u2013 I have nothing from an update from a competitive standpoint, really to report. Remember our competition is about expanding the marketplace that is what it's all about. This is not a scrum of a bunch of people making plastic aligners. This is a scrum about what can you do to reduce the friction of getting dentists and orthodontists to move forward in a digital process. It's the growth of this marketplace that is really the material difference here. It's not individual competition in the trenches that we're focused on or concerned about how do we expand the marketplace Glen. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Thanks for the comments. Joe Hogan : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Richard Newitter : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Joe Hogan : Hi, Rich. Richard Newitter : Hi, how are you doing, Joe. Joe Hogan : Good. Richard Newitter : Wanted to just start-off, just thinking back over the 20 year journey that you had or longer than that now, you're not specifically, but just in aligners and what you've seen in your tenure and what you know before, can you \u2013 there'll probably be an inflection point moments and I'm just curious where and how kind of this COVID opportunity, which is clearly on some level creating an inflection point on some level, where that stacks up? And a year or two years from now, do you think we're going to be saying this was probably the one of the defining periods for you guys to capitalize on converting the gene segment and getting that accelerated kind of digital boost that you needed to really kind of move this market conversion opportunity in a step function fashion. I'm just trying to put it in perspective, are we kind of at the demarcation here, where this is kind of defining period for the company? Joe Hogan : Well, you know Richard this is always really \u2013 it's hard to always call it, you're asking about the tipping point. And John has a great saying you never know the tipping point until it tips, right. So, but I would tell you that, obviously in the current environment that we have right now, where infection is a concern, digital becomes predominant in that sense of doctors looking at it. But I think another good signal that you can say that this can become more permanent, what's really unusual here is take a look at iTero growing 25%, right. You see capital of goods in a situation like this are going to lag, because doctors aren't going to make that kind of a capital outlay when their businesses are under pressure. And what we saw in this case is iTero grew phenomenally and then what we know, and you see that 93% of the cases in the United States right now for ortho is coming through digitally, when you get an iTero scanner into an office whether it's a GP or ortho they become really committed on the digital piece of want to learn. So I think that kind of demand for iTero scanner, what I call a hurricane right now from a doctor\u2019s cash flow standpoint really shows that they're interested in the sense of this digital transformation and want to stick with it. Richard Newitter : That's helpful. And maybe just want to follow up on the competitive comments and questions from the prior. I'm just curious, your ability to train virtually and remotely and your customer base and the advantage you have there. Are your competitors able to kind of get into the channel even as effectively as they might have otherwise been or you basically kind of converting on your own right now, I'm just curious if there's just an inherent structural advantage that you have there during this period and if competitor sales reps are allowed to say engage as actively as you are? Joe Hogan : Yes. Forgive me if I don't answer your question properly, but what I can drive from that is the importance of a sales force versus competition, and then the importance of training. And there's no company in the world that can provide digital training, whether it's virtual or if it's allowed in the future, which it will be obviously face-to-face across a number of platforms that Align can provide. ADAPT is another kind of training, ADAPT is Align Digital and Practice Transformation program that kind of experts that we put in place that understand doctors office workflow and economics, and how we can work through them. Our sales force is, since I've been in this business five years now and I've run sales forces in businesses pretty much my entire adult life. I have never seen such a high touch sales force in my life. The importance of touch with a sales team with those doctors is incredibly important because of how different digital is from a workflow standpoint, a clinical standpoint than what an analog procedure is. So there's no way around that. And then the last part is, maybe we're taking advantage of our competitors or something. And I don't say there in any arrogance or whatever, the competitions, I actually welcome it to a certain extent because it helps to legitimize a digital space. Our job broadly is how do we go and get dentists and orthodontists to move from analog to digital, not so much what the next competitor's product is out there and we're fighting for that extra ounce of share, that's not where we are right now. This is about an expensive marketplace. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Joe Hogan : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Misra : Hi team. How's it going? Hope everyone's well. Shirley Stacy : Hi, Ravi. Joe Hogan : Thank you so much. Ravi Misra : To take a pivot to G8 for a second, and remembering correctly prior versions of the systems have been seen as the step function advancements that have opened the door to more cases and more comfort with doing the system. With G8, just curious in terms of number one, how do you see it kind of increasing the addressable market for the number of cases you can treat? I mean, is this opening up doors that couldn't be done before by the sort of average dentist. And number two, do we have any sort of IP protection around this. I mean, looking at the press release, it seems like a pretty powerful set of innovations in the way you're staging it or this kind of a function or development on top of existing technologies in that sense from an IP perspective? Joe Hogan : Yes. Hey Ravi, good question. First of all, when you think of how we got the G8 is, we've done 9 million patients, right. And probably deep bite cases are 30% of those cases and G8\u2019s around deep bite. And when you do deep bite, there's a lot of extrusion in deep bite, now I don\u2019t want to get to clinically into this thing but extrusion means you're pulling the tooth down or pushing a tooth up. And those are the most difficult movements that we make. They're the hardest movements to do. When we talk about IP, it has to be with the specific kind of attachment, it's where you place that attachment. It's that interface of that attachment with the aligner and how the aligner \u2013 actually that's what we call it the activated part of this thing. And I'd say do we have IP around that? Sure, we do. Do we have IP around doing a deep bite case? No, but our products are specifically geared to be able to do that. And so we use a lot of AI and machine learning to mine that database to figure out where these deep bite cases weren't finishing as fast as they could be at times. And the new G8 supposed to make this better it's been tried in different areas. And in the end, what it does it gives doctors more confidence to be able to get into those cases and though they can finish them the way they want to finish them and that's the purpose of the product. Ravi Misra : Great. And then maybe if I can build on that. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Ravi. Joe Hogan : Yes, go ahead. Ravi Misra : Sure. So one more. So pre-pandemic, you guys were on a kind of case growth basis somewhere in the 30\u2019s, high 20\u2019s range. I appreciate that it's very difficult to look past what's going on in the world right now, but say we do kind of normalize at some point in the future post-pandemic. With these innovations and the sales force touch points that you mentioned, is that 20% to 30% case growth, given where we are on the adoption curve still a kind of reasonable proxy for where this market can go. Thanks. John Morici : Hey Ravi, this is John. Good question. When we think about the investments that we make in the \u2013 as we've described, the vastly underpenetrated market that we're in, we look at our investments to say, look, we can grow revenue in the 20% to 30% and that's how we think of things. And that's what we think that we can control the investments that we're making to be able to grow in this market to that. We didn't guide to that because there's unknowns outside of what we can control and we've kept it at that. But certainly when we look at investments in this market and the opportunities that we have, we look at those investments with the long-term growth model from a revenue standpoint of 20% to 30%. Joe Hogan : Thanks, Ravi. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ryskin : Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Yes, it's late, so I'll just keep it to one. Obviously, seeing the really strong utilization numbers in the Americas for the orthos and GPs. But obviously that's only half of the equation, because you also got the number of docs actually receiving those. So I was just wondering if you could provide any additional color on the split between ortho and GP, which really drove the volume in the quarter in the Americas. What I'm getting at is, with the rebound you commented on and some of that pent-up demand was there one part of your customer base that really accelerated better than the others or was it pretty broad based? John Morici : Yes. I can take that, Michael. This is John. Really when we look at the utilization and the growth that we saw was very broad, it was across GP and ortho. It was across multiple-tiers. We just saw a good adoption of our technology as these practices opened. Patients ask for it by name, doctors used our product. There were many doctors that were higher up on the tiers accelerated their cases. And then even new doctors or doctors that are at lower tiers were able to increase the utilization. So, we're very happy with the results that we saw from newer doctors to more experienced doctors and felt really good about how they were in that recovery mode. As we said, it's tough to understand and break out the piece of how much is pent-up demand versus run rate. But as we went through the quarter, as we said, we got stronger and stronger. So we feel good about the situation that we left Q3 with. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Michael. We've got time for one more question, operator. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Shirley Stacy : Hey, Jason. Jason Bednar : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Hi, there. Congrats on a nice quarter, everyone. Have a clarification question just real quick and then another I'll ask upfront here. Just that enhanced momentum building comment that you made for October, Joe, can you just confirm that holds for all major reporting channels you have with GPs and orthodontists? And then, I know it's early days for iGo Plus, but curious if you could just talk about initial feedback on the system in the first markets you entered in Europe, any learnings you can draw on the early days of that launch before you look to take that system and do additional markets? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Yes, Jason. First of all, I can confirm that it's across all channels, all markets. There's nothing really like in sight, it's not with that momentum that we \u2013 on iPro Plus, iPro Plus is about just enhancing the ability of doctors that are on iPro to be able to do more enhanced cases. And the feedback is great. We started in Europe, because that's where iPro really started from in a big way. And those are the first doctors that really asked for that. And then as and we've rolled that out in general. And it's really on the back of like the ClinCheck 6.0, the cloud-type-based product that we've done. That's one of the great things about digital platforms because you can expand them to be able to fit specifically in different markets at different times. And that's what iPro Plus really represents. So, I hope that helps, Jason. Jason Bednar : Yes. Thanks, Joe. Joe Hogan : Yes. Take care. Operator : There are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to hand it back to management. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your time today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations and we look forward to speaking to you at our Investor Day, November 23rd. Have a great night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the fourth quarter and full year, then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. John will provide more detail on our financial results and share additional color on business trends. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year with record revenues and volumes from both Invisalign aligners and iTero scanners, as well as increased gross margins, operating margins, EPS and cash flow. Our fourth quarter performance is driven by strong year-over-year growth across customer channels and regions and continued momentum sequentially. During the quarter, we achieved a major milestone in EMEA with the shipment to our 2 millionth Invisalign patient that will be amplified with the EMEA-wide campaign that will launch next month. This milestone from reflects strong acceleration in Invisalign adoption and growth. For Q4, total revenues were $834.5 million, up 13.7% sequentially and up 28.4% year-over-year. Q4 '20 Clear Aligner revenues of $700.7 million were up 12.9% sequentially and increased 28.9% year-over-year. In Q4, we shipped a record 568,000 Invisalign cases, an increase of 14.5% sequentially and 37.3% year-over-year. Q4 reflects increased Invisalign adoption from both adults and teenagers, which were up 36.7% and 38.7% year-over-year respectively. Our Teen and Mom-focused consumer campaign generated 77% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and 76% increase in leads generation. In addition, Invisalign social media influencers like Charli D' Amelio, Marsai Martin, Christina Milian, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Rachel Zoe, Tiffany Ma, and Tahj Mowry continued to deliver exciting new content and increased engagement for the Invisalign brand with consumers and among their millions of followers. Our digital platform continues to gain traction as doctors uses of iTero scanners increase. Our Consumer and Patient app was rolled out to more than 50 markets, resulting in more than a 2.5 times increase in apps download and monthly active users in 2020 versus a year ago. Our patient feature usage continues to increase, for example, Invisalign Virtual appointment was used 68,000 times. Our insurance verification feature was used 26,000 times and more than 30,000 patients enrolled in Invisalign Virtual Care in 2020. Our new consumer website was rolled out to more than 40 markets around the world and is driving increased effectiveness in lead generation. We also launched an improved new doctor recruitment website in the U.S. and Canada to support our digital conversion journey. This will be expanded to other markets in the next few months. From a product perspective, growth was strong across Invisalign portfolio, especially for non-comprehensive cases including Invisalign Go and Invisalign Moderate. There are also more doctors engaging with us through the Align Digital and Practice Transformation or ADAPT program, as more practices are moving towards digital practice optimization. As you'll recall, ADAPT was piloted over two years ago and is being commercialized as a standalone service providing the relevant workforce, clinical and marketing support to enable doctors to digitally transform their practices. In Q4, we shipped a record 77,000 Invisalign doctors worldwide of which a record 7,300 were first time customers. We also trained over 6,400 new docs in Q4, including over 3,900 international doctors. Q4 '20 System and Services revenues of $133.8 million were up 18% sequentially driven by momentum in the Americas and EMEA, and up 26% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Our results reflect continued strong uptake of the iTero Element 5D, the only intraoral scanner with caries detection which is scaling rapidly across each region and represented approximately a third of iTero volumes in Q4. Innovation remains a cornerstone of our business. Today, we announced the availability of the iTero Element Plus Series, which expands our portfolio of iTero Element Scanners in Imaging Systems to include new solutions that serve a broader range of the dental marketplace. The new iTero Element Plus Series of scanners in Imaging Systems builds on the success of the award winning iTero Element family and offers all of the existing orthodontic and restorative digital capabilities doctors have come to rely on, plus faster processing time and advanced visualization capabilities for seamless scanning experience in a new sleek ergonomically designed package. We announced the launch of our next-gen ClinCheck Pro 6.0 proprietary treatment planning software with in-face visualization and our Invisalign G8 improved predictability in our last earnings call we announced. Their availability is being expanded across all regions. Further, we launched several enhancements to our treatment planning, including improved Final teeth position and Auto segmentation. We also added several new features to our Virtual Care tool. For the full year 2020, total net revenues were a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year. Clear Aligner revenues of $2.1 billion were up 3.7% reflecting a record $1.6 million Invisalign shipments and growth of 7.9%. During the year, 30.3% of total Invisalign cases or nearly 500,000 teens or younger started Invisalign treatment. This is up 11.5% from 2019. System and Services revenues were down slightly compared to 2019. 2020 was a year unlike any other that we've experienced. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact have been life-changing, marked by loss and separation, recovery and renewal, record highs and lows, and significant milestones and accomplishments. Even in a time of huge disruption, we all had to adapt, evaluate priorities and develop new ways of doing things both personally and professionally. Through it all, Align's priority has been the health and well-being of our employees and their families and our doctor, customers and their staff. And that remains a constant. Despite the swift onset of the pandemic and the uncertainty through 2020, we didn't hold our plans or change our strategy for continued growth. We completed the acquisition of exocad, accelerated our investments in marketing to create Invisalign brand awareness and drive consumer demand for our doctors' offices. Accelerated new technology to market with virtual tools that enable our doctors to stay connected with their patients, provided PPE to those in need and supported doctors and their teams with online education and digital forums that went beyond products to help them navigate the uncertainties of the pandemic. As a result of our continued strategic focus and investments, we exited the year stronger than we started and 2021 is off to a great start. Now, let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter starting with the Americas. With the Americas region, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 12.7% sequentially and up 34.1% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization of Invisalign treatment for both orthodontic and GP channels. Our continued investments in digital marketing and sales programs and focus on market segmentation are helping drive strong growth of Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero products. During the quarter, we continued offering sales initiatives to our doctor partners to help drive adoption of Invisalign and iTero products. The Bracket BuyBack Switch program, which we launched in North America in Q2 '20 continues to drive conversion from wires and brackets to Invisalign clear aligners. During Q4, this program resulting -- has resulted in about 10,000 new cases similar to Q3. We believe this is also causing a halo effect with patients switching from wires and brackets to Invisalign clear aligners with increased awareness of the benefits of Invisalign treatment and how it is less disruptive to their lives with the outcome of a beautiful smile through an Invisalign trained doctor. The Teen Awesomeness Centers programs direct patients to Invisalign doctors who are experts at treating teens and are seen as the go-to docs for treatment. We continue to see growth with Invisalign First for treatment in younger kids driving increased comprehensive treatments within North America Ortho channel. Latin American volume was also up year-over-year, led by strong growth in Brazil and Mexico. We believe the market for orthodontic treatment is huge in Latin America as we continue to grow our presence across the region. We saw increased utilization in the GP channel with Invisalign Go and the continued adoption of Moderate. The GP Accelerator program designed exclusively for general practitioner dentist provides an all-encompassing support plan based on practice needs that is centered around maximizing iTero integration, clinical support needs, and implementing new marketing strategies. We also see increased utilization with GP dentists that have enrolled in the iPro program as well as with doctors that have installed the iTero scanner. DSO utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driver led by Heartland and Smile Docs. For the full year, Americas Invisalign volume was up 3.6% For our International business, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 6.7% [ph], led by a strong growth in EMEA as doctors returned from summer holiday season, offset somewhat by seasonally slower period in China. On a year-over-year basis, International shipments were up 41.1%, reflecting increases throughout both EMEA and APAC. For the full year, International Invisalign volume was up 13.3%. For EMEA, Q4 volumes were up sequentially 47.9% and 48.3% on a year-over-year basis across all markets, with strong performance across both Ortho and GP channels. Within the GP channel specifically, we saw acceleration in both utilization and shipments with Invisalign Go. We also saw acceleration in both core and expansion markets, with growth in our core markets, led by Iberia, UK and France, along with continued growth in our expansion markets, led by Central and Eastern Europe and the Benelux. We introduced the Ortho Recovery 360 Program in EMEA last quarter to support our orthodontists as they started reopening their businesses. As of Q4, 3,200 orthodontists have enrolled in the program. During the quarter, we launched the Recovery II Program with a refreshed website featuring all digital tools, growth programs and education events for EMEA doctors to support their relief efforts during COVID-19. We also held our Digital Innovation Forum at the beginning of December where approximately 900 doctors, both Ortho and GP, attended the two-day forum event with keynotes on the digitization of dental practices. We also continued our Digital Excellence Series of webinars launched by the iTero team. Throughout the quarter, the following digital innovations were also launched across EMEA, Invisalign G8, ClinCheck Pro 6.0 and Invisalign Go Plus, to help drive Invisalign clear aligner utilization. To support our GP doctors, we launched our GP Recovery 360 program last quarter, with over 2,700 GPs enrolled so far. We continued to offer online and on-demand education events, which reached over 15,000 GPs cumulatively. For the full year, EMEA Invisalign volume was up 12.6%. For APAC, Q4 volumes were down sequentially 14.7%. Notwithstanding typical Q4 seasonality in China, following a strong Q3, we had strong growth in Japan and ANZ and Southeast Asia. On a year-over-year basis, APAC was up 30% compared to the prior year, reflecting continued strong growth across the region. We were pleased to see growth in the Adult segment with non-comprehensive cases with the Invisalign Moderate product in the GP channel. In the Teen segment, we also saw an increase in utilization amongst Invisalign doctors and we saw continued acceleration from Japan and ANZ. For the full year, APAC Invisalign volume was up 14.3.%. Last year, we launched a new and improved digital learning environment for our doctors offering a comprehensive learning platform with role-specific content for orthos, GPs and their teams. The improved functionality enables more online learning opportunities with spotlight features for what's trending now, recommended learning path based on doctors' experiences, and expanded categories including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry, and team education. For the year, over 127,000 doctors have accessed recorded lectures, completed self-paced learning modules, and watched how-to videos, with new certified doctors viewing more than 1.4 million pages of content. Among the ortho channel, over 47,000 unique users have engaged with the digital learning site with an additional 80,000 unique users from the GP channel. As we've mentioned, we are seeing good adoption of the ADAPT program, which is an expert and independent fee-based business consulting service offered by Align to optimize clinics' operational workflow and processes to enhance patient experience and customer and staff satisfaction, which will in turn translate into higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices. As a result, the ADAPT service participating practices in Q4 improved profitability significantly after implementation. Our consumer marketing is focused on capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles, educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to our Invisalign doctor offices. In Q4, we saw strong digital engagement globally with more than 77% increase in unique visitors, 108% increase in doc locator searches and 76% increase in leads created, driven by our global adult and mom-focused campaigns and teen-focused influencer content. Our US Mom/Teen multi-touch multimillion dollar campaign with influencer-led YouTube videos, a mom-focused TV spot, a custom Twitch activation, and mega teen sensation Charli D'Amelio continued to perform very well and garnered 2.7 billion impressions in Q4. The statistics I shared previously speak to the successful reach of this marketing campaign is having to not only drive demand with consumers, but also in educating them on the benefits of Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. In Q4, we also launched media tests in the EMEA region in the UK, Germany and France and in the APAC region in Australia and Japan. These have worked very well and resulted in a more than six-times increase in leads in EMEA and a 3-times increase in leads in APAC. Several key metrics that show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand are included in our Q4 quarterly presentation slides available on our website. Align is always looking for new opportunities to reach consumers and be relevant to potential patients wherever they work, live, and play, which is why we announced that the Invisalign brand is the Official Clear Aligner Sponsor of the National Football League, the NFL, and 11 NFL teams, including the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Kansas City Chiefs. The NFL league partnership, designed to expand our reach with consumers, generated over 150 million impressions in 2020, helping to drive awareness of Invisalign clear aligner treatment at a national level, while the team agreements are designed to help us engage within key markets and connect consumers with doctors in those markets. For our Systems and Services business, Q4 revenues were up 18% sequentially due to higher shipments and services revenues. We continued to see momentum with the iTero Element 5D Imaging System, gaining traction in all regions with significant Element Flex sales in EMEA. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were up 26% due to higher shipments and services. For the year, our Systems and Services total revenues were down 2.8% year-over-year. Cumulatively, over 31.4 million orthodontic scans and 6.7 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 84% from 79.5% in Q4 last year. International scans increased to 73.7%, up from 64.7% in the same quarter last year. We're pleased to see that within the Americas 94.8% of cases submitted by North American orthodontists were submitted digitally. We're also proud to share that iTero Element intraoral scanners are the winners of the 2020 Dentaltown Townie Choice Award for Digital Impressioning category. Also, during the quarter, the National Association of Dental Laboratories judging panel selected the iTero Element 5D as the winner of the 2020 Journal of Dental Technology WOW! Award. The award represents the recognition of our commitment to enhancing patient engagement and communications that support efficient laboratory production. For exocad, during the quarter we launched two of the largest software releases in history, DentalCAD and exoplan. DentalCAD3.0 Galway includes over 90 new features and over 80 enhanced functionalities with significant improvements to reduce design time, such as Instant Anatomic Morphing. exoplan 3.0 Galway includes over 40 new features and over 60 enhanced functionalities that support planning of edentulous cases, including the design of surgical guides. During the quarter, exocad also added two new large implant manufacturers as OEMs for exoplan in Brazil. With that, I'll now turn it over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $834.5 million, up 13.7% from the prior quarter and up 28.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of $700.7 million were up 12.9% sequentially and up 28.9% year-over-year reflecting Invisalign volume growth in all regions, partially offset by lower ASPs. Clear Aligner revenues growth was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $5 million or approximately 0.8 points sequentially and on a year-over-year basis by approximately $10.3 million or approximately 1.9 points. Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially $15 primarily due to increased revenue deferrals related to a higher mix of new cases versus additional aligners, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange, and lower promotional discounts. As we mentioned last quarter, we did not implement a price increase in 2020 given our continued commitment to helping our customers in their recovery efforts during the pandemic. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Invisalign ASPs decreased approximately $75 primarily due to our decision not to raise prices last summer, increased revenue deferrals for new cases versus additional aligners, and higher promotional discounts, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. As a result, clear aligner deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $83 million sequentially and $195 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Total Q4 Clear Aligner shipments of 568,000 cases were up 14.5% sequentially and up 37.3% year-over-year. Our System and Services revenues for the fourth quarter was $133.8 million, up 18% sequentially due to an increase in scanner sales and increased services revenues from our larger installed base and higher ASPs. Year-over-year System and Services revenue was up 26% due to higher scanner sales, services revenue, and the inclusion of exocad's CAD/CAM services, partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services deferred revenue was up 30% sequentially and up 69% year-over-year primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 73.2%, up 0.4 points sequentially and up 0.5 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to exocad, overall gross margin was 73.6% for the fourth quarter, up 0.3 points sequentially and up 0.7 points year-over-year. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.9%, up 0.1 point sequentially due to lower additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher warranty, other manufacturing costs and lower ASPs. Clear Aligner gross margin was up 0.7 points year-over-year primarily due to favorable product mix from increased iTero scanner absorption as a result of increased manufacturing volumes partially offset by lower ASPs, higher warranty costs and other manufacturing costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.2%, up 2.2 points sequentially primarily due to higher ASPs and increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher productions volumes. Systems and Services gross margin was down 0.7 points year-over-year due to lower ASPs, higher freight and other manufacturing costs partially offset by higher services revenue. Q4 operating expenses were $397.3 million, up sequentially 11.3% and up 23.8% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased marketing and media spend and spending commensurate with business growth. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $76.5 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and marketing, R&D activities, and manufacturing operations. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $372.3 million, up sequentially 12.1% and up 23.4% year-over-year due to the reasons as described earlier. Our fourth quarter operating income of $213.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.5%, up 1.4 points sequentially and up 2.3 points year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year increases in operating income and the operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to exocad, and acquisition-related costs, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 28.9%, up 0.9 points sequentially, and up 2.5 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense, net for the fourth quarter, was a benefit of $1.4 million, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange. With regards to the fourth quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 25.9% which includes tax benefits of approximately $11 million related to adjustments in prior years' unrecognized tax positions. The fourth quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 14.5% compared to 16.6% in prior quarter and 20.9% in the same quarter a year ago. The fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the third quarter's rate primarily due to the reason previously stated. Fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $2.00, up $0.24 sequentially and up $0.47 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.61 for the fourth quarter, up $0.37 sequentially and up $0.85 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $960.8 million, an increase of approximately $345.3 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations. Of our $960.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $548.3 million was held in the U.S. and $412.5 million was held by our International entities. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $657.7 million, up approximately 5% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 6 days sequentially and down approximately 5 days as compared to Q4 last year due to strong cash collections. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $381.4 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $328.3 million. Under our May 2018 Repurchase Program, we have $100 million still available for repurchase of our common stock. Before we move to the outlook, I would like to make a few comments on the full year 2020 results. In 2020, we shipped a record 1.6 million Invisalign cases, up 7.9% year-over-year. This reflects 13.3% volume growth from our International doctors and 3.6% volume growth from our Americas doctors. System and Services volumes were down 12% compared to 2019, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on equipment sales. Total revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year, with Clear Aligner revenues a record $2.1 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. 2020 Systems and Services revenues were $370.5 million, including exocad revenues from April 1, 2020 forward compared to $381 million in 2019. Full year 2020 operating income of $387.2 million, down 28.6% versus 2019 and operating margin at 15.7% versus 22.5% in 2019. 2019 operating income included a litigation benefit of $51 million and Invisalign Store closures of $23 million for a net benefit on operating margin of 1.1%. With regards to a full year tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was negative 368.6%, which includes a one-time tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion, net of current year amortization, associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to an intra-entity sale of certain intellectual property rights resulting from our corporate structure reorganization completed in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the tax benefit related to our corporate structure reorganization and the related tax effects of stock-based compensation and other non-GAAP adjustments, the full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 17.6% compared to 22% for 2019. 2020 diluted EPS was $22.41. On a non-GAAP basis, 2020 diluted EPS was $5.25. Free cash flow was $507.3 million for 2020, down $90.3 million versus 2019. Now, let me turn to our outlook. Overall, we are very pleased with our Q4 performance and the strong momentum in our business, which has continued through January for both Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. As we discussed at our Investor day in November, we are committed to making significant investments to drive growth and we are seeing good return on these investments across all regions and customer channels. These strong returns give us confidence to continue investing in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to accelerate adoption in a huge, underpenetrated market. These investments coupled with typically higher seasonal operating expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to result in a sequentially lower operating margin percent in Q1 as we have historically seen. While the global environment surrounding the pandemic remains uncertain, we will continue to focus on what we can control and we are confident in our ability to continue to execute. Our responsibility is to continue driving innovation and delivering on the needs of our customer doctors and their patients. Over the past 24 years, Align has invested billions in technology, innovation, consumer marketing and demand creation to connect millions of consumers with our doctor customers. We will continue to invest in this business to drive demand and to drive adoption of the Align Digital Platform, including manufacturing and operational expansion. We will always be responsible. Just like we've done in the past, we make investments to drive growth and maximize ROI. We remain committed to our long-term target model of 20% to 30% revenue growth for Clear Aligners and Systems and Services, and operating margin of 25% to 30%. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. The choices we made in 2020, to protect employees, support customers, and press forward on our strategy for growth, were possible because of the strength of our balance sheet and the confidence we have in our business model. Our actions reflect our conviction in the enormous opportunity we have to transform smiles and change lives. With 15 million orthodontic cases starts annually and more than 500 million consumers who can benefit from a better smile, the market for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry is massive and has been unleashed by the need for digital. In a macro sense, COVID-19 has accentuated the benefits and pervasiveness of the digital economy. From an Align standpoint, practices across every region are embracing digital treatment in new ways and more purposefully than ever before. Invisalign providers are using our virtual tools to minimize in-office appointments and deliver doctor-directed, personalized treatment that meets the needs of the moment and that will reshape the future of treatment. Digital acceleration is not just around Invisalign treatment. It includes digital workflows around iTero scanners and general dentistry. Doctors tell us that the iTero scanner is central to their practice and their practice workflows, and it is key to driving digital treatment. We've always known this, iTero and now exocad are core components of the Align Digital Platform, our integrated suite of unique, proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless, end-to-end solution for patients and consumers, orthodontists and GP dentists, and lab partners. And particularly, we now have all the building blocks to create digital workflows, leveraging the combined power of Invisalign treatment, iTero scanners, and exocad software to become more relevant to the GP market, which is critical to accessing the 500 million consumer opportunity. Align is a growth business with huge opportunities, but the environment remains uncertain due to COVID-19. Our plan is still to counter uncertainty by staying focused on our long-term strategy, living our values, supporting our employees and customers, and keeping in mind the demand drivers we've identified over the past year, the re-direction of disposable income for many consumers, channel focus that allows us to reach and support a wider range of customers within each channel. And most importantly, the digital mindset that's taking hold with more and more of our customers and that we are supporting through innovative products and programs that can help support their digital transformation. We are not ignoring the reality of COVID-19 and how long it may be part of our lives, but we're also not going to stop driving the business forward for the good of customers and their patients, our employees, and our stakeholders. In closing, I want to leave you with a few thoughts as we begin the new year. While there is considerable amount of turmoil in the world, our focus is on what we can control as a company. We have strong momentum. We'll stay focused on our strategic priorities, international expansion, patient demand and conversion, orthodontist utilization, and GP dentist treatment. In summary, we are very pleased with the fourth quarter and full year results of 2020, during a remarkable year with events beyond our control as a result of COVID-19. It is during times such as this when having a solid strategy combined with focused execution can lead to outcomes that support growth, not only for Align's business but also practice growth for Align's customers which also leads to more and more Invisalign smiles. With that, turn it over to the operator and we'll take calls. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Misra : Hi. Thanks for the question. Hi. How are you? Joe Hogan : Good. Ravi Misra : Happy New Year. So I just wanted to maybe start on -- I'll let the others maybe talk about the quarterly trends, but one of the things that kind of stood out to me was you're driving extremely strong volume growth amidst what's kind of a stable to slightly declining pricing environment. Just curious, first, when do you think you'll be able to go back to the kind of prior model where you're able to take pricing? Is that still in the cards? And then secondly, I think the teen market is an area that we've kind of always been looking at as the next leg of growth, the kind of huge market that's out there. And you're talking about some of the conversion and the lead generations. Can you help us understand kind of the conversion rates around the leads that you generate in terms of timing and how long this takes to get the ROI that is put into the advertisements that you're putting out there? Joe Hogan : Ravi, first of all, I guess, your first question is on average selling prices. We try to communicate this as strongly as we can is to keep your eyes on gross margin, because we have huge mix, whether it's international mix or it's product mix, you see a lot of progress in iGo and products like Moderate and Invisalign First in those products. The carry actually lower average selling prices, but higher margins, and so you can often mix up on those things. So I'd say as we keep emphasizing is don't be overly concerned about ASPs or focused on ASPs. Like John said, we didn't increase ASPs this year because we're interested in supporting our customers and making sure that this is difficult -- a really difficult transition for many practices right now and instituting a price increase just wouldn't have been responsible in that sense. But at the same time, we drove incredible productivity across the business and we're able to show those kind of gross margins. So I hope you and the rest of the analysts community out there can actually see that. We've been talking about this for a few years, but actually taking place. On the teen side and the conversions from an advertising standpoint, I mean, we come out just from a lot of different ways and a lot of different areas. And we -- if we are going to start teen season, you really have to start in February in the United States and you have to really work through a lot of different aspects of social media. You advertise differently for moms and you do teens and different things like that. So I can't give you a correlation coefficient in the sense of here we invest and how much we get back, but we understand as well as a business, we've been doing it for years. We understand the timing of it. And more and more we become more specific on the social advertising pieces and how to implement that properly. And John, do you have anything you want to add? John Morici : No. As you said, I mean, it's -- there's others that are in the equation. You have to reach the teen, as Joe described, and we talked about social influencers and so on. You have to reach the parents and we try that. And then also have the right formula with the doctors. So getting those three to think about going into treatment is really the key. Ravi Misra : Okay. Then maybe one last one if I can ask one more, just on the reopening and vaccination progress and kind of volumes. How are you guys kind of thinking about the consumer spending environment as the options that the patient is going to have start increasing. I mean is that going to require more investment here in the near term or do you think kind of where we're at a baseline where you've kind of gotten the ramp where things are starting to really click here with the advertising that you're doing as is? Thank you. John Morici : Yes, Ravi, it's a good question. I mean, look, we're always looking to maximize our return on investment. We talk about that to grow in this vastly underpenetrated market. In some countries like in the U.S., it's just a matter of refining how we spend. We talked about the influencers, talked about NFL and other things. And in other countries, we've really started spending some of that consumer advertising and we see a great response and we see a strong return. And those are areas that, as we see that response, we see it turn into volume, those are areas that will continue. So we're always looking at return on investment and we'll find ways to be able to grow our volume that way. Joe Hogan : Thanks, Ravi. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Jon Block : Hey, Joe. Good afternoon. Joe, you mentioned 2021 is off to a great start. From 2015 to 2019, so I'm sort of isolating pre-COVID management guidance for 1Q cases, the guidance for 1Q cases were up pretty consistently, just low single-digits off of what you did in the fourth quarter. And I guess where I'm going with this is at a high level, what's the expectation for case growth sequentially? And I'm just trying to level set as the back part of 2020 likely benefited from some pent-up demand. So just how we should think about the trend line, if you would, into the early part of 2021? Joe Hogan : Jon, I'll let John have the specifics. I would just tell you that January was a really strong orders quarter, so that momentum really continues. John Morici : And look, Jon, I think as we've said it, we're controlling what we can control, making investments that help drive this business. We look at -- as Joe said, we felt really good about how we exited Q4. We saw that in January as well, and we don't want to guide. We basically haven't because there is things that are outside of our control. And we'll leave that as it is. What we're trying to give you is kind of the latest information without projecting forward. Jon Block : Okay, fair enough. And I'll ask a quick two-part for the second one. EMEA was just gangbusters, I mean, it was up 48% of a 32% comp, shout out to Markus, but anything to call out there? I mean, the number was huge. And then the second part is teen up almost 40%, Joe. What do you think the underlying ortho market was growing? Where I'm going with this is just your conviction of sort of maybe a type of inflection point, if you would, with teen's share of share. Thanks, guys. Joe Hogan : Jon, I appreciate you bringing up EMEA, I mean, that was just an amazing performance when you see that. I've been doing business in Europe since I was 30 years and you see growth like that by countries, it's amazing. And I think that, to me, that was really a story on the fourth quarter too was the breadth of that growth. It wasn't just North America. It wasn't just Asia. It was deep across segments, across GPs, across orthos. So Jon, I'm not ready to talk about an inflection point. All I can say is when you think about, we had 77,000 doctors that ordered that I talked about in my script. And then 7,200 to 7,300 more doctors, that's 10% more doctors, that's a record for us too. So we see Invisalign, this digital treatment really catching on in a big way and it's meaningful. Look, we're gearing up for it. We're obviously advertising to drive that demand and will stay focused on just executing, Jon, right now. Jon Block : Thanks, guys. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Jon. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Steve Beuchaw : Hi. Thanks for the time here, guys. I wanted to try to understand a little bit better the relationship between some of the things that you flagged, John, in your prepared remarks as it relates to deferrals and ASP. I certainly agree with the view that gross margins are really the critical metric, but I'm sure we're going to get a lot of questions about ASP tonight and over the next couple of days. So I wonder if you could help us understand a little bit more deeply, one, why we'd be seeing more deferred revenue here both on aligners and scanners? And what's the relationship to ASP and do we see that reverse? John Morici : Yes, Steve, the basic way to think about this as we look at our revenue, we've got revenue on a new case that we ship out. And there is a certain amount that you recognize on that shipment based on our rev rec. And then there is a certain amount for future aligners or future modifications that are needed. That will be deferred revenue. And then you also get into your revenue so that those deferrals that you've made for maybe previous quarters or even previous year that as they -- that doctor needs to use that additional lines, you're going to get revenue for that. When you have a mix like we have, where there is much more, there is this demand for future volume for new cases, you get a mix where we just have a lot more as a percentage of new cases and that's what impacts ASPs. When we look at that from a margin standpoint, it's margin accretive. We're getting as new cases. Many of the cases that we get back from a deferred revenue standpoint where there's refinements we just don't make as much margin on that. You get the deferred revenue, but you don't get as much of the margin. So there is those dynamics that we have. We saw just when you have a significant volume increase like we saw in our third and fourth quarter. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Thank you, John. And then I wanted to follow-up about the GP channel. GP has been just gangbusters here lately. I wonder if I could try to understand that a little bit more deeply. One is do you think it continues to grow at the sort of clip relative to the ortho channel? Maybe two, do you think exocad has been a driver of incremental growth in that channel at this point? And then lastly, should we think about the shift to DSOs being a variable one way or another. And I apologize for my kids screaming in the background. Joe Hogan : That's the life we live now, Steve. We understand. It happens on and off like every call. From a GP channel standpoint, I mean, three years ago when we first started segmenting in Europe and now we are doing in the States and we do it all over the world. And then we introduced products like iGo that were specific to it. And just a salesforce that can communicate with GPs because it's a different conversation than with orthos. Yes, I can't tell you where it's going, but when we talk about that 500 million patients like I did in my script, that's where they are, and that's where you touch them. I mean, it's a different. It's not a big teen market. It's a lot of adults. But it has to have a workflow that's specific to a GP. And that's why we drive their products, that's why iTero is so important from a front-end standpoint. Your question on exocad is, we think that's going to be a big GP driver for us. It is a big legitimate piece for us, but I don't think it's adding to volume right now. We're just rolling out these new products. We're just starting to integrate that kind of software code into iTero and into our programs and that's certainly will drive increased penetration in the future. Steve Beuchaw : Got it. Thank you so much for all the perspective here. John Morici : Yes. Thanks, Steve. Shirley Stacy : Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird & Co. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good evening, guys. Hey, Joe. I wanted to start with -- I know it's tough and maybe there is not even a way to do it, but any way to think about especially over the last two quarters, how much of this patient volume has been backlog versus the zoom effect versus true kind of accelerating penetration of clear aligners versus brackets and wires. Just is there any way to bucket or any metrics you're looking at that tells you this is truly kind of that secular uptick we've all been waiting for versus backlog and some of the zoom effect? Joe Hogan : I think as we get further and further from the second quarter obviously the backlog question becomes less and less as part of the noise of the structure, right. I feel a lot of analysts, Jeff, they wonder, hey, we had a great third quarter obviously and it was, well, how much of that was really the second quarter that's rolled into the third. We really don't know what that was. We don't. And our doctors don't know it either as we talk to them. The fourth obviously had less of that. And we really felt good about our orders in January too. So I think we're really moving away from that question here soon. The number of docs like I just quoted with over 7,000 new docs ordering from us, 77,000 in total shows you the breadth of what's going on. And what's really struck me in this entire thing too, Jeff, is really this is not just United States, this is all over the world. It's Latin America, it's APAC. It's tremendous growth in Japan and ANZ and traditional markets, in China, in Europe. So there is breadth to this and then the segments we talked about, both GPs and orthos. So look, there have been backlog in the third quarter. There has to be some backlog in the fourth quarter or whatever. But we don't think that's the overriding story here. Jeff Johnson : Yes, that's fair. And then one other kind of maybe more a conceptual question. Just as I think about -- I think about it through your Advantages program, but are you seeing doctors that are the high volume guys, the Platinum guys moving up to Diamond and Double Diamond? Is it the lower Bronze or Gold guys moving up to Platinum? Does it matter to you which it is? But more importantly conceptually, is it getting those low volume guys to really go all in here or the high volume guys to convert completely to Invisalign? And I'm sure you're going to tell me it's a mix of both of that, but just kind of what you're seeing would be helpful there on your own customer base. Joe Hogan : Yes. You helped me answer that question, Jeff, it is a mix. But it is really broad. I mean, we see in the Bronze accounts and Golds and all the way to Diamond and Diamond Plus. And we see growth in all those segments. And I think it's kind of logical, right. The people that know how to do digital are going to expand on it, because digital really allows them to function in this COVID environment in a way that allows them fewer customer touches and they can actually carry on their practices in a normal way. Other doctors actually see the advantages of that. They have patients asking for them. And they start to move toward a digital kind of a platform. And overall, again, it's a breadth discussion. It's not just one area, it's not just one country, it's not one segment of the Advantage program. We just weren't seeing adoption across the board. And John, anything to add on that? John Morici : I'd echo this, the breadth. I mean, you have new doctors, like Joe said, 7,000 new doctors that come in with and want to do cases that come into our ecosystem and start cases. You see doctors who have done just a few cases really start to accelerate and then at the top of the pyramid, you have people that are doing a lot of cases and they do even more cases. So that's part of when we talk about the breadth of this growth and what makes it excited. And it's like Joe said, not just a U.S. phenomena, it's pretty much everywhere. Joe Hogan : And Jeff, I think the last thing you said is do you care which I thought was kind of interesting is like we really don't care. We just want to serve the doctors who want to work with us. We see this market -- we talk about how large this market is and how under-penetrated it is. And we just want to see wherever that growth is, that's great. It's on the low end, that's terrific. It's on the high end, that's terrific. We set this company up to be able to service either side to work well with them. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. I appreciate the comments. Joe Hogan : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Hey, Joe. I always thought -- obviously the -- one of the many nice parts of the quarter was the scanner and CAD/CAM revenue. Can you talk a little bit about what you sort of see as market growth there? Like where are you taking share? Is it in the GP, more on the ortho channel? Is it orthodontists adding their third scanner? Is it people finally saying, yes, I'll go digital? Obviously, the total number of cases submitted digitally was very high. Any other color you could provide there would be really helpful. Joe Hogan : Elizabeth, you could work for us, okay. You kind of described exactly how that demand is, it's coming from all these different places. And a lot of it when you say where you're taking share, a lot of is just analog share. There is so much in dentistry is still just completely analog. They're still doing impression and different pieces. And so it's the growth has been tremendous in that sense. Your question about orthodontists that start to move up into a significant part of their practice being Invisalign, you'll see -- you see a scanner at every chair. And they use these things are constantly. It's part of what they do. What we see on the GP segment is the communication tool ends up being the scanner in the front of the scanner. Because you know in the past, they'd hold up a mirror and say, can you see that, that second molar back there and you'd say, yes, but you really couldn't, right. Now, you throw it on a screen. It's live, you can see exactly what's going on. It becomes an incredible patient-communication tool in a sense of where is your dentist and what needs to be done and helps to convince patients of what the doctor wants to do and the validity of that kind of treatment. So this is where dentistry is going. And when you look at iTero, it is arguably the highest performing scanner in the world, the speed of it, the exactness of it, color rendering, and also with NIRI technology to be able to see caries or cavities is a real benefit, even to orthodontists who want to make sure that before you start the treatment that dentition is in good enough shape to able to except that kind of movement. So that's just -- this is the time for digitization inside of dentistry and iTero plays a big role in that and it front-ends our digital platform. John Morici : Especially in a COVID environment, given the fact that you don't want to have as much time for impressions and so on and you want to be able to have something that's fast and really be part of that digital workflow, this iTero lends itself well. Joe Hogan : Yes. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay, that's super helpful. And Joe, sort of like to just follow up more a housekeeping question. One, obviously you announced the new products today and I imagine that that's something you'll be talking about in sort of the virtual Chicago Midwinter and what you would have discussed a lot of it IDS. Is there anything we should keep in mind in terms of the ramp of sort of new products or impacts from IDS moving to the back half of the year? And then on the other side, obviously we saw your announcement about the move to Arizona. Sounds exciting. I just didn't know if that had any impact in terms of something we should model in on taxes or anything else just to touch on that as well. John Morici : Yes, I think I can answer the tax piece of it. No, really not a tax impact. It really came down to when we look at the campus that we have in San Jose and the expansion that we have from a technology center, we become space constraint. And so we want to keep that technology center, that innovation center in San Jose and expand that out and add more to help with that innovation. And then moving to here in Tempe for kind of that head office just made sense to us. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay, thanks. Joe Hogan : Yes, it is upon the new product pieces. Keep in mind we talked about we spend $500 million a year on advertising and also new product development, you'll see a lot of new products. We don't pace ourselves on those introductions based on IDS. And that's why we obviously announced the new iTero scanner. We talked about the new 6.0 software that we have. A lot of changes to FiPos, it's our final positioning aspect to dentition. We had the Plus product from iGo, the in-face visualization. This is a digital business that requires constant iterations in products. And obviously Midwinter and those things are great places to highlight it. But our innovation, we looked at it agile, not waterfall anymore. In the sense, waterfall used to be invent during the year, release one period of the year. More and more, you'll see us just monthly just rolling out new products as we adapt to a more kind of an agile philosophy of development than a waterfall type of -- if that's what you're asking, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Anderson : Makes total sense. Thank you so much. Joe Hogan : Yes. You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Richard Newitter : Hi, thank you for taking the questions. Just maybe to start off the Switch program, which has fairly been extremely successful for you. I'm curious to know how much more runway there is associated program, and maybe if you could just comment on kind of how you're at least thinking about that from your internal modeling? Joe Hogan : Yes, look, I think it has a huge amount of breadth to it. I mean, it's not just U.S. We started this in Japan actually years ago and introduced in the United States. And you think about -- it's just a great winner, detaching those wires and brackets from people's teeth using Invisalign, understanding, like we said, in our script, is how much more simple it is and better for people and comfortable for people to go with our product line. So we think it's -- we have a lot of room to grow and we're going to keep supporting it. John Morici : Yes. And Rich, it's John. I mean, we are always looking at those types of promotions for an ROI. And in these cases, many cases looking at it from an incremental standpoint, nothing could be more incremental than it was glued onto someone's teeth and now they come off and they go to Invisalign. So we like those dynamics there. It sends a great message. And those people who had wires and brackets on their teeth can talk about their experience with Invisalign. So there is a lot of positives to it, as Joe said, it started in Japan. And we've seen great success in the U.S. and we look to other places as well. Richard Newitter : Got it. Helpful. And Joe, you said a few times how encouraging the trends have been in January. I'm just curious, understanding it's only one month, but how well is the growth, if the trend that you're seeing now were to whole kind of for a good portion of the year, where in your long-term kind of long-range plan of 20% to 30% do you think you'd be falling towards the mid to upper end? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of what do you think in there? Joe Hogan : Nice try, Richard. Look, we're very committed to our long-term growth model 20% to 30%. That's really all I can say right now. Rich, we're in a really uncertain environment. We're happy about January. It is why we're not giving guidance. It's -- we're all living with volatility right now and we'll just continue to execute and keep our heads down, but we're committed to that 20% to 30% growth model that we've been talking about for several years. Richard Newitter : Okay, thanks. Thank you. Shirley Stacy : Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John Kreger : Hey, Joe. Just sticking with that answer, you were obviously above that in terms of volumes in the fourth quarter. How do you feel about your ability to deliver on that if the order flow were sustained? In terms of fabrication and fulfillment, how are those metrics holding up at this point? Joe Hogan : Our supply chains, we try to keep ahead in that sense. So, I feel we have adequate plans and capacity right now to be able to handle the surge in demand. John Kreger : Great. Okay. And then, John, I think you've talked about in the past a reasonable assumption is kind of a flattish ASP, and realized there's a lot of puts and takes. But is that still a reasonable kind of planning thing for us? Or are you guys thinking less on the pricing front, and, therefore, maybe more of a downward trend over the coming year? John Morici : It's tough because it really becomes kind of the end result, because if you have more primary cases as I spoke compared to secondaries, you can get some of these impacts in ASPs. I think, in general, there is not a significant change that we would expect in some of the mix or some of that some of that pricing. So that being said, you wouldn't expect too much fluctuations in ASPs. But like I said, it depends on that demand that comes forward from our doctors. John Kreger : Got it, okay. And then one more, Joe, sorry, in a typical year, we'd assume kind of teens would be big in Q3 and adults would be bigger in Q4. Is that same sort of seasonal pattern likely do you think in '21 given what we know now, or would you expect kind of teen order flow to be more kind of spread evenly throughout the year. Joe Hogan : Hey, John, we don't know. But I'd say it became muted this year. Obviously, we saw as much stronger fourth quarter United States in teens than we saw -- that you normally see from a seasonal standpoint, it got continued. So I think all of us are expecting summer and fall months as COVID to start to retreat a little bit, that might take us back to the patterns that we had before. But I don't think it's going to be binary. I really don't, I think this could have changed the pattern. We're just going to have to -- we're going to have to just ride the curve here and see how it goes. But we'll continue to advertise through this to execute on a place that we talked about in our scripts and we've really feel confident we can continue to drive significant teen demand. John Kreger : Great, thank you. Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. Shirley Stacy : Operator, we'll take one or two more questions please. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Jason Bednar : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here. Congrats on another really strong quarter. I appreciate all the details you discussed. Maybe building off some of the real-time commentary you shared at the end of your prepared remarks there, Joe, just curious if you can expand on what you're seeing in January for maybe a utilization perspective, maybe in the context of where we were October through December, any notable call-outs in January from a good geographic perspective or teens or adults? Joe Hogan : I think the call-out, Jason, really is just the breadth of it really. There wasn't any geography in particular that dominated or it was just in segment to GP and ortho continued to be strong. So when you exit a year and you're at our new year, you're obviously glued to that month to see, especially in a business like this, what the momentum is and we just see a continuation of the strong momentum that we had in the fourth quarter. That's -- John, anything to add on that. John Morici : I think the breadth of it is my note on this that we have across geographies between GP and orthos. And what we described is a lot of doctors that are higher-up in the tier, they're continuing to do a lot of volume, and then a lot of new doctors that come in that come in with cases in hand. And we can get them to start the Invisalign system into our digital ecosystem. So, that continued from Q4 into Q1. Jason Bednar : Okay. That's helpful, guys. And then just focusing on China here just for a quick moment. There wasn't a great deal of discussion probably less in this call than maybe any other call in recent memory on China in particular. But impression, the seasonality that happens here in the fourth quarter, but maybe just wondering if you can expand on what you're seeing with your business and the Clear Aligner market in China specifically and maybe compare that against some of your other APAC markets. Joe Hogan : Yes, we felt good about our growth in China 26% for the quarter overall. China, we see shutdowns periodically, issues in Shanghai or different places and Chinese are pretty draconian, I'd use the move is when they COVID, they move pretty quickly. The public hospitals have been throttled to certain extent unlike the procedures. But we feel good about the quarter and we feel, honestly, our investments in China, we really feel good about those. The manufacturing piece helps legitimizes us our IT systems from a data protection standpoint have to be geared towards China. We're in good shape with that. We're assembling iTero there now. We feel great about our training centers, great about our treatment planning capabilities. So overall, we remain bullish on China and we think that China will start to, with the rest of the world, will start to recover in the second half of next year too and we expect to be a big part of that. Jason Bednar : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Shirley Stacy : Operator, we'll take one more question, please. I know we went over. Operator : Okay. Our last question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Rich : Hey, Joe. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Obviously, results over the past couple of quarters have been really strong. I guess, when we look out to 2021, it's tough to know what happens with COVID, but hopefully we'll start to get back to normal life later this year or 2022. I think as we look at where consensus is modeled I think on a high-teens revenue growth. It seems like you still feel comfortable with the 20% to 30% target. So do you feel like we should be expecting that type of growth in line with the long-term range off of this new higher level of volumes that you're starting to see in the back half of this year. Joe Hogan : Nathan, that's -- we try to emphasize as much as we can, we feel very confident about those 20% to 30% ranges of growth. And continue to target 25, 30% operating profit to in order to do that. So you'll see us in investor rates that John talked about we're putting in place to drive that demand. So we make -- we remain committed to that model growth. John Morici : And it starts with the vastly under-penetrated market and the investment opportunities we talk about. We tried to give you a kind of the breadth of all the different levers that we have to pull to be able to drive that return. And we continue to make that. It changes over time in terms of how we invest and where and so on, but that, that belief is still there. And when we make those forward investments, we're invested into that under-penetrated market that we think we can grow 22% in and do it at a 25%-plus op margin rate. Joe Hogan : Yes. Nathan Rich : Great. Well, congratulations on the strong quarter. Joe Hogan : Thanks a lot, Nathan. I appreciate it Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Nate. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact our Investor Relations department. And we look forward to following up with you at upcoming conferences and virtual events. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the first quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.  I'm pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenues and volumes reflecting strong growth for both Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero Systems and Services across products and customer channels worldwide. Q1 sequential Invisalign Clear Aligner growth was driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments across products, customer channels, especially in North America and the EMEA region. The year is off to a great start, and Q1 reflects increasing momentum and the benefit from continued investments in our strategic initiatives focusing on : expanding our operations globally in existing and emerging international markets; increasing ortho adoption and utilization of Invisalign treatment, especially with teens; training and education GP dentists; an increasing conversion to Clear Aligners; and building Invisalign brand preference with millions of consumers through advertising, PR, digital, social media and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion through Invisalign-trained doctors.  For Q1, total revenues were $894.8 million, up 7.2% sequentially and 62.4% year-over-year. Q1 System and Services were $141.5 million, up 5.8% sequentially and up 104% year-over-year. Q1 '21 Clear Aligner revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5% sequentially and increased of 56.4% year-over-year.  In Q1, we shipped a record 595,800 Invisalign cases, an increase of 4.9% sequentially and 65.8% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to a record 78,600 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 6,600 were first-time customers.  During the quarter, we reached a significant milestone with our 10 millionth Invisalign patient, Gabriela Silva, who recently began our treatment with Dr. Eunice Blind, an Invisalign-trained orthodontist in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, one of our fastest-growing country markets. It's remarkable to think about the pace of growth and adoption that we are experiencing worldwide, especially when considering it took 10 years to achieve our 1 millionth Invisalign patient milestone and now we're adding 1 million new Invisalign patients in less than 6 months. We're grateful to our doctor partners and their patients and to our 20,000 employees around the world who have helped us reach this milestone. In recognition of our 10 millionth Invisalign milestone, we have donated $10 million to the Align Foundation donor-advised fund, are kicking off a campaign called 10 Million Smiles, 10 Million Thanks centered around the transformative power of Invisalign treatment through the eyes of Invisalign patients.  From a product perspective, Q1 clear aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio for both comprehensive and noncomprehensive products. Q1 comp volume increased 4.9% sequentially and 62.3% year-over-year, and Q1 non-comp or noncomprehensive volume increased 5.0% sequentially and 74.4% year-over-year. Invisalign Clear Aligners address a wide range of case complexity and can treat approximately 90% of case starts for adults and teens and phase 1 treatment for kids as young as 6 years old. Q1 adult patients increased 5.8% sequentially and 68.5% year-over-year. Q1 teens or younger patients increased 2.7% sequentially, 58.9% year-over-year. Teenage cases made up nearly 75% of the 15 million ortho starts each year and despite our rapid growth and adoption, Invisalign treatment is still only single digits worldwide, so we continue to see significant runway here.  Our strong Q1 results also reflect our multimillion-dollar consumer marketing investment across key media channels with broad reach to drive consumers to Invisalign doctor practices. Our teen and mom-focused consumer campaign generated 138% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and 35% increase in leads generated. In addition, Invisalign social media influencers like Charli D'Amelio, Avani Gregg, and Tan France and many other content creators/influencers enabled a delivery of 4.2 billion impressions in Q1 '21, delivering exciting new content and increased engagement for the Invisalign brand among their millions of followers. The consumer insights and data we receive from our programs suggest adults are also continuing to invest more in themselves for their overall health and well-being and have more disposable income to do so. They are seeking Invisalign clear aligner treatment from our Invisalign doctors and sharing their positive experiences with their friends, family and social networks, becoming influencers themselves.  Now let's turn to the specifics around our first quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q1 was another strong quarter with Invisalign case volume up 8.4% sequentially and 53.8% year-over-year reflecting increased Invisalign submitters and utilization growth for both orthodontic and GP channels. Q1 results also reflect continued investment in digital marketing, sales programs, our channel focus around GPs, orthos and DSOs and other initiatives to help drive utilization. In the GP channel, Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go continue to gain traction. This was especially true for GP dentists that enrolled in the iPro program as well as doctors that have installed iTero scanners. The GP Accelerator program, designed exclusively for GPs, provides an all-encompassing support plan based on practice needs that is centered around maximizing iTero integration, clinical support needs and implementing new marketing strategies. DSO utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driver and outpaced non-DSO practices.  Today, we announced that we have extended our relationship with DECA Dental Group and have signed a new multiyear agreement for the Invisalign System through early 2025. In addition, DECA Dental Group is extending utilization of iTero Element 5D imaging system across its affiliate practices in the United States. This provides DECA Dental doctors and clinical support team members with access to Align's customized clinical education for the Invisalign system and the iTero Element 5D imaging system to support practices in adopting new workflows for restorative dentistry and for digital orthodontics.  In the ortho channel, the Teen Awesomeness Centers program direct patients to Invisalign doctors who are experts are treating teens and are seen as the go-to doctors in their markets, helping to drive increased comprehensive treatments within the North American ortho channel. Tomorrow, registration opens for the 2021 Teen Forum : Virtual Edition to be held on June 10 and 11, which combines 2 days of all new dynamic sessions focused on the Invisalign teen patient journey. Sessions will focus on building clinical confidence, efficient workflows, teen and parent conversion and the overall digital treatment experience that teens expect. The timing of the forum is designed as a strong lead to the busy teen season, and attendees will have the option, at the post forum mentoring by Invisalign teen experts, to help orthos and their staff apply the tools from the teen forum to their practices and get additional support through their busy summer.  For our international business, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 0.9%. On a year-over-year basis, international shipments were up 83.2%. In EMEA, Q1 volumes were sequentially 3.7%, up 74.9% year-over-year, with strong broad-based growth across all markets, led by the U.K., France and Italy, along with continued growth in our expansion markets, led by Turkey, Russia, CIS and Benelux. We also saw strong performance from both ortho and GP channels, with momentum in the GP channels with adults reflected in strong utilization in shipments from Invisalign Go. EMEA growth programs are customized by market and customers' type to encourage Invisalign utilization, such as Professional 360 Ortho and Advance 360 Ortho programs with over 2,000 orthodontist enrolled. We also had GP Move 360, a program design to be able to help move doctors along their developmental journey, with an increase in GP cohorts of over 117% compared to a prior year. We're also continuing to offer online and on-demand education events, which have reached over 15,000 GPs cumulatively.  In the region, we hosted several successful summits and forums for Invisalign doctors this quarter in all- virtual formats : the U.K. GP Forum and Ortho Summit, French Ortho Summit and the iTero Element Plus launch media event. In addition, we just held the Italian and DACH or German Ortho Summits last week.  International expansion remains one of our key strategic pillars. Last week, we announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in Poland, which will be our first Aligner plant in the EMEA region and our third plant worldwide joining Juarez, Mexico and Ziyang, China. The new facility is expected to be supplying customers in the EMEA region in early 2022, helping address the large and relatively untapped market of more than 5 million annual orthodontic case starts and more than 150 million EMEA customers who could benefit from treatment. The investment is part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to our customers and reflects our commitment to Invisalign-trained doctors and their patients in the EMEA region and extends our local operations in the region. The state-of-the-art EMEA plant in Wroclaw is expected to have more than 2,500 jobs by the end of 2025, making it the company's largest investment in EMEA to date and the largest 3D printing operation in the region.  For APAC, Q1 volumes were down sequentially 3.9% as expected, reflecting seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, APAC was up 101.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting continued strong growth across the region, led by China, Japan and ANZ. Invisalign volume growth drivers were young adults, with young kids ramping faster than any other age group. In the teen segment, Invisalign volumes accelerated during the quarter and were driven by increased Invisalign utilization and case submissions from Invisalign doctors. We also continue to see good adoption of the Invisalign Moderate product for noncomprehensive treatment in the GP channel. During the quarter, we continued to offer online and on-demand education events which reached over 14,000 GPs cumulatively.  Invisalign volumes in China were flat sequentially and up over 200% year-over-year. In Q1, China volumes gained momentum throughout the quarter. The Align clinical education site is the go-to digital hub for Invisalign doctors and team education and training. The digital learning environment was relaunched in February 2020 for Invisalign doctors, offering a comprehensive learning platform with role-specific content for orthos, GPs and their teams. The site enables more online learning opportunities with spotlight features for what's trending now, recommended learning paths based on doctors' experiences and expanded categories, including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry and team education.  During the quarter, over 102,000 unique users, having accessed the records lecture, completed self-paced learning modules and watched how-to videos, viewing more than 3 million pages of learning content. On the Ortho channel, over 38,000 unique users have engaged with a digital learning site and additional 63,000 unique users from the GP channel.  We also continue to see good adoption of the ADAPT program, which is an expert and independent fee-based business consulting service offered by Align to optimize clinics' operational workflow and processes to enhance patient experience, customer and staff satisfaction. As a result of the ADAPT service, practices experience higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices as well as improved profitability after implementation. To date, we've seen a 50% increase in Invisalign cases among doctors' cohorts within 6 months of participation in the ADAPT program. In addition, while still early in the program, we're also seeing a strong correlation or halo effect on teen utilization among ADAPT doctor cohorts.  On consumer marketing, this focuses on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to our Invisalign doctor offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles.  In Q1, we continue to see strong digital engagement globally with more than 138% increase in unique visitors, 95% increase in doctor locator searches and 35% increase in leads created on a year-over-year basis, driven by our global adult and mom-focused campaigns and teen-focused influencer content. Our U.S. Mom/Teen multitouch, multimillion-dollar campaign with influencer-led YouTube videos, a mom-focused TV spot, a custom Twitch activation and mega teen sensations such as Charli D'Amelio and Avani Gregg continued to perform well and garnered 4.2 billion impressions in Q1.  The statistics I shared previously speak to the continued success this marketing campaign is having to not only drive demand with consumers but also educate them on the benefits of Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office.  The Align Digital Platform continues to gain traction globally. Our consumer and patient app, My Invisalign, is now available in 58 markets, resulting in a more than 4x increase in app downloads and 3x increase in patients actively using our app in Q1 '21 versus the same period a year ago. Our consumer and patient feature usage continues to increase. For example, Invisalign Virtual Appointment Tool was used 86,000 times and our insurance verification feature was used 27,000 times in Q1. Further, we received more than 575,000 patient photos in our Virtual Care feature to date globally, providing us rich data to leverage our AI capabilities to improve our services for doctors and patients.  Lastly, our new consumer website has been rolled out to more than 50 markets and continues to drive increased effectiveness in lead creation. In the EMEA region, we built on the tremendous success we saw with the consumer marketing pilot in Q4 in the U.K. and expanded our media investments across the U.K., Germany and France to drive engagements, resulting in more than 335% increase in unique visitors and a 95% increase in leads.  We also expanded our consumer advertising in the APAC region in Australia, Japan and China, and saw more than a 2,000% increase in consumer engagement and a 298% increase in leads. Several key metrics that show increased activity engagement with Invisalign brand are included in our Q1 quarterly presentation slides available on our website.  Our NFL partnership continues to do well, generating over 23.5 million impressions during the quarter. It continues to be another major integral channel to reach adults considering clear aligner treatment through an Invisalign-trained doctor. During the quarter, we expanded our sports partnership marketing strategy with the Invisalign brand named the official smile partner of the Golden State Warriors. As part of the agreement with the 6x NBA Champion Golden State Warriors, the Invisalign brand also is the official smile partner of the Santa Cruz Warriors, the Golden State's G League affiliate, and the Golden Guardians, its e-sport affiliate. The sponsorship includes an omnichannel activation across TV, digital media, social, a jersey partnership with the Golden Guardians and the Santa Cruz Warriors.  Finally, on the consumer marketing front, we also launched our first ever social purpose initiative in Q1 called Invisalign ChangeMakers, an award program we developed in partnership with the National 4-H Council. This is to celebrate and highlight teens in making an impact in their communities. We were blown away by the number of recommendations and stories we received about teens, from redistributing excess food to combat hunger in their communities, to donating weighted blankets to those in the autism spectrum. Overall, it's been heartwarming to learn about each of these amazing teenagers who bring a unique approach to positively impacting their communities and following their passions to create change.  In total, we received nearly 800 ChangeMakers applications. On June 28, we will announce 100 winners, each of whom will receive $5,000 to help them continue their goodwill efforts. We'll also celebrate these young forces of change with a virtual ceremony currently slated for mid-July. We are continuing to invest in creating consumer demand for Invisalign Aligners in markets around the world. Our global campaigns include a multichannel media strategy using digital video, social media, influencer marketing and TV.  For our Systems and Services business, Q1 revenues were up 5.8% sequentially, reflecting slightly lower scanner volume following a record fourth quarter. This is primarily due to the seasonality of capital equipment sales at year-end and higher services revenue. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were up 104%, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. The iTero Element 5D Imaging System continues to gain traction across all regions. Element 5D is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3D intra-oral optical impressions, 2D color images and Near Infrared Images or NIRI technology. Full arch scans can be completed in as little as 60 seconds, and NIRI technology scans the structure of the tooth in real-time without harmful radiation, acting as digital aid for detection of interproximal caries, or cavities, above the gingiva line.  In APAC, the Element Flex is doing well with its wand-only configuration that provides needed mobility so doctors can see patients anywhere they choose and also or perform full arch scans in even the smallest office.  During the quarter, we announced availability of the iTero Element Plus series, which expands the iTero portfolio to serve a broad range of the dental market. The new Element Plus series offers faster processing time, advanced visualization capabilities for a seamless scanning experience in a new sleek ergonomically-designed package. It's also engineered with the latest computing power, a dedicated AI chip and new AI-based features as well as an easy upgrade path for future innovation.  In terms of digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions in Q1, total digital scans increased to 80.9% from 75.8% in Q1 last year. International scans increased to 75.1%, up from 68.7% in the same quarter last year. For the Americas, 85.5% of the cases submitted digitally compared to 80.5% a year ago. Cumulatively, over 35.4 million orthodontic scans and 7.5 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners.  Turning to exocad. A year ago in April, we welcomed exocad into the Align family. I want to thank the entire team for their continued progress on integration and road map development. Together, we are working to extend exocad's position as a key technology provider for the dental CAD/CAM industry and to drive continuous innovation with the open and integrated approach that is the foundation of exocad. During Q1, the new release of exocad's DentalCAD3.0 Galway was successfully rolled out globally with very positive customer feedback. A record number of over 70,000 verified prosthetic components were created in DentalCAD Galway, one of the largest prosthetic libraries in the industry.  exocad also reached a new milestone for the exoplan database, which now supports nearly 10,000 implants from over 90 manufacturers. The new release also includes a unique and highly innovative DentalCAD feature, Instant Anatomic Morphing, that reduces design time by up to 30% compared to previous version. It also includes new AI technology for exocad's Smile Creator, which enables time-saving automatic detection of facial features. In addition, the new MyiTero Connector was launched directly to exocad labs. The MyiTero Connector creates an easy and integrated way to receive intra-oral scan cases from thousands of iTero doctors worldwide. New cases are downloaded automatically and will show up directly in the DentalDB case list.  exocad also co-hosted a joint dentistry event in the U.K. to showcase full workflow with ChairsideCAD titled Digital Dentistry Hands On. The virtual roadshow aimed at general dentists showcases a full digital workflow for the clinical environment with ChairsideCAD, exocad's complete open architecture CAD software platform for single-visit dentistry. Hosted by Dr. Gulshan Murgai, the participants of the roadshow series learn how to use the software for single-visit restorations and implant planning in the dental practice along the entire digital dentistry workflow.  These are just a few milestones, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead to shape the dental industry with technology and expertise that benefits all customers, labs, partners and users. We look forward to sharing more about ongoing exocad developments. With that, I'll now turn it over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $894.8 million, up 7.2% from the prior quarter and up 62.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5% sequentially and up 56.4% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in most geographies. Clear Aligner revenue growth was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $14.4 million or approximately 2.1 points sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, by approximately $22.3 million or approximately 4.6 points.  For Q1, Invisalign Comprehensive and Non-Comprehensive ASPs were both up sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign Comprehensive and Non-Comprehensive ASP decreased. Overall, on a sequential and year-over-year basis, ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, ASPs were impacted by higher net revenue deferrals in all regions and higher promotional discounts. Clear aligner deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $79 million sequentially and $256 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Total Q1 clear aligner shipments of 595,800 cases were up 4.9% sequentially and up 65.8% year-over-year.  Our Systems and Services revenues for the first quarter was a record $141.5 million, up 5.8% sequentially due to product mix and increased services revenues from our larger installed base and exocad's CAD/CAM services. Year-over-year, Systems and Services revenues was up 104% due to higher scanner shipments and services and the inclusion of exocad's CAD/CAM services from the April 2020 acquisition and increased services from our larger installed base.  Our Systems and Services deferred revenue was up 17% sequentially and up 102% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 75.7%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.1 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 76.1% for the first quarter and up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.2 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points sequentially and 0.7 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange.  Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 77.6%, up 2.7 points sequentially due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, higher ASPs and lower freight, partially offset by higher additional aligner volume. Clear Aligner gross margin was up 4.6 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and lower freight, partially offset by lower ASPs.  Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was a record 65.4%, up 1.2 points sequentially, primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and higher ASPs, partially offset by increased freight. Systems and Services gross margin was up 3.6 points year-over-year due to manufacturing efficiencies from increased volume, higher ASPs and services revenues.  Q1 operating expenses were $451.7 million, up sequentially 13.7% and up 39.2% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased compensation, primarily from additional headcount and incentive compensation, consumer marketing spend and other general and administrative costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $127.2 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth.  On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition and acquisition costs related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $424.8 million, up sequentially 14.1% and up 40.9% year-over-year.  Our first quarter operating income of $225.4 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.2%, down 0.3 points sequentially and up 12.5 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is attributed to operational investments. The year-over-year increase in operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, the acquisition costs related to our exocad acquisition, operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6%, down 0.4 points sequentially and up 11.5 points year-over-year. Our operating margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points sequentially and 1.5 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange.  Interest and other income and expense, net, for the first quarter was a gain of $36.2 million, primarily driven by the SDC arbitration award gain. Excluding the SDC arbitration award gain, interest and other income and expense, net, was a $7.2 million expense on a non-GAAP basis.  With regards to the first quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 23.4%, which includes tax expense of approximately $11 million related to U.S. taxes on the SDC arbitration award received and approximately $14 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our GAAP tax rate this quarter was lower than the prior quarter rate of 25.9%, primarily due to the higher excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by foreign income taxes at different rates.  Our GAAP tax rate was higher than the same quarter last year, which was negative 2,745%, primarily due to a onetime tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion associated with our corporate structure reorganization completed during the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 20.2% compared to 14.5% in prior quarter and 33.2% in the prior year. The first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was higher than the prior quarter rate, primarily due to lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates. In comparison to prior year, the non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was lower primarily due to higher tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates.  First quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, up $0.51 sequentially and down $16.70 compared to prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.49 for the first quarter, down $0.12 sequentially and up $1.76 year-over-year.  Moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately $170.9 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to cash flow from operations. Of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $684.4 million was held in the U.S. and $447.3 million was held by our international entities.  Q1 accounts receivable balance was $719 million, up approximately 9.3% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 72 days, up approximately 1 day sequentially and down approximately 15 days as compared to Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $227.2 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $43.4 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $183.8 million.  We also have $300 million available under our revolving line of credit. Under our May 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock.  Now let me turn to our outlook. Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and our continued strong momentum across regions and customer channels. It has been over a year since the pandemic began, and I want to briefly recap the actions we took to support our employees by protecting employee jobs and salaries and by supporting our customers with PPE, extended payment terms, training and many other areas of assistance.  Instead of going quiet, we accelerated our investments in marketing to drive consumer demand to our doctors' offices and stay top of mind with consumers. We accelerated our digital technology investments so that we could provide virtual tools to our doctors, enabling them to stay connected with their patients and keep their treatment moving forward. We continued to grow the business, increased our investments in R&D and product innovation and developing our plans for manufacturing expansion in EMEA. We did all these things for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders because we believe in the industry and the size of the market opportunity. Our results are the outcome of our conviction in our business model, focus and ability to execute.  While there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and global environment, the strength in our business reflects the purposeful decisions we made through the pandemic and fuels our confidence in continuing to invest into growth to drive demand and conversion globally.  Q2 is off to a great start and momentum has continued through April. Consumer demand trends and patient traffic across the dental industry are favorable and continue to improve. Given these factors and the positive trends we continue to see across the business, we believe it is important to share our current outlook and provide guidance for the full year. Note that the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to any supply constraints.  With that, let's turn to our full year 2021 outlook and the factors that inform our view. We have growing confidence in our digital platform and how it is driving growth across all regions and market segments. We expect 2021 revenues of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion, up 50% to 58% year-over-year. Consistent with past years, we expect second half revenue to make up more than half of the full year revenue, and our second half revenue to grow year-over-year around the midpoint of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%.  As discussed during our last earnings call, we are increasing our investments in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to continue to drive our growth programs and accelerate adoption in a vastly underpenetrated market. On a GAAP basis, we anticipate 2021 and operating margin to be between 23.5% and 24.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization.  In addition, during Q2 '21, we expect to repurchase $100 million of our common stock through either open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement we intend to enter into on or prior to May 3, 2021. The repurchase is intended to complete the $600 million stock repurchase authorization announced on May 23, 2018.  For 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in a new manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland, our first one in the EMEA region. We intend to fund these needs with cash generated from operations. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. In summary, we're very pleased with the first quarter results of 2021. Our strong growth and continued momentum reflect our strategic initiatives and investments, including support for doctors to ensure treatment and business continuity, ramping availability of virtual tools to keep doctors and patients connected throughout treatment and increased consumer marketing and concierge programs. The benefits of digital treatment and digital tools and the limitations of outdated old analog approaches continue to drive adoption of Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero scanners and services. Over the past year, more doctors have experienced Align's digital platform, which made it possible for thousands of Invisalign practices and patients to continue treatments throughout global disruption, thanks to Invisalign aligners, digital treatment planning, virtual monitoring and care as well as iTero scanners.  But the shift from traditional analog wires and brackets to a fully end-to-end digital platform is not easy, cannot be done without very complex technology. And this technology is prevalent, touching every aspect of what we do from manufacturing excellence where we currently manufacture over 700,000 unique aligners per day, to expanding our geographic footprint to over 100 markets, to building a network of over 200,000 trained Invisalign doctors and providing the technology to our doctors in a complete digital system, the Aligned digital platform.  As the market leader in the clear aligner space, we have been building this industry over 24 years to get to where it is today and yet the majority of the market opportunity remains largely untapped. With over 500 million potential case starts globally, Align is in a rare position to address this market with the Align Digital Platform, powered by 2 decades of clinical data based on more than 10.2 million patients with AI machine learning and digital tools to help our doctors efficiently communicate with their patients, show and explain any issues and visualize potential treatment outcomes. And together with doctors, we're going to leverage the power of digital dentistry and orthodontics more than ever.  We remain focused on our strategic execution, agility, customer service excellence and continuing to make investments to grow our business to drive utilization of the Invisalign system, ultimately returning value to our shareholders. This is the multi-variable equation that we talk about and there's no other company in the market today that has all these capabilities combined.  Finally, throughout the pandemic, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and their families and our doctor customers and their staff, and that has not changed. We remain dedicated to their well-being, and I want to reiterate our commitment to all Invisalign practices and our employees around the world, especially those in areas recently affected by a surge in COVID-19: India, Brazil, France, Poland, Ukraine, Mexico, Thailand and Japan. We are continuing to monitor the situations and are providing support and resources to those impacted employees.  Thanks for your time today. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Maybe starting with the guidance for the year and your expectations over the balance of the year. I appreciate the detail that you gave. I guess, should we think about the revenue cadence as being similar to a normal year? And Joe, I mean, it certainly seems like the shift in market share that you've been highlighting has accelerated during the pandemic. I guess I'd be curious to know if you have any way of kind of quantifying the magnitude of this shift as we think about the ability of -- you just kind of sustain this momentum going forward and the gains that obviously Clear Aligners has had during the pandemic. Joseph Hogan : All right. Nathan, we're obviously optimistic. I mean, given the guidance we had today and the strong first quarter results, we really feel good about where we are. The great thing about this growth is it's been broad and deep, okay? It is across every region. We see it whether it's in APAC, or whether it's EMEA, whether it's in the Americas overall. And then across the GP spectrum, across the ortho spectrum, too, it's been terrific. And it's also up and down. That's why we're giving you comprehensive, noncomprehensive now, all different kinds of cases.  So we just feel great about the demand patterns, the depth and breadth of this rebound and that's why we have some clarity now. We decided to give guidance, and we're excited about this year and going forward. John, any thoughts on it? John Morici : And to add to your question, Nathan, the seasonality and things that we've seen in the past will continue. We would expect those to continue as we go through this year. So it's hard to compare year-over-year, especially in the first half. But going forward, it makes sense to look at it quarter-over-quarter. Nathan Rich : Great. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up on the -- it seems like it's going to -- there's going to be more discussion around comprehensive versus noncomprehensive instead of the regional breakout going forward. So I was wondering if you could just level set us on the current mix of business between comprehensive and non-comprehensive cases. And how you're thinking about the growth of those two categories going forward? John Morici : Yes. When you look at it, Nathan, it's about 75% comprehensive, 25% noncomprehensive. It can vary by quarter based on teen season and so on, but that's roughly the split there. And we're investing in both areas to be able to grow, whether it's on the ortho side or the GP side for those categories. Joseph Hogan : And Nate, I think you know the margin on those products also. So there's not -- this is not like a margin split. I mean, you still have higher margins on the less than comprehensive product line, too. So it's a good mix. Operator : The next question is from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Jason Bednar : Congrats on a really nice quarter here. I actually want to start on guidance as well. If I focus in the second half of the year, maybe when comps tend to normalize a bit and use the midpoint of that 20% to 30% long-term guide you've got out there. Are you able to talk about how this comes together from a regional or channel perspective? Is it safe to assume that teens international still grows above that mid-20s level? And then is it right to think about imaging and CAD/CAM growing at that mid-20s level as well? John Morici : Jason, this is John. We would look at Invisalign and our System and Services to grow at that midpoint in the second half, so around that 25% year-over-year across the business. And we're making investments and continued investments, as we've talked about, to really establish and continue our growth. Jason Bednar : Okay. And John, just sorry, anything from a regional or channel perspective, international or teens or just how that all comes together? John Morici : I think we're not forecasting by each of the regions and so on from that. I think you can -- from our business, we're trying to grow teens. It's a great indicator for the penetration on the ortho side, and we'll continue to grow that, but not giving specifics by region. Jason Bednar : Okay. Understood. And then just one other follow-up. I mean, the Clear Aligner gross margin was extremely strong this quarter. The Clear Aligner revenue, that grew $50 million sequentially with COGS that fell by $10 million. John, I know you stepped through some of the factors just incorporated there. But is this a sustainable level that we should be thinking about for Clear Aligner gross margin going forward, kind of in this upper 70s level? Or maybe were there some other factors that helped push that gross margin higher here just in the first quarter? John Morici : Well, we did see some FX benefit, as we called out, but it's a reflection of investing in this business, adding capacity, adding in places where we see the growth, and this was leveraging some of that -- those investments. So it's a reflection of the work that we have, the productivity that we can drive across the business, utilizing some of the facilities that we have and then benefit a bit from FX on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Operator : The next question is from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : Congrats on a nice quarter. Can you talk about any changes in your DSO strategy? I know you obviously, highlighted the DECA renewal in the quarter, but I just didn't know if there -- as we come out of COVID, anything to think about there in terms of how you're working with that group of customers? Joseph Hogan : No, Elizabeth, actually, we do, we can. We bring the entire Align digital platform together with iTero, the different -- some DSOs want to approach this thing from a comprehensive standpoint, some want noncomprehensive. So we just basically gear our digital platform and our product line based on what a DSO wants to do and what they want to accomplish, and not just in the U.S. but really all over the world. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. That's helpful. And then in terms of the new facility in Poland, should we think about the potential impact on the gross margin line to be similar to when you open the Ziyang facility? Or is there a different way that you -- that this one is different? John Morici : I think when we look at that, we'll leverage to ramp up that facility as fast as possible as a lot of volume can come through from EMEA. So I wouldn't look at that as a model for that. Remember what we did in China was a temporary facility to move to a greenfield, and this is a greenfield new facility to start with. Operator : The next question is from Jon Block from Stifel. Jonathan Block : Joe, nice quarter. Two relatively quick ones. I guess to start, Joe, you called out EMEA and North America as the primary case volume, call it, upside drivers, not APAC. And just maybe if you could talk to APAC a little bit more. It was sort of first in COVID, and I think everyone was thinking first in, first out, but it seems like EMEA has been stronger. I mean, it was on a 2-year stack basis despite all the headline stuff that we hear in EMEA. Any details on APAC? Obviously, you've got a pretty big competitor in China. Any more granularity there would be very helpful. And then I've got a little bit of a tighter follow-up. Joseph Hogan : Jon, first of all, I mean, EMEA was amazing in that way, but I wouldn't let it eclipse APAC, right? We feel really good about APAC across the board. China, obviously, being a big area, the sequential growth of China. When you look at fourth quarter versus first quarter, it's right in that 7%, 7.5% range like the entire business is. And then obviously, APAC is extremely diverse, but from Japan, ANZ, those key areas that we have in APAC, it's really strong growth.  So I really feel great about APAC. It's just there's somewhat of an eclipse right now because EMEA was extremely strong. But you shouldn't let yourself think in any way that, that means APAC was weak in some way. We feel good about APAC as we go into the first quarter and the whole year. Jonathan Block : Okay. Yes, I guess, good problem to have. Second one is sort of a derivative of Nathan's question. But the biggest question I get from investors is this pull-forward of demand, right? In other words, is the 1Q '21 volume, call it, success, is that at the expense of future quarters? And it seems like your guidance suggests you're not too worried about that, Joe. But can you give us more detail here? Like why aren't you worried about any pull-forward? What are you hearing from sales reps? What are docs saying about sustaining the momentum throughout the year? Joseph Hogan : Yes, John. John, first of all, it's the breadth of this growth, right? It's not like it's a singular region like we just talked about with EMEA and APAC and how strong the Americas is. We're seeing great uptake in the GP side. We see terrific growth there, the orthodontic side. You see our team numbers are good and respectable. We're moving in the teen season.  So what we feel good about is just the breadth and depth of this business. It's not just leaning on 1 or 2 legs from a strategy standpoint, it really is well positioned going forward. We hear the same thing about demand pull-forward or whatever. We -- doctors aren't talking like that. Remember, the questions back in the third quarter, fourth quarter was backlog, right? How much of this was backlog that wasn't consummated in second quarter, early third quarter. And we got way past that. Obviously, we got into the fourth quarter, whatever. So I think we're just seeing a realization in the adult and the teen market of what digital orthodontics can do. And our company is very well positioned to take advantage of that when you look throughout the world. John, anything to add? John Morici : Okay. Operator : The next question is from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin Caliendo : I want to talk a little bit about how to think about seasonality with regards to teens. You typically -- you gear up the summer, it's a big teen season historically. Has there -- do you expect that again next year as sort of back-to-school might be a little more normal? And what -- how should we think about you gearing up for another incremental teen season? What might be different? Any expectations around incremental share for teens? I'd just love to hear the strategy. Joseph Hogan : Well, I think we have a strategy really based on every region because the teen season is different by region from a calendar standpoint. And doctors apply our technology in different ways with teens. But let's just take U.S. and Canada for a second.  Obviously, in the second quarter, beginning of third quarter, those are the really strong areas where you'll see our advertising program really kick in, in a big way. We talked about the Teen Awesomeness Centers that we put in place. That's with making sure that we have doctors that are really well-equipped to handle teens, and we direct the leads to that teams with confidence that they can be serviced properly.  Overseas, we understand what those timing are for the teens also, and we put those programs together, too. Honestly, Kevin, we have a great portfolio, right? And we can go across teens in a lot of different ways, all the way from 6 year olds, to really older teens when you get to 16 to 19 years old, and the tooth movements associated with those two. So it's just having those doctors ready. It's having the communications with the teens and the moms to make sure they're aware of a digital orthodontic option, and they really ask for that as they go into the doctors. And that's a strategy we apply just in different ways and different seasons around the world, but it specifically applies to teens. Kevin Caliendo : That's helpful. And one -- just one follow-up on margins. The gross margin number was mentioned. You covered that already. Should we think about any of that flowing down to the operating margin? Or any sort of target for operating margins over the next couple of years? You've historically always looked to spend to grow, and it's always -- you've always been rewarded for it. There's no reason to change. But just thinking sort of where you are now, maybe if you do have a little bit of an uptick in the gross margin that you can let more of it flow through to the operating side. How do you think about that? John Morici : I think when you look at it -- Kevin, this is John. I mean, we're looking to balance our growth opportunities with our margin. And in certain countries, you might be at different parts of that equation. But on balance, we're pleased with the gross margin. We've talked a lot about the investments, the productivity and other things that we see, and that continues. And it gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to invest.  But in a vastly underpenetrated market that we're in, making these investments to grow volume make a lot of sense to us. But we're always mindful of that balance between volume and margin. Operator : The next question is from Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital Markets. Ravi Misra : So just want to press a little bit more on kind of just some of the marketing opportunities that you're highlighting. And just curious, you have the ski team now, you're talking about the Golden State Warriors. I'm sure Draymond Green is not very happy about that. But just can you help us understand, like, what do you go after when you look at the marketing opportunity? Like in terms of the return that you're searching for the particular brands that you're aligning with? And then I have a follow-up after that. Joseph Hogan : We do a lot of work on this, just figuring out what channels, what kind of return we get by channel, how much you put in social media, sports team, how much do you put in television. But overall, John and I expect a certain return, and we know what those returns are by region. We invest a dollar here, we know what we get back.  I don't necessarily want to convey exactly what those returns are but we make sure they're positive. And you've seen us increase our advertising pretty dramatically outside the United States. The response for that has been really good. And obviously, we use a lot of what we learned here in North America to apply that around the world.  So Invisalign is an incredibly well-known brand, not just in North America, but all around the world. And being to leverage that and having that as kind of a common name around the world, it's very helpful for us in the sense of driving volumes, giving doctors confidence and patients confidence, too.  So we really feel good about our investments. And obviously, we balance that well with increased salespeople, with technology investments, all the things you have to do when you run a business like this, but it is something that obviously gains a lot of attention and a lot of analysis from us. Ravi Misra : Great. And then maybe just one on -- on the press release, something caught my eye around your kind of Ortho Summit Case Shoot-out where the highest vote was around kind of a Class II/Class III Invisalign case presentation. Historically, that's been something -- I think maybe -- that unless you're a bleeding edge KOL or doctor that you weren't doing. The fact that, that's kind of winning the kind of peer award now, does that suggest that you're getting deeper into these more complicated cases?  And just more specifically, do you feel that you have an edge versus your competitors in the space that allow you to do this? Or is this kind of a class effect that you think has to do with comfort and ease of use of the technology as a whole? Joseph Hogan : Yes, Ravi, it's a good question. Look, remember, we have -- we've done, what, we said 10.2 million cases. And through those 10.2 million cases, we've learned a lot, and we learn more every day. And we run AI and machine learning across those cases. And that's how we just launched GA, as we understood and defined cases. We have some issues with posterior open bite and different clinical kind of issues that would bore you to death, but we understand based on millions of cases that we have done, which is the best way to move those teeth to ensure that they end up in the right positions with the right smile at -- obviously, you want to do this as quickly as you possibly can because patients don't want to be in treatment over 5 years.  So I feel we have an incredible advantage. You look at SmartTrack, you look at how we initiate that with over 4 million lines of codes that we have in ClinCheck. You look at the accuracy of iTero in the sense of transferring information through over to our manufacturing facility in order to make this. It's so -- and I feel very confident about a 24-year first-mover advantage on what we've done.  Now obviously, there's competitors out there and competitors are coming up. But a lot of them have to crawl through the friction that we did in order to learn this. And a lot of the IP that we've put down that makes us unique in the sense of how we position ourselves in the marketplace. So back to what you started with, when you do these shoot-outs and all, it's really great to sit in the audience and look at the before and after photos. I mean it's amazing. When I first joined this business, I just said, I -- hard to believe that you can do this.  What's happening today is it's becoming more common. I mean you go all around the world. It was -- it's not 1 or 2 doctors doing this. There's hundreds, if not thousands, that are doing incredible kinds of cases. And so -- which I think that more and more, it just lends credibility to this product line. It can do what we say now 90% of all the cases that are out there. That's not just because it's plastic, right? It is the whole system from how we 3D print, what plastic we use, the algorithms we use, how we constantly tweak it by the information that we have, driving a brand like this, having the kind of training. We talked about 200,000 doctors that we've trained who've gone through these things. This takes time to do, it takes expertise. And doctors need that confidence in understanding. And we feel we can give it to them better than anyone. John Morici : And that technology is brought about by investments, and we'll invest over $250 million this year alone in R&D to improve our systems and Invisalign for our customers. And that's an advantage. It's an advantage, like Joe said, over a period of time, but we're continuing to invest to make things better and better for our customers. Operator : The next question is from Richard Newitter from SVB Leerink. Jaime Morgan : This is Jaime on for Rich. Just one question for me. Appreciating that you guys are obviously focused on driving higher ortho teen utilization, overall GP adoption at the same time. I'm just curious, in your view, which of the 2 is likely to be the bigger make-or-break driver of growth over the near to intermediate term? Joseph Hogan : You know, it just sounds like a terrible answer to you, but they're both. Really, we talk about 500 million patients out there that could use Invisalign treatment. We know that of the 15 million orthodontic cases, roughly 75% to 80% are teens -- I mean all those -- they're both huge opportunities. And there's not a difference from a technology standpoint or how you apply that technology to either of those that would make one easier to do or more beneficial than another. So honestly, both of those are great reservoirs of growth for us. Jaime Morgan : Got it. Okay. And then just... Joseph Hogan : Go ahead, Jaime. Jaime Morgan : One last one for me, just on the DSO. Kind of the business model and strategy that you guys have for entrenching iTero systems in DSOs across all practices, kind of how do you approach that? And when you do see DSOs where the large majority of their practices have adopt the iTero scanner, what's the sort of pickup that you guys see in terms of utilization? Joseph Hogan : Well, where you use iTero scanners, you train the doctors properly, you have the right products in a GP channel like iGo and different products like that. We get terrific uptake. I mean, you can't measure it the way you do share a chair at the orthodontic office. But we get -- our DSO business is significant now. It's meaningful that way. And it's one where that digital platform strategy, as you kind of outlined in your question, is what we employ. But again, we employ it in different ways, depending on how a DSO really wants to engage with us. Operator : Next question is from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Jeffrey Johnson : John, I want to go back. You mentioned the $250 million in R&D. And I think the number we've discussed over the last, I don't know, probably somewhere in the last 6 or 9 months or so, it's like $500 million total of what you guys spend, not only on R&D, but channel support, advertising, social media, all that stuff. And on our mind, that's one of your bigger barriers to entry, even probably more so than some of the IP and what have you.  But it sounds like with some of the stuff, you're taking up EMEA, you're taking up APAC advertising, more and more sports teams and things like that. Is that $500 million number a dated number at this point? Is that barrier to entry and that spend even going well above that number in the near to intermediate term? John Morici : You will see that. That's a good question, Jeff. We talked about that at our last Investor Day, about the $500 million combined kind of the marketing go-to-market plus the R&D. And what you'll see is as in success. And we've talked about a lot, as you know, where we see returns, where we see volume, where we see profitability, we're going to continue to make those investments. So as we go through this year, that number will most likely go up as we find success in these investments and find that right return. Jeffrey Johnson : Yes. Fair enough. And Joe, I'd be interested. I mean, we saw COVID case counts and restrictions even in the 1Q in some of the markets you called out in EMEA as being so strong, U.K., France. I'm sure some others, you called out other areas. Obviously. India that we're all watching closely, but a lot of other markets as well that are still dealing with COVID case counts and heightened risks there.  Does that even matter to case shipments to Invisalign at this point? I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, is that stuff holding back some volumes that could come through next year? Are we all just with COVID fatigue still comfortable going in and getting Clear Aligner cases even in those markets? So is COVID a risk factor, I guess, that you've had to build in some caution in the guidance for in some of those markets? Or are cases just as strong in those markets as they are in markets where maybe COVID is a little more under control? Joseph Hogan : Yes. Jeff, it's a good question. It's just what we've seen. There's one definitive. If offices are shut down and patients aren't allowed to go to offices, we saw that. That happened in the second quarter, it happened all around the world. And then the term lockdown is used very loosely all around the world, what's a lockdown and what isn't. The situations like in India right now are a disaster, obviously, and people are very cautious. But the rest of the way around the world, what we see is it looks like communities and people have been able to manage this, okay? Is there any kind of a backlog of patients not going into dental offices because of that? I think in certain countries around the world, there is, but we can't really quantify that right now. And again, the breadth and depth of our demand pattern gives us confidence that we think we can predict around it. Operator : The next question is from Erin Wright from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Erin Wright : Great. Can you speak a little bit about what you're doing differently in terms of promotions or other initiatives around iTero that's really resonating with customers maybe differently now? And where is the traction mostly tied to, on the ortho or GP channel? And do you anticipate any lumpiness quarter-to-quarter across that business? Joseph Hogan : Yes. Well, iTero's been great for us, right? You have a good services business there. We announced the Plus series iTero, which is -- Erin, it's a breakthrough. I mean, it sounds like it's a derivative as far as incremental but it is really a strong platform. We talk about the artificial intelligence we've been able to embed in that machine. We see doctors, both on the GP side and the orthodontic side, really excited about it. This is not a promotional discussion in a sense of when you ask your question about how to promote it. There's nothing tricky there. What we do is we have a broad number of products. You have the NIRI product plus, which is the very high end of the product line. Then you have a flex system, which I mentioned in my opening, which is basically a wand itself and it's used with the -- a normal kind of a computer that's adapted to that. And it helps to get flexibility in the sense of what a customer wants to use or a doctor wants to use on both ends.  So I feel it's like how we take this to market, the different products that we have and the different way that we segment that is -- and then, obviously, if you want to do Invisalign, this is the front end, the key end of our digital platform and that's very attractive to both GPs and orthos that really want to do Invisalign. They know that iTero is critical for that. Operator : The next question is from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : John, maybe just a two part question around guidance. The operating margin outlook would suggest your margins kind of moderate a bit over the balance of the year from 1Q levels. Can you sort of elaborate on your expectations for gross margins for the balance of the year? And then what should we -- how should we think about the trend of ASPs over the next few quarters? I'd just leave it there. John Morici : Yes. Brandon, when we look at -- we're pleased with our gross margin and margins that we had in the first quarter. A lot of things came together on that. When we look at the investments and the growth opportunities we have, we're not giving specific guidance around our gross margin. What you can see as it translates to op margins, it's a reflection of the growth opportunities we have, the investment opportunities that we have to be able to invest and grow in this business. And we can update as we go forward based on what we see.  Your other part of the question regarding kind of ASPs and so on. When you look at -- we have a breakout, and we show that on a regular basis between comprehensive and noncomprehensive. We don't expect any major fluctuation across our ASPs. The only thing that comes up, and we saw it in this quarter a bit was with currency changes. But in terms of the promotions and how we go about the business and how we're trying to drive growth, there's nothing out of the ordinary that would impact ASPs. Operator : The next question is from John Kreger from William Blair. John Kreger : I just wanted to follow-up on Jeff's question a bit. So if you move beyond office closures, as you look at certain regions of the world becoming hot spots and then that fading, does that impact demand levels that you're seeing? Joseph Hogan : It's not a great answer for us, John, it's yes and no, okay? Depending on the severity and where it is, I can say yes. For the most part, we say no. And that's after the second quarter when, again, the definitive piece, if you shut offices down and you won't let patients in there, we're going to have an issue. But actually, after the second quarter, early third quarter, we've been dealing with lockdowns that are basically lockdowns of time frame, lockdowns of where people can travel, but not specific lockdowns of doctor offices. If the market stays away from that, we feel we're pretty good. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, John. Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : The next question is from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : I'll just ask a quick one. Sort of want to expand a little bit on the ASP question that was just asked. I'm just wondering, you cited a little bit in your prepared remarks in terms of promotional things like that, discounts. Are you referring specifically to the Advantage program? And if you could talk about how some of the orthos and GPs are falling in with those tiers. Have you seen any movement over the last couple of quarters where people are falling more into the platinum and the diamond grouping there? Kind of also backing into sort of the numbers on utilization between ortho, I've seen some really nice numbers the last couple of quarters. Is that indicative of that, a higher portion of orthos and GPs falling at those higher tiers and therefore, walking in those -- the higher promotional discounts? John Morici : Yes. Certainly, that is an impact. When you have -- as doctors grow through the tiers, they become more proficient. They had taken on more cases, whether they're on the ortho side or the GP side, we see them work their way through tiers. They do more cases, then we get that volume benefit. And then they'll see those discounts there. We've had those programs in place. Those programs really help drive utilization and really talk to the utilization growth that you noted there. So those are programs that we've had. They're there to drive utilization, and it's something that we've used in our business and expect to continue to use. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Shirley Stacy for closing remarks. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your time. We look forward to seeing you or speaking with you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings and events. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact our Investor Relations department. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the second quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. I'm pleased to report our first $1 billion revenue quarter with record volumes reflecting continued momentum from both Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. For Q2, Systems and Services revenues reflect strong growth across all regions and the strategic value of the iTero business with continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D Plus Series of next-generation scanners and imaging systems which launched in February. Increasingly, doctors are seeing the strategic impact and value of iTero scanners in their practices. In addition to its role in Invisalign case submissions, it is a true workhorse and digital enabler in every type of practice and across every type of orthodontic and restorative workflow. Q2 sequential Clear Aligner volumes were primarily driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments and across customer channels and regions, especially from the Americas and EMEA regions, reflecting the expanding opportunity for Invisalign treatment among adults globally, as well as the underlying orthodontic market as we continue to build awareness of the Invisalign brand and drive utilization among teens and younger patients. For Q2 '21, Invisalign Clear Aligner volumes for teens were up 9.5% sequentially and 156% year-over-year to 181,000 teens, representing one-third of total cases shipped, with strong growth from North America and EMEA orthodontists. During the quarter, we hosted several team-focused, peer-to-peer events designed to build clinical competence in teen treatment and highlight the teen digital treatment journey with Invisalign treatment.  The recent APAC Virtual Symposium featured leading providers focusing on clinical excellence with teen treatment, and North America hosted the Invisalign Teen forum; Virtual Edition for Invisalign doctors bringing together clinical speakers, digital industry experts and teen patient panelists to share their insights.  In May, Align focused on the Align Digital Platform at the 2021 AAO annual session, featuring a dynamic virtual line-up of Invisalign doctors describing how they have grown their practices through adoption of digital technology. Our Q2 results also reflect the positive impact of our investments in consumer marketing, generating billions of impressions and 33% year-over-year increase in leads for Invisalign doctors. During the quarter, we launched the next phase of our Mom/Teen multi-touch campaign, as well as the new \u201cInvis is a Powerful Thing\u201d campaign designed to engage teens and young adults.  We also deepened our partnership with influencers like Charli D'Amelio with the first limited-edition aligner case as part of our new e-Commerce initiative featuring custom cases, cleaning and oral care products, as well as accessories like Invisalign Stickables, all of which are available on Invisalign.com.  These and other consumer initiatives are important in supporting doctors\u2019 practices especially through the busy summer teen season and beyond. They also build on our investments in digital technology and innovation that are the foundation of the Align Digital Platform, including integrated digital workflows and virtual tools designed to improve clinical confidence, treatment efficiency, and patient outcomes. A year ago, we released Invisalign Virtual Appointment and Invisalign Virtual Care tools within our My Invisalign app, in response to the global pandemic to enable Invisalign doctors to provide continuity of care for their patients. Today, Invisalign Virtual Care is available globally in 60 markets and the My Invisalign app has been downloaded 1 million times with Invisalign patients worldwide.  It was recently recognized as the \u201cBest Virtual Care Platform\u201d by the MedTech Breakthrough Awards program and as \u201cDigital Innovation of the Year\u201d by Healthcare Asia Medtech Awards. As part of Invisalign Virtual Care, patients use My Invisalign app to stay engaged with their treatment and convey progress photos to their doctor, fostering two-way communication with their doctor throughout their Invisalign treatment journey. Now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q2 was another strong quarter with Invisalign case volumes up 11% sequentially and 261% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region especially in the United States and Canada, from both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, and increased Invisalign utilization from orthodontic and GP channels. DSO utilization continues to be a strong growth driver as well, led by Heartland and Smile Docs. For our international business, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 12.7% on a year-over-year basis. International shipments were up 149%. For EMEA, Q2 volumes were up sequentially 17% and 265% year-over-year with broad-based growth across all markets, led by Iberia, UK, and Italy along with continued growth in our expansion markets. In Q2, growth from both channels was strong, with orthodontic channel growth reflecting increased Invisalign utilization, and GP channel growth driven by increased Invisalign submitters. For Q2, EMEA growth also reflects adoption of the Invisalign First product, designed to treat a broad range of teeth straightening issues in growing children, from simple to complex, including crowding, spacing, and narrow dental arches.  Aiding in treatment engagement for those younger patients, Invisalign Stickables are innovative accessories designed exclusively for use with the patented SmartTrack material in Invisalign clear systems. Available in an array of designs, colors, shapes, and themes, Invisalign Stickables are a fun way for patients to show their personal style during Invisalign treatment. During the quarter, we also hosted a successful virtual edition of GP Growth Summit attended by over 1,200 doctors from the EMEA region. For APAC, Q2 volumes were up sequentially 4.8% and 50% on a year year-over-year basis, reflecting growth across the region, led by Japan, China and ANZ, despite new and extended COVID restrictions in several APAC markets. APAC performance reflects strength in GP Channel with increased Invisalign submitters, especially in Japan which continues to deliver strong growth. During the quarter, we hosted our China Forum, attended by over 1,500 doctors from private clinics, our APAC Virtual Symposium, attended by 1,400 doctors as well as the China Public Hospital Forum in June. Our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to Invisalign doctors\u2019 offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. We have provided many of our key metrics that show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand in our Q2 quarterly presentation slides available on aligntech.com. In Q2, we launched the next generation of \u201cInvis Is\u201d multi-touch campaign driving reach and awareness with adult, mom and teen consumers yielding more than 200% growth in visitors globally to our Web sites and more than 82% increase in searches for an Invisalign trained doctor. Leading with the Invis is Not Your Parents Braces campaign, we connected with teens, utilizing digital media such as YouTube, Twitch, and social media. We also continued with our Invisalign ChangeMakers program that celebrated and recognized teens driving change in their communities which was covered by multiple media outlets such as Elite Daily, Refinery29, Yahoo! Unwind, Hollywood Life, SheKnows, J-14, Yahoo Finance, Parents.com, Glamour and NewBeauty and generated more than 600 million impressions. In the EMEA region, our new marketing campaign to drive engagement, \u201cInvis is a powerful thing,\u201d went live in the UK, Germany, and France during the quarter resulting in more than 170% year-over-year increase in unique visitors and 136% year-over-year increase in doctor locater searches. We will continue to roll out the campaign to additional markets in the region during the third quarter. We continued to expand our consumer advertising in the APAC region in Australia, Japan, and China and saw more than an 800% increase in consumer engagement and a 55% year-over-year increase in leads. Lastly, we continue to build strong relationships with global search and social media giants like Google, Snapchat, and TikTok in order to further leverage our best-in-class consumer demand programs more effective globally. These partners recognize the power of the Invisalign brand and are helping us amplify and gain efficiencies from our investments. For our Systems and Services business, Q2 revenues were up 20% sequentially and up 214% year-over-year reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. The iTero Element 5D Plus Imaging System continues to gain traction across all regions with strong adoption with new customers in the APAC and EMEA regions and with existing customers in the Americas region. In APAC, the iTero Element 2 intraoral scanner did well during the quarter, helping to transform digital workflows and chairside consults for doctors. During the quarter, we announced a new iTero Workflow 2.0 software and previewed auto-upload functionality in the iTero Element 5D Imaging System. The iTero Workflow 2.0 software advanced features, including faster scanning, improved visualization, and enhanced patient communication tools, were rolled out regionally in all markets where the iTero Element Plus imaging systems were sold. The iTero Element 5D imaging system auto-upload feature will eliminate steps and streamline Invisalign case submissions with intraoral color scan images that can be used in place of traditional intraoral photos. The auto-upload functionality is scheduled for release during the third quarter of 2021. There is great symmetry between Systems and Services business with Clear Aligner business reflected in the positive correlation between the deployment of scanners and the increased utilization of Invisalign Clear Aligners. In terms of digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions, total digital scans in Q2 increased to 82.2% from 78.5% in Q2 last year. International scans increased to 76.2%, up from 72% in the same quarter last year. For the Americas, 86.6% of cases were submitted digitally compared to 86% a year ago. Cumulatively, over 40.1 million orthodontic scans and 8.4 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. I\u2019m also pleased to share that Align received regulatory approval for the iTero 5D Plus series in Japan on July 1, with a formal launch event planned for August. Turning to exocad. During the quarter, exocad launched the Creator Center, the new exocad one-stop-shop for online and in-person educational events with a database consisting of 35 educational webinars showcasing the highlights and add-on features of exocad\u2019s software solutions, DentalCAD Galway 3.0 and exoplan 3.0 Galway. More than 2,500 users and distributors have been trained on the new software releases worldwide. exocad also expanded their market coverage with a new global OEM partner, Ivoclar Vivadent, or we call IV, one of the largest manufacturers in the dental industry. This strategic collaboration will give exocad access to thousands of new IV users worldwide and will also provide exocad users with access to production processes with removable prosthetics in the future. Earlier this month, exocad has released PartialCAD 3.0 Galway, its module for removable partial denture frameworks, which has new and advanced features for the design of high quality partial dentures. This new release enhances digital CAD/CAM possibilities for exocad users and dental technicians by providing simpler design solutions for complex cases. PartialCAD 3.0 Galway provides both experts and new users with smooth, improved integration with DentalCAD, exocad\u2019s leading software for dental laboratories. Bringing the iTero and exocad businesses together makes us more viable within the GP segment and more relevant in day-to-day comprehensive dentistry for our customers. The combination of Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero scanners have long provided a seamless workflow for orthodontic treatment.  The integration of exocad\u2019s expertise in restorative dentistry and implantology, guided surgery and smile design takes the Align technology portfolio beyond our established footprint in orthodontics to ortho-restorative and restorative treatment, and paves the way for new, cross-disciplinary workflows that span from visualization and treatment planning to lab production to chairside. exocad also broadens Align\u2019s platform reach in digital dentistry with over 200 partners and more than 40,000 licenses installed worldwide. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Let me begin by reminding everyone that for Align and many companies, Q2 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19 business disruptions, and comparisons of our results for Q2 2021 should be considered accordingly. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1 billion, up 13% from the prior quarter and up 186.9% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q2 revenues of $841 million were up 11.6% sequentially and up 181.9% year-over-year reflecting Invisalign volume growth in most geographies. In Q2, we shipped a record 665.6 thousand Invisalign cases, an increase of 11.7% sequentially and 200% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped a record 83.5 thousand Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7.2 thousand were first-time customers. Q2 Clear Aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio for both Comprehensive and non-Comprehensive products. Q2 Comprehensive volume increased 11.4% sequentially and 181.9% year-over-year. And Q2 non-Comprehensive volume increased 12.3% sequentially driven by strength in Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go and up 251.7% year-over-year. Q2 adult patients increased 12.6% sequentially and 220.4% year-over-year. In Q2, teens or younger patients increased 9.5% sequentially and 156.3% year-over-year. Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.4 million or approximately 0.5 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $36.7 million or approximately 12.3 points. For Q2, Invisalign Comprehensive ASPs decreased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign Comprehensive ASPs reflect higher discounts, credits, and foreign exchange, partially offset by regional mix. On a year-over-year basis, Comprehensive ASPs reflect the increase in net revenue deferrals for new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments partially offset by foreign exchange.  Recall Q2 2020 ASPs increased as a result of more additional aligner shipments as doctors were focused on maintaining treatment progress for existing Invisalign patients. This trend reversed itself after practices reopened in Q3 and demand for new cases ramped up significantly. Q2 Invisalign non-Comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and were flat year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-Comprehensive ASPs reflect lower discounts partially offset by foreign exchange.  On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-Comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange offset by higher mix of new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments. Clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $101 million sequentially and $337 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.  Our System and Services revenues for the second quarter were a record $169.8 million, up 20% sequentially and up 214.7% year-over-year. The increase sequentially and year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, higher ASP and increased services revenues from our larger installed base. Our Systems and Services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up 22% sequentially and up 135% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 75%, down 0.6 points sequentially and up 11.4 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 75.4% for the second quarter, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 11 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange and relatively unchanged sequentially. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 76.9%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher freight costs and slightly lower ASPs. Clear Aligner gross margin was 12.4 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was a record 65.9%, up 0.5 points sequentially primarily due to higher ASPs, partially offset by manufacturing variances and higher freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin was up 6.6 points year-over-year due to higher ASPs and services revenues, in addition to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs. Q2 operating expenses were $489.6 million, up sequentially 8.4% and up 64.7% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased consumer marketing spend, increased compensation related to additional headcount and higher commissions, and other general and administrative costs.  Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $192.3 million, reflecting our continued investment in marketing and sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $461.2 million, up sequentially 8.6% and up 73.6% year-over-year due to the reasons described above. Our second quarter operating income of $268.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 26.6%, up 1.4 points versus prior quarter and up 47.3 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin was attributable primarily to operational leverage. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to higher gross margin and operating leverage as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximate 1.8 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, operating margin for the second quarter was 29.8%, up 1.2 points sequentially, and up 40.8 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense, net for the second quarter was a loss of 0.1 million, down sequentially by $36.3 million primarily due to the SDC arbitration award gain recorded in the first quarter. With regards to the second quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 25.7%, which was higher than the prior quarter rate of 23.4% primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our GAAP tax rate was lower than the same quarter last year, which was 44.8%, primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower rates. The second quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 19.5% compared to 20.2% in the prior quarter and 27.8% in the prior year. The second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the prior quarter and the second quarter of the prior year rates due to foreign income taxed at lower rates. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, flat sequentially and up $3.03 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $3.04 for the second quarter, up $0.55 sequentially and up $3.39 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, flat sequentially. Of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $551 million was held in the U.S. and $535.3 million was held by our international entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $808.1 million, up approximately 12.4% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 72 days, flat sequentially and down approximately 49.1 days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $317.5 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $124.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $193.3 million. We also have $300 million available under our revolving line of credit. Under our $1 Billion repurchase program announced in May 2021, we have $900 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. Now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our continued strong performance across regions, customer channels and products.  While there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and increasing restrictions related to COVID-19 in certain geographies, we are continuing to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, including sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity, to drive demand and conversion globally and are confident in our competitive position and ability to execute.  At the same time, we are also anticipating more pronounced summer seasonality across all regions than we have experienced in recent years, as doctors, their staff and patients take long overdue vacations. Notwithstanding seasonality, given our strong performance and continued confidence in the huge market opportunity, our industry leadership and our ability to execute, we are increasing our 2021 revenue guidance provided in April on the Q1 '21 earnings call to a range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. Additionally, we now expect our second half year-over-year revenue growth rate to be above the midpoint of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, we now anticipate our 2021 operation margin to be better than our prior guidance, in the range of 24% to 25%.  On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin, after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization. In addition, during Q3 '21, we expect to repurchase up to $75 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. For 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in a new manufacturing facility in Poland, our first one in the EMEA region. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. Q2 was a terrific quarter and we\u2019re very pleased with the improvements we\u2019re seeing in recovery in doctor\u2019s practices. We truly value their increasing adoption of digital treatment approaches, their confidence in the unique Align Digital Platform that spans from iTero to the world\u2019s most sophisticated treatment planning, the world\u2019s largest 3D printing business on the globe to a patient app with over 1 million consumers along with the world\u2019s most recognized orthodontic brand has driven strong performance across the business.  Our performance over the last year confirms the incredible size of our target market and demonstrates that our strategy and investments in recent years have helped further solidify our competitive position. We have numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpenetrated market. And while we continue to see some lasting impact and continued uncertainty due to COVID, we remain confident in both the enormous opportunity we have to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry with our doctor customers, and in our ability to execute our strategy to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment globally. We\u2019re also confident in and excited about the benefits of digital treatment that more and more doctors are experiencing by transforming their practices with Invisalign digital orthodontics and iTero scanners for chairside treatment planning and visualization. In fact, Invisalign treatment requires on an average 30% fewer doctor visits than fixed appliances, creating efficiency gains for the doctors and a better patient experience. And 85% of orthodontists surveyed agree that adopting the Align Digital Platform has made a huge difference in their practices. It provides ways to improve their efficiency and productivity. I look forward to updating you at the GP Summit and Investor Day in October in Las Vegas and sharing more examples of how Align is helping doctors transform their practices and their approach to treatment. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question. Nathan Rich : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. Joe, I wanted to start with the increased guidance and the expectations around the back half of the year being at the high end of the long-term range. I guess several of the factors that you highlighted on the call, the growth in new customers, the strong iTero placements, those have all historically been good leading indicators of growth in Invisalign. It also sounds like you're seeing better uptake from the DSO channels. That's obviously an opportunity that you guys have been going after for a long time. But I guess at this point, does that change how you're thinking about what the right target is for top line growth kind of next year, within the long-term range that you have? Joseph Hogan : Hi, Nathan. Look, I think you said it really well what we're seeing right now, what we're experiencing overall, and we are calling strong growth for the second half of this year. But, look, our revenue guidance for the long term for the business is 20% to 30%. And we continue to work within those boundaries. So we're not prepared to change that at the moment. John, any thoughts on --? John Morici : No, that's exactly -- we feel good about what we're seeing in the marketplace and our guide reflects that. Nathan Rich : I appreciate that. And then, John, maybe a follow up for you. Can you maybe go into a little bit more detail around your comments on the more pronounced summer seasonality, just how that impacts your expectations for the sequential growth we're likely to see in 3Q and 4Q of this year, maybe versus what you would expect in a normal year? John Morici : Well, as we know, there's a summer period where people take vacations, holidays and so on in EMEA and other places, and we expect and I think what we see in our own lives is you take longer weekends or maybe more pronounced vacations, people doing things in advance of shutdowns or lockdowns that might happen. And I think we're just being reflective of that. But really looking at all the variables that we normally see and talking to what we expect for the second half, which is to the upper side of our midpoint on a year-over-year basis. Nathan Rich : Got it. Thanks for the questions. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Jon. Jonathan Block : Hi, Joe. Good afternoon, guys. I think, Joe, I'll start with you with the first one. I think it was 5.3 North American GPU utilization number was huge and I think we all waited for a while to get that to get to 4. Now it's towards the 5. Just talk to us on what that is? I'm assuming what? It's more scanners. Is it also just increased utilization with even those that have had the scanner for some time? Would love some color and maybe just more importantly, is that 5 handle on the North American GPU utilization, do you view that as sustainable going forward? And then I've got a follow up. Joseph Hogan : Jon, I consider everything we do has more than a single variable to it and that's the platform that we work with that you know as well as anybody. But I'd say yes. Scanners serve that very well. Our increased advertising helps to drive that too. It brings more patients to the GPs. And thirdly, new product like [indiscernible] and different derivatives of that product line that are very efficient for GPs to use. And it gives them a huge amount of confidence in our product line when they use it, Jon. So it's a combination of our brand, it's a combination of our digital platform with iTero. It's a combination of product piece. And then we don't talk about it a lot, but we split our sales force years ago. And we have a specific focused sales force on GPs. And GPs speak a different language, Jon. It's different than orthodontists altogether, and that team has been incredibly effective being able to work with doctors, how they can integrate Invisalign into the workflow. And from a restorative standpoint, how you use this proactively. So I'm confident that's a great market for us. We know that 500 million patients we talk about globally sits broadly in that segment, but you need a different kind of a product approach, a different sales approach, and a strong platform geared to those guys to keep that going. And we feel good about that. Jonathan Block : Okay. And actually you brought up an interesting point. I think the sales force is I believe bifurcating international more recently in North America. So I guess we're starting to see that come through. Second question, John, just let me try to be as detailed as possible. So you've got solid 2Q '21 sales upside that you just reported. Then you raised the back part of the year from roughly 25% year-over-year revenue midpoint growth to closer to 27%. Yet you call out some more pronounced summer seasonality, and those seem at odds with one another. So can you just reconcile those two data points? In other words, you're alluding to more seasonality, yet you just took up the forecast in the back part of the year even in the face of that. So any color would be great. John Morici : I think it really reflects just the timing between quarters and not kind of as you said looking at the second half in a way, not knowing how vacations and holidays and lockdowns potential might play out but by looking at it in totality and kind of looking at from a second half standpoint. Jonathan Block : Thanks, guys. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please state your question. Jason Bednar : Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Congrats on the strong quarter here. Joe, I want to follow up on Nathan\u2019s question there going back to the first one. Maybe if you can unpack a bit further what you're seeing here as we look ahead in the next couple quarters, especially now that we've lapped the easiest of your comps, your guide here with suggest momentum strong across the business. But the key question I keep getting from investors is really how that adult consumer in the second half of the year and then into '22, how they're going to respond? So the question I guess for you is just how you're seeing the adult consumer respond in your various geographies as economies have opened back up and as we start staring down some tougher paths on the adult side? Then I've got a follow up. Joseph Hogan : Well, I think, Jason, in what we see with adults, and we see this really all over the globe, is we obviously had a big uptake from an adult standpoint, but you can see our team numbers up pretty substantially too at the same time. So there's a good balance. The previous question that Jon asked too with GPs, it comes into broadly an adult segment and that segment also. And my explanation in the sense of why we've been effective in that segment, we think we can continue to be helps to contribute to that. Now when we talk about third quarter and seasonality that Jon's talking about whatever, a lot of that is around adult patients and vacations and different things too and it affects different parts of the organization, and how we go to market. But in general, we just feel good about the direction of the business, the signal and words that we're getting from our doctors and what they're explaining they're seeing out there. And that's all incorporated into what we've been forecasting for you. And the one thing to never forget about too, Jason, is the size of this marketplace. We talk about 500 million patients and I know you hear from a lot of other companies in different industries about oversize, SIMs and whatever. This is true. If anything should have shown, like I mentioned in my closing comments, that this market is as big as we talk about being is what you've seen from this business over the last year in the adult segment of that part too, which is a big part of that 500 million patients that we talk about. Jason Bednar : That's helpful, Joe. And then just looking at least relative to our model in the quarter, it looks like -- most of the outperformance or disproportion amount came from the Americas. I'm sure that's U.S., but also maybe Brazil. And you made some pretty strong comments in the past on what Brazil could do for your business in a pretty short window of time. So just wondering if you could update us here on where you're at with expansion in Brazil, maybe how much that market in particular is contributing to sequential case growth? Joseph Hogan : Yes, no statistics for it. Brazil continues to be strong. I think you know it's a big aesthetic market, one of the biggest aesthetic markets in the world. It parallels Iberia in a lot of ways as we -- how we have to go in there and move. We're primarily in the orthodontic segment there and not in the GP segment right now on how we have done it. It's a different market that way because ortho play in a much more broader sense in that country than we do here. But we have a very experienced team there. We funded it well. I feel good about our position from a product standpoint and iTero scanners. And it's a big market for us. And don't just think about Brazil too. Latin America in general, it's been a big expanding market for us. So Brazil leads because of the size, population and essentially talked about. But overall, our LATAM market is extremely strong and we're well positioned there. John, any thoughts on that? John Morici : I think you covered it. Jason Bednar : All right. Thanks, guys. Joseph Hogan : All right, Jason. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great. Sticking with that international topic, can you speak to the growth in the quarter in Asia Pac and what you're seeing across that market? Are you still seeing some COVID related lingering headwinds there? And can you speak to some of the competitive landscape dynamics as well? And then also your efforts in terms of expanding the consumer advertising effort across that geography as well? Thanks. John Morici : Hi, Erin. This is John. I can address the start of that. Look, APAC is an important region for us, a huge market opportunity. We've invested, as we've talked about, with manufacturing and treatment planning and other places. We recently have added some additional advertising in APAC, and we see great results where there's a lot of interest, a lot of awareness that it drives, people come to our Web site and look for doctors and so on. And we think that translates very well. We're very happy with the quarter for Q2. You do have pockets of areas where there's COVID, more of a COVID impact; Southeast Asia, parts of China, other areas that we're always mindful of. But when we look at the investments we're making, the return that we're getting from those investments, we feel really good about APAC. Erin Wright : Okay. And then how should we be thinking about the quarterly progression of the gross margin from here and the run rate going forward? Is there anything to call out in terms of mix or ASPs? Are some of those seasonal dynamics you were talking about that we should be thinking about as we think about the third and the fourth quarter gross margin trends? Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Nothing of major note, Erin. We've seen that -- as we drive utilization, have more coming through our factories, it\u2019s very productive for us. We're very mindful of the tradeoffs that affect our margin, and you're seeing that come through. So as we look at some of the investments that we're making and how we're going to market products that we have, how we view things, there's nothing that should be too different than what we've seen from a gross margin standpoint. Erin Wright : Okay, great. Thank you. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Erin. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Johnson : Good afternoon. Hi, Joe. How are you? A couple of questions here I guess. One, on the seasonality, again, I hate to keep harping on that. But typically by this point, late July, you guys now know July numbers, you probably know pretty much what's lined up for August given cases that are in treatment planning phase right now. So are the seasonality comments driven by something you're seeing so far in the numbers? Is it something that you're just expecting could come in late in the quarter? Is it focused on the adult side, just kind of any more color there would be helpful as well? Joseph Hogan : Jeff, it's based on our experience with the season. I think you know. You've been following our business long enough. Third quarter is a real transition quarter from a vacation standpoint, teams coming in here. European vacations, which are really big. And our comments are just reflecting what we're hearing from our customer base, our doctor base not just in the United States, but all over the world. And we're just trying to share that with you. But at the same time, the guide that we've taken up, you have to remember we're at the upper end of our growth model for the second half. And when you think about it, we have two real strong quarters last year, Jeff, third and fourth quarters. So it's just a lot of confidence in what we see and what we feel. Jeffrey Johnson : Yes, understood. And then on ASPs, John, maybe for you. It sounds like some of the rebaiting or some of the promotional activity, I guess I should say, maybe has stepped down just a little bit. Obviously, you're running some bigger trading programs in that late last year and the early part of this year. Is that an opportunity then for ASPs to float a little bit higher into the back half of next year, or do other promotions pop up and just think about ASPs kind of straight lining from here? Thanks. John Morici : Yes, I would say the latter. Look, there's always promotions that we're running to drive that right utilization, and you try to find that right mix. And what we talk about and I think everybody gets is, it has to translate to gross margin, and we feel good about the gross margin that it's ultimately driving and our op margins that it brings to our bottom line. So there will be some tradeoffs, but I don't expect too much of a change in ASP. And the way we've looked at it, and just because some grow faster than others, look at it from a Comprehensive standpoint versus a non-Comprehensive standpoint to be relatively stable. Jeffrey Johnson : Yes, understood. Thanks, guys. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead. Joseph Hogan : Hi, John. John Kreger : Hi, guys. Thanks so much. Maybe just one more follow up. I would assume the seasonality comment is mainly sort of one about adults. But curious if you've got any thoughts on how the teen season might differ this year? Is it shaping up to be sort of a normal year as we assume schools are open again, or maybe more spread evenly across the second half? John Morici : I think you look at it, John, just from the standpoint that there are unknowns around COVID and vacations and other things. COVID is one of them. Some places we hear some of the countries and regions, school is going to open up earlier; some are saying that it's later. So we're just trying to be mindful that there's going to be changes that happen to this and try to give as much information about that as possible. John Kreger : Great. Thanks, John. And then maybe one follow up on ASP. It seemed like the year-over-year trend was different in Comprehensive versus non-Comprehensive. Can you just explain that again? Why would the Comprehensive change have been greater than a non-Comprehensive? And when you think about that metric longer term, do you assume the trajectory is similar across those two buckets or not? John Morici : Yes, the biggest change from last year to this year is really around the additional treatment that doctors were provided. So remember, last year, they didn't have as many new patients coming in, but they were still keeping existing patients along in treatment. It doesn't count as a new case. It really just counts as additional revenue. And therefore ASPs are higher as a result of that. Conversely, as now they've focused more on primary cases and new patients coming in, we see that shift -- we saw that shift. It really started in the third quarter of last year. It's kind of progressed relatively steady from third quarter on. And that's kind of how we think of it. There's not a -- it's not a promotional change or there's nothing of that nature. It's just really more just on how we're recognizing revenue between a primary shipment and then an additional treatment that a doctor provides. John Kreger : Okay, makes sense. Thank you. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. So my question is in terms of the second quarter, could you talk about how you saw volumes progressing maybe in the U.S. across the three months? John Morici : I think when we look at -- hi, Elizabeth. It\u2019s John. We saw strength across our business. We're not going to get into kind of month-by-month, but I think what we saw and you saw in the print for second quarter, very strong across geographies, products and so on. And what we're seeing is a reflection of that with our guidance. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay, that makes sense. And then turning to the cash flow, I appreciate the CapEx increase this year is largely a function of the new facility in Poland. Is that something that should continue on at that kind of pace going forward, or do you see kind of all of that wrapped up in this year's expense? And then we should go back to sort of more normalized levels afterwards. John Morici : Yes, I think what you'll see with kind of the convergence of what we have now, we have a lot of capacity that we're adding to meet the demand in the markets that we have. And we have that unique event with Poland kind of going on from a land, purchase, building and equipment that goes in. So this year will be a little bit heavy from that standpoint. And then going forward, it should just be more of the expansion and growth that way, but not as much as this year with the building as well. Joseph Hogan : Elizabeth, this is Joe. And thinking about -- we\u2019re talking about 200% growth rates, right. And we're talking about growth rates on the upper end of what our revenue models have been given to you guys. So it requires actually that kind of investment. And it's a good question. But like John said, we\u2019ll hit it hard this year, build some more capacity and this will lay in over time. Elizabeth Anderson : Yes, that certainly makes sense, especially as you have to build it ahead of the growth. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Liza Garcia with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Liza Garcia : Hi, guys. Can you hear me all right? Shirley Stacy : Yes, we hear you fine. Joseph Hogan : Yes. Hi, Liza. Liza Garcia : So I guess just digging into kind of how you're thinking about the exocad expansion with the [indiscernible] and kind of how you see the opportunity building there. You've mentioned a couple of things. And also should we view this kind of as like a first move for exocad and going forward strategy into more CAD/CAM? Joseph Hogan : Yes, Liza, that's a good question. When you think about -- we talk about the GP segment, we talk about ortho-restorative and I think most people, if you study this, you know the exocad is one of the few companies out there that actually offers a digital type of restorative platform for dentists all around the world. Our vision for our business, as we become a big part of restorative and saving enamel and moving teeth, before you actually do implants, you need to do different things. And that's what -- like that's we think is the revolution of orthodontics, because that wasn't a tool that was really used before. And so exocad and iTero plug in really well behind that. Never forget that our strategy is always about selling more Invisalign. That's what exocad is about. That's what iTero is about too. But they also have to have credibility as units in those segments. And that's when we talk about what we're doing with exocad and iTero, we're expanding our technology but always with a thought of how we can be more effective in ortho-restorative. John actually runs the business. I\u2019ll let him talk about it. John Morici : No, I think you summarized it well. This is a -- it's been just over a year. We're very pleased with how the business stands, as it stands alone, and then the technical and commercial integration that's been going on. And we see more and more synergies and feel good about the digital platform that this helps us move forward. So more to come on this. But after a year, we're very pleased. Liza Garcia : Great. Awesome. And then I was just wondering if you're hearing any indications from your customers about staffing as a potential issue, that's kind of limiting their availability anywhere? It doesn't -- obviously, the report doesn't certainly seem that way. But channel checks have kind of indicated some more limited staffing. Joseph Hogan : Yes. Liza, it\u2019s Joe again. I wouldn't call it a hindrance right now. They have to pay more to find these people. There is concern out there in the sense of how much people have to pay to bring them in. But we haven't had that as an excuse of doctor saying, I can't do more cases because I can't find staff. It's just harder to spend more time doing. John Morici : The one thing that you do hear and it's just the reality when we talk about some of that seasonality, people take vacations or doctors on vacation as well as staff and patients. So they might fall into that bucket as well to limit some of that staff at their offices. Liza Garcia : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Jamie Morgan : Hi, guys. It's Jamie on for Rich. A quick question for me on teens. Obviously, our checks, specifically within the ortho channel have been very bullish over the last couple of months. And now with it representing greater than a third of total case shifts, is it fair to say now that teen adoption is finally hitting that inflection point in the U.S.? And if not, kind of what are some of the things that you think still need to happen to really start to take on this sort of viewpoint? Joseph Hogan : It\u2019s Joe. Look, this is not a tipping point as you referred to it. It's been a ground war actually. And that ground war is basically started with product liability. And obviously, with Invisalign First and mandibular advancement and some of our other innovations that we've had, we've really opened up that segment and made it available to us too. Now the work is primarily with orthodontists to make them confident that they can service these teens, not just clinically but from a business standpoint also. That's why our programs like ADAPT and different things we put into place. And remember the war here is not against other clear aligner companies, it's about braces and fixed appliances. And that's what we really have to break through and get done. And honestly, orthodontists just have to be comfortable, not clinically but also from a business standpoint. And I feel like we're making progress in educating teens and educating mom, but on the other end, educating orthodontists to how they can properly do this clinically and also be efficient in their practices in doing it, and that's the ground war part. I feel we're well positioned. And obviously our numbers say we're making progress, but we're not declaring victory here at all. Jamie Morgan : Got it. And then just one follow up back to kind of some of the more pronounced summer seasonality. If I look back kind of through 2017 through 2019, it seems like you guys have seen anywhere from flat to maybe mid-single digit sequential improvement. Consensus is currently standing at something that would imply a decline. So is there any reason to be thinking that it shouldn't at least fall within the bounds of zero, a flat, mid-single digit improvement versus what consensus is currently implying, which would be a decline, just trying to get better calibration there. John Morici : Yes, Jamie, this is John. Look, we're trying to give you color to the second half because it's implied in our total year, and you can kind of defer or kind of infer what that means from third quarter and fourth quarter, but just trying to give you as much color without giving quarterly guidance is all that has been. Jamie Morgan : Okay. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hi, guys. How are you doing? Congrats on the quarter of the guide raise. I want to ask first on the -- I guess for John on the operating margin, especially on the non-GAAP side, had another really good quarter there. You bumped the guide a little bit, but you're still sort of -- your outlook for the second half still implies a pretty decent step down in operating margin. So I'm just wondering what's going on there? Is there any incremental spend that you're budgeting? And just in general, sort of expand on that? Can you talk a little bit about consumer marketing spend? How are those costs trending? How's the return on that going? John Morici : Yes, good question. Look, we're very pleased with our margins that we've seen through the first half, as you noted, very strong performance, a good reflection of a lot of the investments that we made, and we continue to make to help grow our business. And we look at the second half as continuing these investments to expand from a sales and marketing standpoint. There's some operating costs that we have to be able to grow our business, like we have. It reflects those investments and we're trying to continue to position ourselves so that we would continue momentum and be able to start next year with that momentum. So it's really more of a reflection of that. And obviously, as we go through the second half, we'll update on what that means for margin. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And then on the gross margin line, again, just on the -- you got the manufacturing facility in China. You're talking about the plant in Poland up in 2022. Could you give us an update or reminder of sort of how we should think about progression there in terms of shifting some of the manufacturing there, and how they should work its way through the gross margin lines? And when do to those plants reach more or less full capacity and sort of you work through the ramp up there? John Morici : Yes, you're right. When we go live, there is -- until you get that capacity up, and we're really -- we know how to do that manufacturing, we've learned as we've gone through some of the China facility ramp up, that will get applied to how we ramp up in Poland. We'll move doctors over kind of country by country and ramp things up. That will happen in the first half next year. But very mindful of what it means from a margin standpoint and do everything we can to minimize that inefficiency that you have when you first start up, and be able to get those facilities up and running at near 100% capacity. Joseph Hogan : Yes. And one of the things that John knows better than me on this one, Michael, is when we ramped up China, remember we started with a rental temporary facility that was not even close to scale, and it just pounded our cost. But we just wanted to get in place, get the workflow done. We built a building next to the where that area was, then transitioned into it. So that was a pretty big bump that we took there. We're not anticipating, John, the same. John Morici : Right. And that would happen, Michael, when we kind of quietly went live in Q2 of last year with that new Greenfield facility. And it's all about running that factory with a high utilization. They have an efficient labor and productivity there that we know how to drive. But there is some ramp up period, but we'll look to that in kind of the first half, and then see improvement as we go into the second half. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Fantastic. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ravi Misra : Hi, team. How are you doing? Can you hear me? Joseph Hogan : Hi, Ravi. Shirley Stacy : Hi, Ravi. Ravi Misra : Hi. So I guess I have two questions. One is more on the R&D side and one on China. So just on the R&D, one of your competitors announced a new polymer. And I think one of the things that's actually turned up in our checks with orthos at least is that SmartTrack gives you an edge. Just curious on your view and whether that's kind of starting to have any sort of impact, or is it too early? And then how you plan to maybe position yourself to kind of keep ahead of the peers? And then secondly, just around China, I guess it\u2019s another kind of competition question with I guess your largest facility, a relatively small competitor going public? How are you kind of viewing that market now with kind of another I guess well funded competitor out there in terms of the ability to grow the market or kind of go after potential segment of that market, whether it's the more luxury focus patient or how are you kind of segmenting the population there? Thanks. Joseph Hogan : On your first question on a new polymer, we do multi-layer material. So it's various polymers that you put together and we were balancing the equation between elasticity and overall rigidity or retention [h] strength. And it's like our other competitors are starting to figure that piece out and see pieces of it. We have strong patents around SmartTrack and obviously improving over time is a real important part about not just having the right materials, but having the right kind of system in place. And that's the treatment planning part that we talked about, 25 years of understanding how to really activate those aligners and make that plastic actually work through those algorithms. And we don't use a displacement methodology, which is basically built on aligner that kind of leads things. It actually engages with these things in a different way. So I expect more companies to come out and work different polymers or whatever. We have a huge amount of experience of that, but don't forget about the entire system, the algorithms, how it works together and how it works the attachments, the exactness of the attachments, where you put those attachments, how they're shaped, so a lot going on there. We feel good about our position, and we'll continue to innovate in that space across all those spectrums. But there's nothing in the competitive marketplace that we are concerned with that would change the trajectory of where we're investing right now. From a China competitive standpoint, obviously Angel Align IPO, we watched that closely and get some clarity to everybody in that marketplace as they IPO\u2019ed and what's going on. And I think you see they're strong in Tier 3 cities, they're strong with public hospitals in different areas. But look, I feel good about our position in China. Our manufacturing is strong. Our training centers there are strong. Our treatment planning is strong. It's close to accounts. We had good growth in the quarter overall, good sequential growth, good year-on-year growth. You might want to [indiscernible], John. John Morici : Yes, just to add in China, we've been competing in China with various companies since we've been there. So it is nothing new really with the IPO. It's really more of a reflection of this under penetrated market in China. China is a huge opportunity for the clear aligner business. And so we feel very good about our positioning there. Primarily cases are done with wires and brackets. And so this is less about share shifting amongst clear aligner and more about growth in the category. Ravi Misra : Thanks. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Ravi. Well, listen, thank you everyone for joining us today. We really appreciate your time. Look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including the International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany, September 22 through 25, where we'll be showcasing Align, exocad innovations and a hybrid and multimedia exhibition space through physical and virtual experiences. We'll also be hosting an investor meeting in conjunction with our GP Summit in October in Las Vegas in Nevada. We'll have that October 29 and 30. So look for more information. And if you have any additional questions, please follow up with our Investor Relations Department. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights in the third quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, system services, and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. I am pleased to report strong third quarter results with revenue growth of 38.4% year-over-year on top of a record third quarter last year, driven by the strength across all regions, customer channels, and products.  For Q3 we shipped to a record 85,500 doctors in the quarter and reached 11.6 million Invisalign patients cumulatively. On a sequential basis, Q3 results reflect continued adoption of iTero scanners and increased utilization of Invisalign Clear Aligners in the Americas and APAC regions, as well as the growth in teen segment, especially in the North America orthodontics channel. Our third quarter revenues reflect a growing confidence of doctors and patients with Invisalign treatment, iTero scanners and Exocad software, as more doctors discover the benefits of digital treatment and transform their practices with the Align Digital Platform. For Q3, Systems and Services revenues were up 57.3% year-over-year, with strong revenue growth across all regions, and up 5% sequentially, primarily in North America. Q3 results reflect the continued adoption of iTero Element 5D Plus Series, our next-generation scanners and imaging system, which launched earlier this year and feature innovative technology like Near Infrared technology we call NIRI, which aid in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva without harmful radiation. For Q3, Clear Aligner revenues were up 34.9% year-over-year, with strong revenue growth across all regions and across the portfolio, including comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, as well as Invisalign moderate and Invisalign Go.  On a sequential basis, Q3 Clear Aligners revenues were down very slightly from record Q2 reflecting more pronounced summer seasonality than last year, especially in EMEA, were practices and patients appear to have taken extended holidays and where offices were impacted due to resurgence of COVID-19 cases and restrictions especially in some markets in Asia-Pacific. And the team segment Q3 '21 Invisalign Clear Aligner volumes for teens were strong, up 13.8% sequentially, and 26.6% year-over-year to a record 206,000 teens, representing approximately 1/3 of total cases shipped, with strong shipment growth from North American orthodontists and a record quarter for teen and APAC.  Our third quarter revenues also include non-case revenue for clinical training and education, and doctor prescribed retainer products. Retention is a critical part of creating and maintaining a beautiful new smile. Retainers prevent teeth from gradually shifting back to their initial positions after treatment ends. Studies show that without retention, even perfectly aligned teeth can gradually revert to their pre -treatment state. And that dentition continues to change as patients age, often requiring limited treatment, also known as touch-up treatment, if not properly retained. Our retention products are designed to maintain teeth that have been aligned by Invisalign Aligners, braces, or other aligners. These retainer products can accommodate lingual bars, wires, also known as a permanent retainer, missing teeth that require an artificial tooth, and bite ramps, also known as turbos or blocks. While our retainer business continues to deliver solid revenue growth, our share of retention market is significantly under-penetrated. Even more so than in our share of the orthodontic case starts. We've been developing a robust retainer strategy, including a separate marketing team focused solely on driving adoption, and increasing market share in the United States. Our objective is to build brand awareness for Vivera retainers, and driving engagement with doctors through clinical education and sales initiatives, while connecting consumers to doctors through demand creation programs and our concierge service. We've also recently implemented social media campaigns featuring the benefits of Vivera from the makers of Invisalign Clear Aligners. We believe that incremental investments will provide increased value for Invisalign practices, and drive growth consistent with our long-term financial model target. In addition, we successfully rolled out a limited pilot program to participate in Invisalign Providers in the United States and Canada, that offers a monthly targeted subscription program to address the unmet patient demand for retention or touch-up cases. Our goal is to encourage experienced high-volume Invisalign practices, who regularly treat patients with our comprehensive products to offer premium retention or entry-level products for the long-term health of their patients, and to grow their businesses. Practices in this pilot program can purchase a monthly subscription at a fixed price, based on their monthly needs for retention or limited treatment. The program allows doctors the flexibility to order both touch-up or retention Aligners with their tier subscription. The program is designed for a segment of experienced Invisalign doctors, who are now regularly using our retainers or low stage Aligners. The positive feedback from our doctors have been encouraging. For instance, the doctors at [Indiscernible] told us the program is very straightforward and easy to understand, and they've been hoping Align would do something like this. Doctor Jonathan Nicozisis at Princeton Orthodontics called the program a home run. We went on to -- he went to predict it should replace the idea that doctors invest in 3D printing and the additional complications and expenses it requires. Including the need for a full-time employee and additional overhead costs, particularly because he believes h is treatment outcomes are always better with Align. Q3 non-case revenues also included accessories and consumables such as aligner cases called Clam Shells, cleaning crystals, and other oral health products that are available on our e-commerce channels in the U.S. only, including the Invisalign accessories store, Walmart, and Amazon. In Q3, we announced an exclusive supply distribution agreement with Ultradent Products, Incorporated, a leading developer and manufacturer of high-tech dental materials, devices and instruments worldwide. The Invisalign Professional whitening program powered OpEx essence is optimized for Invisalign aligners and Vivera Retainers and is available only through Invisalign trained doctors. Also in Q3, we launched the Invisalign whitening pen through an e-commerce channels in the U.S. only. The whitening Pen is over-the-counter retail product for consumers seeking quick tooth whitening at a lower price and is not intended to be used with aligners. The whitening Pen complements the other accessory products that Align already marks to consumers through its existing e-commerce channels and is a key addition to our consumable product portfolio.  Now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results, starting with the Americas. With Americas, Q3 results reflected strong performance, including record revenues for Latin America, as well as summer seasonality for adult case starts in North America that primarily impacted GP practices, strong ortho performance, especially in the teen market that included increased utilization from the orthodontic channel. Invisalign Case volume was up 0.7% sequentially, and up 36.4% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region especially in Latin. DSO utilization continued to be a strong growth driver as well, led by Heartland and Smile Docs. For our international business, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 27% year-over-year on top of record growth in the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, international shipments were down sequentially 4.3%, primarily as a result of greater seasonality in COVID related shutdowns in APAC markets.  For EMEA, Q3 Invisalign case volumes were up 49.6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all markets led by the U.K. and Iberia, along with continued growth in our expansion markets in Central and Eastern Europe and the Benelux. For Q3 year-over-year Invisalign volume in EMEA was driven by increased submitters from both orthodontics and GPEs and increase utilization primarily from orthos. On a sequential basis, EMEA was down sequentially 60.5% following a record Q2, primarily as a result of the extended seasonality we had anticipated, primarily from summer holidays and vacations across the region. For APAC, Q3 volumes were up 4.2% compared to a record Q3 last year in APAC. On a year-over-year basis, growth was uneven. The market as APAC, the first region to emerge from the depths of the COVID lockdown in 2020. Additionally, we saw COVID resurgences and lockdowns sporadically impact various APAC countries in Q3. On a sequential basis, Q3 Invisalign volumes were up 21.2%, reflecting growth across the region led by a record quarter in China, especially from teen cases, as well as strong growth in Japan, and A&G. In Q3 growth from both channels was strong with ortho growth driven by increased Invisalign utilization and cheapy growth, channel growth driven by increased Invisalign submitters. APAC teen shipments reached an all-time high in Q3, at the recent 10th China Finance Summit Awards, Align was recognized as the 2021 most innovative enterprise for its advancements and outstanding contributions in the field of Digital orthodontics.  This award builds on our prior recognition of Align's leadership in the digital orthodontics industry and its efforts to promote the modernization of orthodontics. Our consumer marketing focuses on educating consumers about the Invisalign system, to drive demand to Invisalign doctors offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. In Q3, we expanded a next-generation of the Invis Is media campaign across EMEA, APAC, and Brazil to increase awareness with adult, mom, and teen consumers. Globally, we delivered 6.45 billion impressions, growing 42% year-over-year, resulting in a 70% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our websites. In the U.S., we connected with teens on Snapchat, YouTube, and Twitch, with our Invis is Not Your Parents Braces campaigns. These campaigns continue to feature some of the largest teen influencers from our Invisalign SmileSquad, like Charlie D'Amelio, Marci Martin, Michael Leon Collins, and Devin Key. These influencers share their personal experience with Invisalign treatment, including why they chose Invisalign treatment to shape their smiles. As part of our focus on teens, with our Invisalign teens makers program, we hold a recognition event hosted by Marcel Martin with teens across the country to celebrate and recognize 100 teens across the country who drove positive change within their communities. To continue growing for our young adult businesses, we expanded the Invis is a powerful thing campaign, which highlights how powerful the smile transformation with Invisalign treatment can be for their self confidence.  In U.S we expanded our Invisalign smile squad to include young adult influencers such as Cody Rigsby, Lana Candor, and Emily Hampshire, who help to deliver over 405 million impressions. Additionally, our influencer partnerships with TikTok creators helped increase traffic to our sites, with a 127% increase in click-through rates. In Brazil, we launched the Invis is a Powerful Thing campaign, and teamed up with mega influencer [Indiscernible] to increase website traffic by 30%. In the EMEA region, we expanded into new media channels such as TikTok and Snapchat across the UK, Germany, and France to drive engagement. These efforts led to more than a 153% increase in unique visitors. We also started consumer advertising in Russia, which resulted in more of a 1000 increase in unique visitors to our website. In Q3, we continue to expand our consumer advertising across the APAC region, experienced a 132% increase in unique visitors to our websites. And Australia, we expanded our media mix to include partners such as TikTok and Snapchat. Which resulted in 250% -- 250% growth year-over-year in unique visitors to our website. In Japan, we continue to see a strong response from consumers to our [Indiscernible] campaign, resulting in more than an 800% increase year-over-year in unique visitors to our website. Adoption of our consumer in patient app, my Invisalign continued to increase in Q3 with 1.2 million downloads to date. Usage of our 4 digital tools also continued to increase. For example, our Invisalign virtual appointment tool was used over 15,000 times and our insurance verification feature was used 14,000 times in Q3. Furthermore, we received more than 1.5 million patient photos in our Virtual Care feature today globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our AI capabilities and improve our services for doctors that is used to enhance their patients care. For our systems and services business, Q3 revenues grew 57.3% year-over-year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services, and was up 5% sequentially. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for our systems and services business. The iTero Element 5D Plus Imaging system continued gaining traction across all regions, with the most recent launch in Japan in Q3. The iTero Element 5D Plus Imaging System will be available in China in Q4 of this year. Additionally, The iTero Element Plus Series was launched in Korea in Q3. The series expands the portfolio of iTero Element Scanners and Imaging Systems to include new solutions that serve the needs of a broader range of doctors and patients in the dental market. Moreover, I'm proud to say that in a recent clinical study, the iTero Element 5D Intraoral Scanner was found to be more sensitive than bitewing radiology. in detecting early enamel lesions, providing further evidence of the benefits of iTero 5D Scanner in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva, without exposing patients to harmful ionizing radiation. This is great news for our iTero business, as a study further supports the diagnostic ability of Near-Infrared imaging technology offered by the iTero 5D Scanner for early proximal caries detection. The findings also underscore the valuable role that NIRI technology can have in dental health assessment and early detection of cavities, which is important to the overall oral healthcare treatment options. And a comfortable, safe experience for a broad population of patients. A strong indicator of the digital acceleration with dental offices is a number of intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions. Total worldwide intraoral digital scans used to start an Invisalign case in Q3 increased 84.2% from 78.3% in Q3 last year. International intraoral digital scanners for Invisalign case submissions increased 79.3% up from 72.1% in the same last year. For the America's, 88% of cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan compared to 83.2% a year ago.  Cumulatively, over 44.9 million orthodontics scans and 9.3 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. Our Q3 systems and services revenues also includes Exocad, CAD CAM products and services. Exocad expertise -- expertise in restorative dentistry, implantology, guidance surgery and smile design, extends our digital -- our digital dental solutions and broadens Align digital platform towards fully integrated into disciplinary and workflows, we remained excited about our continued integration progress and product plans with Exocad. During the quarter, Exocad launched, chair-side CAD 3.0 Galloway.  The next-generation of Exocad, easy-to-use CAD software for single-visit dentistry. The software has improved automation for fast crown design enables users to integrate open hardware and material s of choice. Exocad, chair-side CAD received 2021 seller best-of-class technology award for the third consecutive year. Also during the quarter, Exocad has its largest ever presence at IDS, International Dental Show, where they showcased their seamless digital workflows, and the simplicity of the use of Exocad Galway software release. Exocad was the only Company at IDS to showcase live patient treatment with a smile creator experience station, featuring iTero scans, instant smile makeovers, and production of clip on smiles. With that, I will now turn it over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $1.016 billion, up 0.5% from the prior quarter and up 38.4% from the corresponding quarter a year-ago. For Clear Aligners, Q3 revenues $837.6 million were down 0.4% sequentially, and up 34.9% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth across all geographies. In Q3, we shipped 655,100 Invisalign cases, a decrease of 1.6% sequentially with an increase of 32.1% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to a record 85,500 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7200 were first-time customers.  Q3 Clear Aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio, led by comprehensive products. Q3 comprehensive volume increased 1.3% sequentially, and 30.3% year-over-year. And Q3 non-comprehensive volume decreased 8.1% sequentially, and increased 36.8% year-over-year. Q3 adult patients decreased 7.3% sequentially, and increased 34.7% year-over-year. In Q3, teens or younger patients increased 13.8% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.2 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.1 million or approximately 2.6 points. For Q3 Invisalign comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by the increase in net revenue deferrals for new Invisalign cases versus additional Aligner shipments. Q3 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional Aligners, partially offset by higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange, higher additional Aligners, and lower discounts. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $84 million or 9.3% sequentially, and $347.3 million or 53.9% year-over-year, and will be recognized as the additional Aligners are shipped. Our Systems and Services revenues for the third quarter were a record $178.3 million, up 5% sequentially, and up 57.3% year-over-year. This marks the fifth quarter in a row of sequential revenue increase. The increase sequentially can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, and increased services revenues from our larger installed base. The increase year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, increased service revenues from our larger installed base, as well as higher ASPs from a favorable mix shift towards higher price iTero 5D scanners and imaging systems.  Our systems and services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up $27.2 million or 17% sequentially, and up $100.1 million or a 115.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and deferral of services revenue, which we recognized ratably over the service period. Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 74.3% down 0.7 points sequentially, and up 1.6 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our 2020 Exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 74.7% for the third quarter, down 0.7 points sequentially, and up 1.4 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis, due to foreign exchange and relatively unchanged sequentially. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 76.2%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher manufacturing costs, and higher additional Aligners, partially offset by higher ASPs and lower freight. Clear Aligner gross margin was up 1.5 points year-over-year due to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume, partially offset by higher ASPs.  Systems and services gross margin for the third quarter was 65.6% down 0.3 sequentially, primarily due to lower ASPs and higher manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher service revenue. Systems and services gross margin was up 3.6 points year-over-year due to higher ASPs from product mix shift to iTero 5D and 5D Plus series and service revenues, partially offset by higher freight costs. Q3 operating expenses were $494 million up sequentially, 0.9% and up 38.4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly by $4.4 million. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $137 million, reflecting increased headcount in our continued investment in marketing, sales, and R$D activities. and invents -- investments commensurate with business growth. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, and amortization of intangibles and acquisition costs related to our 2020 Exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $466.1 million up sequentially 1% and up 40.3% year-over-year due to the reasons described earlier.  Our third quarter operating income of $261.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.7%, down 0.9 points from the prior quarter, and up 1.6 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin was attributable primarily to lower gross margin. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage, as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.7 points, partially offset by continued investment as mentioned earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related costs, the operating margin for the third quarter was 28.8%, down 0.9 points sequentially, and up 0.8 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense, net for the third quarter was a gain of $0.8 million up sequentially by 0.9 million and down year-over-year by $6.6 million.  On a year-over-year basis, interest and other income and expense decreased primarily due to net foreign exchange losses in the 3 months ended September 30th, 2021, as compared to net foreign exchange gains in the same period in 2020, which was partially offset by an unrealized gain and an investment held in a private Company recognized in the three months ended September 30th 2021. The GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.9%, compared to 25.7% in the second quarter, and 24.5% in the third quarter of the prior year. On an non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.2% in the third quarter, compared to 19.5% in the second quarter, and 16.6% in the third quarter of the prior year. The third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were higher than the second quarter, primarily due to our foreign income being taxed at different rates and tax true-ups. Our GAAP and non-GAAP third quarter effective tax rates were higher than the third quarter of the prior year, primarily due to lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at lower rates and a tax benefit recognized last year resulting from an income tax audit settlement.  Third quarter net income per diluted share was $2.28, down sequentially $0.23 and up $0.52 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.87 for the third quarter, down $0.17 sequentially and up $0.62 year-over-year. Moving onto the balance sheet. As of September 30th, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion, up sequentially $151.5 million, and up $622.3 million year-over-year. Of our 1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $607.5 million was held in the U.S., and $630.3 million was held by our international entities. Q3 accounts receivable balance was $855 million, up approximately 5.8% sequentially, our overall days sales outstanding was 75 days, up approximately three days sequentially, and down approximately two days as compared to Q3 last year. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $355 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $124.3 million. As we continue to invest in increased in the liner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures amounted to $230.7 million. We also have $300 million available under our untapped revolving line of credit. Under our $1 billion repurchase program announced in May of 2021, we have $825 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. Now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. We're very pleased with our Q3 results and strong year-over-year growth, which reflects continued customer adoption of the iTero scanners and increased Invisalign utilization across customer channels, including teens, adults, and young patients. Over the last 18 months, our investment decisions have helped drive and capture demand across all regions and customer channels. We continued spending in many areas, and have seen good return on our investments and strong revenue growth. Consumer interest in improving smiles is high, and doctor acceptance into Align Digital Platform is helping drive growth across all regions and market segments. As anticipated in our Q3 outlook, we experienced more pronounced summer seasonality, more noticeably in September and continued into October as practices took more extended vacations, and patient traffic low was sporadically interrupted by regional COVID resurgence, restrictions, and other lockdowns. We anticipate these COVID challenges and the general macroeconomic uncertainties to continue into Q4. Taking this all into account, as we look at the remainder of 2021, we expect revenues for the year to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion, at the high end of our original guidance range. We also expect our outlook in revenue growth for the second half of 2021 to be in the high end of our long-term operating model of 20% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, we anticipate our 2021 operating margin to be around 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin, after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization from our 2020 Exocad acquisition. We remain confident in the huge market opportunities for our business, our industry leadership, and our ability to execute. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, innovation, and manufacturing capacity to drive our growth and accelerate adoption in a huge under-penetrated market. In addition, during Q4 2021, we expect to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement.  For 2021 we expect our investments in capital expenditures to be above $400 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction improvements, as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in our new work -- our new facility in Wroclaw, Poland, the first in the EMEA region. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. Summary, Q3 was a strong quarter and we're pleased with our performance across the business. Align is uniquely positioned. We have a clinical capability and product portfolio supported by doctor and patient workflows only accessible through the proprietary Align Digital Platform, to address the broadest range of orthodontic cases with the Invisalign system through a network of trained Invisalign doctors who had the expertise to reach more than the 500 million potential global patients.  As we develop our annual plan for 2022 over the next few months, it's important that we continue to expand our commercial manufacturing, R&D clinical treatment planning and manufacturing operations, and continue to leverage our global quality and regulatory muscles in existing and emerging markets. Which millions of consumers who want to transform their smile with the most advanced Clear Aligner systems in the world.  Through advertising, PR, digital, social media, and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion through Invisalign trained doctors. Increased ortho adoption and team utilization of Invisalign treatment, and train and educate GP Dentist on how the iTero Element family of inter-oral scanners in imaging systems propel today's dental practice into the future by enhancing patient experience and elevating clinical precision, and in the benefits of digital dentistry with the Invisalign system, trusted by more than 11 million people worldwide to improve their smiles. Remained focused on strategic execution, accountability, agility, customer service excellence, and continuing to make investments to grow our business. This is a multi-variable equation that we continue to talk about, and that in combination where we remain uniquely able to offer. As we continue to stay the course with our strategic initiatives, we also continue to navigate the COVID-19 environment and the challenges and uncertainty that go with it. Throughout the pandemic, our top priority has been consistent. The health and safety of our employees and their families, doctors and their staff. And that has not changed. The situation with COVID remains very fluid, and with the rise of the Delta variant, many cities, states, and countries have issued or planned to issue new guidance, including mass requirements, regular testing, capacity limits, and vaccination mandates.  Operating in this evolving environment is challenging for everyone, and we're staying as close as we can to the situation. The shift from traditional analog wires and brackets to a fully end-to-end digital platform is not easy and cannot be done without very complex and industry-leading technology, and talented passionate people. But the digital transformation in orthodontics is inevitable. Our technology is prevalent, touching every aspect of what we do from manufacturing excellence, where we currently produce over 750,000 unique Aligners a day, to expanding our geographic footprint to over a 100 markets, to building a network of over 210,000 trained Invisalign doctors, and providing a technology to our doctors and a complete digital system, the Align Digital Platform. As the inventor of the leading Clear Aligner system, we've been investing in this therapy for over 24 years to get it to where it is today, and yet the majority of the market opportunity remains largely untapped. with over 500 million potential cases starts globally. Align is in a rare position to address this market with the Align Digital Platform, powered by two decades of research and development, manufacturing excellence clinical data based on more than 11 million patients, with AI machine learning and digital tools to help our doctors efficiently communicate with our patients, show and explain any issues and visualize potential treatment options.  And together with doctors, we're going to unleash the power of digital for dentistry in orthodontics more than ever. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to speaking with you on Friday at our Investor Day where we'll share more details on the Align Digital Platform and our vision and strategy to make Clear Aligner treatment available to everyone through doctors. Now I will turn the call over to our operator for your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. We ask that you please limit to 1 question and 1 follow-up. [Operator instructions]. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please while we pull for questions. Our first question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Rich : Hi, good afternoon. Hey, Joe. Joe and John, you highlighted the seasonal softness in September and that extended into October. I wonder if you could maybe just provide a little bit more detail on what you've seen in October so far, maybe how that compared to September. And then as we've seen the latest COVID case spikes subside in recent weeks, have you seen -- the patient traffic flow that you mentioned, has that started to pick up as COVID cases have ticked down? John Morici : Yes. Hi, Nate. This is John. As we said, the extended seasonality continued into September and October. And then some of the COVID uncertainty still remains. And some places more back to normal than others, and -- but that uncertainty remains. Taking all that together, our forecast reflects that. So the total year -- the remaining for total year reflects everything that we've seen to this date. Nathan Rich : Okay. That's fair, I guess. Joe, maybe a follow-up. I mean, you've continued to have confidence in that 20% to 30% long-term range. Maybe we'll hear more on Friday at the Analyst Day. But do you have an initial view on growth for next year, and do you feel like once this period of more pronounced seasonality is behind you, we get back to a more normalized trajectory for the business as we head into next year. Thanks for the questions. Joseph Hogan : Well, Nathan we are growing at a pretty good pace right now. So it's actually above our long-term growth model, which is 20% to 30%. And as we move into 2022, we'll retain that 20% revenue growth target, and we're happy to discuss it more in detail on Friday. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Nathan. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from John Block with Stifle. please proceed with your question. Jonathan Block : Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. John, I just might follow in Nathan's path, but let me take a different approach. The new rev range that you gave for this year, you clearly brought it up a little bit, it seems to imply a bit over a billion dollars for the fourth quarter. If I assume the scanner up sequentially from the 178, and 55 million - ish give or take in non-case revenue. And it looks like case volume is expected to be flat to maybe even down low-to-mid-single-digits sequentially. So a couple of things there, is that the right way to think about things specific to case volumes? And if so, I know you touched on this a little bit, but why sort of the different trend line versus prior to COVID, if you would, where that was more up mid-single-digit plus? John Morici : Yeah, Jon. I think when you look at prior years with COVID not in the mix, things were maybe more seasonal. And you could see some of the standard patterns from let's say a Q3 to Q4, given COVID and given some of the uncertainties that you have. And certain economies and how they are responding and opening up, Things don't always apply to mainly what's happened in the past. So that guidance that we gave is a reflection of what we've seen. Jonathan Block : Okay. Got it. And Joe, just a follow-up, we keep on hearing about the iOS changed from Apple on privacy and you guys have such a broad reach in terms of marketing. But I am curious if you're seeing any impact? Is it impacting leads? Yes or no, and if so, could that actually continue into 2022? We'd love your feedback there. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : John, it's a good question we've seen an impact on it. The thing is a lot of other media you can -- you can pivot to in order to find those patients. So have we seen it and have we had to do a certain amount of pivot to do that? Yes. But you know as far as our marketing efforts, I wouldn't discount them in any way in this sense of that change being material in some sense in the near future. Jonathan Block : Fair enough. See you on Friday. Joseph Hogan : [Indiscernible] Operator : Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. John Kreger : Hey, guys. Thanks. I'm curious now that you've exited another typical teen season what penetration do you think Invisalign has of total teens starts at this point? Joseph Hogan : Well, I mean globally -- hey John, it's Joe. Globally, it's less than 5%. When you look at -- we'll show on Friday exactly what we think that is. In United States, I think our current number is the mid-teens. Yes. John, I think that too. We have so far to go, right. This is a superior treatment, like I said in our script, we can do 90% of the orthodontic cases that are out there. It's just us continuing to work really closely with the orthodontist, and advertise to consumers to explain the benefits of digital orthodontics and move this forward. But like I said, this is inevitable. Digital is better. We know it's better. We've made it better. It's more comprehensive than it was before, it's faster, less invasive. I could go on all day. And that's what drives this Company, that's our purpose. We know we'll hit it. It's just -- there's just a lot of work to get from here to there. John Kreger : Thanks.That was Joe, that was my follow-up. As you talk to your power users or maybe people that are just getting started. You've made the product better. You made the software better. What do you think is the key point of friction at this point to get that adoption rate up where I think most of us on this call assume it can get to longer-term? Joseph Hogan : But John, I think it's the classic early adopter syndrome. The doctors who use our product almost exclusively 100% can't imagine not using our product line. But they're early adopters in the classical sense. There's 2 things; 1, there's the clinical confidence people, people that are out there that we have to convince. It's much easier that it is today than it was five years ago. Given products like first giving products like [Indiscernible] those kind of things that extend it. And then the predictability of our products.  Secondly, it's the business equation inside the orthodontic practices that they're convinced they can actually keep up the margins and the growth capability they have for their practices, we understand that. And that's why we have programs like adapt that we put together, John, that orthodontist who want to engage with us we can show them how to really operate in a digital environment and actually exceed from a margin standpoint, and growth standpoint. John Kreger : Sounds good. Thank you. Joseph Hogan : Yes. Thanks, John. Operator : The next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Jason Bednar : Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the record quarter here. Joseph Hogan : Thanks Jason. Jason Bednar : A couple of questions from our side. One big picture. First for you, Joe. One of the key drivers of growth, the past year has been really the adult category outpacing that of teens. It really seemed like heading into this quarter could be the proof-point quarter and whether that growth would flip back to teen, but adult was again stronger than teens here. It seems like some good staying power. So I guess Joe, how do you think about these -- how these 2 segments play out from Here, both obviously have a ton of growth potential, but as the business for Align shifted to where we should be thinking about adult growth, outpacing that of teens. As we look forward to the coming quarters and years? Joseph Hogan : Yes. Jason, it's a good question, but I think it's -- and you'll hear a lot about it this Friday, is the demand equation on this business is incredible, right. The 500 million patients we've talked about, they'll primarily be serviced at the general dentistry area, and then the over 20 million, that's on the -- in the orthodontics side. That mean -- that's -- you look at that. It's a wide open marketplace. Adults have done well, teens will do well. I just think you have to have them both go up. And remember their dealer from different basis in the sense of, traditionally, 75% of our cases have been adults and 25% teens, so there is a large number on the adult side, but the growth potential is amazing. And we'll just going to go after both ends of that equation as aggressively as we can. Jason Bednar : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. I look forward to more on Friday then. And then maybe some more of a real-time look and also following up on Nate's question there to start out, but asking also a different way. Maybe wonder if you could talk about how utilization trends have gone here month-to-month on a regional basis, September, October, and then maybe based on the treatment plans and missions, other measures of your funnel. What does the utilization look like as we shift from October and November? Thanks. John Morici : Yes, Jason, this is John. We've seen some improvements in utilization and it's a reflection of kind of coming out of that seasonality piece of what we've talked about and kind of navigating through COVID. But we've been happy with the utilization that we've seen as of late. Jason Bednar : All right. Thanks so much. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I had a question on the gross margin line. I think you guys talked about how you're seeing maybe slightly higher manufacturing costs in Clear Aligners and then lower freight and higher freight in iTero that has other -- the higher freight costs there. So I was just wondering, as we think about some of the global supply chain issues that we've been reading about and hearing about from other companies, if you could just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in both of those areas. Thanks. John Morici : Hi, Elizabeth. This is John. I can take that. I think when you look at our overall gross margin, broadly impacted as we've talked about. Additional liners, as we now have ramped up and we've seen those cases from the last several quarters as doctors make refinements and get patiently in to make refinements to the care. We see an improvement there in ASPs, but there's some offset in gross margin.  But broadly, when we look at some of the inflationary [Indiscernible] and so on, we have long term contracts, we have got a supply chain where we're driving a lot of productivity and efficiencies through. So, we feel we're pretty well balanced as we see some of these inflationary headwinds, not that it's not a challenge out there for everybody, but we feel that between the contracts we have and the efficiencies we can drive, we balance it. Elizabeth Anderson : That's really helpful and maybe I saw that in your outlook, you're obviously talking about around a $100 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter. But your cash balance is moving up nicely and I was wondering if you could comment on what you see sort of how preferred level of cash balance and if there's any potential for acceleration on the share repurchase line or, things that we should consider in thinking that should be a little bit higher than where it's been traditionally. John Morici : Yeah, I think when you look at -- I'm balanced, Elizabet, we're very pleased with the cash generation, almost 900 million of CFOA, 3 quarters of the year. It's phenomenal cash. A lot going back into the business to grow our business, make investments in some of the operating expenditures to grow our business, continue to make investments in capacity and adding capacity, getting closer to our customers. And then as we've said with our cash, we'll give back to shareholders through repurchase. So we're very happy with how things have progressed. We don't have a magical number in terms of how much cash we should have, but all things in balance. We feel like we're executing to our strategy. Elizabeth Anderson : Perfect, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird, please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Johnson : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Joe, I wanted to start maybe on system and services, or maybe John this is for you, but where are at, as what portion of that revenue is the recurring services' side as opposed to system sales? And in 4Q, we're still hearing about a decent amount of PPP money floating around. Obviously, you've got the incremental launch coming in China and that of 5D. Should we think of 4Q being a better system quarter sequentially again, just with seasonality there? John Morici : Yeah, Jeff, this is John. We've been very pleased with our sequential improvements that we've seen in the systems and services -- in scanner services business. When we look at five quarters in a row of kind of really helping us lead the recovery out of COVID. And a lot of investments that doctors are making -- our doctors are making in the Digital Platform, there's an excellent reflection of that, we have a lot of new doctors that started Invisalign this quarter with us and many of them start with getting an iTero and being able to utilize that within their practice. So we feel very good about the scanner and services business. About a third of that business is services. So that's the reoccurring. And as we improve and have more of an installed base, that just grows that business. So you got a very big and growing installed base coupled with great products that are really driving that adoption. And especially among newer doctors coming in, they're coming in with that scanner to really incorporate that digital technology into their practice. Jeffrey Johnson : Yeah. Understood. And then Joe, maybe bigger picture question just on the return in the chair and what docs are seeing for Clear Aligner and this a line of specialty relative to braces. But we've talked more and more docs just even over the last maybe few months who seem to be really spacing those follow-up visits in Invisalign out to 3 or even 4 months. It's cutting the chair time even in half relative to pre - COVID levels and well below braces.  Are you seeing the same thing? I know virtual is helping that a little bit. I think some docs even doing it without virtual, just given their confidence and outcomes. But how much is that driving the argument in that secular push into Clear Aligner, especially with staffing issues that maybe you guys are hearing about at some of the offices, things like that? Joseph Hogan : Yeah, Jeff, that's one of the key ingredients, is the productivity of a doctor's time and the productivity of the real estate within that office. And in digital kind of situation, you can remote monitor like you do on Virtual Care, some other products that are out there and doctors are taking advantage of that. But also there's a lot of confidence doctors have too if their patients are using the Aligners they will bring them back every so often and take a look to that. That's a big part of it. Secondly, Jeff, is it -- you can actually work with less labor content, and less doctor content and people in the office. And also size of the office too. You see a whole lot of orthodontists understanding that, and really embracing it. There's a whole referral aspect to Invisalign, is once a patient has an experience with Invisalign, they are often ready to refer another patient to that doctor much more so than wires and brackets. And they said they benefit from that because they see an increase in their sales too. And we see that constantly and adapt and we focus on that, and can actually predict it to a certain extent of time. So I hope I'm answering your question, Jeff, but that is the whole idea of Digital. And then we keep talking about our Align Digital capability, and being able to service a doctor through iTero, being -- having Virtual Care on both ends, and having the kind of capability and horsepower that we can provide with our algorithms in the extent of our clinical capability, is just -- it gives us a huge amount of breadth and capability at orthodontist. Jeffrey Johnson : Sure. I understood. Thanks, guys. Joseph Hogan : Thanks [Indiscernible] Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jeffrey's, please proceed with your question. Brandon Couillard : Thanks.Good afternoon. I actually want to switch gears, you talked quite a bit about the non-case business and the retainer business. Can you help us understand why your share has historically lagged there? Maybe a sense of what your capture rate is today in terms of the cases that also have a follow-on retainer. And how would you frame the revenue opportunity from these newer initiatives? Joseph Hogan : Brian, it's a good -- it's why we highlighted it and it's obviously why we've put money into this thing and our focus on it over the last years. There's certain things in this business that we all know, but there's so many things to do and focus on it. Sometimes something it's so obvious like that, lacks the attention that you want to give to it. And we've been talking about this over time. So, beginning of this year, put a team together to really go after those things. It's hard to say the reason why. It's just we haven't been as focused on retention as we need to be. And many orthodontists, they make their own retainers.  They do it because we just haven't been competitive in the sense of how we can deliver, how fast we can deliver, how easy we make it for them. But I guarantee you if you go out Brandon and you query even orthodontist that seldom use our retainers, they'll tell you we make the best retainers in the world. And we should when we make a 750,000 unique parts a day, right? We know what we're doing. The fits are exquisite. When you have an iTero scanner, it'd be able to do that. And we've set this thing up as a play for doctors that they can feel confident that we'll get these retailers to them in a quick amount of time. They're going to be terrific retainers, something they are proud to really get to their patients. And we've had great feedback on this so far. So I can't apologize for the past or give you the whole history why we haven't done it, but I feel really good about the progress we've made so far. Brandon Couillard : Fine. And then just a question on scanner business. I mean, pretty remarkable strength for a while now. Can you just help us understand where the sources of this momentum, and is the NIRI study the type of data set that can move the needle with GP that?yield loss? can talk about clinical studies, especially within?Joel's? beginners, but just trying to get a sense of how significant you'll be able to go in and have this data there might be for a GP that doesn't use digital impressioning today, or might be on the fence. Joseph Hogan : Yeah. I think NIRI really helps. I really do. It's one of those -- you know in electronics we all know there's killer apps, right? Killer applications. When you can see?carriers?, cavities, right? We use the clinical term, but when you can see cavities without ionizing radiation and Brand of what's amazing when you see this to what happens is the enamel almost becomes invisible, it's almost translucent. You can see through the enamel right to where the carriers is. And there's certain amount of training that has to be done in order to do it and -- look, I grew up in ionizing radiation business.  I know what it is and CT and x-ray and it's that radiation component is better today than it used to be, but it's still exist and patients are still concerned with it over time and to be able to do this in a sense, in a safe way, and as a quick way like we do it. You know what it is to put bitewings in a chair. I mean, it's terrible in a dentist chair, right. Bite down, turn your head sideways. I could go through it all day. And this is a quick scan, one minute scan. minute and a half scan. It pops up on the screen. You can have a conversation with a patient, say there it is, what he deals with. So yes, I think it's a killer application. We'll convince all GPs to buy iTero, no. But then you have to look at Exocad, that critical workflow between labs and GPs really sets us up nicely for restorative pieces. Soon to announce [Indiscernible] architect, which really allows doctors to use restored of Orthodontics as a standard of care, we'll talk about that more Friday. Look, I'm biased. I've been in the -- I'd say the medical imaging equipment business for 15 years of my life count, and iTero, this is the best scanner in the marketplace. And we're just out to show it and to prove it. Brandon Couillard : Thank you. Joseph Hogan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Cooley with Stephens, please proceed with your question. Chris Cooley : Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on the record quarter. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Chris. Chris Cooley : Just from me as we all start looking forward to upcoming event here this Friday, and Saturday maybe a bigger picture question. As we think about the business you've made significant investments in technology, not only pioneering the category, but expanding its indications for use. You subsequently invested in chair-side, really facilitating the diagnostic aspect. And as the businesses now kind of inflecting here, two straight quarters of a billion dollars plus, do we think about the next stage of investment really kind of going back to a prior question being tools that enable or enhance the productivity of the clinician or patient flow. more to marketing at the consumer and clinical level? I'm just thinking about how the business now pivots for that next stage of continued growth at this greater scale. And I have just one quick follow-up after that, if I may. Joseph Hogan : Chris, it's really good question, because obviously as we're going through our AOP for next year and putting those things together. But when you say pivot.I wouldn't use the word pivot. I'd say that we extend to what we're doing. And then we place bets accordingly and where we think we'll get the best return. We -- I got to continue advertising. We have a superior system. We have a wonderful brand. We have to leverage that piece. But specifically, and this goes to last questions we had too, doctor productivity is a big deal.  And when you look at our Align Digital Platform, inherently that's what it's about. It's how do you make doctors more productive to make sure that we don't go back and forth with 8 clean checks, or how do we make sure that from our standpoint that we can respond quickly to customer issues. And we're investing heavily in all those things and making good progress. It's expensive, the lot of things that you have to do when you really grounded in software and making those changes. We have really great talent here that knows how to do that. We've been actually working the productivity of clean checking those things for 3 to 4 years. And it's just starting to bring technology to the marketplace. So you're right. We're not pivoting toward that. We've been investing in it, but you'll see the combination of that more and more as we enter next year in the second half of next year too. John, anything to add? John Morici : No. I think that's the investments that we continue to make. It's about productivity. It's about growing in this Digital orthodontics, and our doctors expected and our tools will provide that. Chris Cooley : That's great. And if I could just squeeze in a quick follow-on, just want to make sure, doesn't look out of proportion, but I just want to make sure we didn't miss something there on the deferred piece in the quarter, I think was approximately 84 million. Anything just COVID-related that we should be mindful of there is that just normal course of business when we look at the deferred revenue component for the 3Q. Thanks so much for wrapping the quarter. John Morici : Thanks, Chris. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Chris. John Morici : It's completely normal course of business, nothing COVID related within there, just deferred revenue that we'll recognize in future periods. Chris Cooley : Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ryskin : All right. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Couple of quick ones from me, but I'll try to tie them together into one. On the scanners and service revenue, I've noted that your digitally submitted cases continues to grind higher, pretty close to hitting 90%, maybe in a year or 2. I am just wondering as you continue to play iTero into the field, How often are you surplacing a second or third unit, versus getting a new one out there, versus a competitor placement where you're displacing someone else potentially. And then as a follow-on to that, sort of building off of I think Elizabeth question earlier on the supply chain. Any specific to semis that we should be thinking about, this is the question that's come up a lot some of other names, and want to make sure we tie that off as far as it relates to scanners. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Hey, Mike. From a scanner standpoint is -- obviously we have a great scanner, and I think your question asked more about saturation, more than anything. Our feeling is you got 2 million dentists out there and orthodontist. And each of them actually, if you're going to run a digital practice, you need more than one scanner, you need a scanner per chair. You think, let's just say the average doctor has three chairs and there's 2 million doctors out there, we're just touching this thing. We got a 50 thousand unit installed base. And obviously this is a growth equation. It's not one where we're looking to playing out in some time, and obviously it's a portfolio insurance over time, because the technology moves fast too. So, it creates some of its own demand through our solar system. John, I'm done. John Morici : And from a supply standpoint, obviously, we're mindful of concerns and things that go on from a global supply chain. But we feel comfortable that between the inventory we have and some of the things that we've been able to do that we can manage to, in a supply chain concerns that are out there. Michael Ryskin : All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Devin Misra with Birenberg, please proceed with your question. Doug: Hey Devin, Doug here for Ravi from Berenberg. Thanks for taking my question. I want to revisit the marketing side. I think you guys have been ramping up marketing spending and there was a long list of things with very large percentage increases noted earlier. Where are you seeing a higher ROI in regards to marketing? Are there any specific regions? And then also just going back to a question on growth of teens versus adults, if we look at the marketing spend on things that you noted, it seems like a focus is on the teen side, which is indicative that that's where you see more growth and stronger returns. So any color around that and then I have a quick follow-up. Joseph Hogan : First of all, from a marketing spend standpoint, we really do understand by region our return on investment and what we get. I'm not going to share that over the phone but we're very aware of that and what it is. We also -- when you asked about the teen advertisements, there's a seasonality for teams around the world too. So you'll see like in the quarter we just came out of and the second quarter we were going into, that's teen season.  It's big in China, big in the States. And so you'll see a larger part of our advertising budget go towards that in order to capture that demand. This is part of how we go-to-market. We have a great brand. That brand needs to be enhanced with patients and we want those patients go into doctors asking for Invisalign. We have some very good capability here from a marketing standpoint to exercise that. John? John Morici : And what we've learned over time is, we're -- it's not one size fits all across all the markets. You're trying to maximize return on investment and in certain markets you are doing things that are different than others. Maybe more established markets, you try something different. Maybe other markets that we have where we can advertise. we try different things. But I think the key is we understand what levers to pull.  We've learned a lot over the last several years. We're very excited about these opportunities. And as Joe said, we have the best brand -- best global brand out there, and we want to be able to reach those potential patients in the way that they are living their lives. That's the philosophy that we have, and we talked a lot about that front-end at top of the funnel metrics, and we're very excited about what we're seeing as we've gone due to the last several quarters. Doug: Okay, great. And then kind of following up on that direct-to-consumer focus question early on, there was launch of that team -- of teeth whitening solution and hopefully they would go to their Align shops that be litigation with the SCE. it's a focus point there. As we envision where the direct-to-consumer side of Align business goes, how does that teeth whitening solution, and -- how does that fit in? I'm trying to see -- it seems like there's a big push to a dredge consumer with the -- with that side coming up. So any color on that would be helpful. Joseph Hogan : Well, if your question implies a direct-to-consumer kind of a mode, that's not us, it's not what we do. It's not what -- but you know, we obviously have an e-commerce site. We have a great brand called Invisalign. Patients ask us all the time for whitening, cleansers, chewys, things associated with it. And what is exercising that capability? It's one with the whitening standpoint, we probably should have been more aggressive on before. But again, it's one of those things that we decided to focus on recently. And we're getting great feedback from the doctors in doing that. It only makes sense. It's classic brand extension, and we're going to leverage that and use Align brand as well as we can. Doug: Great, thanks. Joseph Hogan : Thank you. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Shirley Stacy for closing comments. Shirley Stacy : Thank you, Operator. And thank you everyone for joining us today.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the fourth quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Services Systems and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. Overall, I'm very pleased to report fourth quarter results and another record year -- full year for Align. Net revenues of $4 billion and operating margin of 24.7% were both at the high end of our guidance for fiscal 2021. For Systems and Services, full year revenues increased 90.4% over the prior year to a record $705.5 million. For Clear Aligners, full year revenues increased 54.5% over the prior year to a record $3.2 billion. During 2021, we achieved several major installed base milestones, including our 12 millionth Invisalign patient, 68,000 iTero scanners sold and 47,000 Exocad software license install. Together, these elements are the foundation of the Align Digital platform. Proprietary combination of software, systems and services designed to provide a seamless experience and workflow that integrates and connects all users, doctors, labs, patients and consumers. For Q4, revenues reflect continued strong growth and momentum from iTero scanner services revenues, particularly in North America, offset by lower-than-expected Invisalign Clear Aligner revenues. Through most of the fourth quarter, our Clear Aligner volumes were trending in line with our Q4 seasonality. However, the environment quickly changed in December with the rise of COVID-19 Omicron variant. We believe our Q4 Clear Aligners volumes were impacted by an increase in COVID-19 Omicron cases that cause customer lab shortages from a staff standpoint, practice closures or reduced hours and less patient traffic in December and that continued into Q1. This compounded an already slower seasonal period for many practices in which offices took time off in between the holidays. We estimate that our Q4 was negatively impacted by roughly 3 points of year-over-year revenue growth as a result of these factors. While there are some similarities to what we experienced 2 years ago when COVID-19 first appeared, especially in China, which currently has a 0 tolerance COVID policy, the environment today is total -- today is different. There aren't broad government-mandated shutdowns, stay-at-home orders or extended quarantines, but there is more consumer caution, self-imposed quarantines, higher inflation, less economic stimulus and supply chain shortages, which makes it more difficult to predict when recovery may occur. Nonetheless, Invisalign doctor submitters and case submissions are improving. We're working closely with our customers to support their needs and protect the health and safety of our employees. For Q4, Systems and Services revenues were up 61.3% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially, with strong revenue growth across all regions. Q4 results reflect the continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system, which we launched last year and that features innovative technology like Near Infrared technology with aid in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva without harmful radiation. The iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system represents 75% of iTero volumes in Q4. In addition, over 50% of iTero scanner sales in Q4 were sold to first-time scanner buyers who are just beginning their Align Digital Platform journey. We also continue to see growth in our iTero scanner installed base with strong service revenues, which historically have been a leading indicator of increased digital adoption among doctors. For Q4, Clear Aligners revenues were up 16.3% year-over-year with strong revenue growth across all regions and across the portfolio, including comprehensive and noncomprehensive products as well as Invisalign First, Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go products. Our fourth quarter revenues also include non-case revenue for clinical training and education, doctor prescribed retainer products and other dental consumables. During the quarter, we saw good performance from our retainer business overall, delivering strong revenue growth, along with increased enthusiasm for the doctor subscription program pilot in North America. As we mentioned last quarter, our share of the retention market is significantly underpenetrated even more so than our share of the orthodontic case starts. We have been developing a robust retainer strategy, including a separate marketing team, focused solely on driving adoption and increasing market share in the U.S. Our objective is to build brand awareness for Vivera retainers and drive engagement with doctors through clinical education and sales initiatives, while connecting consumers to doctors through demand creation programs and our concierge service. We've also recently implemented social media campaigns featuring the benefit of Vivera from the makers of Invisalign Clear Aligners. We believe that incremental investments will increase value for Invisalign practices and contribute to growth consistent with our long-term financial model target. Q4 non-case revenues also include accessories and consumables such as Aligner cases, clamshells, cleaning crystals, Invisalign Whitening Pen and other oral health products that are available on our e-commerce channel, including the Invisalign accessory store, walmart.com and amazon.com. We view these ancillary products as a natural brand extension, enabling patient and doctor behavior with the power in the Invisalign brand. Our full year results reflect continued adoption and demand for both the Invisalign system and iTero systems and services and exocad CAD/CAM software as more doctors transform their practices to digital and more consumers need to transform their smiles through doctor-directed Invisalign treatment. Now let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, full year 2021 Invisalign case volumes were up 57.6%. For Q4, Invisalign case volumes were up 11.5% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in LatAm. On a sequential basis, American shipments were down 7.9%, primarily reflecting the impact of Omicron previously described as well as a seasonally slower teen season from Q3 to Q4. We also saw higher GP and adult case volume and continued momentum from our doctor subscription plan pilot. In Q4, we pledged a $1 million donation to the American Association of Orthodontists Foundation, the charitable arm of the American Association of Orthodontists in support of the science of orthodontics. We're also investing in educational grants, programs to provide universities with greater access to all line products for education and training purposes. Through these programs, our partnership with the aligner intensive fellowship and the other in-person educational programs, we are investing in the orthodontic profession through the people who care for and treat patients directly. For Systems and Services, Q4 was a strong quarter for Americas, driven by continued adoption of iTero 5D Plus imaging system across customer channels, including our DSO partners. Services revenues continue to grow nicely, reflecting the growth of the iTero scanner installed base in North America. For the full year, international Invisalign case volume was up 51.6%. For our international business, Q4 Invisalign case volumes were up 10.7% year-over-year on tough comps compared to 2020. On a sequential basis, international shipments were up 1.7%. Notwithstanding the impact of Omicron in December, we still saw strong growth in EMEA, offset somewhat by a seasonally slower period primarily in China. For the full year, EMEA Invisalign volume was up 69.5%. For EMEA, Q4 Invisalign case volumes were up 14.9% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all markets, led by Italy and Iberia, along with continued growth in our expansion markets in Turkey, Russia, CIS and Benelux. For Q4, year-over-year Invisalign case volume in EMEA was driven by increased submissions primarily from the orthodontist channel. On a sequential basis, despite the impact of Omicron, EMEA Invisalign case volume was up 13.6%, primarily as a result of strong ortho channel performance especially in the teen market. During Q4, we began commercial operations in Africa, with our initial focus on North Africa and then plan to enter Sub-Sahara Africa and South Africa this year further broadening our expansion markets in EMEA. It's exciting opportunity for Align in this untapped and expanding totally addressable market. We're also making great progress on building our Europe and manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland, which will be our third global aligner manufacturing operation. The Europe manufacturing facility is on track to go live during the first half of 2022, further increasing our ability to efficiently provide the Invisalign system to our valued doctor customers within the European region. For Q4, we saw strong scanner shipments during the quarter as more doctors in the EMEA region continue to digitize their practices. Through a full year APAC, Invisalign case volume was up 27.1%. For Q4, APAC Invisalign case volumes led by Japan, Korea and India were up 3.4% year-over-year on tough comps despite continued COVID resurgences and lockdown sporadically impacting various APAC countries, including China. We also saw strength in the GP dentist channel with increased Invisalign submitters and in the teen market with increased submissions from the orthodontic channel. On a sequential basis, APAC was down 15.4% notwithstanding the impact of Omicron in December and Q4 seasonality in China. We had strong growth in Thailand, Southeast Asia, Taiwan. Overall, it was encouraging to see record numbers of shipments to those markets in APAC and that were not as impacted by the most severe lockdowns. In Q4, Systems and Services in APAC saw the highest percentage of iTero scanners sold to new doctors. Today, we announced new Invisalign Systems innovations for the Align Digital platform, a proprietary combination of software, systems and services, designed to provide a seamless experience and workflow that integrates and connects all users, doctors, labs, patients and consumers. These new innovations include ClinCheck live update for 3D controls; the Invisalign Practice App; Invisalign Personalized Plan, or IPP; and the Invisalign Smile Architect. We believe they will revolutionize digital treatment planning for orthodontics and restorative dentistry by providing doctors with greater flexibility, consistency of treatment preferences and real-time treatment planning access and modification capabilities. Each of these innovations is designed to enhance Invisalign treatment planning quality, efficiency and scale and contribute to better doctor patient engagement and treatment outcomes. ClinCheck live update for 3D controls enables real-time ClinCheck treatment plan modifications that improve practice productivity significantly while also improving quality of treatment plans. Invisalign practice app provides mobile integration with the Invisalign Doctor Site or IDS. It enables doctors to manage their practices at their fingertips. Invisalign's Personal Plan, or IPP, automatically applies the doctor's specific treatment preferences for comprehensive cases, enhancing efficiency and step changing treatment planning consistency. Invisalign Smile Architect software is designed for GP dentists to create and visualize orthodontic restorative treatment plans for their patients using iTero digital scans and wide smile photos on the Invisalign Go platform. The technical design assessment go-to-market is scheduled for Q4 '22. We know that every Invisalign trained doctor has distinct preferences. Every patient is unique and every treatment plan can vary depending on a variety of factors such as the type of malocclusion, patient age and desired outcome. Because of that, doctors spend time planning and reviewing and modifying their ClinCheck plans and it multiplies with practice growth. IPP and ClinCheck live update for 3D controls are game-changing innovations that represent a step change in digital treatment planning to help doctors achieve more personalized ClinCheck treatment plans. By using 3D controls, doctors can see greater efficiency with changes reflected in real time. Invisalign Smile Architect combines basically driven in ortho restorative treatment planning within the power of ClinCheck software, providing flexibility across treatment planning to address a variety of patient needs, whether it may be orthodontic, restorative or ortho restorative combined. It allows doctors to share their vision with patients and use digital technology and tools to achieve the best quality clinical outcomes for their patients. It's through the convergence of advancements in digital technology, Align's unique capabilities and know-how, and data from millions of Invisalign patients that we\u2019re able to bring these new Invisalign innovations to our customers this year. The journey to deliver a ClinCheck live update in Invisalign Personal Plan has taken thousands of combined person years of development, testing and learning. It is only possible through the experience data and insights we have gained from over 12 million Invisalign cases. Across our innovations, we're also using a combination of AI and automation to reimagine what the treatment planning experience looks like for our doctors, doctor customers and augmenting their expertise and experience to help them create and personalize and modify Invisalign treatment plans more efficiently and more consistently than ever before. What used to take several days can now be accomplished in just a few minutes, and it's a huge productivity win for doctors and their patients. Our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to Invisalign doctors offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. Consumer interest in the Invisalign brand remains high, and we are continuing to invest in building the brand in key markets and customer segments. This includes investments in social media as an effective channel to increase awareness and interest for Invisalign treatment. We're continuing to work closely with our media partners to reach consumers with the right creative and compelling campaigns, optimize our buys and test new approaches. In Q4, we continued to build on our successful \"Invis is\" multi-media campaign across the Americas, EMEA and APAC and drove awareness and interest in Invisalign treatment with adult, teen and parent consumer segments. Globally, we delivered record impression volume with over 8 billion impressions, representing 84% year-over-year growth and 21.7 million unique visitors to our website, a 127% increase year-over-year. In the U.S., we amplified our campaigns across the top social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube to increase awareness with teens about Invisalign treatment. Our campaigns continue to feature some of the largest teen influencers from our Invisalign Smile Squad, such as Collins, Devon Key, Charli D'Amelio and Michael Lay, each of whom share their personal experiences with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smiles with Invisalign aligners. Our consumer marketing programs also include connecting with teams within gaming, specifically on Twitch, with a customized integration that was awarded the gold medal in the Annual Internationalist Awards for innovation in digital marketing solutions. To continue growing our young adult business across the Americas, EMEA and APAC, we built upon our successful \"Invis Is a Powerful Thing\u201d campaign, which highlights the power of Invisalign treatment transformation for every young adult self confidence. Our integrated media plans across YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok connected with young adults in the media channels, they consume the most. In Brazil, we continue to amplify our \"Invis Is a Powerful Thing\" powerful thing campaign, featuring mega influencer, Ta\u00eds Araujo, driving a 400% year-over-year increase in web traffic. In the EMEA region, we successfully expanded into new markets such as Italy in the Netherlands. To complement our integrated media plan with Google and YouTube, we also leverage newer media channels such as TikTok and Snapchat to drive engagement with consumers resulting in more than 170% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. We continue to expand our investment in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in a 192% year-over-year increase in unique visitors and a 235% year-over-year increase in impressions. We continue to strengthen our investments in Australia leveraging leading influencers featured in premium placements in TikTok and also YouTube. In Japan, we continue to see strong response from consumers as evidenced by 117% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. Lastly, we expanded our advertising investments in India and Taiwan, which generated a strong consumer response. We saw 1,200% and 628% increase in impressions and a 470% and 116% increase in unique visitors to our website in India and Taiwan, respectively. Adoption of our consumer and patient app, My Invisalign continued to increase with 1.4 million downloads to date. Usage of our 4 digital tools continues to increase. For example, in addition to My Invisalign just mentioned, the Invisalign virtual appointment tool was used over 14,000x and our insurance verification feature was used 20,000x in Q4. Further, globally, we received more than 45,000 patient photos in our virtual care feature globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our AI capabilities and improve our services for doctors and patients. Our Systems and Services business, Q4 revenues grew 61.3% year-over-year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services up 21% sequentially. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for our Systems and Services business. And I as mentioned earlier, over 50% of scanner sales in Q4 were the first time iTero scanner buyers. We're pleased to see doctors continue to go digital and invest in the Align digital platform. The iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system continued to gain traction across all regions with the most recent launch in China during Q4. The series expands the portfolio of iTero Element scanners and imaging systems to include new solutions that more broadly serve the needs of doctors and patients in the dental market. A strong indicator of digital acceleration within the dental offices is a number of intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions. Total worldwide inter-oral digital scan submitted to start an Invisalign case in Q4 increased to 85.4% from 79.3% in Q4 last year. International inter-oral digital scans for Invisalign case submissions increased 80.8%, up from 73.7% in the same quarter last year. For the Americas, 89.1% of Invisalign cases were submitted using an inter-oral digital scan compared to 84% in the same quarter last year. Cumulatively, over 50 million orthodontic scans and 10.3 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. With continued growth of the iTero scanner at 68,000 scanners sold worldwide as of Q4, approximately 30% is services revenue, which includes reoccurring revenue subscriptions, CAT scan software and ancillary products. And we continue to make improvements in our scanner and imaging systems, making iTero systems and service as an integral part of orthodontic and GP dentist workflow. For example, we streamlined the Invisalign case submission process with the iTero Element 5D imaging systems Auto Upload functionality. Turning to exocad. For Q4 Systems and Services, revenues also include exocad CAD/CAM products and services. exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design extends our digital dental solutions and broadens Align's digital platform towards a fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows. Cumulatively, as Q4 exocad now has over 47,000 software license worldwide. During the quarter, exocad announced the release of ChairsideCAD 3.0 Galway. It's a next generation of easy-to-use CAD software for single-visit dentistry. With this new release, exocad offers dentist design tools for a vast range of indications with a wide choice of integrated devices. Also during the quarter, exocad announced the availability of ChairsideCAD 3.0 Galway software in the U.S. and Canada, where the software is now available in North America, EU and other selected markets. Exocad\u2019s ChairsideCAD is groundbreaking open architecture CAD software for single-visit dentistry. It received the 2021 Cellerant best-of-class technology award from Cellerant Consulting Group during the quarter as well. This is the third consecutive year that ChairsideCAD has been recognized for this award. With that, I'll now turn this over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.31 billion, up 1.5% from the prior quarter and up 23.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of $815.3 million were down 2.7% sequentially due to lower Invisalign volumes, partially offset by slightly higher ASPs and up 16.3% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth across all geographies and higher ASPs. In Q4, we shipped 631,100 Invisalign cases, a decrease of 3.7% sequentially, an increase of 11.1% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to 83,500 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which over 6,400 were to first-time customers. Q4 comprehensive volume increased 13.1% year-over-year and decreased 4.5% sequentially. And Q4 noncomprehensive volume increased 6.6% year-over-year and decreased 1.7% sequentially. Q4 adult patients increased 10.4% year-over-year and increased 0.1% sequentially. In Q4, teens or younger patients increased 13% year-over-year and decreased 11.8% sequentially. Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $11.4 million or approximately 1.4 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.2 points. For Q4, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional liners, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher discounts. Q4 Invisalign noncomprehensive ASPs decreased sequentially and increased year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign noncomprehensive ASPs were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign noncomprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional liners and product mix, partially offset by higher discounts. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $68.5 million or 6.9% sequentially and $332.9 million or 45.8% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Our Systems and Services revenues for the fourth quarter were a record $215.8 million, up 21% sequentially and up 61.3% year-over-year. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. The increase sequentially can be attributed to increased scanner shipments and increased service revenues from our larger installed base. The increase year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, increased service revenues from our larger installed base as well as higher ASPs from the favorable mix shift towards higher-priced iTero 5D scanners and imaging systems. Our Systems and Services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up $42.6 million or 22.8% sequentially and up $116.2 million or 102.6% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferred -- and the deferral of services revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 72.2%, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 0.9 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, overall, gross margin was 72.6% for the fourth quarter, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 0.9 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.1 points on a year-over-year basis and by approximately 0.4% sequentially due to foreign exchange. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.2%, down 2 points sequentially due to higher freight costs and additional aligners, along with lower primary shipments, partially offset by higher ASPs. Clear Aligner gross margin was down 0.6 points year-over-year due to higher additional aligners and higher freight costs, partially offset by higher ASPs and improved manufacturing absorption due to higher volumes. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.7%, down 0.9 points sequentially, primarily due to higher freight costs and increased component costs, partially offset by higher ASP from 5D Plus mix and higher service revenues. Systems and Services gross margin was up 0.4 points year-over-year due to higher ASP from higher mix of iTero 5D Plus and higher service revenues, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased component costs. We are actively engaged in activities to mitigate supply disruptions by expanding supplier communications, modifying our purchase order coverage and increasing inventory levels for key components. Q4 operating expenses were $523.7 million, up sequentially 6% and up 31.8% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up by $29.7 million. Year-over-year operating expenses increased by $126.4 million, reflecting increased headcount and our continued investment in marketing, sales, in R&D activities and other investments commensurate with business growth. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $494.4 million, up sequentially 6.1% and up 32.8% year-over-year due to the reasons described earlier. Our fourth quarter operating income of $220.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 21.4%, down 4.3 points sequentially and down 4.1 points year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year decreases in operating margin are primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 24.7%, down 4.1 points sequentially and down 4.3 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was a loss of $0.9 million, down sequentially by $1.7 million and down year-over-year by $2.2 million. The GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 13.2% compared to 30.9% in the third quarter and 25.9% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.5% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.2% in the third quarter and 14.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior fourth quarter. The fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates reflected an out-of-period adjustment, which reduced our tax rate by 7.3% and 6.3%, respectively. Fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $2.40, up sequentially $0.12 and up $0.40 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.83 for the fourth quarter, down $0.04 sequentially and up $0.22 year-over-year. For the full year, net income per diluted share was $9.69, down $12.72 year-over-year due to the onetime tax benefit in 2020 of approximately $1.5 billion associated with our corporate structure reorganization completed during the first quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $11.22 for the full year, up $5.97 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1.3 billion, up sequentially $58.8 million and up $335.8 million year-over-year. Of our $1.3 billion balance, $582.9 million was held in the U.S. and $713.8 million was held by our international entities. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $897.2 million, up approximately 4.9% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 78 days, up approximately 3 days sequentially and up approximately 7 days as compared to Q4 last year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $272.8 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $109.1 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner manufacturing capability -- capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $163.8 million. In November 2021, we purchased $100 million of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase, which was approximately 0.2 million shares at an average price of $666.53 per share. We have approximately $725 million remaining available for repurchase under our May 13, 2021, $1 billion repurchase program. Before I move to our outlook, I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2021 results. In 2021, we shipped a record 2.5 million Invisalign cases, up 54.8% year-over-year. This reflects 51.6% volume growth from our international doctors and 57.6% volume growth from our Americas doctors. Total revenues were a record $4 billion, up 59.9% year-over-year with Clear Aligner revenues a record $3.2 billion, up 54.5% year-over-year. 2021 Systems and Services revenue were a record $705.5 million compared to $370.5 million in 2020, up 90.4% year-over-year. Full year 2021 GAAP operating income of $976.4 million was up 152.2% versus 2020, and operating margin at 24.7% versus 15.7% in 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, 2021 operating margin was 27.9% versus 20.3% in 2020. 2021 interest income and other income and expense net of $36 million included the SmileDirectClub arbitration award gain of $43.4 million. Excluding the SmileDirectClub arbitration award gain, interest and other income and expense was $7.4 million expense on a non-GAAP basis. With regards to full year tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 23.7%. The full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 18.5% compared to 17.6% for 2020. 2021 diluted EPS was $9.69. On a non-GAAP basis, 2021 diluted EPS was $11.22. Free cash flow was $771.4 million for 2021, up $264.2 million versus 2020. Overall, we are pleased with our Q4 results and another record year for Align. We delivered strong growth and profitability, in line with our guidance despite disruptions late in the quarter from Omicron and others factors. Our Q4 revenue year-over-year growth was within our long-term model despite disruptions impacting roughly 3 points of growth. We continue to see strong momentum and demand for our Systems and Services throughout Q4, with the majority of scanners being sold to first-time buyers. We believe this is a good leading indicator of future Invisalign growth as our customers continue to invest in digital technology even during COVID. Let me turn to our outlook. We would normally expect sequentially higher Invisalign revenues and lower Systems and Services revenue, consistent with the typical Q1 seasonality. However, due to the continued impact of Omicron into Q1, we now expect our total Q1 revenue to be slightly down sequentially. We remain confident in our strategy, our huge underpenetrated market opportunity, our industry leadership and our ability to execute. These factors have guided our approach throughout the pandemic, where we continue to invest in new technology, commercial expansion and manufacturing capabilities to drive our growth. We plan to continue these investments in Q1 and therefore, expect our Q1 operating margin to be less than 20%. In addition, during Q1 2020 -- 2022, we expect to repurchase up to $75 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. Turning to full year 2022. Despite Omicron headwinds, we expect 2022 revenue growth to be in line with our long-term model range of 20% to 30%. Our 2022 guidance assumes no significant new COVID surges after the current wave. No meaningful practice disruptions nor material supply chain issues throughout the year. On a GAAP basis, we anticipate our 2022 operating margin to be around 24%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 2022 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization from certain acquisitions. For 2022, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $350 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building in construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in a Clear Aligner manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland, which is expected to begin serving doctors in 2022 as part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. Overall, despite the disruption from the Omicron in December, we delivered a record year with strong revenue growth and operating margin, in line with our guidance for the full year on top of a record Q4 and 2020 a year ago. As you look back, I wanted to take a moment to recognize our accomplishments and thank our employees and our customers for another remarkable year. In the face of ongoing challenges related to COVID-19 and economic uncertainty, we remain steadfast in our commitment to our employees, customers and the focused execution of our strategic initiatives, and our customers remain confident in our ability to support them. Operating in this environment has not been easy, but after 2 years of navigating uncharted waters, the Align team is more agile and resilient than ever. In 2021, we met our goals and achieved numerous milestones. Globally, we delivered across each of our strategic priorities, which are highlighted in our Q4 '21 webcast slides. Our performance over the last year reaffirms the incredible size of our target market, and demonstrates that our strategy and investment in recent years are validated by the trust and faith our customers place in us. In 2022, we must continue to extend our leadership in digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry through relentless execution of our strategic initiatives, focusing on expanding our commercial, manufacturing, R&D, clinical, treatment planning and manufacturing operations, and building our quality and regulatory muscle globally in existing and emerging markets, reaching millions of consumers who want to transform their smiles using the most advanced Clear Aligner system in the world through the right investments in advertising, PR, digital, social media and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion through Invisalign trained doctors. Invisalign ortho adoption and teen utilization of Invisalign treatment and training and educating GP dentists on how the iTero Element family of inter-oral scanners and imaging systems can propel today's dental practice into the future by enhancing patient experience and elevating clinical precision, and on the benefits of digital dentistry with the Invisalign system trusted by more than 12 million people worldwide to transform smiles. We remain mindful of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and the challenges that go with it. While there is still uncertainty, it has become increasingly clear over the last year with the first spread of the Delta variant, now Omicron, that COVID-19 may never fully go away and may be a virus that persist in one variant form or another for the foreseeable future. And like other viruses, new or different vaccines will be needed and new therapies will be developed to minimize the impact and treat COVID-19 more effectively in our most vulnerable populations. The reality of living with COVID is one of the government's businesses and communities all over the world are beginning to acknowledge and move towards, and at Align, we will do the same. In closing, I'm going to share some thoughts that I expressed to our employees recently. What we learn in life, both in business and our personal lines, is that we're not fully in control of our environment and destiny. This is a fact of life that we face every day, but not being in control does not mean that we can't make good choices regardless of the situation or challenges we all face. We must look forward focused on the opportunities. Align has numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpenetrated market. And while we continue to see some lasting impact and continued uncertainty due to COVID-19, we remain confident in both the enormous opportunity to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry. We never forget that digital orthodontics presents the fastest growing and largest market in the world of medical devices. We have the greatest Clear Aligner system, scanners, GP lab software in the world and the broadest and deepest digital dental platform. We have the most recognized consumer brand in the largest direct sales force in the dental space with over 4,000 salespeople supporting over 212,000 doctors and labs and their staff, who have incredible skills and dedication to their patients. We have an amazing team of employees committed to our purpose. It's a unique opportunity unlike anything I've ever seen in my career. They both continue to grow Align and be part of the positively changing millions of lives by transforming their smiles. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to speaking to you again as the year progresses. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Joe, thanks for all the details on the outlook. You called out the 300 basis point headwind from COVID in the quarter, with the impact, I think, concentrated in December. So maybe a bit higher as we think about what the headwind was exiting the year. Could you maybe talk about how the impact in January as compared to what you experienced in December? And can you maybe elaborate on what you've seen in recent weeks? I'm just looking for a sense of maybe where January is trending and kind of what you're assuming for the balance of the quarter to get you to the guidance that you gave for 1Q? Joe Hogan : Nathan, look, we saw what we talked about in December, we had a rapid decrease through COVID. But what we've seen as we've gone into January is just a progressive improvement. And we feel good about that. We feel it's moving in the right way. And it's in direct correlation. We track it around the country with what's going on with Omicron in certain states and certain regions. And remember, this is in just the United States. We've seen this all over the world. We see it in APAC, and we see it in Europe too when we track it. Nathan Rich : Okay. And maybe just building on that at a high level, Joe, do you feel like the slowdown, I guess, is primarily a supply issue, just given the practice closures and lockdowns and staffing issues that you cited versus a demand issue? Because I think in your prepared remarks, you also mentioned some impacts from inflation and less stimulus. So I was just curious to kind of get your thoughts there. Joe Hogan : No, we don't see this as a demand issue. I mean, we look at the market as we always have. That's why we reasserted our 20%, 30% growth rate for this year. So this is not a demand equation issue or you call it a supply, but I'd call it demand from a patient standpoint. We just see it's patients and doctors in the sense of cancellations, availability and all those things that COVID has impacted around. So we remain very confident. That's why you see us to continue to make investments, the things we announced today. We feel really good about the business. We just have to get through this first quarter and what we talked about, and we'll move on. We feel really good about it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : Just maybe a follow-up on that -- the question on planning assumptions around your Q1 comments and 2022 guidance. Maybe, Joe, if you could just give a sense as to how -- you mentioned improvements in early January. Is this kind of sluggish recovery wrapping up by the end of the quarter? Is Q2 the inflection to help you get to that 20%, 30% growth that you mentioned? And then just if I could also on a similar topic. Just the idea that somehow there is -- you've -- I think many of the folks on the call heard this idea that somehow there was outsized growth due to the pandemic, and we're sort of digesting that somehow now, which I know it's sort of one of the ways that folks look at Align and aligners and so on. If you could maybe just talk about your confidence that, once we get through the staffing that the demand that's in front of you of the growth drivers that you're laying in on top of your core markets, that we're not looking to digest some sort of outsized growth during the pandemic here in '22, but we're getting back to a growth market that's still highly underpenetrated? Sorry for the lengthy 2-part question, but I would appreciate it. Joe Hogan : We understand the basis of your question, Matt. That's not a problem in that sense. Look, as I mentioned before, we're really confident in demand equation in the sense of Clear Aligners and Invisalign. What we're experiencing right now is obviously somewhat of a slowdown in our order demand pattern based on what we see through the virus that's going on around the world. As soon as that clears and we see it clearing around the world, and as I mentioned, we see January improving over December, we're very confident in demand models that we've expressed for this business over the last several years. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : I guess on the first side, I think you obviously talked about some of the increased investments that you're making on marketing and also in sales capacity, et cetera. How do we think about the conversion efforts of those initiatives versus sort of prior -- and sort of where do you sort of see that hitting in terms of as we're thinking about the pacing of the year? Joe Hogan : Yes. I mean the pacing of the year, I mean we continue to invest, as we mentioned, John mentioned, I mentioned too in marketing. Where we invest? We understand the returns that we get, no matter what the country is or what kind of media we use in order to go after consumers. So we've been very consistent in the sense of that investment. And we move money around based on where we see the most opportunity. John, anything to add? John Morici : And we -- as we mentioned, we added some sales resources in Q4 to get ahead of sales territories and changes and so on. We saw that show up in Q4, but it really gives us the opportunity then to be able to grow as we get into this year. So it's continued investments to drive the biggest return and that's what we're continuing to do. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay. So it sounds like maybe no change in sort of the pacing that we've been seeing before. Maybe as a follow-up, I know you obviously highlighted that the total growth of the company would be in your 20% to 30% range. Do you also see that the case growth on a year-over-year basis would be above 20% as you look out at this point? John Morici : We'd expect them to be similar. When we talk about 20% to 30%, we're talking about revenue for the entire company, but they would be similar from an outlook standpoint. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block : Maybe just the first one. The outmargin compression year-over-year, the 24.7-ish gap that is to the 24%. Maybe you could talk to that, John, I was just going to say it's a gross margin thing with scanners likely to grow much faster than case vol. But to Elizabeth's question, it seems like you expect both to be within the guardrails of 20% to 30%. So is it more a function of you guys just sort of, call it, running a little bit harder on the OpEx line to drive that case volume and why we would see that year-over-year OM compression. Again, I'm just sort of referring gap-to-gap for apples-to-apples? John Morici : I think, Jon, it's continued investments like we have with the story to continue to invest that we have and being able to be able to grow into this market. So I think when we look at it overall, we're kind of pegging the GAAP rate to be at 24% for 2022, and we'll evaluate and update as we go forward. But it's continuing to invest. We've got, as you know, our Poland facility going live in 2022. And we have some of those moving parts that will impact our gross margin slightly as a result of that, but -- and that translates to op margin. But those are the initiatives that we have, but nothing out of the ordinary that we've done in the past. Jon Block : Okay. Heads up this next one is going to be long, probably 2 parts. But maybe can you just get people comfortable with the fact that if you look at your 2Q, 3Q, 4Q '21 case files and the implied guidance for 1Q, to get to 20% to 30% case volumes for the year, you're going to have to rip sequentially in 2Q, 3Q, 4Q of '22. Maybe if you could talk to that? And then the other sort of third question, if you would admittedly is I'm confused on the 3 points. So if 4Q was impacted by 3 points of growth, why don't you we capture, I don't know, 2 or 3 points of that in 1Q '22? Where are those cases going if they're not showing up in the next possible quarter? John Morici : I think I'll maybe start with the last part of your question, Jon. When you think of what's happened in the world with Omicron and the effects of that, it's affecting parts of the world at different paces. You see it even within the U.S. Northeast maybe gets hit with it first. It starts to open up later. After that, maybe other parts of the country get impacted. So it's not like it just happens and you immediately get it back. It comes down to when people are able to go to work, in this case, at doctors' offices to be able to provide care and then it comes down to when patients feel comfortable to be able to go back in. And so it's not an immediate effect in how we look at it. So think of -- and what we've learned from kind of COVID 1.0, the first time we saw this, we know that there's an impact, and then there's a recovery period -- and that's our best view of that recovery period. Joe Hogan : John, on your your other part about you have the rest of the year, we understand that. I mean we've modeled it out. Remember, our comparisons are a little better in second half than they were first half when you look at what we did in 2021 in the first half of the year. So look, we wouldn't make that prediction if we didn't think it was feasible based on what we've seen and what we've modeled. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Jeff Johnson : Just a couple of questions here for me. I guess one, John, in 2021, you guys were talking about being within your LRP, but at the upper end of that, do you want to put any quality buyers on kind of the LRP for 2022. It feels like kind of low end, given where 1Q is starting. But one, do you want to put any qualifiers around where within that LRP you'd expect to be? And two, just to go back to the last 2 questions again. I feel like I'm talking to my 10-year-old kid here, so apologies, but I'm going to give you one more chance. Do you feel like case shipments can still grow within that LRP this year too, not just revenue because you've got some of the new products you're selling, plus you've got faster iTero growth than that, but case shipments also can be within that 20% to 30% LRP. I just want to make sure I'm hearing that correctly. John Morici : I can answer both of those, Jeff, in terms of the 20% to 30%. We're not going to call kind of high low on that. We're kind of reaffirming our 20% to 30%, similar to what we talked about at Investor Day despite some of the things that we've talked about here with Omicron in some of those cases and so on. But when we look at Invisalign case volume, we would expect to be in and above that range. So nothing out of the ordinary from what we expect. We don't see -- our ASPs were very similar to what they were in the prior quarter, provided that there's not FX or other things that we're not projecting now. And if there's no change there, we would expect to be in that range as well. Jeff Johnson : Fair enough. And then, Joe, maybe kind of just update us on kind of the competitive landscape. We've seen a couple of DSO contracts get announced here from others in the last few months and maybe some talk over in China about some growing competition or slowing end markets in that. But where do you see your end markets across the globe from a competitive standpoint? Would just love to hear your update there? Joe Hogan : Jeff, I think from a competitive standpoint, nothing's really changed. As we look out there, you can see the tech we just announced this week, we move on in the sense of our capabilities, what we can do. My position has always been that competition isn't really affecting us from a price standpoint. I think you see that in what we're doing. But they do serve to help to broaden the market and increase the market and make -- increase the awareness. So we feel we are -- in this kind of competitive environment, we're doing well, and we lead in this sense and there's nothing as we go into 2022 that I won't reflect on it's changed competitively than what I've seen over the last 3 years. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger : John, two quick ones for you. I think you said that the receivable DSOs were up about 7 days year-over-year. Can you just expand on that? Was that -- were you providing some extra inducements to practices or anything to be concerned about there? John Morici : Nothing to be concerned. We're in a fortunate cash position as a company to be able to generate a lot of CFOA and free cash flow. And in working with doctors to be able to give them more flexibility, sometimes we'll extend payments. But we've actually seen historically low amount of past dues as we've gone through this time period in 2021. So we feel very comfortable with that. It's just working with doctors to kind of meet their cash flow needs, but nothing out of the ordinary. John Kreger : Okay. Great. And then one other one to clarify. I think you said that you expect the EBIT margin to be under 20% in the first quarter. Was that GAAP or non-GAAP? John Morici : That's GAAP. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Jason Bednar : Joe, just real quick, and I asked whether you can confirm you said January improved over December. I thought I heard you say that earlier in the call? Or is it just that the January trend line showed improvement as the month unfolded? Sorry for just clarifying that something nuanced like that here. John Morici : Yes. I think to clarify, Jason, the month end showed improvement versus December. It was -- it's how COVID spreads across, whether it's one country or parts of countries and so on and how it affects the staff and how it affects the patients in. But as we exited, we're in a better trend line than we started the month with. Jason Bednar : Okay. Understood. And then maybe as a follow-up to an earlier question, really for Joe or John. I know you often talk about the internal investments you keep making in the business, you talked about running a similar growth algorithm here in '22 as you have in the past. But we also have 2 different case examples here of the market with pre-COVID, a lot of those resources were helping funding faster growth in your team business. And then the last 18 months during the pandemic, adult demand has really taken off and growing faster than teens. So I guess my question here is, as you went through your year-end planning and you're obviously resourcing this business in another significant way here in '22, how do you approach it for this year? Is it from a sales force add marketing plan and whatnot? Is it -- are you really with respect to how you're thinking about the adult and teen mix that you're expecting for this year? Joe Hogan : I mean we're -- it's Joe, Jason. I mean there's no big change in the sense of what we think the critical drivers are that we have to invest in to drive growth. Where we invest and how we invest is really important. When you look at technology, when you look at consumer pieces, however, parts of those demand inflations you want to go to. But remember, there are certain ratios that we always hold to in this business, its that what we invest in. And we hold ourselves accountable for those ratios and that performance from a profitability standpoint.  But I can't overstate the importance of having a strong sales force. We talked about additional sales people that we are putting in place. Our consumer brand means a lot in the sense of our growth. And that's becoming more and more sophisticated in the sense of where we spend those dollars and how we spend those dollars. But leading in technology, you have to have technology in this business, and that's why we're excited to really announce what we did today. We've been working on these programs for 3 years or more. And these are game breakers in the sense of how you interface with a doctor and how a doctor interface with patients. John Morici : And I would just add to that, Jason. We're investing with that return on investment in mind. That's how we look at our long-term growth model. And when we make investments, we have that in mind. In some countries, you're going deeper, you're adding more salespeople to get closer to doctors and really talk to drive that utilization. In other areas where you don't have a direct sales force, you're just adding and just trying to get the breadth in there.  And then we've been talking about a lot of the marketing activities and other things that we do to drive that awareness in some of those markets and coupled with the research and development investments. Some of it operations, again, to get closer to our customers like in Poland. So it's a multitude of investments, but we look at it with how do we generate the best return and there's multiple different ways that we do it across these functions. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Jason. Operator, we'll take one more call, please? Operator : Sure. The last question we have is from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : John, you've talked about freight costs for a few quarters now. Any chance you're planning a less price increase this year to help offset some of that? It's been a few years since you've taken less pricing? John Morici : Yes, it's a good question. We are seeing freight -- it looks like many companies have. We have a lot of plans in place to drive productivity. The operating team is very aware of our cost inputs and where we can drive productivity, getting closer to our customers, like we talk in Poland. Once we get there, that will be a freight savings. And once we're operational there, and that will help. But we haven't really finalized any plans on a price increase. We'll evaluate as we go through. And the first people that we talked to would be our customers. But you're right, we understand the price is important, but we're also very sensitive to our customers and what they've had to go through as we've been on this COVID journey. So nothing in the works now. Brandon Couillard : Okay. And then Joe, on Ontario, I appreciate the detail as far as more than 50% of placements being new buyers. I would actually expect that to be normally the case. So what's the relevancy of that metric? Is that up a lot compared to historical levels? And what percent of those placements are being used for Invisalign case submissions? Joe Hogan : Over the years, Brandon, we've obviously seen that correlation, and we've communicated it to you in a sense if you sell more iTero scanners, you sell more Invisalign. And that's obviously, the front end of our digital system and it works for us really well. We just had to side the 50% because, one, you saw we had a very strong fourth quarter for iTero. And we always have strong fourth quarters. So this was exceptional in that sense. And it was a good signal from the practices that we're dealing with that this had to do with the day-to-day flow that you see from an Invisalign patient standpoint, it had nothing to do with their enthusiasm in the sense of embracing the digital environment that we're talking about. And so to see the number of sales that we had really in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, it was just a good signal for us. And we wanted to share that with you is that this market is embracing digital even when it's under pressure, and we're performing really well in that area. As far as 50%, whatever and how, I don't know exactly what the historical percentages are in that way. But we're -- obviously, what we're excited about is once those scanners are in place, it gives us a good foundation to sell Invisalign. Operator : And we have reached the end of our question and session. I now turn the call back over to Shirley Stacy for closing remarks. Shirley Stacy : Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings. If you have any questions or follow-up, please contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Align Technology\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our Q1 results and discuss the performance of our two operating segments; Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial performance and our view for the remainder of the year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. Overall, the first quarter proved to be a tougher-than-expected operating environment globally and we believe our results primarily reflect three key factors; the continued impact of COVID-19 waves in every region and especially in China, with its restrictions and lockdowns under their Zero COVID policy; a weaker economic environment and waning consumer confidence driven by increasing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions; and the military conflict in the Ukraine and fallout across Europe. In addition, with approximately half our business occurring outside the United States, unfavorable foreign exchange rates negatively impacting our revenues, margins, and EPS. Notwithstanding these headwinds, Q1 2022 total revenues of $973.2 million were up 8.8% year-over-year compared to Q1 2021 revenues of $894 million with a growth rate of 62% year-over-year. Our Q1 2022 operating income was $198 million and operating margin was 20.4%. In Q1, Systems and Services revenues were up 15.6% year-over-year, but down 24% sequentially coming off our sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth and record scanner and services revenue. Sequential results primarily reflect lower volumes from our aforementioned headwinds and from seasonality as Q4 is historically a stronger capital equipment sales quarter. For Q1, Clear Aligner revenues were up 7.5% year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth across regions and products and were down slightly sequentially from Q4 at minus 0.7%. In the teen segment, 175,000 teen started treatment with Invisalign Aligners, up 6% year-over-year. Invisalign First for kids as young as six years old grew sequentially year-over-year and was strong across all regions. Q1 non-case revenues would include doctor-prescribed retention products, clinical training and education and other dental consumables performed well and grew both year-over-year and sequentially. Our Doctor Subscription Plan, or DSP, pilot was launched last year in the United States and Canada, and it continues to ramp nicely, driving strong revenue growth. DSP is a monthly subscription program, designed for a segment of experienced Invisalign doctors, who are not regularly using our retainers or low-stage aligners. We're very excited about the feedback and uptake we're seeing, and we'll expand the program into other markets this year Here are just a few things from doctors who are saying about DSP. Dr. De Ferris in Santa Barbara, California, 'we have shifted our retention model and workflow. We really like the material, the fit and the precision of the product and having everything in Align systems versus printing in-house and having to maintain it ourselves.' Dr. Sandra Tai, in Vancouver, Canada, 'This program fits my business model very well. I'm able to pass savings to patients.' Now let's turn to the specifics around the first quarter results, starting with the Americas. For Q1, Invisalign case volumes were down 1.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Americas case volumes were down 4.3%, primarily reflecting the impact from COVID-19 waves. First experience in North America beginning in Q4 2021 and continue into Q1 and later in Latin America, causing consumers customer staffing shortages and practice closures as well as decreased patient traffic and increased deployment cancellations. The latest data from the gauge practice analysis tool that collect and consolidates data from about 700 ortho practices, covering more than 1,000 orthodontists across 1,600 locations in the United States and Canada, showed weakening underlying patient demand trends in the first quarter for both adult and teens and across wires and brackets and Clear Aligner products. New patient visits were down 7.6% year-over-year ortho starts were down 7.2% year-over-year. In the DSO channel, in Q1 2022, DSO practices grew faster than non-DSO practices with utilization led by Heartland and Smile Doctors. Earlier this month, we announced a new DSO partnership with Dental Corp, Canada's largest and fastest-growing network of dental practices. Dental Corp plans to extend its offering of Invisalign brand, Clear Aligner treatment to Canadians nationwide through its ortho acceleration program. This strategic collaboration also provides dental course network of doctors across nearly 460 practices with access to enhanced benefits, dedicated learning opportunities, and treatment planning support for the Invisalign system. Also this month, we launched a new Invisalign Teen subscription program in the United States and Canada to help unlock the massive opportunity from teen orthodontics, which makes up approximately 75% of the 5 million annual case starts in North America. The teen subscription program enables orthodontists to buy Clear Aligners in case packs in advance, much like the way they buy wires and brackets today, offering simple and more predictable billing for doctors. It also includes exclusive practice development benefits with the Invisalign brand and requires an incremental volume commitment from doctors. The timing of the new teen program coincides with the beginning of the summer teen season, and we're excited to continue partnering with doctors to grow their practice with Invisalign treatment with less than 10% share of teen case starts, the teen subscription program has the potential to help accelerate Invisalign adoption in the largest segment of the orthodontic market teams.  For our international business, Q1 Invisalign case volumes were up 3% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, international case volumes were down 6.1%, primarily reflecting the headwinds described earlier, especially the impact of COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in China in the fallout across Europe from the military conflict in Ukraine. For EMEA, Q1 Invisalign case with core growth in our core markets led by Italy and Germany and doc, along with the growth expansion markets led by Turkey and EMEA. The Q1 year-over-year Invisalign case volume in EMEA was driven by increased emissions, primarily from the orthodontist channel, especially in the teen market. During the quarter, we launched our first ever directed teen campaign in EMEA focused on educating teens about the benefits in Invisalign treatment over traditional wires and brackets, increasing consumer demand as part of our wider teen growth plan, combined with our parent of teen campaign and to help give teens critical influence in the parent decision by driving peer word of mouth.  More recently, we launched the Invisalign Go Express system, the latest addition to the Invisalign Go portfolio for general dentists. First launched in EMEA in 2016 as a 20-stage aligner treatment offering, the Invisalign Go portfolio system is designed for general dentists to treat mild to moderate malocclusions, to integrate tooth alignment into restorative and comprehensive dental care. Additionally, building of our European manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Polar remains on track to go live this quarter, increasing our flexibility and timeliness in supporting our value doctor customers across the EMEA region. Turning to APAC for Q1. APAC Invisalign case volumes were up 4.7% year-over-year. With strengthened the GP dentist channel, primarily through increased Invisalign submissions with the Invisalign Go product and in the teen market with increased submissions from the orthodontic channel. On a sequential basis, APAC was down 2.6%, reflecting a larger impact from surges in new COVID-19 cases that led to significant lockdowns in China. Alternatively, despite headwinds, Japan and Taiwan performed well. We had strong growth in emerging markets like Korea and India and Thailand on a year-over-year basis. Earlier this month, we expanded the Invisalign Clear Aligner product portfolio with new offerings that better serve the expanding market in China. The two new products Invisalign Adult and Invisalign Standard Clear Aligners are designed for more specific types of malocclusion cases and private doctors and their patients with a more clinical and affordable options for moderate to complex cases.  Invisalign Adult and Invisalign Standard Clear Aligners built on our proven technology for a wider range and scope in malocclusion. During the quarter we announced new Invisalign innovations for the Align Digital platform. Proprietary combination of software, systems and services designed to provide a seamless experience and workflow that integrates and connects all users, doctors, labs, patients and consumers. These new Invisalign innovations include ClinCheck Live update, the Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personalized Plan or IPP, Invisalign Smile Architect and the cone beam computed tomography, CDCT integration feature for ClinCheck digital treatment planning software. These innovations will revolutionize digital treatment planning for orthodontics and restorative dentistry by providing doctors with greater flexibility and real-time treatment plan access and modification capabilities. Each of these innovations are designed to enhance Invisalign treatment planning quality, efficiency, and scale and contribute to a better doctor-patient experience. More recently, we introduced a new enhancement for the Invisalign system with mandibular advancement feature. The Invisalign system with mandibular advancement is the only clinically proven Clear Aligner product in the world today that address a Class II correction with simultaneous alignment. Using feedback from customers, we've enhanced the original design with new enhanced precision wins that provide increased durability and comfort as well as great overlap to help ensure that the Aligners remain seated and properly engaged to more effectively address Class II malocclusions in growing preteen and teen patients. Our consumer marketing focus on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to Invisalign doctors' offices ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. In Q1, we built on a successful Invis Is Multimedia campaign across the Americas, EMEA and APAC driving awareness and interest in Invisalign treatment with adult, teen, and parent consumer segments. Globally, we delivered strong impression volume with over 23.7 million visits to our websites, 11 with a -- 113% [ph] year-over-year increase and over 7.8 billion impressions delivered, representing a 32% year-over-year increase. In the US, we continue to amplify our campaigns across the top social platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube to increased awareness of Invisalign brand with young adults and teens. Our campaigns featured collaborations with some of the largest influencers in social media, including Charli D'Amelio, Lana Condor, Devon Key, Michael Le, and Josh Richards. Each of these creators shared their personal experience with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smiles with Invisalign Aligners. To continue growing our young adult business across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, we hold upon our successful Invis Is a Powerful Thing campaign, which highlights how powerful the smile transformation with Invisalign treatment can be for even young adults' self-confidence. We leverage top influers like Leana Green and Lana Condor and integrated media campaigns. Further, we are expanding our collaboration with influencers globally and are excited to welcome Olympic Gold Medalist, Suni Lee and creators Josh Richards, [indiscernible], and Scarlett Estevez who have chosen to shape their smiles with Invisalign treatment. In the EMEA region, we accelerated our media investments across digital media platforms, including YouTube, TikTok, Meta, and Snapchat and expanded our Invisalign Smile squad roster with new influencers. Additionally, we launched a pilot in the UK to reach teams with special campaigns to create awareness of the unique benefits of Invisalign treatment. Our consumer campaigns delivered more 8.8 million unique visitors to our website, representing 170% increase year-over-year with over 2.5 billion media impressions. We continue to expand our investment in consumer advertising across the APAC region, excluding -- including China, resulting in a 278% increase year-over-year in unique visitors and a 265% year-over-year increase in impressions. We continue to strengthen our investments in Australia by expanding our reach via social media platforms such as TikTok, Meta, and YouTube. In Japan, we built upon our successful consumer campaigns by expanding into Twitter and continue to see strong response from consumers as evidenced by a 373% increase in unique visitors to our site. For our Systems and Services business, Q1 revenues were up 15.6% year-over-year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services and down 24.2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower volumes from the previous mentioned headwinds and capital equipment seasonality. During the past quarter, we saw continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D imaging system we launched last year that features innovative technology like near infrared technology that we call NIRI, which age into detection and monitoring of Interproximal Caries Lesions or cavities without -- above the gingiva without harmful radiation. A strong indicator of the digital adoption within dental offices is a number of intraoral scans used for Invisalign case submissions. Total worldwide in oral digital scan submitted to start an Invisalign case in Q1 increased to 87.1% from 80.9% in Q1 last year. International intraoral digital scans for Invisalign case submissions increased to 83%, up from 75% in Q1 last year. For the Americas, 91% of Invisalign cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan compared to 85.5% in Q1 of last year. Cumulatively, over 54.9 million orthodontic scans and over 11.4 million restorative scans have been formed with iTero scanners. During the quarter, the iTero Element 5D Plus won the best new imaging or CAD/CAM product from DrBicuspid.com and Cuspies award. The award reflects our commitment to develop innovative solutions that help doctors transform lives by improving patients' journey to a healthy, beautiful smile. We are pleased to share that the iTero Element scanner received in ortho town, 2021 Townie Choice Awards, which seeks to recognize the top gear recommended products and services and dentistry. We're proud that the iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system provides dental practices with Alvadis [ph] and imaging technology, cutting-edge enhanced chair-side visualizations and applications that can drive practice growth in treatment acceptance. Continued growth in the iTero scanner installed base is driving increased services revenues as well as exocad CAD/CAM software solutions that integrate workflows to the dental labs and dental practices. Our Q1 exocad CAD/CAM products and services, which include restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design offerings are included in scanner and services revenues and are helping extend our digital dental solutions and broaden Aligned digital platform towards fully integrated interdisciplinary and workflows. As we continue to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, our goal is to make orthodontics a pillar of dentistry. April 2 marked our second anniversary since welcoming exocad into the Align family. And together, we're working to ensure that every dental technician in every dentist planning restorative treatment in centers of benefits of digital orthodontics first. We're continuing to focus on integration and road map development to strengthen the Align Digital platform by addressing restorative needs to facilitate both ortho restorative and comprehensive dentistry. Two years after exocad joined Align, we are more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead to shape the dental industry and with technology and expertise that complement the many benefits of the Align Digital platform and bringing all key stakeholders together, doctor, customers, labs, partners and users as we continue transforming smiles and changing lives. During the quarter, exocad participated in the 2022 Dental South China show in Guangzhou, China, showcasing its newest software release, Dental CAD 3.0 Galway plus other open software solutions like Innovative Smile Design program called Smile Creator. The show allowed the exocad team to deepen their relationships with the dental community to discover new trends emerging in the growing dental market in China. Attendees have both the experienced in firsthand how exocad's wizard guided workflows and easy online communication programs streamline the treatment journey from consultation to final restoration. Finally, this quarter, exocad is opening its new headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, which provides a robust high-tech infrastructure to a key region of our business. exocad has been working with a growing number of Korean manufacturers for many years, and this location help facilitate strategic relationships in the region. With that, I'll now turn over the call to John. John Morici : Thanks Joe. Now, for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $973.2 million, down 5.6% from the prior quarter and up 8.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $809.7 million were down 0.7% sequentially due to lower Invisalign case volumes, partially offset by higher ASPs, reflecting higher ASPs and up 7.5% year-over-year reflecting higher ASPs in non-case revenues. In Q1, Invisalign case volume were down 5.1% sequentially and up 0.5% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped Clear Aligners to 82,400 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which over 5,000 were first-time customers. Q1 comprehensive volume increased 2. 4% year-over-year and decreased 5% sequentially. Q1 non-comprehensive volume decreased 4% year-over-year and decreased 5.4% sequentially. Q1 adult patients decreased 1.6% year-over-year and decreased 5.7% sequentially. In Q1, teens or younger patients increased 6% year-over-year and decreased 3.6% sequentially. Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $6.5 million or approximately 0.8 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $24 million or approximately 3.2 points. For Q1, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect per order processing fees charged on most Clear Aligner shipments, lower discounts, and higher additional lines, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners and per order processing fees, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Q1 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by per order processing fees and lower discounts, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect per order processing fees, higher additional aligners, partially offset by foreign exchange. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $53 million or 5% sequentially and $307.1 million or 38.1% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional lenders are shipped. Our Systems and Services revenue for the first quarter were $163.5 million, down 24.2% sequentially and up 15.6% year-over-year. The decrease sequentially can be attributed to lower scanner volume following a strong Q4 and consistent with seasonality in the capital equipment business, coupled with the headwinds described earlier. The increase year-over-year can be attributed to increased services revenue from our larger installed base as well as slightly higher scanner volume. Our Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $16.5 million or 7.2% sequentially and up $114.9 million or 87.6% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenue included with our -- with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 72.9%, up 0.7 points sequentially and down 2.8 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, overall gross margin was 73.3% for the first quarter, up 0.7 points sequentially and down 2.8 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points on a year-over-year basis and by approximately 0.2 points sequentially due to foreign exchange. Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 74.8%, up 0.6 point sequentially due to higher ASPs, partially offset by higher mix of additional aligner volume and higher freight costs. Clear Aligner gross margin was down 2.8 points year-over-year due to higher mix of additional aligner volume and higher freight costs, partially offset by higher ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was 63.4%, down 1.3 points sequentially due to lower volume and lower ASPs, partially offset by lower freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin was down 2 points year-over-year due to higher manufacturing inefficiencies, partially offset by higher mix of service revenues and increased ASPs. Q1 operating expenses were $511.3 million, down sequentially 2.4% and up 13.2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $12.4 million. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $59.6 million, reflecting increased headcount and our continued investment in marketing sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $480.2 million, down sequentially 2.9% and up 13.1% year-over-year due to the reasons described above. Our first quarter operating income of $198.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 20.4%, down 1.1 points sequentially and down 4.8 points year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs, operating margin for the first quarter was 24%, down 0.7 points sequentially and down 4.6 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the first quarter was a loss of $10.6 million, down sequentially by $9. 7 million and down year-over-year by $46.8 million. Q1 of 2021 included the SEC arbitration award gain of $43.4 million. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.4% compared to 13.2% in the fourth quarter and 23.4% in the first quarter of the prior year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.2% in the first quarter compared to 11.5% in the fourth quarter and 20.2% in the first quarter of the prior year. The first quarter GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were higher than fourth quarter effective tax rates, primarily due to tax benefits related to expiration of statutes of limitations for timely asserting claims and an out-of-period adjustment recorded last quarter. First quarter net income per diluted share was $1.70, down sequentially $0.70 and down $0.81 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.13 on a sequential basis and $0.28 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.13 for the first quarter, down $0.70 sequentially and down $0.36 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31st, 2022, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1.1 billion, down sequentially $176.1 million and down $11.1 million year-over-year. Of our $1.1 billion balance, $453 million was held in the US and $667.6 million was held by our international entities. Q1 accounts receivable balance was $950.9 million, up approximately 6% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 87 days, up approximately nine days sequentially and up approximately 15 days as compared to Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $30.5 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $87.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, amounted to negative $56.8 million. In February, we repurchased $75 million of our common stock through open market repurchases of approximately 143,600 shares at an average price of $522.61 per share. We have approximately $650 million remaining available for repurchase under our May 13th, 2021, $1 billion repurchase program. As described during our Q4 2021 earnings call, we provided our fiscal year 2022 outlook with revenue growth in line with our long-term revenue range of 20% to 30%. This revenue growth assumed no significant new COVID surges after current wave, no meaningful practice disruption nor material supply chain issues throughout the year. At that time, we were seeing some recovery as Omicron headwinds began to ease and COVID restrictions were relaxing. However, later in the quarter, unfavorable impacts on our business occurred driven by China lockdowns, weaker consumer confidence, inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For April, we have not seen momentum return as the headwinds previously mentioned persist. Now turning to full year 2022. We remain confident in the huge underpenetrated market, our technology and industry leadership and our ability to execute and make progress toward our long-term model of 20% to 30% revenue growth. At the same time, the headwinds we're experiencing, which include increased COVID waves and significant China lockdowns, weaker consumer confidence, inflation pressures the Russia-Ukraine conflict have increased uncertainty across all markets. We also anticipate capital equipment sales will be increasingly constrained throughout the year as practices adjust to these headwinds. Given less visibility and an increasing unpredictable operating environment, we are not providing revenue guidance for the year. However, assuming no additional material disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, our goal for fiscal 2022 is to deliver GAAP operating margin above 20%, while making strategic investments in sales, marketing, R&D and operations In addition, during Q2 2022, we expect to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. For 2022, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as a digital manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our investment in an aligner fabrication facility in Wroclaw, Poland, which is expected to begin serving doctors in the second quarter of 2022 as part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers. As we continue growing, we intend to expand our investments in research and development, manufacturing, treatment planning, sales and marketing operations to meet the actual and anticipated local and regional demands. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. Operator : Excuse me. Joe Hogan, are you there? Shirley Stacy : Yes, operator. Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. I'll run by this again. Okay. That was my fault. Over our first quarter results reflect a more challenging environment than expected. We know that COVID lockdowns, weaker consumer confidence, inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have created headwinds, but we remain excited and committed to realizing the enormous opportunity in front of us to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry. With less than 10% share of the 21 million starts each year with over 500 million people globally who can benefit from a healthy beautiful smile, our market is as large as ever. No other company is as well positioned as us to take advantage of that potential as the environment improves and growth trends return. We will continue to focus on the execution of our strategic growth drivers, while managing investments in the near-term to account for the headwinds and uncertainty, and we will remain confident in our long-term revenue growth model of 20% to 30%. Before we open the call to questions, I want to address the military conflict in the Ukraine and our operations in Russia. It's a human tragedy for all people involved and our thoughts go out to everyone impacted and especially to those with personal connections who are undoubtedly concerned with their families and loved ones. Our primary concern remains the safety and security of our employees and their families, our doctors, their staff and patients. We have nothing to do with this conflict. As a global medical device provider of doctor-prescribed products, continuity of care is critical to the doctors and their patients in orthodontic treatment. We discontinued commercial activities in Russia that are not essential to providing continuity of care to patients. Our focus on only our values and ethical responsibility of patients in treatment. In the process, we are also adhering to the international sanctions that have been imposed. Our IT infrastructure, including covet intellectual property is hosted outside of Russia. Prior to the conflict, we have begun expanding our R&D teams in Downstate, Germany; Madrid, Spain; Toronto, Canada; and Austin, Texas. And we're prudently working with the team on the ground in Russia on work pieces. A number of our Russian employees have already transitioned and are in various stages of transitioning their families to Armenia, where we've set up an R&D center in urban to support those who choose to relocate. At the same time, it's humbling to see the tremendous outpouring of kindness and support throughout the company as our employees respond to the humanitarian needs of the crisis. Our Polish team members has set up donation centers at our facilities where employees are contributing food, clothing, supplies, and human care. Many are also taking Ukrainian refugees into their homes. And we're proud of the tremendous initiative by our colleagues and are grateful for their actions. In addition to our employees' efforts, Align is donating $300,000 to support humanitarian relief efforts through organizations providing shelter food, medicines and vital supplies. We can only hope that the conflict in Ukraine will end soon, that the ongoing impact of the pandemic will lessen for good, and that economic factors facing many customers and consumers will abate. But these things are beyond our control, so we will continue to prioritize the health and safety of employees, customers, and patients and will stay focused on strategic initiatives. In closing, April 3rd marked the 25th anniversary of the founding of Align Technology. And shortly thereafter, the long of the Invisalign system. Over the past 25 years, we've transformed the orthodontic industry with a passion for innovation as we've evolved from leading the evolution from digital appliances to digital platform. We've created an incredible company unlike any other. Invisalign's unique mass customization business operating in real time with no inventory or distribution at the front end of our market. Consequence of fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment are felt faster at Align than I've ever experienced anywhere in my career. And we monitored these trends to make adjustments in our business when needed. Our success is a result of a vision and purpose and results. Thanks to our employees and our doctor customers around the world, who took a chance on a Silicon Valley start-up and risked everything. Today, Align is the largest 3D printing operation in the world, producing 1 million customized aligners each day based on the learnings gained from nearly 13 million Invisalign patients and 60 million iTero digital scans Our global team of over 25,000 employees support more than 250,000 doctors and labs in more than 150 countries. There are more than 500 million people in the world that can benefit from orthodontic procedures. It's huge. And you can only address opportunities of that size with digital orthodontics. It could never happen using old analog methods. As we have digitized that capability, it has opened up a market broadly for orthodontic treatment to the masses. It's hard to believe that after 25 years, we're still in the early phases of transforming the orthodontic market. We look forward to sharing more milestones over the next 25 years as we continue to lead the digital evolution of orthodontics and dentistry, deliver great treatment outcomes and treatment experiences to doctors and patients around the world. Thank you for your time today. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. You may proceed. Joe Hogan : Hi, Jason. Jason Bednar : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Hey, there. Thanks for taking the questions. So Joe, I guess just to start with you. I mean, you and John called out the consumer confidence items and the inflationary pressures impacting the business. The wind shifting pretty abruptly on you. I guess, are there tools you have at your disposal to manage through these pressures, or is this a matter of just keeping your head down, waiting for the macro environment to settle down, I guess, really just trying to get a sense of how we should be moderating expectations from what's typical sequential growth we would see in the business? Joe Hogan : Yes, Jason, good question. I'd say being a global business, we talked about having 50% of our revenues outside. It just gives us good scope in the sense to take advantage where opportunities are. And so I feel really good about the company in that sense. And we've made great development over the last three years from an international standpoint. We also have a great portfolio. We have iTero scanners. We talked about some reluctance in the sense that we saw at the end of the first quarter as some doctors to really commit to it. But I mean that demand is still out there. When you look at iTero scanners are so underpenetrated still when you look at digital dentistry and what the future really brings. And so pushing that and pushing it in the right places and also you see the expansion of our Invisalign technology and what we're doing in different areas, too. So I feel like we have a lot of levers that we can pull, but we are constrained by these headwinds that we've seen. And obviously, we'll respect those and make the kind of adjustments needed to make sure this business stays on track with. Look, I love our portfolio. I love our position. I see a great future. We'll manage our way through this, Jason. Jason Bednar : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe shifting over to the \u2013 the margin side, you're not stepping off the gas with spending. I wouldn't expect it to given the opportunity that you're talking about here today and you've talked about for quite some time. But I guess are you still comfortable with that long-term model of 25% plus operating margins? I know we've seen that for some select periods for the business. But is that the right margin level to think about for the business when you're driving towards that 20% topline growth? Just -- can you truly balance that, or do you have to sacrifice one for the other, again, thinking longer term here? Joe Hogan : I think, Jason, honestly, I think we've managed that well over the years. I mean you can see how well we did last year in the sense of that operating profit has been squarely on top of that piece. And I think we've managed it within that bandwidth very well, and that's -- this current situation is not going to change that. Jason Bednar : All right. Thanks guys. Joe Hogan : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. You may proceed. Joe Hogan : Hi Jeff. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Hey guys, how are you? So, Joe, let me just pick up on that last point. I mean, you said you've managed OpEx well over the years in that. I guess, let me just be direct on it. I mean, if end markets are cyclically slowing that's kind of out of your control, do you put the gas pedal down to the accelerator? Do you say there's not a whole lot that that's going to accomplish? So I kind of protect margins here in the short run. Just what's your OpEx outlook kind of in the near term -- near to intermediate term, I guess, given some of this macro uncertainty? Joe Hogan : Jeff, it's more the latter of your question. It's just you take off the accelerator. And we know -- John and I know where to adjust it won't hurt the business. We continue to invest in innovation in different areas, too. But there are several areas of short-term investments that aren't going to help us in this current crisis that will obviously lean into and make sure that we preserve margins as much as we can. : But with those investments, yes, it will be -- when we talked about the 20-plus percent on a GAAP basis, that's the trade-off that we'll have. We'll invest where we can see a return. And based on the volume that we expect, but deliver 20-plus percent op margin. Jeff Johnson : Yes, got it. Thanks John. And then a follow-up question, I guess, just on the gauge data, you talked about down 7% case starts ortho year-to-date. I'm hearing that through April, not just through March. But I don't get the whole gauge data set, but what I've seen is that the adult data is worse than the teen data, which would make sense to me. Everybody sitting at home, all the adults sitting home last year with the Zoom effect going on at this point in stimulus checks, sitting in pockets and all that. So, that all makes sense. But just what's the tenor in North America or in those markets that aren't impacted by China and Russia, Ukraine in that? What's the tenor of the teen business? And is the core that part of the business still doing better than you've just got real tough comps because all those adults were coming in last year as they were sitting at home and had nothing better to do than get Clear Aligners? Joe Hogan : Hey Jeff, it's Joe. Look, the teen market, you're good to focus on that. I mean that's -- we look at that as a fairly secure market. Obviously, it can move up and down, but it won't have the volatility and you've seen in the adult market and you're comparing a against last year is a good way to look at it, given the Zoom effect and things we talked about before. So -- and Jeff, that's why you see us launching these teen products right now and getting ready from a summer time standpoint. We want to take advantage of that demand as much as we possibly can, especially in times like this. We know the adult market is going to be pressured. I'm talking about the US right now, but this sets leave China now because China is a unique position in the sense of a lockdown that they're going through. But we're -- you're going to see us take the same tact in Europe also. And you saw our teen volume in Europe was actually pretty good in the first quarter. Jeff Johnson : What about that teen volume in the US, Joe? Joe Hogan : We expect that teen volume to be good. Summer seasonality is there. And it's funny. There's a window for to really have their teeth treated. And we've known that here for years, and that's why we prepared for teen season. And this year, honestly, Jeff, I feel better about our positioning for teens in the United States and also in Europe. I have many time since I've been here with these teen packs that we just talked about and how we'll go about it, I think we're well positioned to make further penetration in the teen market versus wires and brackets. Jeff Johnson : Yes, got it. Thanks, guys. Joe Hogan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. You may proceed. Joe Hogan : Hey, Jon. Jonathan Block : Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good segue. I'll start with the teen case packs. We picked up on that program right after April. Quite honestly, unfortunately, I'm old enough to remember your teens pack programs internationally from like a decade ago. And if I remember this correctly, Joe, it is just hard to collect, if you would, if someone did below their threshold and hopefully, I'm making some sense. So maybe just talk to us -- here you are going after it, you're going after for teens, not overall, you're launching it. What's going to be different this go round when someone commits to a 50-case pack or a 100-case pack, let's go with 100, they do 88 and you've got to go out there and say, 'Hey, look, it's a user or lose it, we got to collect for you and then also just keep the tenor of the relationship or the goodwill of the relationship intact because now argue even have more options to go somewhere else versus what they were staring down a decade ago. So maybe if you could talk to that and just the timing behind kicking off the program, that will be a great place to start. Joe Hogan : Jon, you're like an Align history, and that's a good question, right? Because I can tell you, I doesn't hear where that happened in Europe, but it's legendary here. But if you go back in time, I think our business in Europe was less than $10 million back then. Okay, now it\u2019s over $1 billion. And I think the whole world is much more coined with Clear Aligners than when it was back then, we were really pioneers at that point in time. If you look at our DSP program, it's basically the same thing. They make commitments to how many aligners are going to buy over a certain period of time. We haven't had any issues in DSP with having customers regress or not making those benchmarks. So we feel pretty good about where we are. I mean will we run into a few situations, I think we will. I think they'll be outliers, and we'll deal with them in time. Jonathan Block : Okay. Fair enough. And I just might go back to sort of where Jason started a little bit. There's going to be a lot of questions on 2022 and pulling the top line guidance. So let me just throw out a couple of things, and we could sort of work through it. If I look back the past five to six years, the first quarter was about 22% of total revenue. And if you run that exercise for this year, you get about 11% or 12% year-over-year revenue growth and you've got an incremental FX headwind. So should we throw a dart at 10%? And what's wrong with that thought process in getting to, call it, low double-digit 10%, 12% top line growth for 2022? Thanks, guys. John Morici : I think -- Jon, this is John. As we talked about that last earnings, there's a lot of changes that have happened in the marketplace and in the world. And as a result of that, we pulled the top line guidance until we get further clarity as how things are going to shake out. What we have committed to is being able to grow in a profitable way in a way that you would expect us to be responsible being at 20-plus percent, but we pulled that guidance because of the uncertainty. Joe Hogan : Jon, just to add to John's comments, too, is that as we look at April versus March, we haven't seen any momentum from an April standpoint too. And we start from that standpoint also. Jonathan Block : Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Hi Erin. Erin Wright : In the Americas -- hi, good to hear from you. So, in the Americas, can you parse out a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of macro headwinds compared to maybe some of the lingering COVID impact? And does it seem like some -- I mean it doesn't seem like some of these cases are coming back from maybe Omicron delays. But what are in terms of the dynamics there? Just trying to kind of parse out. Last quarter, you did break out kind of a COVID impact, but could you do that this quarter? Joe Hogan : It's hard to be very discrete in the sense of what that impact is, Erin. But I'd say we -- obviously faced staffing shortages and things at different doctors in the first part of the first quarter that affected us. I'd say that drifted through to basically late February, early March. After that, you can -- if you watch the consumer confidence statistics in the United States, they've gone down pretty dramatically. And we started getting a lot of reports from our doctors is patients thought saying no, but patients not as quick to say, yes, that they wanted treatment. And we hear that both in the GP segment in the orthodontic segment. So, you can call out what you want to, okay? But do we see some reticence in the marketplace to move forward with treatment and again, it's not binary. It's not everybody is saying, no, like in the heart of a deep recession or something we saw back in 2007 or 2008. It's just more cautiousness from people about their personal finances. Erin Wright : Okay, great. Thanks. And then on ASPs for the balance of the year, I guess, how should we be thinking about that and the levers, I guess, you can pull on that front? Thanks. John Morici : Hey Erin, this is John. From an overall ASP standpoint, we don't have any anything unusual from a promotion standpoint or anything else that would affect us. Obviously, notwithstanding FX, we've seen unfavorable FX as we've gone through this year so far. But notwithstanding FX, we wouldn't expect anything dramatically different from an ASP standpoint. Erin Wright : Okay, great. Thank you. Joe Hogan : Thanks Erin. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may proceed. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking my call. Joe Hogan : Hey Kevin. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. So, I guess the question I have is, the first one is really why have the doc adds -- doc starts been so sluggish? Is it demand driven? Is it competitive positioning? Is it -- I would just love to hear sort of why in the US, especially the sort of doc ads have been flattish for the last couple of quarters? If there's anything, if it's macro or micro or competitive? Joe Hogan : Well, I think I read your question, I think you're asking if it's competitive because I mean we're pretty clear on what we've been seeing around the globe in the United States from a macro standpoint, Kevin. So, I just -- look, from a competition standpoint, we don't see any major issue with competition in the sense of being a factor in this demand cycle that we're talking about. Kevin Caliendo : And when we try to think about the impacts here that are driving all of this, how much do you -- have you guys been able to ascertain how much of this is economic-driven? You're talking about decisions taking longer and people being more hesitant and volumes being down, how much of that is economic versus COVID versus other -- like have you been able to just parse out what's really driving it as a percentage? Is it mostly simply listen, we're in an inflationary environment. People don't have as much to spend, consumers aren't spending as much broadly versus just an overall demand for your products and/or COVID, like those three things, if you were to group them? Joe Hogan : Kevin, our announcement and the way we communicate to the marketplace, we talk about this huge market, right? We're totally underpenetrated in the orthodontic segment, less than 10% of 21 million case starts a year. Talking about what we see through the 500 million patients. So there's not a lack of demand out there and the lack of opportunity. There's not a competitive issue that we think is affecting our growth or our earnings. And so obviously, COVID is part of this thing. Part of it we see in Europe was the Ukraine conflict that's going on today. And I think significant amount of it is too is what we're seeing in the marketplace, too, from a consumer standpoint. I can't put any weighted averages on these things to give you an example. And I think -- if I compare to when we last talked to you at the first couple of days of February, the way things have changed, those variables in that equation, I think, have changed pretty dramatically. So it's really hard to say going forward what that might be. Kevin Caliendo : Are there any goals that you have -- one last one for me. Are there any goals that you have for this year in terms of quantifiable goals in terms of whether it be doc ads or utilization uptick or -- I mean, I know those are the things you were focused on when you talked about increasing your spend. Like what are you targeting at this point? Is there anything that we can sort of put a stick in the ground and say, 'okay, here's something that the company is hoping to achieve in 2022 in terms of a quantifiable number. Joe Hogan : Kevin, this is a growth company. And it never leaves our thought process. So what are we trying to do? We're trying to run the way we always do. We're running at these plays in a much more difficult market with more headwinds. That's all. And so we'll move these place around. We'll look at them by country. We'll see what makes the most sense. We still keep a good strong focus on how we can grow and where we can grow and we'll find those ways. Kevin Caliendo : Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Joe Hogan : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. You may proceed. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. I got two, a few I want to touch on. Can you hear me? Joe Hogan : Yes. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Great. Thanks. One is just sort of talking through some of the dynamics we're talking to. You talked for the quarter. I think we can all kind of see that a lot of it or a lot of it is macro driven, a lot of it's global driven and each of these events that we're following, whether it's the China lockdowns or the conflict in Europe or even things like FX are going to be more temporary than others. I know your long-term outlook is still there for the 20% to 30% volume growth and revenue growth. But what about sort of catch-up spend on these things? Is there an expectation somewhere and you kind of touched on this when you talked about your spend and your expectations on investment this year? As we go through the next couple of months, next couple of quarters as some of these things start to fade, are you expecting another bolus of catch-up as these cases come back like we saw in 2020 and 2021? Anything you can sort of comment on that? And then I've got a follow-up. Joe Hogan : I think a bolus, you talked about -- I mean, that was interesting is what we saw after the last downturn, it was first like COVID. I mean I look at that, Mike, overall, is it just shows you the demand out there for our kind of procedures. So it's there. And so John and I are in setting here are predicting another bolus or a wave or whatever, but I think it just shows you the demand that exists in this business and it can be pent up at times. We'll just have to see how the headwinds that we see filter through the marketplace and how it affects consumers and doctors. Michael Ryskin : Okay. I appreciate that. And then the follow-up, you touched on this in an answer earlier when you sort of referenced the 2007, 2008 downturn. Obviously, hopefully, we're not going to something quite like that in the coming year, too. But there's still a lot of talk about recession and sort of what the impact of prolong inflation is going to be on the consumer. Could you talk us through your plans if things do continue to deteriorate on that front, we're not there yet, but six months from now, a year from now, things are still heading in that direction sort of what are your internal plans for adjusting both on operations growth in that kind of environment? Because if you look back at 2007, 2008, 2009, there was a protracted period of essentially flat growth. So could you compare-- Joe Hogan : Yes, it's Joe again. I just -- we have a really strong balance sheet to start with. It's great to have a strong balance sheet and really no net debt from a company standpoint. So, look, it's -- I'm not an economist, but I'm not predicting a meltdown of our financial system, like we saw in 2007, 2008 depending on what Federal Reserve does or whatever, we're probably going to see an adjustment as they try to attack inflation. So, look, we -- this business is incredibly healthy. It generates a lot of cash. It's extremely international now. And we have a lot of levers to pull and a lot of things to do to keep this business going. So -- but if something dire did happen, I feel we got a balance sheet to be able to cover it, too, and we'll manage the business responsibly that way. So, I'd just tell you don't give up on us, okay? We love this business. We love the position that it's in. We're confident about the future. We're just going to see how these headwinds hit and how they subside, and we'll be ready on either end of that to be able to position this company to do well. John Morici : And I might add, just we are a different business than we were back in 2007, 2008. We didn't have iTero. We have iTero, much more of a global products, much further along in the teen market, more consumer awareness, all the things that we've done over this time period now being 25 years, we've evolved over time and created a business where we're very mindful of what is happening from a demand standpoint, and we can do a lot of things from a leverage standpoint in order to drive that right amount of profitability. Michael Ryskin : Thank you. Joe Hogan : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. you may proceed. Nathan Rich : Hi, thanks for the questions. I wanted to follow-up on your commentary on April and not seeing momentum return. I was just wondering if there's any parameters you could put around that relative to maybe what you've seen in the first quarter? I guess like would that sort of mean volumes more flattish, anything that you could do to kind of help us think about how the business kind of exited the first quarter and where the current run rate is would be helpful? Joe Hogan : Yes. Nate, I'll give you a quick rundown, and John can give you specifics to is. Look, we -- this is flattish to use your term. When you look at between March and April is more flattish than anything. But just remember, we have -- China is still our second biggest country in the world. It's locked down. Shanghai -- Beijing is going into lockdown. That's not the first lockdown we've seen in China. Remember, there are several provinces that were locked down before that, too. So, that part of our business has really been impacted in a big way, and that's part of that flattishness that we're talking about, too. So we're seeing impact in every region of the world in different ways. And on the APAC side, particularly with China, it's dramatic. John Morici : I don't have much -- anything to add to it. I just -- a lot has changed as we've seen over the last couple of months, and we're responding to that change. Nathan Rich : Makes sense. And I guess, I'd be curious just to get your thoughts on sort of the consumer environment. I know it's been touched on in other questions. But Invisalign treatment is a higher ticket purchase, and we've kind of always thought of it as catering to a more affluent consumer. I guess, is there anything that you've seen kind of between higher-end consumer versus lower-end consumer? And they're going back to, I think, the way you framed it, kind of the reticence to start treatment, any difference that you've seen among maybe the different segments of the population that could be considering treatment? . Joe Hogan : I commented that back to the other question was asked about teens, right? The teen aspect in the orthodontic segment is pretty resilient, and that is a certain demographic that it's always existed in the sense of the parents that they can afford that kind of treatment of young children. The adult segment, it's all over the place depending on -- sometimes, it's just teeth straightening. Some of times, it's a broad worth correction on what's going on. We don't have any data in that adult segment to say that a certain FIFA score certain match, certain amount would be fewer people taking treatment or whatever. I don't have that data. I don't know if John has seen it either. But you'd have to guess that the more your finances are impacted, you're actually going to sign up for a $3,500 to $7,000 treatment depending on what you want or how you're in a contract for it. So it's logical that certain demographics would be less willing at this point in time. Shirley Stacy : Thanks. Operator, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Absolutely. The next question is from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Joe Hogan : Hi, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Anderson : So maybe one question on the iTero scanner growth. Obviously, we saw a deceleration quarter-over-quarter, but still year-over-year growth there. When you sort of talk about how providers are looking at demand, and I realize that not all of that is like pure like iTero sales. How do we think about sort of what's driving the purchases in the first quarter? Obviously, there is some seasonality. But if you like, overall visits, maybe ex-Clear Aligners are not has maybe haven't been quite as impacted. Are we seeing sort of a reticence to spend? Is it sort of interest rates going up and people worried about sort of equipment financing? Could you walk us through some of the puts and takes of the demand drivers there? Joe Hogan : Elizabeth, it's Joe. I'd start with the still market is broadly unpenetrated from a scanner standpoint. GP side, the ortho side, an ortho that does a lot of Invisalign, they can have four, five, six scanners overall. So look, with the GE Healthcare for years, ABB, I understand the capital equipment cycle. There is a true cycle in capital equipment. When people get concerned, they'll delay those kinds of purchases. And I think, obviously, you have -- when I talk about 250,000 doctors that we service today, some of them are going to be worried about what their cash flow is going to look like. They're going to be reticent in the sense of saying they want to sign up for a scanner that can cost anywhere between $15,000 to $35,000 right now and what we sell. So, I can't tell you by country or by region or whatever, but we didn't see things shut off. We just saw things as the quarter got through, they just didn't have as strong as demand for iTero than we anticipated. So, we'll have to -- obviously, we get into this way it goes. But there's going to be some more scrutiny, I think, around capital investment, if doctors are seeing less traffic through their practices. John Morici : Yes. It's just the delays that they put to not close and necessarily within the quarter. It's not going away, but it's just a delay. And we have to work to try to get them to say. Elizabeth Anderson : And you're not having any like supply chain issues on that side in terms of like being able to manufacture the equipment? Joe Hogan : We didn't have any in the first quarter. We won't have any in the second quarter either. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay. And one more quick follow-up. In terms of the gross margin impact of the new Poland facility, can you remind us about the cadence of the gross margin pressure when you open a new facility as it scale? So, I'm just trying to be able to parse that out versus maybe some of the deleveraging impact of some of the volume shifts versus that. John Morici : Yes, Elizabeth. What we'll see is we'll go live in the second quarter here and that does have a gross margin impact. It really comes down to trying to get as much utilization through the plant as possible converting -- moving those countries and doctors through the plant. And then once that utilization increases, then you start to see some of that productivity. So, it hits about a quarter, maybe a little bit more than a quarter and then it subsides and then it gets more on a regular operating basis. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. Thank you very much. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Elizabeth. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. We look forward to speaking to you at upcoming conferences and industry meetings. And if you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our Q2 results and discuss the performance of our two operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial performance and our view for the remainder of the year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. I'm pleased to report solid second quarter results with top line revenues relatively unchanged from Q1, and operating margin of approximately 20%, despite unfavorable foreign exchange. The underlying market for orthodontics continues to be impacted by macroeconomic environment factors and lingering effects of COVID-19 variants in certain markets. Notwithstanding, these headwinds, we've remained focused on achieving our strategic initiatives, including opening new offices in the Middle East and Africa and our new manufacturing facility in Poland, launching new solutions to better support the way our customers want to do business, such as a doctor subscription program, and teen case packs, and announcing new products and innovation to help our doctors and their patients. These new innovations are revolutionizing the digital treatment planning and helping to drive the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry. Align is well-positioned to withstand the current market conditions to lead the digital revolution in orthodontics and dentistry as the environment and growth trends improve. For System and Services, Q2 revenues were up 4.7% sequentially and up slightly year-over-year compared to Q2 2021 year-over-year growth of 215%. Q2 Services and Systems revenues increased sequentially driven by scanner volume growth in the Americas and APAC, partially offset by lower volume in EMEA, and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The iTero Element 5D imaging system continues to represent the majority of our scanner volume as doctors recognize the benefits of going digital. In APAC, the iTero entry-level Flex scanner offering was up sequentially in Q2, reflecting increased adoption. I'm also pleased with sequentially increasing services revenues in Q2, reflecting growth from the installed base. Services revenues represent approximately 40% of our Systems and Services business. For our Clear Aligner segment, Q2 revenues were down slightly sequentially and down 5.1% year-over-year compared to our Q2 2021 record year-over-year revenue growth of 182%. For the quarter, Q2 Clear Aligner volumes reflect sequential growth across the Americas and parts of EMEA, partially offset by China and UK Q2 Invisalign case starts for teens and younger patients was 177.3000 up slightly sequentially and down 2.1% year-over-year compared last year when our Teen case shipment growth rate was an all-time high. For Q2, Invisalign First for kids as young as six years old, grew year-over-year and was strong across all regions. During Q2, we introduced Invisalign Teen Packs in the US and Canada and France. Teen Packs, our new subscription program, which enables orthodontists to buy clear aligners and packs in advance, similar to the way they buy wires and brackets today. Our Teen Case Pack simplified the ordering process and make the billing more predictable for doctors. Teen Case Packs also include exclusive practice development benefits with the Invisalign brand and requires an incremental volume commitment from doctors. To date, enrollment has been encouraging with early adoptions highest among doctors who have not historically used Invisalign aligners to treat their teen patients. For other non-case revenues, which include retention products such as Vivera Retainers, clinical training and education, accessories, e-commerce and our new subscription programs such as our DSP revenues, were up both sequentially and year-over-year. For retainers, Q2 shipments had strong momentum with sequential and year-over-year growth across all regions driven by both submitters and utilization. Momentum in our doctor subscription program continued and Q2 revenues increased over 60% sequentially. Now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q2 Invisalign case volumes were up sequentially, reflecting increased submissions from the orthodontic channel and increased utilization from the GP channel. From a product standpoint, Q2 sequential Invisalign case growth reflects increases in both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, including Invisalign First and Invisalign Moderate. Q2 also benefited from increased utilization in the DSO channel. Our international Clear Aligners, Q2 Invisalign case volumes were down 1.7% sequentially, primarily as a result of the headwinds described previously. For EMEA, Q2 Invisalign case volumes were down slightly primarily reflecting a slight increase in Iberia and Italy, offset primarily by slightly lower sequential volumes in the UK and France. For Q2, expansion market shipments declined sequentially. Q2 Invisalign teen patients increased sequentially driven by an increase in the number of doctors submitting teen cases. Turning to APAC. Invisalign case volumes were down slightly, reflecting a full quarter effect of continued lockdowns in China. For Q2, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and India performed well during the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign case shipments growth was strong in Japan, India, Taiwan, Thailand and Korea. The APAC teen case volume increased year-over-year, primarily driven by increased doctor submitters. Turning to new innovations. The Align Digital Platform is an integrated suite of proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless end-to-end solution to customers that connects all users, doctors, labs patients and consumers to transform smiles, and change lives. Our technology advancements help our doctor customers deliver superior clinical outcomes, treatment efficiency and also superior patient experience. In Q2, we introduced Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro and Cone Beam being Computed Tomography systems, integration for ClinCheck software, building on several new innovations announced last quarter that we'll begin rolling out across the regions in August. Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro, the next-generation patient communication tool that empowers doctors to help patients visualize their potential new smile after Invisalign treatment. Use in-phase visualization in 3D dentition view, all done chairside in minutes. Cone Beam Computed Tomography systems, or what we call CBCT, integration for ClinCheck software is designed to deliver a complete view of a patient's roots, crown and jawbone. CBCT integration for ClinCheck software enables doctors to confidently deliver a more informed Invisalign clear liner treatment plan or a wide range of cases. The user-friendly interface makes easy for doctors to see their patients root, crown and jawbone and one automatically digitally fused 3D model. This allows doctors to tailor their treatment plan based on their experience and their patients' needs. CBCT integration for ClinCheck software gives doctors the control and confidence to expand treatment planning to a broad range of mal inclusions, including surgical, restorative, expansion, extraction as well as teen cases with impacted or unterrupted team. While it's still early in the commercialization of these new products, initial feedback from doctors is encouraging. We are excited to begin scaling them across our customer base in the second half of 2022. Also, during the quarter, we awarded 11 new research grants, totaling $275,000 to universities around the world. Through our annual research awards program, we help advance orthodontic and dental research, furthering our commitment to the future of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. Our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the Invisalign system, and driving that demand to Invisalign doctors offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. For Q2, we had over 16.2 million visits to our websites, a 15% year-over-year increase, and delivered over 6.3 billion impressions. Both metrics were lower versus Q1 as we chose to rightsize our size and media spend in Q2, given the macroeconomic environment. During the quarter, we built on our successful \u201cInvis Is\u201d multimedia campaign and launched in the US the next evolution with two new campaigns, \u201cInvis Is\u201d trauma-free, targeted at teens, and Invis Is when everything clicks, targeted at adults. Our Invis Is trauma-free campaign highlights the benefits of Invisalign treatment, while numerously juxtaposing teams with the significant hassles involved with using braces. Our Invis Is when everything clicks campaign showcases Invisalign treatment, transforming smiles and the resulting confidence it gives the young adults. Both campaigns will be rolled out to markets around the world in Q3. About some of our consumer patient app My Invisalign continued to increase with 1.8 million downloads to date. Uses of our four digital tools continues to increase, for example, Invisalign virtual appointment tool was used over 12,000 times, and our insurance verification feature was used 36,000 times in Q2. Further, we received more than 91,000 patient photos in our virtual care feature globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our artificial intelligence capabilities and improve our services for doctors and patients. Additional consumer demand metrics are included in our Q2 earnings slides posted on our website. We are pleased with our Q2 Systems and Services revenues, which were up 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Q2 sequential growth primarily reflects higher scanner volumes in the Americas and APAC, and increased subscriptions. Year-over-year results primarily reflect increased scanner revenues in the Americas, offset by lower volume in APAC and EMEA. Growth of our iTero scanner installed base is driving an increase in services revenue. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services growth reflects increased service revenues from our largest scanner installed base, higher subscription revenues and increased sales of scanner once leased. The number of intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions in Q2 reflect continued adoption of our digital scanners and our larger installed base. Total worldwide intraoral digital scan submitted to start an Invisalign case in Q2 increased 88.4% from 82.2% in Q2 of last year. International intraoral digital scans for Invisalign case submissions increased 84.4%, up from 76.2% in Q2 of last year. For the Americas, 91.4% of Invisalign cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan compared to 87% in Q2 last year. Cumulatively, over 60.4 million orthodontic scans and over 12.6 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. Our Q2 exocad CAD/CAM products and services, which include restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design offerings are included in our Systems and Services revenue. Exocad products and services are helping extend our digital dental solutions and broaden the Align Digital Platform towards fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows. During the quarter, exocad released dental CAD 3.1 Rijeka in the new powerful lab software, which saves design time and offers more intuitive workflows along the designs earning from CAD to CAM. In addition, the release -- the exocad release launched the new, myexocad portal, introducing mandatory end-user software use registration that for the first time, allows exocad to collect information about who and how customers are using the software. This expands the opportunities for future product improvements. Also during the quarter, we signed a new long-term contract with exocad\u2019s largest customer, Arming Gearbox, further strengthening our relationship. Finally, we continue to execute our strategy of geographic expansion. In June, our European manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland began manufacturing clear aligners for the EMEA region. Locally, for the first time, we also continued our operational expansion in Poland with our latest treatment planning facility. Our expanded operation in Poland supports Invisalign doctors in local languages, increases our flexibility and timeliness and supporting our doctor customers across the region, and we expect will positively influence the quality and time of preparation of ClinCheck treatment plans and provide our doctor customers with benefits of digital orthodontics with the Invisalign system. We are uniquely positioned with manufacturing and treatment planning in all three regions, and no other clear aligner manufacturer has our global footprint and capabilities. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $969.6 million, down 0.4% from the prior quarter and down 4.1% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. This is compared to Q2 2021 revenues of $1 billion, which had a year-over-year growth rate of 186.9%. For clear aligners, Q2 revenues of $798.4 million were down 1.4% sequentially, due primarily to product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher non-case revenues, and down 5.1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower volumes, unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and product mix shift, partially offset by higher additional aligners per order processing fees and higher non-case revenues. Q2 2022 Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $12.3 million, or approximately 1.5% sequentially, and approximately $32.9 million, or approximately 4% year-over-year. For Q2, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs decreased sequentially and increased year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in comprehensive ASPs reflect higher discounts and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners. On a year-over-year basis, higher comprehensive ASPs reflect the impact of higher additional aligners and per order processing fees, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts. Q2 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by lower discounts, partially offset by product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, higher Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect lower discounts, per order processing fees and higher additional aligners, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift. Clear Aligner of deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $25.4 million, or 2.3% sequentially and $231 million, or up 2.5% year-over-year, and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q2 2022 Systems and Services revenue of $171.2 million were up 4.7% sequentially, primarily due to higher scanner volume and ASP, and were up slightly by 0.8% year-over-year, primarily from higher services revenues from our larger installed base, partially offset by lower scanner volume and lower ASP. Systems and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.9 million, or approximately 1.7% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $7 million, or approximately 3.9%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was $13.3 million, or 5.4% sequentially, and up $99.6 million, or 62.3% year-over-year primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 70.9%, down two points sequentially and down 4.1 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points sequentially and 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 73.3%, down 1.5 points sequentially due to lower ASPs and higher freight costs. Clear Aligner gross margin was down 3.6 points year-over-year due to a higher mix of additional aligner volume, higher freight and manufacturing spend, partially offset by higher ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was 59.8%, down 3.6 points sequentially due to higher manufacturing variances and freight costs, partially offset by higher ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin was down 6.1 points year-over-year due to lower ASPs and higher manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher service mix. Q2 operating expenses were $499.4 million, down sequentially 2.3%, and up 2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down by $11.9 million mainly due to lower incentive compensation and controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $9.7 million, reflecting our continued investment in marketing, sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs, operating expenses were $466 million down sequentially 3% and up 1% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating income of $188.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 19.4% and down 0.9 points sequentially and down 7.2 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points sequentially due to foreign exchange. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributable to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 2.4 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, of intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs, operating margin for the second quarter was 23.3%, down 0.7 points sequentially and down 6.5 points year-over-year. Interest and other income expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $14.6 million, down sequentially by $4 million and down year-over-year by $14.5 million, primarily due to larger net foreign exchange losses from the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the US dollar. The GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 35% compared to 28.4% in the first quarter and 25.7% in the second quarter of the prior year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.6% in the second quarter compared to 24.2% in the first quarter and 19.5% in the second quarter of the prior year. The second quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter effective tax rate primarily due to foreign income tax at different rates and lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.44, down sequentially $0.26 and down $1.07 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.26 on a sequential basis and $0.42 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per share was $2 for the second quarter, down $0.13 sequentially and down $1.04 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities were $977.2 million, down sequentially $143.4 million and down $109.2 million year-over-year. Of our $977.2 million balance, $251.4 million was held in the US and $725.8 million was held by our international entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $931.9 million, down approximately 2% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, down approximately two days sequentially and up approximately 13 days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $127 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $76 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $51 million. In Q2, we purchased $200 million of our common stock through an accelerated stock repurchase program, receiving approximately 757,000 shares at an average price of $264.37 per share. We are over halfway through our May 2021 $1 billion repurchase program, and have approximately $450 million remaining available for purchase. Now turning to full year 2022 and the factors that influence our views on our business outlook. Overall, our Q2 results were solid, and we feel good about the execution across the business, especially in an increasingly challenging global economic environment. Delivering revenues and volumes relatively unchanged from Q1 and down only slightly year-over-year despite unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange speak to the strength of our underlying products and services and the size of our market opportunity. We remain confident in the huge underpenetrated market for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, our technology and our industry leadership and our ability to execute and make progress towards our long-term model of 20% to 30% revenue growth. We also remain committed to our goal for fiscal 2022 to deliver GAAP operating margins above 20%, while making strategic investments in sales, marketing, R&D and operations, notwithstanding the impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, which was not factored into our operating margin guidance for the full year. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as a digital manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. For 2022, we expect our investment in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. This includes our investment in our aligner fabrication facility in Wroclaw, Poland. In times like these, our strong fundamental Business differentiates align, and we are grateful to have a profitable underlying business model that generates strong cash flow as well as a healthy balance sheet that provides flexibility to invest in our growth while supporting our employees, customers and shareholders. As we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to manage our investments to account for headwinds and uncertainty while focusing on successfully delivering on our strategic growth drivers. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. Closing Q2 in the first half of 2022 has proved to be tougher than we expected. As we continue to navigate macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence and impacts related to COVID-19 variance, we cannot lose sight of the strong fundamentals of our business and the enormous market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. The decisions we make this year will have lasting strategic implications for the future of our industry and the competitive landscape. We are holding true to our business strategy, and making good progress in a very difficult operating environment. We remain committed to balancing investments to drive growth and long-term strategic priorities with near-term headwinds while acting with a sense of urgency to ensure that we're ready to capitalize and extend our global innovation leadership as growth resumes. Thanks for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Nathan Rich : Thank you, good afternoon. Hey, Joe and John. I guess, I wanted to start high level. Joe, you kind of highlighted the consistent case in revenue trends in the second quarter relative to the first. But within the context of a challenging macro environment, I guess, how does that influence your thinking on the trajectory of the business? And have you seen an impact on patient traffic to dental practices or treatment acceptance rates that's kind of driving that commentary? Joe Hogan : Nate, it's a -- if you look at this from a domestic standpoint, you can pull out some signal, but I think you have to when you're asking a demand question like that, you have to look at this globally. And I think like John and I were just clear in our introduction that basically, if you took Asia, COVID-19 impacted us pretty tremendously in Asia. Japan for a little bit in the first part of the quarter in China almost throughout the quarter. So it was really a COVID discussion there, and it's hard to pull a demand signal out. In the United States, I mean, if you look at the data that we do, you'll see from a general practitioner standpoint or whatever, some stability in patient vision to what's going on. Our concern here is, obviously, this is a product where like a cap or a crown or cleaning or something that needs to be done, it's somewhat discretionary. And we see that from an adult standpoint, more variability in adult selection than in teens. Teens have been pretty stable in that way if we talked about before. Moving over to Europe. We're working off 300% growth rates in Europe last year, okay, which you have to internalize that. It's a pretty big comparison year-on-year. And there weren't standard vacations being taken in Europe to the beginning of the end of the second quarter and the third quarter. So overall, I'd say, as you look around the globe, I fee like -- I felt good, as we mentioned in the script, about Q1 versus Q2 and pretty much the same kind of demand pattern. But right now, I can't really give you a trajectory in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, because of the macro environment, concerns again in China from another COVID shutdown and those types of things. I hope that makes sense, Nate. Nathan Rich : Yes, definitely. And maybe just a quick follow-up. \u2013 were you, I guess, able to size kind of the headwind from the lockdowns in China? And with that -- in that market specifically, have you started to see those volumes recover as we're starting to see those lockdowns ease? Joe Hogan : For sure. I mean it's direct correlation there as soon as they let Shanghai open again, we saw it reflected in our order rates there. And look, we continue to feel good about China in a stable market. It's just the dramatic way that China continues to address COVID cases by major cities. This just creates a huge amount of uncertainty as when the next lockdown will be. Nathan Rich : Thank you. Joe Hogan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Rich. The next question is from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please proceed. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Joe Hogan : Hi, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Anderson : Thanks so much for the question. One thing I was wondering if you could comment about -- I know in the sort of fourth quarter of last year, and into the first quarter, you did increase the sales hiring, sequentially and year-over-year. Could you sort of talk through sort of the impact of those salespeople? Where are they in the ramp process? And how do you -- should we think about their potential for contributing in the back half of the year? Thanks. Joe Hogan : That's a good question, Elizabeth. Obviously, our sales force -- being a direct sales force is really important to us in that way. And so the way we do this, obviously, as you indicated, we hire a lot of salespeople upfront. We have sales training programs too that help to initiate them as they come into the corporation. But I would tell you, depending on where you are around the globe, there is a six-month and nine-month burn-in period, before you really feel that they're up to speed. They understand the Invisalign system, the digital platform and those types of things. So I would say in some simpler kinds of situations geographically, it could be six months. But in general, it's nine months or so before we have confidence that they're going to be really good on their feet as they talk to our doctors. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. That's helpful. And then one thing that depressed me in the quarter a little bit was about the teen number. I know that sometimes this quarter, it's been off because of COVID in terms of seasonality, and it's not necessarily always the strongest quarter for teen. But how are you thinking about that versus the economic sensitivity of adult cases and sort of how -- do you expect that to sort of trend in the sort of near-term? Joe Hogan : Yes. Keep in mind, we see a lot more concern from an adult standpoint, when you look year-over-year in the sense of our order growth in adults, I mean it's been affected Elizabeth, and there's a lot of data that we produce that will show you that. On the teen side, it's hard to pull a lot of the second quarter because it really starts in the third quarter. But I felt overall good about it, but again, not surprised because we've always felt that teens have a certain window of time from a treatment standpoint. And so it's not necessarily an emotional purchase in a way, it's usually planned for and anticipated. And -- and what we saw between the second quarter and beginning of the third quarter, it really bears that out. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Joe Hogan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Anderson. Our next question is from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed. Jon Block : Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I'll follow up on teen, maybe just to go there. I think worldwide teen was down year-over-year. And I believe, Joe, you mentioned that teen and APAC was up year-over-year, which sort of implies that North American teen was down maybe a decent amount. So anything to call out there? Why do we see that maybe specific to North America? And then more importantly, you did have some positive commentary around teen case packs, you talked about enrollment. So maybe just talk to us on how long it might take for the teen case pack program in North America to give that segment a shot in the arm and then your plans to roll that out internationally? I've got a follow-up. Joe Hogan : Jon, on the teen side, remember, we kind of lost -- or we had a muted signal on the team side. It needs to be very clear from quarter-to-quarter before COVID. If you remember last year, it was much more muted. This year, we're hoping to see a less muted cycle. And I think we're starting to feel that, Jon. So it's -- I don't think you can look too much between what we're doing between the first quarter and second quarter and pull a clear teen signal out of there. The other thing on teen too is there's always competitive concern with other clear aligner whatever. But basically, this is a wires and brackets competition with us. It's always been and continues to be that way. And in new products that we're launching these teen packs, we feel good about them. They've been -- as I mentioned in my script too, they've been received well. And it's been with the lower-end orthodontics from our standpoint that haven't done a lot of teen cases in the past. And that's a segment that we were fishing for to give them more confidence to be able to move in with teens. So we're not declaring victory, but we feel we have a good product that's timed well. And we're not seeing the cycles in the teen marketplace as we're seeing in the adult marketplace. And obviously, Jon, as we get through the third quarter, we'll have a much better understanding of how we turn out that way. But I didn't pull anything out between the first and the second quarter that concerned me. Jon Block : Got it. Helpful. Thank you. And then for my second one, let me try to maybe jam two in one, and hopefully not make a mess of it. So just for us on the 3Q versus 2Q overall case volumes, China is reopened. China is a decent chunk of business for you guys. So if China snaps back, you talked about Shanghai, then maybe talk to us on why we wouldn't see you guys resume some sequential growth 3Q versus 2Q? I know there's many other markets. And then maybe just to stick with China. I just love your thoughts on what's going on over there, maybe in terms of market share, your main competitor had some quasi numbers out recently. It looked like they were down mid-single digits in cases 1H 2022 year-over-year, which quite honestly, I actually thought that was a good number considering the environment. So I would love your thoughts on just China and your ability to hold share on what's going on from a market share perspective? Thanks guys. Joe Hogan : Yeah. I'll start with the China and move backwards, Jon. And I'll get John involved here, too. But from the China side, obviously, we saw what you published there, whatever, but I looked at Angel numbers, and it basically same thing we experienced. I mean, we experienced a shutdown of Shanghai, slowdowns in some other regions, and there was nothing in those numbers that really surprised me. As I look at China, our ability to compete there. I feel great about it. And again, our investments we've made there in treatment planning and manufacturing. We've only added to that. The efficiency of those organizations have done well. Our product is great for that marketplace, and some of the most difficult cases that we encounter exist there, too. So I feel good about our ability to compete in that market against Angel or anyone else who's there. We just need a stable marketplace that we can operate in, and it hasn't been stable for -- goodness knows, it's been, what, almost two years. And I mean I just read this morning, the Wuhan's looking at the close down. So I mean, Jon, there's a lot of variability there, a concern with COVID and shutdowns, particularly in the second half of this year in China, but I continue to be concerned about that can disrupt the marketplace. But if that stays clear, we're going to have China in the second half that we can operate from. To answer your question, I feel good about our competitive position there, our ability to compete against with anyone. John Morici : And we should see some of the sequential history that we normally see in our business. It goes to what Joe said that, there's just some unforeseen variables that are still there. If there is a shutdown in China, that will impact our numbers. If there's no shutdown, we should see sequential improvement. And then you have some of the other macro economics that we've talked about in terms of potential recession or other things that people are concerned about, that affects their decisions on whether they go into treatment. But we're watching closer to see how sequentially things are behaving and making investments appropriate based on what we see. Joe Hogan : And Jon, sorry, just staying back to your second question... Jon Block : Sorry. if I can just jump in... Joe Hogan : Go ahead, Jon. Jon Block : Sorry, Joe. I was just going to say, John and Joe, maybe to follow up on that lasts comment just for clarity purposes because I think it's an important one. Are you guys saying sort of as you sit here today, who the heck knows what's going on with Wuhan, I don't know, something worse incrementally with the economy. But as we sit here today in late July, you're expecting the resumption of sequential growth off the 2Q number, this evening? Joe Hogan : Well, I'd say, Jon, expecting anything in this market might be a sign of a low IQ. When you look at what's going on in China, I'm not going to sit here and tell you I expect a stable market in the second half based on their COVID policies. So I hope -- from the United States standpoint, there's a lot going on trying to explain to the teen market overall outside of China, I feel is the most stable market we have, and the one that we're ready to compete with, and we're moving into seasonality, what really makes a difference. We have -- we're positioned well with products. But as you know, Jon, as well as anybody, that's always been a wires and brackets marketplace. We've been taking share 1.5 points, two points a year. We're hoping some moves we make can make that better, but we'll know a lot more when the third quarter is over in the sense. Jon Block : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Joe Hogan : Thanks, Jon. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Block. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please proceed. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Joe \u2013 hey, Joe, so I just wanted to talk maybe on the doctor shift to that number this quarter. It's trended down each of the last couple of quarters. This quarter in the Americas, it did trend back up just a touch. What are your views on what that means? Is that a -- market stabilized a little bit? Is that maybe the competitive positioning is stabilizing a little bit? Just how do you view that number in the Americas? And is there room left in the Americas for that number over the next couple of years to keep moving higher? Are you kind of at a point where you've saturated kind of the Americas market with a number of doctors who are going to be performing in these cases? Joe Hogan : Just to answer your last part of your question first, Jeff. No, we have a lot of room to grow in the Americas, too. In United States, Canada, but also you have to throw in Latin America and Brazil in that. There's a lot of growth, John and I have ported over these numbers a lot. You know what happens, if you backed these numbers up before really the big surge in orders that we had before, we can draw a line through these things. It doesn't upset us. You have to split orthos and GPs very clearly. Remember, you have some GPs that do like three cases a year. As things kind of slow down, they'll be out of the circulation for a while and then they order another and whatever. And these numbers will go up 81, 1,000, 2,000, we'll see them go up and down. But don't look at this in any way as that we're saturated in this marketplace, both from an orthodontic standpoint and a GP standpoint. Jeff, the other thing too, I think, that people forget from an orthodontic standpoint is that our orthodontists who do teens. These are orthodontists that are really committed to Invisalign for the most part, and they do a lot of teens. But we still have a significant amount of orthodontists at do Invisalign almost exclusively for adults. And so you'll see that whole piece from a utilization standpoint as we increase our team penetration, you should see the utilization rates there improve. Jeff Johnson : Yeah, that's helpful. And then maybe kind of a follow-up on all that a two-parter, just the international number again, kind of, did tick down a little bit that number of factors shipped to internationally. One, I would assume you think there's a lot more room even there to saturate that market over the next few years, that would seem to make sense to me anyway. But is there any way to look at what that number did in China? And was there sequential decline largely driven by the shutdowns in China, or ex-China, would that number have been up? And then I was a little surprised to hear cases down, I think you said in UK year-over-year. Is that just a tough comp, or what's going on in the UK? I think we are all aware of China pressures in early, Japan pressures or early quarter Japan pressures, but UK caught me off guard a little bit there? Thanks. Joe Hogan : I'll answer the UK piece first. The UK was outstanding for us last year. Remember, Europe grew 300% for us last year, Jeff, right? The UK led that. So I'm sure that UK number is higher than what that aggregate number is. And so what you're seeing is adult retrenchment in the UK from an order standpoint, but not an indication of a utilization issue that I'd say, across the doctor base that we have in the UK. John, I don't know\u2026 : And just on the China piece or the APAC piece for international. So that was certainly an impact in terms of the lockdowns, and doctors just not being able to transact and therefore, don't have ship to. So the international side of the doctor ship was certainly impacted by COVID. We won't break it out by the sub-regions. But that was an impact that look, as those offices open up, as those lockdowns are minimized, we would expect that to increase from a ship to stand. Jeff Johnson : Thanks guys. Joe Hogan : Yeah. Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Our next question is from the line of Justin Lin [ph] with William Blair. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon. Can you just touch on your sales and marketing spending strategy a little bit in the short-term and longer term? I guess, when can you decide to flip the switch? Joe Hogan : You mean flip the switches as far as up or down? Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, yeah. Joe Hogan : Yeah. I mean, obviously, obviously, we saw our adults dramatically decreased, and so the return on investment in some specific geographies. John, as I take a look at it, and we don't eliminate it, but we reduce it in accordance with what we think the demand pattern is. And we spread it around into other countries that we feel we can get a higher return on. And we just basically sizing our advertising to what we think the demand patterns are around the business in different areas. And so I wouldn't look at this as any way that we'll continue to advertise aggressively and promote our brand and to drive value in our change to bring customers to our doctor base, but we can be responsible to we can advertise at the rate that we did last year when we were growing at over 100% in a lot of these regions, we have to modify it somewhat in order to address that demand pattern. John Morici : And we adjust into the market. So keep the overall brand awareness, keep that averages. Remember, still sudden spending even as we right-size things, hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing and media to be able to go to market, drive that awareness. But then in certain markets, if there's COVID or if there's economic concerns and so on, we're adjusting things to make sure that we right-size and continue to make sure that we make the right trade-off between how we're investing in go-to-market, and continue to reinvest in the rest of the business like R&D and operations. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's very helpful. And I guess just pivoting to a more sort of higher-level question. Any update on commercial operations in sort of your emerging markets like Brazil, India, Africa, what would you say current penetration levels are over there? And I guess, realistically, how much revenue can you capture from those regions in the next, let's say, five to 10 years? A \u2013 Joe Hogan :  And the region that you mentioned were really underpenetrated, huge opportunity. I mean we've seen great progress in Brazil. We're seeing good progress in India. Reported in -- I mean, it's -- when we talk about those 500 million patients, they're out there. And the way to get them is we do -- we put salespeople in place. We put the right kind of capability on the ground. This is a direct sales force that you have to have in order to sell our product line. But to answer your specific question, the penetration rates aren't even close. And that's -- again, you can see that in our script, that's how we remain so confident that in a stable environment, we'll continue to perform really well. John Morici : And we're built as a company to really expand into those markets. We've got that global footprint for manufacturing now in all three geographies. We've got treatment planning. We've got that go-to-market sales force -- direct sales force with great products. So we're built in all those markets. We like the dynamics of these markets where you have a growing middle class, big population. You've got people who want to straighten their teeth, and we've got a great way for them to get to that. So all the markets you described as well as many others, those are where we think of some of the investments because it's a great return on those investments. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you very much. Joe Hogan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. [indiscernible]. Our next question is from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Joe Hogan : Hi, Jason. Jason Bednar : Hey, good afternoon. Yes. So Joe, I'll go big picture here in the US market, and maybe go back to clarifying point on Jon Block's question earlier. On one hand, demand in the category broadly just did seem to show some signs of moderation in the second half of last year relation to a bit of a leading indicator in other parts of high end then on the help of the average consumer. I mean this needs are going to be coming into some easier absolute comparisons as we head into the back half of this year, which I don't know, maybe helps reverse this downtrend in Invisalign case growth. But I guess we're also in the early days of what still could be some more pain coming for the consumer. So I guess what dominates in your opinion? Do the easier comps dominate, or does it more challenge on consumer dominate? And again, just thinking about the domestic market you're and ignoring again some of that China and predictability that's out there. Joe Hogan : Yes. I'll let John take a shot at this, too. But I would say, I mean, obviously, you talk about easier comps. I mean when you're comping against 300% growth, like we just talked about, it's one of the tougher comps on a large number I've had in my business career. And so obviously, when you get some light on that line, it helps somewhat. But consumer confidence. I'd say, outside of the COVID, the way I'd look at the business again is COVID affected Asia in a big way. We had some COVID staffing issues or whatever, but predominantly in the West, it's consumer confidence that we look at. And so those consumer confidence numbers start to equalize to start to get better. Some of the ones we look in Europe are all-time lows. I feel that means a lot. It means that means more to meet in those comparisons years from here. We report more confidence in consumers in a trend where in that kind of environment, we think we see the adult cases resume at a pace that we'd be equal to our long-term growth rate. John Morici : Yes. It's consumer confidence overall, and in certain cases\u2026 Jason Bednar : I guess, just real quick, I guess I would -- yeah, I guess I was just focusing more on the US market. And I totally understand Europe and China and APAC and all the different dynamics there. But just in within the US market, I mean, the comps do get easier, absolute comps -- they did tick down starting in the second half of last year. So just I'd be where I'd be focusing the question here, sorry to interrupt. Joe Hogan : Yeah. No, Jason, that's okay. I look at the United States too is -- I just give you consumer confidence more than anything. Not just saying that there's no big variant issue or something that happens with COVID. We're all kind of have PTSD in that sense and what we experienced over the last two years. But yeah, I like the comparison year-over-year. That's going to be helpful. But those consumer confidence numbers, whether I'm talking about Europe or I'm talking about the States, those are the ones that we stay alluded to that we think are a really good indicator in the sense of our market, and that adult market that we appeal to, both in the GP segment and the adult market in the orthodontic segment, too. John Morici : And the piece that I would add to the US is just that as we get into teen season now as we go from Q2 to Q3. Teens will be important to see. We've got great products. We've got great go-to-market opportunities to be able to grow in those markets and get more market share. When we think of teens everywhere in the world, it's single digit and even in the US. So we look at growth opportunities that will be teens, maybe a little bit less of more resistant to maybe some of that consumer concerns that they have. Consumer concerns certainly show up on the adult side, but we think teams can help offset that just a bit because it's less discretionary. Jason Bednar : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up here. A lot of questions out there right now from investors on the decremental margin impact for the business with volumes and revenue doing what it's doing here. You added a lot of head count. It's significantly expanded branding and advertising efforts during the pandemic really helped to widen the competitive moat, so really impressive. It sounds like some of that marketing though has been recalibrated here. Are there further resets that -- with the OpEx structure that might be necessary in this environment? And I guess, what's the trigger for you to decide that a further rightsizing is necessary? Joe Hogan : I mean rightsizing, when I hear words like that, it means that we've gone to the layoffs, so we haven't laid anything off. Remember, we -- any one off in that sense. We normally hire to a 20% to 30% growth rate. And so -- and we -- our OpEx spend is in that range, too. So, obviously, we didn't -- we couldn't hire in that range, and so if you call that a cutback, it's a cutback from our normal OpEx. What we do is we normally balance OpEx to revenue at about a 50% range, and there's a lot of variables in that line from an OpEx standpoint that we can go about. Remember, our most important areas that we want to make sure we take care of is our commercial team, our engineering effort and also our marketing. We know those are really key. And we focus on those, and we balance the business well. John, anything you want to add? John Morici : It's a balance, both short and long-term. So as we balance out our plans, we look to the growth opportunities we have, we want to make sure we continue to invest in those growth opportunities. But then obviously, we have to be mindful of the current conditions that we're in, and we'll adjust as needed to still maximize the return on investments that we're making. Jason Bednar : All right. Thanks so much. John Morici : Thanks Jason. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Bednar. Our next question is from the line of Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. And I wanted to ask another Americas teen question here. But just given the seasonality and given this is an area where you should have some better visibility. I just want to clarify, does this -- does this mean you're going to see a meaningful sequential pickup in the coming quarter, or why would that not happen for you? And just given that should be an area more under your control here. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Yes. Our normal growth pattern between the second quarter and the third quarter is flat to down 1 percentage point or so. John can confirm that. So the second quarter to third quarter is a big teen season, but there's other parts of our portfolio that kind of balance out with that. It's not traditionally a jump from second to third quarter. But again, we're focused on teens because we feel teens have a lot less elasticity than what adults have right now based on the consumer confidence level. So I just -- but I'd just caution you here. Remember, this is a wires and brackets play. It's something that's systemic that we have worked on for years. We have many new products like Invisalign First, I mean give advancement and several new teen products that help us with this. The new teen packs help also. We think we're well positioned, but we have to get into the quarter and be able to assess how well that market is actually holding up. John, anything... John Morici : But specifically in the US, US teen, we should see sequential improvement as we get into teen season, going from Q2 to Q3, notwithstanding any occurrences that happened from an economic standpoint, but the expectation is given our products, given the opportunity, given the utilization that we have, we should be able to see growth. Notwithstanding, anything else that gets in our way. Erin Wright : Okay. Thanks. And then ASPs for the balance of the year, how should we be thinking about that and the FX impact? John Morici : Erin, FX, obviously, Q1 to Q2 was a big impact in FX. We see it in the numbers from revenue all the way down to our EPS. I would think of it's tough to forecast where FX is going to go. Certainly, dollar has strengthened. I think you kind of take the numbers that they're at now and kind of play that forward for the rest of the year is how we look at that. I think from an overall ASP standpoint, there's always going to be puts and takes. So we're not doing anything different from a discounting standpoint, how we're going to market and so on. You might have some mix effects that come through. But I take the FX rates kind of as they are now, project those forward and then ASP should be too much different than what you see now notwithstanding any FX. Erin Wright : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Wright. The next question is from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brandon Couillard : Thanks, John, a quick follow-up on that FX question. I appreciate all the details in the deck. It is very, very helpful. Just curious, what is the estimated impact of currency on the operating margin for the year now in the ballpark? John Morici : Well, ballpark, I would look at that is about 1 point, maybe just over 1 point of impact. We saw that 1.1 point impact from Q1 to Q2 in op margin. I would kind of look at the full year and about the same. Brandon Couillard : Thanks. And then Joe, on the scanner business, any color between the North American segment and international in terms of growth rate, how would you sort of characterize the capital spending environment in those two regions, specifically? Joe Hogan : Yes. I'll start with -- I mean, obviously, we had trouble selling scanners in China because China shut down. And China is one of our bigger markets is between China and Japan and Asia. So I didn't look at that so much as and overall market problem, I looked at that as more of a COVID problem. And so hopeful of, as I mentioned before, if that COVID stays clear, that will write itself. United States, just a good job by the team, strong demand there. 5G plus tends to be the really strong scanner out there. On the restorative side, dentists liking the NERI, the near-infrared technology for carries detection and orthodontists continue like the exactness of how our workflows at all from an overall iTero standpoint. So I feel good about the Americas and what the performance was in that piece. And as I mentioned in my script is 40% with a large installed base now, 40% is services, too, which is really helpful in that business overall. And look, I feel good about, again, our scanners in Europe compared to get some pretty big numbers again last year. So I wouldn't be blinded by the year-over-year number in that sense. But Europe has the added pressure right now from a Ukraine standpoint. It's just -- it wears on the consumer sentiment piece. I think it makes docs a little more reluctant in -- but there's -- I feel good about our position in Europe from a scanner standpoint. And as the market hopefully starts to stabilize here, we'll see that business that we had return loans. Brandon Couillard : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please proceed. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for getting me in. So just want to think about how -- or what it would take for you guys to feel comfortable with providing guidance again, or feeling comfortable that you can hit your longer term targets rather than making progress towards it. Do we need to see consumer confidence go back above 99% or something like that, or I mean, at the beginning of the year, you caveated and said, listen, if there's no more COVID outbreaks, we'd still be able to do this. What do you need to see before you can come to us and say, hey, we're back on track or we think we can do this? So we feel comfortable. We're going to be able to grow at ex-rate going forward, even be able to provide guidance for like a quarter going forward, even if it's not for the full year. What needs to happen, in your mind? Joe Hogan : I'll turn it over to John. But first of all is, remember, we don't carry inventory in this business outside of scanners. So it's a real-time business. We don't have any inventory to reflect from or any -- very little business from a week-to-week standpoint. So I'll move it over to John, but keep that in mind that we, kind of, feel these trends early on both ends. As the economy picks up, we'll probably feel it first. And as it turns down, we feel it by just the nature of the business first. John Morici : It really comes down to, Kevin, more just having more predictability on a macro basis, understanding you mentioned COVID and thinking that we're through it, then you have China lockdowns or some of the consumer sentiment and things that come up that are outside of our control, we feel very good about being able to control what we can control, making the right investments as we go to market or adding investments in R&D to better our products and so on, and drive that return. And, therefore, like I said, we can manage that 20%, that\u2019s something that we can manage as we go through the quarter. It really comes out to having more predictability on a macro basis. And once we get confidence in that, and we work our way to that understanding, look, the economies are going to do what they're going to do. They're going to go up or down. But if I have more predictability on the direction that they're going and how they're going to go, then we can give a good forecast. Kevin Caliendo : All right. Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Caliendo. Our next question is from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please proceed. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. I have kind of a follow-up to one of the earlier ones, and some that Kevin just asked sort of on the moving pieces going forward. I mean we spent a lot of time talking about China lockdowns and the impact that had, and there was some discussion on consumer confidence as well. But it was sort of brought up in the sense of, well, what happens when things improve. I hate to be the pessimist here, but can we talk about the other side of things as inflation is one thing and consumer sentiment and consumer confidence is another thing. But recessionary impact, if unemployment goes higher, if job losses start to accelerate, there is a scenario where things are -- should get worse for the next couple of quarters before they get better. So can you talk through sort of how you view the likelihood of that happening, the impact you think it will have on the business? And also sort of what's your response going to be what's the game plan? You talked a little bit about controlling costs in the quarter already. What would be the other levers you would pull if things for the consumer in the Americas and in Europe get materially worse over the next three to six to nine months? Joe Hogan : It's Joe. Look, I think you've seen that -- I feel we've been responsible in the sense of adjusting the business to a lower demand signal than the business is used to having. I think you saw us respond the same way when COVID hit in March of in 2020, and how we ran the business. If it gets worse, and it could get worse is the way -- I mean from the standpoint of whatever happens from an economic standpoint. I'd just say that, look, John and I come from businesses where we've been through these cycles. We know how to operate in a down cycle. We run a business that way. This is a growth business, and we'll treat it as a growth business, but we're responsible from a standpoint of making sure that we adjust this business to whatever economic conditions that we see out there. John Morici : And as a result, we've been able to make these adjustments. We're fortunate as a company to have the cash position, the balance sheet that we have and all these other. And in the end, you know the story, we have a huge opportunity to be able to grow. You just have this in our way. And like Joe said, and what many others say is it could get worse. We have to be able to be able to balance those short-term worse to with our long-term goal of being able to make Invisalign the standard of care. And that's what we're balancing right now, and that could play out -- that will play out in the next -- whatever, a year to 18 months, things will evolve. We hope that the economies improve. We hope that that a lot of this has just got a short term and things get better. And when things do get better, we're well positioned to be able to grow into this market, but we just have to be based on the realities of what's happening in short term. Michael Ryskin : Great. And a quick follow-up, if I can. On 1Q, you kind of gave some comments on pacing through the quarter, and gave some comments on April as it relates to March. Kind of get the sense that things probably slowed down at the end of 2Q or bit in June, both between FX and China lockdowns being worse. Any sense you can give on sort of the progression through the course of 2Q? And just any early signs you've seen from July, again, realize that walk-down in China and FX is playing a big role. But maybe if you could just focus on America's trends through the quarter, and July. That will be helpful. John Morici : Yes. No, it's a good question. So if you think like an overall picture, you hit some of the FX and so on, you look -- everybody can look at FX rates and see the changes and so on, you can project based on those. When you talk about a COVID lockdown or talk specifically in China, there was an impact for us. And we've seen that in the first quarter, we saw it in the second quarter, but it's -- happens in China. It happens in every place that we see where there's a lockdown, we have a reduction in volume. Where that lockdown goes away, the volume starts to come back. So I would say when you think of China, as you go from lockdown to not lockdown, that's favorable for us. We start to see some of the volume come back. And I think when you look at -- I think part of your question is around the US, I think what do you see for the US is it's -- maybe things stabilizing a little bit more. You're not seeing -- maybe it's pretty similar to what we exited Q2 into Q3. And I think when you look at the team benefit that ideally comes through with some of the products and programs that we have in teen in the US and other places, but focus on the US, we think that's helpful for us as we go from Q2 to Q3. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Ryskin. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Shirley Stacy for closing remarks.

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note this conference will be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Shirley Stacy, with Align Technology. You may begin. Shirley Stacy : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our Q3 results and discuss the performance of our two operating segments, System and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial performance and our view for the remainder of the year. Following that, I'll come back, summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. Our third quarter results reflect the continued macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence as well as significant impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates across currencies that affect our operations. On a constant currency basis, total Q3 revenues were reduced by $25 million or 2.7% sequentially and $57.4 million or 6.1% year-over-year, one of the largest quarterly foreign exchange impacts in our history. We remain confident in the execution of our strategic growth drivers despite the continuing economic headwinds. In Q3, we reached our 14 millionth Invisalign patient milestone during the quarter, which includes nearly 4 million teenagers and kids as young as six years old, who have been treated with Invisalign clear aligners. In Q3, teen case starts of 200,000 were up 13% sequentially and just off slightly compared to Q3 '21 a year ago when a record 206,000 teenagers started Invisalign treatment. We're also excited to be launching significantly new products and technologies that further enhance the Align Digital platform. Leading the digital transformation are the practice of dentistry, during the quarter we also began to commercialize ClinCheck live update software, Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personal Plan, Invisalign Smile Architect, the Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro with in-face visualization, Cone Beam Computed Tomography integration with ClinCheck software Invisalign, virtual AI software and iTero-exocad Connector. These technology advancements represent an important expansion of our digital platform that we believe will help our doctor customers increase treatment efficiency and deliver superior clinical outcomes and patient experiences, positioning us to drive growth when the market inevitably rebounds. We'll be showcasing these innovations next month at the Invisalign Ortho Summit Las Vegas, the premier education and networking experience for Invisalign practices with the most peer-to-peer presentations of any Invisalign education event. Through Q3, Systems and Services, interest in our iTero scanners was good with increased product demos across the regions. Doctors are increasingly recognizing the substantial benefits of intraoral scanning and end-to-end digital workflows with the iTero scanner and imaging systems. At the same time, increasing inflation, rising interest rates and less patient traffic and dental practices are lengthening sales cycles and conversion time. For Q3, System and Services revenues of $157.5 million were down sequentially year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced Q3 '22 systems and services revenues by approximately $4.1 million or 2.5% sequentially and approximately $9.9 million or 5.9% year-over-year. For Q3, scanner services year-over-year revenue growth was strong across all regions, particularly due to increased subscription revenue driven by growth of the installed base of iTero scanners. Year-over-year growth also reflects increased sales of iTero warrants lease and continued growth of our scanner leasing rental programs. We continue to work closely with our doctor customers to support their practice growth and digital transformation goals. This includes understanding different ways to enable them to navigate to more uncertain economic environment. Over the past year, we've had good success rolling out new leasing programs in Latin America and certified pre-owned or CPO, as we call it, options in India and North America. We're also looking at new opportunities on the capital equipment side for our DSO partners. This is a natural progression in an equipment business with a large and growing installed base. As we introduce new products, there are more opportunities for customers to upgrade to make trade-ins and to provide refurbished scanners for emerging markets, too. We expect to continue to roll out programs that are especially helpful for customers in the current macroeconomic environment. It's selling the way doctors and customers want to do business and leveraging our balance sheet. We're still early. We're pleased with the contribution of margin accretion we're seeing. For our Clear Aligner segment, macroeconomic uncertainty and waiting consumer confidence continues to impact the dental market overall, making for a challenging operating environment across the board. For Q3, third-party reports indicate there are fewer new patient visits, less traffic flow and lower orthodontic case starts overall. Our Clear Aligner volumes further reflect the underlying orthodontic market trends and a shift away from adults toward teens in Q3. Q3 Clear Aligner revenues were down 8.2% sequentially and down 12.5% year-over-year compared to Q3 '21 year-over-year revenue growth rates of plus 35%. On a constant currency basis, Q3 '22 Clear Aligner revenues were reduced by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $21 million or approximately 2.8% sequentially and approximately $47.4 million or approximately 6.1% year-over-year. For the quarter, Q3 Aligner volumes reflect a sequential increase in Invisalign shipments from Asia-Pacific and Latin America as well as North America Invisalign teen cases offset by lower volume in EMEA and North America, primarily Invisalign adult cases. For Q3, Invisalign First for kids as young as 6 grew year-over-year and was strong across all regions. On a trailing 12-month basis, as of Q3, Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and young kids using Invisalign First up year-over-year to over 734,000 cases. For Q3, the total number of new Invisalign trained doctors increased sequentially 8.5% driven by North America and Asia-Pacific. In terms of Invisalign submitters, the total number of doctors shipped to for Q3 increased sequentially to 84,400 doctors, the second highest number this year, driven by Asia-Pacific and the Americas. From a channel perspective, ortho submitters were slightly year-over-year up especially from doctors submitting teen cases, offsetting -- offset by a few GP dentists year-over-year, especially in EMEA. For other non-case revenues, which include retention products such as Vivera retainers, clinical training and education, accessories, e-commerce and our new subscription programs such as our DSP, Q3 revenues were up both sequentially and year-over-year. This reflects strong growth in retainers sequentially and year-over-year growth across all regions, driven by more submitters. In U.S., revenues for our doctor subscription program increased sequentially and year-over-year. I'm very pleased to see continued momentum in non-case revenues driven by subscription-based programs that we expect to continue to expanding across the business. Now let's turn to the specifics around the third quarter results, starting with the Americas. The Q3 Invisalign case volumes for Americas was down sequentially single-digit percentages and primarily due to lower Invisalign bulk shipments. The environment remains challenging and feedback from our customers indicates consumer financing and patient no shows affecting their practices in Q3, especially with adult patients. Q3 Invisalign volume also reflects increased case submissions from orthodontic channel and sequential growth in the teen segment. For Q3, teen patients were most resilient, reflecting continued momentum in younger patients with Invisalign First as well as the new Invisalign Teen Case Pack. During Q3, Invisalign Teen Case Packs grew both sequentially and year-over-year. As a reminder, Invisalign Teen Case Pack, a new subscription program that enables orthodontists to buy Clear Aligners and packs in advance. They also include exclusive practice development benefits with the Invisalign brand and require an incremental volume commitment from doctors. Teen case packs are currently available in the U.S., Canada and France, and we expect to be expanded more in EMEA region. Turning to our international business for Q3, Invisalign Clear Aligner volume was down very slightly sequentially, 1.4%, with strong sequential growth for APAC, offset by lower volume in EMEA. For EMEA, Q3 operating environment was challenging. Inflation in the Eurozone is more than 10% and global macroeconomic factors weighed on consumer sentiment and purchasing decisions, especially for adult patients, which compounded the impact of Q3 summer seasonality. Similar to the Americas, doctors in EMEA also reported increased appointment cancellations and the impact of less patients financing their purchases. EMEA teen patients also resilient in Q3 increased sequentially in Iberia as well as France, where we introduced Teen case packs during the quarter. In APAC, Q3 sequential growth was led by China, Japan and ANZ despite ongoing COVID restrictions and lockdowns in parts of China and Japan. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign case volumes reflected increased shipments across almost all markets, led by Taiwan, Thailand, India and Korea, driven by increased submitters. In Q3, APAC sequential growth also reflects strong demand from our expanded Invisalign Clear Aligner product portfolio in China. Recall in late April, Q2, we introduced two new products that better serve the expanding market in China. Invisalign Adult and Invisalign Standard Clear Aligners leverage our proven technology while broadening our appeal to more consumer segments. Q3 was the first full quarter offering these new products that provide doctors and patients in China with broader clinical and affordable options for moderate-to-complex adult cases. Finally, I'm pleased to share that the Invisalign system was recently awarded the Gold Design Award for 2022, making it the first orthodontic appliance to win the prestigious award in Japan. In the judge's assessment of the Invisalign system, they emphasized that the opportunity for teeth straightening is high in Japan and cited the barrier to adoption by Japanese consumers is resistance to metal braces and praised the Invisalign system as an orthodontic solution that can improve the quality of life during treatment. We certainly recognize the importance of the Japanese market for digital orthodontics and is one of the reasons we opened our first office in Tokyo nearly 15 years ago and established treatment planning operations in Yokohama a few years ago. Turning to new innovations. We continue to deliver our technology road map. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we began to commercialize several new products and services that we previously announced would come to market in the second half of 2022. These technology advancements illustrate our commitment to continuous innovation in digital orthodontics, and we remain excited about the transformational projects that we're working on as we continue to drive the evolution of our industry. No other dental company has the experience, including over 14 million patients treated to date to lead the transformation of the practice of dentistry. Our consumer marketing focus on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to Invisalign doctor's offices ultimately capitalize on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles globally. In Q3, we built on our successful Invis Is media campaign and continued our launch of the Invis Is trauma free targeted at teens and Invis Is when everything clicks targeted at adults. Our teen campaign, Invis is trauma free highlights the benefits of Invisalign while humorously juxtaposing them with the significant trade-offs involved with using braces. Our Invis Is when everything clicks campaign showcases Invisalign treatment transforming smiles and the resulting confidence it gifts young adults. During Q3, we had over 4.3 billion impressions delivered in 14 million business to our website, a 1.6% year-over-year increase as a result of rightsizing our media investments. We're also rightsizing our consumer media investments across all core EMEA markets, impacting the impressions and unique visits. In U.S., we continued our influencer and creator-centric campaigns, partnering with leading smile squad creators like Olympic Gold Medalist, Suni Lee, Michael Lee, Josh Richards and Marsai Martin. Each of these creators share their personal experience of Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners. Most recently, Suni Lee shared her positive experience with Invisalign in major media programming include Good Morning America, people.com, resulting in over 93 million impressions. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across APAC region, resulting in a 72% year-over-year increase in impressions and 29% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. Our ongoing campaigns were omnipresent across the top social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube to increase the awareness of the Invisalign brand with young adults and teens. In Q3, we launched a global plot on the Roblox platform within the popular game, Livetopia, creating a fun experience for players to learn about the benefits of Invisalign treatment. To date, we had over 5.9 million impressions delivered in over 2.6 million unique visitors on the game experience. Adoption of My Invisalign Consumer and Patient app continues to increase with 2.2 million downloads to date. Usage of our key digital tools also continued to increase. Live update was used by 41,000 doctors or more than 395,000 cases, reduced time spent in modifying treatment by 18% and Invisalign Practice app has downloaded 314,000 times to date. Further, we received more than 110,000 patient photos in our virtual care capability to date, providing rich global data to leverage our AI capabilities and improve our services for doctors and patients. The investments that we make to drive patient demand and conversion to support our doctor customers is unparalleled in our industry, leveraging the global recognition of the Invisalign system. No other dental company equals our brand strength today. For more details on our consumer marketing programs, please see our Q3 '22 earnings and conference slides. Turning to exocad. Overall, I'm very pleased with our progress with the exocad business and its leadership and restorative dentistry. In addition to the iTero-exocad Connector, I mentioned previously, during the quarter, we also introduced iTero NIRI, NIRI is near infrared technology intraoral camera images and are now automatically imported into dental CAD when designing restorations, enabling technicians to visualize the internal and external tooth structure and optimize the process of margin line tracing. The new xSnap module is a model attachment for a printable 3D articulated system, featuring a spherical head, which allows a precisely executed movement. And Ivoclar's Ivotion Denture System, a complete workflow for digital production of high-quality removable dentures is now available on exocad. Together, the iTero and exocad product portfolios help accelerate the digital transformation of dental practices by facilitating the way doctors and labs collaborate to deliver better care for their patients. As part of the Align Digital platform, the integration of iTero's digital scanning and exocad's complete software solution delivers seamless end-to-end digital workflows from diagnosis to treatment, planning and then fabrication. Customers are already utilizing the automated workflows, unlocking efficiencies and productivities, which are more important than ever in the current economic climate. With the recent integration of iTero NIRI and intraoral camera images unique to iTero Element 5D imaging systems and exocad Rijeka software release, Align is redefining restorative visualization and treatment planning for the doctors and labs. We are committed to continuing innovating in the dental industry to drive efficiency and clinical excellence for the benefit of our customers and their patients. With that, I'll now turn it over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $890.3 million, down 8.2% from the prior quarter and down 12.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q3 2022 unfavorable foreign exchange reduced Q3 revenues by approximately $25.1 million sequentially and approximately $57.4 million year-over-year. For Clear Aligners, Q3 revenues up $732.8 million were down 8.2% sequentially primarily due to lower volumes, unfavorable foreign exchange, higher promotions and discounts and product mix shift, partially offset by higher additional aligners. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Clear Aligner revenue were down 12.5%, primarily reflecting the aforementioned items, offset somewhat by per order processing fees and higher non-case revenues. On a constant currency basis, Q3 '22 unfavorable foreign exchange reduced Q3 Clear Aligner revenues by approximately $21 million or approximately 2.8% sequentially and approximately $47.4 million or approximately 6.1% year-over-year. For Q3, Invisalign ASPs for both comprehensive and noncomprehensive treatment decreased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflect unfavorable impact from foreign exchange that Joe described earlier as well as higher discounts and product mix shift, partially offset by higher additional aligners. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in ASPs reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by the higher additional aligners and per order processing fees. As our revenues from subscription, retainers and other ancillary products continue to grow and expand globally, some of the historical metrics that focus only on case shipments do not account for our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total Clear Aligner revenue per case shipment which is more indicative of our overall growth strategy. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $37 million or 3.3% sequentially and $184 million or up 18.6% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized $137.2 million that was included in the Clear Aligner deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2021. The Q3 Systems and Services revenue of $157.5 million were down 8% sequentially, primarily due to lower scanner volume, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger installed base and were down 11.7% year-over-year, primarily due to lower scanner volume and lower ASP, partially offset by higher services revenue from our larger installed base. Q3 '22, Systems and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $4.1 million or approximately 2.5% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, System and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $9.9 million or approximately 5.9%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $4.1 million or 1.6% sequentially and up $76.5 million or 40.9% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. During the 3 months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized $13.3 million that was included in the Systems and Services deferred revenues balance as of December 31, 2021.  Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 69.5% down 1.4 points sequentially and down 4.8 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points sequentially and 1.8 points on a year-over-year basis due to the impact of foreign exchange on our revenues. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 70.9% down 2.4 points sequentially due to lower ASPs and increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was down 5.3 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing spend for the reasons stated previously, higher freight and a higher mix of additional aligner volume and lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was 63.3%, up 3.6 points sequentially due to improved manufacturing absorption and lower freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was down 2.3 points year-over-year due to higher inventory costs and manufacturing inefficiencies coupled with lower ASPs, partially offset by higher service revenues. Q3 operating expenses were $475.5 million, down sequentially 4.8% and down 3.7% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $23.9 million, mainly due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses decreased by $18.5 million for the same reasons as sequential as well as lower incentive compensation. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, Operating expenses were $443.4 million, down sequentially 4.8% and down 4.9% year-over-year. Our third quarter operating income of $143.7 million resulted in an operating margin of 16.1%, down 3.3 points sequentially and down 9.6 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.6 points sequentially due to foreign exchange and lower gross margin. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 3.5 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisition, the operating margin for the third quarter was 20.2%, down 3 points sequentially and down 8.6 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the third quarter was a loss of $21 million compared to a loss of $14.6 million in Q2 and an income of $0.8 million in Q3 of '21, primarily due to larger net foreign exchange losses from the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. The GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 40.7% and compared to 35% in the second quarter and 30.9% in the third quarter of the prior year. The third quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the second quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to the decrease in profits and changes in jurisdictional mix of income, resulting in lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates and higher than in the U.S. On a non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.1% in the third quarter compared to 25.6% in the second quarter and 22.2% in the third quarter of the prior year. Third quarter net income per diluted share was $0.93, down sequentially $0.51 and down $1.35 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.30 on a sequential basis and $0.48 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $1.36 for the third quarter, down $0.64 sequentially and down $1.51 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1.1 billion, up sequentially $163.8 million and down $96.8 million year-over-year. Of the $1.1 billion balance, $471 million was held in the U.S. and $670 million was held by our international entities. Q3 accounts receivable balance was $859.6 million, down approximately 7.8% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 86 days, flat sequentially and up approximately 11 days as compared to Q3 last year. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $266.5 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $75.3 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase Aligne\u2019r manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $191.1 million. We are well capitalized to continue to invest for growth while managing through these challenging market conditions, exiting the quarter with over $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet and 0 debt. Now turning to full year 2022 and the factors that influence our views on our business outlook. Underlying market dynamics as well as the reactions to macroeconomic headwinds by central banks, governments and consumers remain uncertain. We will continue to focus on those matters that have been central to our historically successful business strategies by managing those things within our control. This includes maintaining fiscal controls and focused delivery on our business model so that we are positioned for success once the difficult operating environment ultimately abates. We remain confident in the huge underpenetrated market for the digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, our technology and industry leadership and our ability to execute and make progress toward our long-term model of 20% to 30% revenue growth. We expect to be below our fiscal 2022 GAAP operating margin target of 20%, which includes the impact from the current unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately 2 points to 3 points that was not factored into our operating margin guidance for the fiscal year 2022 when we gave an update on the Q1 '22 earnings call in April. For 2022, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our investment in the aligner fabrication facility in Wroclaw, Poland, which began servicing doctors in the second quarter of 2022. In addition, during Q4 2022, we expect to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock through either or a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. As we continue to navigate a macroeconomic uncertainty, weaker consumer confidence and the lingering impacts of COVID-19 shutdowns primarily in China and Japan, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives as well as the incredible market opportunity for digital dentistry and our products. We believe our unwavering drive to transform smiles and change lives for millions of people around the world is on one other clear aligner company can match and positions us to better address this market opportunity. Regardless of the operating environment, we are committed to balancing investments to drive growth and long-term strategic priorities that will transform the practice of dentistry and strengthen our business. These are uncertain times. Every business is being impacted by macroeconomic environmental uncertainty. In addition, as a multinational company based in the United States with roughly half of our sales outside the country, the negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange has been like anything I've ever seen in my career. We will continue to invest in digital solutions and demand creation to help doctors and their patients. We are committed to doctor-directed care and transforming the industry together while working through these global macro economic challenges. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call.  Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Jason Bednar : Joe, from what we've seen and heard in the market, I think it goes without saying that monthly demand has just been quite choppy here in the U.S. I think July and September were pretty darn soft, August, maybe not as weak, but still not great. I guess, did you see a similar level of uneven demand when we look outside the U.S. and I guess is there anything you'd call out geographically or in any of your channels that was maybe less bad than what you were prepared for three months ago? Joe Hogan : Jason, we started with not high expectations to begin with, all right? But I would say the U.S. market panned out the way we thought overall, maybe a little more strength in Latin America, a little momentum despite the elections and some economics there. Europe just wasn't quite as strong as what we thought. And as we tried to explain in my notes that I really feel it's just -- it's the uncertainty that circulates Europe right now and Ukraine situation doesn't help either. From an Asia standpoint, we're affected by COVID again. We saw it in China, even though we had growth in China, which was respectable and in Japan also, but we saw the market impact in those two areas, too. I felt great about it's a smaller part of the business, but Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and other businesses that were up significantly, but our major three were still affected, primarily the three is Australia and China and Japan with some COVID issues. So it's a way of saying, I think in general, we anticipated where we are, we were hoping for the best year. But what really grabs me to, Jason, maybe I'm giving you too much for your call is that the teen demand, we felt good about overall across the globe in the United States, too. The teen packs did well overall. And obviously, we'll roll that out in other parts of the world, too. The adult -- the impact on the adult cases is what was -- to me, is astounding in the sense, and you see that flow through the orthodontic community, the GP community too. And that's not just in the United States, we see that all over the world. . Jason Bednar : Maybe Joe or John, just on the margin topic, you are backing away from that 20% margin floor commentary that you had given previously. Fully understanding part of this is FX related. But maybe can you talk about how much of it's tied to the decremental impact from lower volumes. And then you fully understand this is a tough macro environment to forecast. But a lot of investors right now are really trying to get comfortable with how defensible margins and profitability are as we look out to 2023, which I hope it's not, but it could very well be another tough year for the business just given the global macro environment we're in.  So just -- are you willing to provide any guardrails around what we can consider for 2023 margins? Or maybe talk about how much flexibility you have in the P&L to offset pressures from lower volumes? Joe Hogan : Jason, it's a fair question. First of all, I'll turn it over to John, but I'm going to give that 20% operating margin piece. I had no idea. You'd see international currency swings. And way we've seen it. I've been in these jobs for a long time and you don't expect 25% decreases year-over-year in currency. And so obviously, we had to back up on that piece. I feel good about the way we manage our cost I feel good about where we're investing and where we continue to rightsize. John will give you more specifics. John Morici : So on a constant currency basis, we expect to be at that 20% or above. It's just like Joe said, it's pretty dramatic to see the FX changes that we have. As noted in the comments, we said it going to affect the year by 2 to 3 points. So there's no -- there's a commitment to that margin, and we're investing based on volume that we see and other priorities that we have on R&D and go-to-market activities and so on. But it's just that FX piece that we're calling out. But on a constant currency basis, we feel that that number of 20% still holds from earlier. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Velasquez with William Blair. Brandon Velasquez : I wanted to go -- I'd like to go back for a second kind of to the monthly progression just to -- I think what might be helpful to kind of understand underlying market dynamics and maybe you can tease it out a little bit in Americas versus international. Just -- what were you seeing through the quarter where you -- did you exit the quarter and go into Q4? Were things stabilizing? Were they getting better? Were they getting worse? Any kind of color you can give us around what the situation is like as we go forward from Q3? Joe Hogan : Again, like on the last call, Brendon, I think it played out the way our expectations, I think were formatted. We talked about teens in the third quarter. And obviously, that's teen season. That played out well from what we anticipated. And as we mentioned before, we think teens are somewhat shielded -- not completely, but shielded from the economic environment because of the time window for treatment and parents that want to help their teens through that whole process. The adult segment was the -- we saw the most volatility in for sure, both in the United States, Europe and in Asia. It's hard for me to tell you that we're -- there's any kind of change from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. It was pretty consistent from what we've seen. John, would you add anything else? . Brandon Velasquez : I mean that's how we saw it. Okay. And then internationally, you guys sound pretty excited about kind of the new product launches within China, specifically offering that new maybe lower-tier product. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? How strong has the recovery been in China? How much of that recovery has come from really opening up the product portfolio there? And how should that kind of continue going forward? Joe Hogan : That's a good question. I mean, China is a very important market for us. As we talked about on other calls, those Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities have been an important target for us. We've known for about two years, we have a hole in our portfolio in those areas, particularly with -- we have comprehensive on top, and then we have a moderate product between it. So we announced Invisalign standard, Invisalign adult. And what this does is it just helps us segment the market. These are not -- they can't handle -- these products can have handle cases like Invisalign First Scan or mandibular advancement or some of the sophisticated cases we have out there. We don't offer CBCT 5-minute ClinCheck and those kind of things around those products, too. So we tailor those products for more moderate kinds of cases in those specific areas where public hospitals have been strong. And we really good results from the standpoint of what we saw in the uptake that we saw over this last quarter, and we'll continue with that strategy. We feel good about it. John Morici : And it's about market expansion there. We're selling to more doctors than we've sold to in the past with these products. So we're really trying to capture more of that market, as Joe said, into Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, and we saw good uptake from that. And it's something that we know to go to the market and be able to reach these potential customers. These are the types of products that we need. . Joe Hogan : Yes. So Brandon, I think honestly, I feel really good about our positioning there. China did perform well from a volume standpoint, and we'll continue to update on our progress. . Operator : Our next question comes from John Block with Stifel. John Block : Maybe just first first for me. The 3Q '22 ASP of 1150 versus 1220, so I'm calcing down 6% Q-over-Q. Some of that's FX, but I think if I look at your comments, it seems like half of that 6% headwind is FX. And John, I know you said mix, but I'm counting that teen was about 35% of your 3Q '22 cases versus 30% of your 2Q '22 cases and teen is a high acuity comprehensive ASP. I would think DSP is also helping pull out some of the lower ASP cases as DSP ramps quarter in, quarter out. So can you just help me with the ASP movement, what else was it outside of FX? And if it was mix, why mix based on my teen commentary? John Morici : Yes, I think you've hit the major pieces, John. When you look at it majority was FX. We saw the dollar strengthening, that obviously hits our numbers. And then you look at the other parts, we do have a higher proportion of teen in the third quarter, and that's a help. We also have things that we've done like we answered on the previous call about mix in China and expansion out, and there's offsets to that. But it's primarily FX and then you have some mix. But from a discounting standpoint, or other things, there was really no overall change to how we've done stuff. It's primarily the FX piece and the mix. Joe Hogan : John, one other thing to add to that, too, on the DSP program, we look at that as incremental, not as replacing other business that we've had in the past. So like we feel good that's an expansion play for us. And I think you see that in the numbers, too. John Block : So maybe just quickly on that last point, Joe. Question on B would be, you don't really think any cases are being pulled out of the case volume number into DSP that's actually having an incremental negative impact to '22? Do you think those are just truly largely incremental. That was 1B, just to be clear. Joe Hogan : Yes, I think you learn a business, John, never be binary, either or. I'd say the majority of those cases, if you look at it, we're picking up from an ortho standpoint, a lot of retention we never had before. We see orthos doing touch-up cases and all that might have been done in-house at times. So I'm not saying that there's absolutely nothing that would transpose from one to another, but I'd say primarily, we're looking at that as a growth opportunity for us. John Block : And then the last question, and it's just where I struggle the most. I think sort of who cares, but my view on teen versus how you guys have positioned it with all due respect. And I get the teen 2Q to 3Q had a good sequential growth rate, but the 1Q to 3Q because 2Q was weak, was actually below trend on a four-year average throwing out 2020. And Joe, just -- if we can go down that road a little bit more, teen case volumes were still down 3% year-over-year. This whole story is about taking maybe 200 bps of share every year in this market. What do you think overall teen case volume was globally if you guys were down 3%? And maybe just really the questions about market share gains and if you still feel like you've got the momentum there or if that has slowed as of late and what can reaccelerate it? Joe Hogan : Yes, John, again, that's a good question. I think when you talk about first quarter to second quarter, the rhythm that we had there, remember, the normal rhythms we've seen in this business, the seasonality, we call it. We have not seen that since really 2019. And so we had muted signals on teens through 2020, '21. Just -- it wasn't the same. What I liked about -- what I saw in the third quarter was we saw teens come back in the sense of in a pattern of what you'd expect in teen season, Q3, Q4. It's too early for me to dig out the data and tell you how much share we're gaining against wires and brackets. John, we don't talk about a lot or products like -- and we highlighted it here today, when you look at the Invisalign First product line, we're really getting tremendous results out there on young patients, 6 to 9 years old, the Phase I, Phase II treatments, where often the Phase II can be a lot less extensive than what the Phase I was with wires and brackets. So our different expansion devices. So we see a big uptake in that product line from a teen standpoint. We see that as penetration too. We've seen consistent growth from a share standpoint in those teen cases in Americas globally. So -- we just introduced curved wings mandibular advancement too that's having a really good start in the market, too, to address some cases that mandibular advancement couldn't get in the past. So John, both with technology, with our advertising campaigns, the teen packs and whatever, I continue to feel good about our movement. We'll have more as we analyze the trends, the share trends and stuff that we'll be able to share with you, but I do like our position in the marketplace in teens. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Just a question on just OpEx and how you're managing headcount, whether you pulled back in any parts of the business globally? And maybe just talk about the levers that might be at your disposal if the environment continues to deteriorate and maybe if there are some areas that would be ring-fenced as far as potential cuts. Joe Hogan : Ben, it's Joe. Look, first of all, what I protect with my life here are our direct salespeople and also our technology and our engineering team and what we focus on. And so we've made sure that we continue to reinforce those. There's just other parts of our business, too, that we rightsized. I mean, obviously, this business is used to growing 20%, 30%. And so we kind of came into the year with that mindset. We quickly realized it wasn't. And so we've taken actions in order to do that. But you see that throughout the business. Don't forget, we also have really strong productivity programs and manufacturing and all, that really help us during these times. Emory and his team do a terrific job, they help to drive that. John will give you another insight in a sense of how we're managing OpEx across the business. John Morici : We have good insight into our P&Ls across the world. So we're looking at country by country in certain regions and so on. And like Joe said, from an overall focus, we want to make sure that we're going to market and protecting the sales, make sure our R&D technology is putting out the best products and the best technology going forward. . So we protect that. And then we look at what expenses make sense in the short and long term in various regions, various campaigns that we have to make sure that we're getting the return that's appropriate given the market conditions. So we're constantly iterating and changing things. it's no different on the other side of things. When a year ago, we were looking at the growth opportunities. We're looking at it the same type of way kind of on a country-by-country, market-by-market basis is just the other way as it is now. So we feel like we have a good understanding of our return on investment and a good understanding of the levers that we need to pull or not pull given these conditions. Brandon Couillard : And then John, just one follow-up. Can you help me just kind of understand what's going on with the inventory line and why that continues to grow year-over-year and sequentially. Is there something tied to the new European fab facility that may be driving that? And what we should expect on that line in the next few quarters? John Morici : Yes. I think we're kind of getting to -- we kind of get to a point where some of that is due to just the fact that you have a third manufacturing site, and you're going to have raw materials related to that and other in-process inventory and so on there. So you're going to have some of that. Some of it is also on the iTero side where you're manufacturing and you're doing some things where you're securing supply. I mean there's been a lot of talk and we feel good about our supply to be able to components and so on. We've purchased several components just to make sure that we had adequate supply for our forecast and so on. But nothing out of the ordinary other than some expansion that we have with new manufacturing and then making sure that we secured our supply lines, and that's what we've seen in our numbers. . Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson : So Joe, I want to pin you down a little bit on a couple of things, if I could here that questions that have been asked. And on the teen packs especially, I mean, look, we know there were so many adult cases last year with the assume a factor, whatever we want to call it and stimulus spending and all that. But the teen number is obviously the important number. I think we're all trying to focus on here. The down 3%, I think is what you said year-over-year, up sequentially. That's down 3% year-over-year on teen cases globally. I mean, how do you feel like that compares to the overall ortho market? Were you better or worse than other teen cases done with brackets and wires when you throw in other clear aligners from the competitors, things like that? Just how are you competing in that teen market right now? Joe Hogan : Jeff, it's a fair question. I'd first take it to Europe. I mean Europe was down substantially for us, too. So I don't think we've got a clear signal out of there because of the economics and in general. I mean we did fairly well in -- from a European standpoint. But third quarter in Europe is never a particularly strong quarter. We're going to pull a signal out of -- you look at the United States, you go to Gaidge Data. And you'll see that inside Gaidge Data aligners were down but Invisalign was actually above what the generic aligners are reported in Gaidge data, which says we continue to do well with our teen portfolio and what we do. . You see wires and brackets cases actually expanded. But what that is, is you see if they're doing more -- fewer adults -- and you know how orthos have held on to teens for a long time, you get a mix phenomenon there where it looks like they're doing more wires and brackets, but they're not. They're just doing fewer adults, and they mix down in that sense. So -- and then move over to Asia, I've always felt good about Asia is different by country. But the COVID overlay in Japan in particular, but also China. I thought the teen case volume was still reasonable. But it's still hard to pull a signal out of a lot of noise with the COVID shutdowns in all of those countries. So again, just like in John's question, Jeff, is I do feel great about our portfolio. I feel good about how we're positioning the product. I think the teen packs are a way to sell the way doctors want to commit in this area, I think we'll continue to get strong there. The future of those teen cases, there's no question it's digital. It's just how we approach it, the products we launch and convincing doctors more and more that teens will use these and showing them the results that we're seeing all over the world. Jeff Johnson : Yes. Fair enough. All right. And then I'm going to jam two questions together, kind of ala John Black here, I'll call it, 2A and 2B and other separate questions. But any update on volume-based procurement in China, how we should think about that? And then I didn't see a breakout for Americas versus international doctors shipped to. You provided that in the past. Any way we could get that number this time? John Morici : Well, on the doctor shipped to, what we've done is consolidate them together to a total. And what we saw, if you looked at international versus domestic, they're both up. And the numbers that we had. This is actually our second highest ever from a shipped to standpoint. But we decided to consolidate those together without giving too much more details on that. But they're both up. Jeff Johnson : Sequentially, John, just to be clear? John Morici : Yes. Yes. Jeff Johnson : John, both up sequentially. Sorry, Joe. . John Morici : Yes, yes, correct. . Joe Hogan : Yes, on sequential. On the volume-based purchasing in China, we have our eyes all over, Jeff, as you can guess. It represents anywhere between 15% and 18% of our business there. The way they're setting this up, pretty much in what we would call not our main areas in where we do business in China. I think we've positioned ourselves for this. strategically, I feel we can make the right move here. Look, I have friends and other medical device businesses. I was in the medical devices for a while. We know what this did to stents and hip transplants and different things. I feel like the way they set this up, one is 70% of it will be BBP in those areas, 30% will still be up to the doctors in the sense of what they want to use and how they want to use it. So what's key here is that we exercise our portfolio and the capacity that we have over there to just have a strategic positioning in that. So I don't expect any major differences as we move into 2023. We'll just have to wait to see how that goes. And as we move into 2024, 2025, how the government -- which way the government moves. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : I guess my first question is just on equipment line. I noticed you sort of talking more about leased equipment in the quarter. Can you sort of talk about how that's been growing and sort of what contribution that made to the equipment revenues in the quarter? John Morici : Yes, I can start with that. It's obviously a strategy that we have. We've got great equipment, great products, and we want to be able to get those to our customers in a way that they want to buy. Sometimes those doctors of ours don't necessarily want to purchase it outright. They want to try other things. And so we've tested in certain markets, just alternatives, kind of the rental model and so on. And we see good uptake. We see them these doctors now wanting to get a scanner to be able to digitize their practice. So it's really at early stage right now, Elizabeth, but it is something that when we think about how we want to go to market, we want to offer alternatives such as leasing or expanding rental or other parts of our business are going to see the certified preowned where you have upgrades and other things that happen as we have a larger and larger installed base, we're going to get some of that equipment back. We want to be able to have a mechanism to be able to use that equipment, use it in other places, and give our customers alternatives, both in terms of the equipment that they can purchase from us and then how they purchase and use that equipment from a financing or maybe leasing or rental options. And we think that they'll end up using our equipment more and more. And then we know that helps from a digital standpoint when they use their equipment and then they'll end up using more Invisalign. So it all kind of works from an ecosystem standpoint. Elizabeth Anderson : And then just in terms of on the P&L, like one of the things that, obviously, saw the change in SG&A spend in the quarter and how you pulled back on spending there. What about on the R&D line? Do you sort of see an opportunity to pull back on R&D as well going forward? Or is that something you're sort of keener to defend going forward? . Joe Hogan : Elizabeth, it's Joe. We want to defend R&D. Very important part of the business. You can see the programs are rolling out. The programs we're rolling out, we didn't do them this year, right? Some of these are 3-year old programs that we've been working on. And so I don't want to stop the momentum on those. I mean obviously, we'll take any steps here to preserve the cash flow and integrity of this business that we have to do. But our front lines are our sales organization and technology. And before we go anywhere near those, we want to make sure we do everything we can, the right size of business in other areas. Elizabeth Anderson : And then just in terms of my 2B question, in terms of like what you're seeing through the month of October so far, if we're sort of thinking about how the cadence of 4Q is shaping up, which is to expect like the cases to be sort of flat sequentially at this point based on what you're seeing? Or like how do we think about sort of where we are now? Joe Hogan : Kind of anticipating that question is, we're not seeing any major change, I'd say, from the momentum that we saw in the second quarter. . Elizabeth Anderson : You mean the third quarter? Joe Hogan : I'm sorry, third quarter. That's right, a little bit... Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with MS. Your line is now open. Erin Wright : So how should we think about underlying ASPs going forward, excluding the FX dynamics from here just given some of the mix dynamics you noted. And FX is FX, and that's understandable. But if we do continue to see what we're seeing in terms of the macro environment, what do we think about in terms of trough margins from here? And do you see an opportunity for a sort of recovery near term? Or any sort of margin expansion? Anything you can give us on that front would be helpful. John Morici : Yes. Obviously, Erin, this is John. Obviously, gross margin, op margins is a primary concern for us. We want to make sure that we're managing things appropriately. From an ASP standpoint, take FX out of this and really FX out of our margin because it's hard to so much coming through from a P&L standpoint. But we're always looking at productivity to be able to help drive the business. And as we scale up Poland is a great example, we'll become more productive there, and that will help our margin. It's kind of in our margins right now as an impact, but it will get better over time through utilization. . We look at the technology that we have in the business and what it means from an ASP standpoint. And our customers understand that. There's always going to be geographical mix shifts that happen. Certain parts of the world are at different times throughout the year. But I don't expect a dramatic shift in our overall ASPs. Take FX out of it from an overall ASP standpoint and then we're really focused on what can we do to look at savings that help us from a gross margin standpoint and see that. And then also on an op margin standpoint for all the OpEx things that we previously talked about. Erin Wright : And then just going back to Elizabeth's question on the quarterly cadence. Just in the teen market, in particular, what are you seeing in terms of typical seasonality there? And did you see some of that momentum continuing here into the fourth quarter in that particular segment? Or how should we be thinking about the quarter-to-quarter cadence given -- relative to what you typically see from a seasonal standpoint. . Joe Hogan : The teen market predominantly, if we look at the third quarter. Obviously, a bleed some into the fourth quarter, whatever, but I wouldn't take anything we're seeing right now and projected into the future to change what the normal fourth quarter sequence could be. So like I said previously on the question as far as when you look at third quarter moving in the fourth quarter, we're not seeing any meaningful change one way or another. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Nathan Rich : If I could go back to margins for a minute. You mentioned not changing the target for this year on a constant currency basis. I guess -- if I could maybe ask the question this way, if we don't see further changes to FX or the kind of overall demand environment, do you think the 16% margin that you saw this quarter on a GAAP basis is indicative of what we should assume going forward, again, kind of -- assuming no kind of changes in the underlying environment? . John Morici : I wouldn't take that. I think when we're talking about for the full year, we're kind of looking at kind of that on a constant currency basis, that 20%. And I think you have impacts with Poland startup and some other things in the quarter that are impacting that. But when we look at the 20% and what we were calling earlier in the year, we were thinking about that less about the quarters, but on a -- more on a total year basis on a constant currency basis. Nathan Rich : Okay. And the FX headwind for the year on margins is that 2% to 3%? John Morici : That's the way to look at it, Nate. It's -- we're kind of looking at -- as best as we can call it now, we're kind of using the latest FX rates that you have now. It's up to predict what's going to happen in the next 2 months. But if you took kind of currently and kind of what we've done throughout the year and then use the current FX rates, we think that's a 2- to 3-point impact. And without that FX rates, we -- our GAAP numbers would have been at the 20%, like we called. Nathan Rich : If I could just ask a quick follow-up. Joe, I think you had noted less willingness of consumers to finance treatments in both the U.S. and Europe. How big is that as a percent of case volumes in terms of what's typically financed? And how much in particular kind of might have this weight on demand? And I guess, bigger picture, are there ways kind of in this environment that you kind of see as kind of maybe being best able to stimulate demand just in terms of how you might either help customers or doctors in this environment? Joe Hogan : Yes, Nathan, I think what we gave you is basically data that we receive from the marketplace. It's what we're hearing from orthodontists and dentists in general in treatment. We don't have any quantification to say so many patients were seeking funding, they didn't get it or there's so many losses in that sense. That's pretty much listed as the reasons why patients have refused treatment or thinking about treatment in the financial considerations of it. John, would you? John Morici : No, I think you're always going to have a mix of -- some patients, they'll pay for it all upfront. Some will finance either through the doctor or some outside group. And I think you're constantly going to have that. We do think as much as we can with our doctors to give them some of the financial flexibility, so that as they maybe have additional terms where they pay us, the doctors, they can maybe apply some of that to their patients, and they can help their patients as well, manage some of the cash flow. So we're aware of it. We do as much as we can. It's just kind of out there. And like Joe said, we don't have a quantification of it, but in tougher economic times, we know that patients will be looking for different alternatives. Joe Hogan : And the other part of your question, Nick, about how do we help accounts. We watch payments. We try to help in that sense at times. We try to drive direct Invisalign docs to do a lot of Invisalign. And obviously, our advertising is extremely important to them. So we have our whole lead program to help them drive those things. We just want to be as close to our customers as possible because they're feeling what we feel. And we have strong relationships with many of them, and they're part of the family here. And we work it country by country, doctor by doctor, region by region to see how we can help. . Shirley Stacy : Operator, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : So may have found a little bit on the comment around October, saying that the momentum continued. If we think about that, that was sort of down 12%, right, year-over-year. I think what we're all looking for is we saw cases flat Q1 to Q2. And then we saw a step down in Q3 despite a stronger teen season. So I think what we're all trying to figure out here is adjusting for the third quarter strength, seasonality in teen, when do you actually expect to see stabilization globally in cases, meaning either sequentially or year-over-year flatness? Like when do you actually expect that, that could happen? Joe Hogan : Kevin, it's Joe. Look, I think we can sit here and tell you, I think we're in pretty volatile economic times. I can't tell you what the dollar is going to be in 3 months. I don't know what's going to happen in Europe. I don't know how bad COVID hits China. I don't know what it does in Japan. So I know exactly what you're asking for and every investor is asking for. And we'd give you that data if we thought we had it, but we are in such a volatile time right now. We're just working this thing from month to month. As I mentioned, as we go into the fourth quarter, obviously, there's a rhythm between teens and adults from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. What I mentioned from a continuation standpoint is we haven't seen much of a change between the third and the fourth right now as we move into it. That's about as well as I can tell you of what we're seeing and what we're experiencing, trying to forecast what's going to happen toward the end of the quarter, next quarter, I can't do that. I don't think anybody here can. Kevin Caliendo : And if I can just ask a follow-up. There's been a lot of talk about spending and margins in 20% and everything else. And historically, in the past, you guys always just invested to grow. Is it now given the uncertainty of everything that you're just going to manage through a margin or try to manage to the 20% margin ex FX? Or -- I mean, is that the strategy? Or is it still to try to get back to the -- what you would need to do normally to hit certain growth targets that you've had? Joe Hogan : It's a growth business, Kevin. If we had good economic times here, I can tell you, we'd be having a much different conversation. So the challenge with this business is how are we responsible on cost and obviously, a challenged demand environment [indiscernible] this company very strong because when this market comes back, you just go back in history and take a look, it comes back and it comes back hard. And we've got to make sure that we're in a good position to be able to field that when it does occur. So you'll see us be, what I call, fiscally responsible, but we'll continue to make sure that we invest and make as many changes as we can around different areas of OpEx, but to protect those key areas where our customer interface and the development of our technology. And actually, the operations capacity we need in this business when this thing does bring back. And that's not just in manufacturing aligners. That's in being able to service customers across the board. So you'll see us balance that well as we should do from a leadership standpoint. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your time and look forward to speaking with you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including the Ortho Summit in Las Vegas next month. If you have any further questions or follow-up, please contact our Investor Relations team. Have a great day . Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q4 financial performance and comment on our views for 2023. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.  You'll note that we have shortened our formal remarks in order to leave more time for Q&A. Overall, I'm pleased to report fourth quarter results that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients than the recent quarters, especially in the Americas and EMEA regions, as well as parts of APAC. For Q4, trends in consumer interest for orthodontic treatment, patient traffic in doctors' practices and iTero scanner demos improved. However, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results reduced our revenues and margins significantly.  Despite the large impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, Q4 revenues of $901.5 million, increased sequentially from Q3, reflecting growth in Systems and Services as well as a slight increase in Clear Aligner shipments. This is the first quarter in a year that our total revenues and Clear Aligner volumes increased sequentially. As we move through 2023 and hopeful that we'll see continued stability in an improving operating environment, but remind everyone that the macroeconomic situation remains fragile. Regardless, we are confident in our large untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. We anticipate 2023 will be an exciting year for new innovation at Align, and we'll begin to commercialize one of the largest new product and technology cycles in our 25-year history.  The Q4 Systems and Services revenue of $169.9 million were up 7.8% sequentially and down 21.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, Q4 Systems and Services revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million or 1.5% sequentially and approximately $11.2 million or 6.2% year-over-year. For Q4, Systems and Services revenues increased sequentially, driven by growth in the Americas and EMEA regions, reflecting continued sales of intraoral scanners, especially the iTero 5D. Q4 sequential growth also reflects continued growth of our scanner rental programs as well as initial deployment of a certified preowned, what we call CPO scanner leasing rental program with desktop metal, that I'll describe in more detail shortly.  We continue to develop new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers, and DSO partners, which is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade to make trade-ins to provide refurbished scanners for emerging markets. We expect to continue rolling out programs such as leasing and rental offerings that help customers in the current macroeconomic environment by leveraging our balance sheet and selling the way our customers want to buy. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 services revenues increased primarily due to increased subscription revenue, resulting in a larger number of field scanners. We also had higher non-case systems revenues related to our scanner leasing rental programs previously mentioned. To help accelerate the adoption of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, in Q4, we announced a strategic collaboration with Desktop Metal to supply iTero Element Flex scanners to Desktop Labs, one of the largest lab networks in the U.S. serving general dentists.  The iTero Element Flex is now the preferred restorative scanner for desktop labs and will connect dentists directly to a suite of offerings from desktop labs that simplifies the digital design and manufacture restorations with both traditional and digital technologies. Our collaboration with Desktop Metal reflects our commitment to a relationship we expect will evolve and expand to being advanced restorative workflows to market. We see significant opportunities to enable dentists to use scan data directly order restorative services or printed ready digital files from Desktop Labs that can be used for 3D printing in their offices. In addition to iTero scanners, we're also excited about extending the benefits of the Align Digital Platform, including the Invisalign System and Exocad software to Desktop Labs' customers as well.  For Q4, total Clear Aligner revenues of $731.7 million were down slightly, 0.2% sequentially and down 10.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, for Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of $13.4 million or 1.8% sequentially and $56.4 million or 7.2% year-over-year. Q4 total Clear Aligner volumes of $583,000 was up slightly sequentially, reflecting growth in the Americas and EMEA regions, offset by lower APAC volumes primarily in China.  For the Americas, Q4 Clear Aligner volumes were down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower ortho cases, especially teen starts as compared to the typical higher teen season in Q3. Offset primarily by an increase in adult patients from the GP dentist channel. For Q4, Clear Aligner volume from DSO customers continue to outpace non-DSO customers.  For EMEA, Q4 Clear Aligner volume increased sequentially in all markets and across products, especially recently launched Invisalign Moderate, iGO Plus and iGO Express, which enabled GP dentists to treat a broader range of cases, mild-to-moderate types of malocclusions and can easily be integrated in a wide range of restorative treatments in a dental practice. EMEA had a strong sequential growth in the teen market segment with continued demand for Invisalign Teen case packs, which are available in France and Iberia as well as Invisalign's first treatment for kids as young as 6 years old.  APAC, Q4 Clear Aligner volumes were lower sequentially due primarily to China, which continues to be impacted by COVID. In Q4, ongoing COVID restrictions and lockdowns in China persisted throughout the quarter. Outside of China, APAC volumes increased sequentially led by Japan, Taiwan, India and Southeast Asia markets.  On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner case volumes reflected increased shipments led by Korea, India, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. While the easing of COVID restrictions in China and the more recent downward trend in COVID infection rates are encouraging, many uncertainties remain, including the lingering impacts from COVID across the population and the time and effort needed to restore consumer confidence.  For the other non-case revenues, which include retention products such as our Vivera Retainers, clinical training and education, accessories, e-commerce, and a new subscription programs such as our DSP, fourth quarter revenues were down slightly sequentially and up double digits year-over-year. For retention and e-commerce products, Q4 revenues were relatively unchanged from Q3. We are pleased with our subscription-based programs like DSP, which increased sequentially and year-over-year and expect to continue expanding DSP offerings in other regions.  For Q4, the total number of new Invisalign trained doctors decreased sequentially due primarily to fourth quarter being a seasonally slower period for clinical education with holidays, et cetera, as well as fewer trainings in China and Brazil. This was offset by somewhat significantly higher numbers of new Invisalign doctors trained in EMEA. Teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for Clear Aligner sales to orthos. We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through team specific sales and marketing programs and product features, including Invisalign First for kids, as young as 6, which was up sequentially across all markets. For Q4, total Clear Aligner teen cases were down sequentially due primarily to the impact of COVID in China as well as seasonally fewer team starts in North America as compared to Q3.  According to the December gauge report, which tracks approximately 1,000 orthos in the United States and Canada, new patient exams for teens slowed in Q4, while new patient exams for adults improved slightly. A smaller pool of potential teen patients may put pressure on traditional orthos and cause them to go between clear aligners and wires and brackets, especially those practices that have failed to understand the significant benefits of adopting more efficient digital workflows, believing metal braces are more profitable.  In EMEA, Q4 was a record quarter for teen case starts. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 teen case starts were relatively unchanged. For Q4, Invisalign First increased year-over-year and was strong across all regions. Invisalign First Clear Aligner treatment is designed for predictive results and a positive experience while addressing the unique needs of growing children from as young as 6 to treat Phase I. For the full year, Invisalign Clear aligner shipments for teens and young kids was approximately 733,000 cases, our teen case mix overall was a record 31% of Invisalign cases shipped for the year.  Finally, in Q4, the total number of doctors shipped was 82, 900 doctors, a slight decrease due primarily to the impact of COVID in China and off our Q3 '22 high point, which included a major DSO onboarding in North America. For the full year 2023, we also shipped to the highest cumulative number of Invisalign trained doctors over 124,000 doctors, reinforcing our commitment to doctor-directed care for Clear Aligner treatment to achieve the safest and best possible clinical treatment outcomes for patients.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Before I go through the details of our Q4 results, I want to comment on 2 items in our fourth quarter financial results. Restructuring and other charges, during Q4 2022, we incurred a total of $14.3 million of restructuring and other charges, of which $2.9 million was included in the cost of net revenues and $11.5 million included in operating expenses. Restructuring and other charges included $8.7 million of severance-related costs and $5.6 million of certain lease terminations and asset impairments, primarily related to rightsizing operations in Russia in light of business needs.  Second, non-GAAP tax rate. In Q4 2022, we changed to a long-term projected tax rate for our non-GAAP provision for income taxes. Our previous methodology for calculating our non-GAAP effective tax rates included certain nonrecurring and period-specific items. That produced fluctuating effective tax rates that management does not believe are reflective of the company's long-term effective tax rate. We have recast non-GAAP results for our provision for income taxes. Effective tax rate, net income and diluted net income per share for each reporting period in 2022 to reflect this change. We did not make any changes to the results reported for 2021 as reflecting the change in our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results. Refer to the section in our Q4 press release titled Recast financial measures for prior periods in 2022 for a tax rate change under unaudited GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for further information.  Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $901.5 million, up 1.3% from the prior quarter and down 12.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q4 2022 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $16 million or approximately 1.7% sequentially and approximately $67.6 million year-over-year or approximately 7%.  For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of $731.7 million were flat sequentially, primarily from lower ASPs, mostly offset by higher volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were down 10.3% and primarily due to lower volumes and lower ASPs, partially offset by higher non-case revenues. For Q4, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were flat sequentially and decreased year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners and product mix shift.  On a year-over-year basis, the decline in comprehensive ASPs reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix shift and higher discounts partially offset by higher additional aligners and per order processing fees. For Q4, Invisalign ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment decreased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflect product mix shift, unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and higher discounts, partially offset by higher additional aligners.  On a year-over-year basis, the decline in ASPs reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by higher additional aligners and per order processing fees. As we mentioned last quarter, as our revenues from subscriptions, retainers and other ancillary products continue to grow and expand globally, some of the historical metrics that focus only on case shipments do not account for our overall growth.  In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we've added our total Clear Aligner revenue per case shipment, which is more indicative of our overall growth strategy. Clear Aligner's deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $56.4 million or 4.8% sequentially and $171.9 million or up 16.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q4 2022 Systems and Services revenues of $169.9 million were up 7.8% sequentially, primarily due to higher scanner volume, services and exocad revenues, partially offset by lower ASPs and were down 21.3% year-over-year primarily due to lower scanner volume and ASPs, partially offset by higher services revenue from our larger installed base of scanners and increased nonsystem revenues related to our certified preowned and leasing and rental programs. Q4 2022 Systems and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million or approximately 1.5% sequentially.  On a year-over-year basis, System and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $11.2 million or approximately 6.2%. The Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $9 million or 3.4% sequentially and up $42.9 million or 18.7% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.  Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 68.5%, down 1 point sequentially and down 3.7 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange on our revenues by approximately 0.6 points sequentially and 2.2 points on a year-over-year basis.  Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.8%, down 0.1 point sequentially due to lower ASPs and higher warranty and restructuring costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing absorption and lower training costs. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was down 3.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower ASPs, increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume.  Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 58.8%, down 4.6 points sequentially due to lower ASPs and higher inventory costs and manufacturing inefficiencies, partially offset by higher services revenues and lower freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was down 5.9 points year-over-year for the reasons stated previously.  Q4 operating expenses were $505 million, up sequentially 6.2% and down 3.6% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $29.5 million, mainly due to restructuring and other charges and our continued investment in sales and R&D activities, along with higher consulting expenses. Year-over-year, operating expenses decreased by $18.6 million primarily due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs as well as lower incentive compensation, partially offset by restructuring and other charges.  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were up were $459.7 million, up 3.7% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating income of $112.7 million resulted in an operating margin of 12.5%, down 3.6 points sequentially and down 8.9 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by 0.9 points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange and lower gross margin. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 4.2 points.  On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 18.3%, down 1.9 points sequentially and down 6.4 points year-over-year. Interest and other income expense net for the fourth quarter was income of $2.7 million compared to a loss of $21 million in the third quarter and a loss of $0.9 million in Q4 of 2021, primarily due to net foreign exchange gains from the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.  The GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 63.8% compared to 40.7% in the third quarter and 13.2% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to decreased earnings in low tax jurisdictions as -- and an increase in the amount of U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20% in the fourth quarter and reflects the change in our methodology that was discussed earlier. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior year in 2021, which does not reflect the change in our methodology.  Fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $0.54, down sequentially $0.39 and down $1.86 compared to the prior year. Our earnings per share was unfavorably impacted by $0.04 on a sequential basis and $0.22 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $1.73 for the fourth quarter, up $0.10 sequentially and down $1.10 year-over-year. Note that the prior year 2021 non-GAAP net income per diluted share or prior year 2021 EPS does not reflect the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate.  Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1 billion, down sequentially $99.5 million and down $255.1 million year-over-year. Of our $1 billion balance $387.9 million was held in the U.S. and $653.7 million was held by our international entities. In October 2022, we purchased approximately 848,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $188.62 per share through a $200 million accelerated share repurchase under our May 2021, $1 billion stock repurchase program. We have $250 million remaining available for repurchase under this program, and we plan to repurchase this remaining amount starting in Q1 2023 through either -- either or a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement, completing the repurchases in Q2 of 2023.  Q4 accounts receivable balance was $859.7 million, flat sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, down 1 day sequentially and up approximately 7 days as compared to Q4 last year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $144.7 million, Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $91.5 million.  We exited fiscal 2022 with a strong balance sheet, including $1 billion in cash and investments, a healthy cash flow position and no long-term debt. As we announced with our earnings, Align's Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the current $1 billion program. This new $1 billion program reflects the strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow generation as well as management and our board's continued confidence in our ability to capitalize on large market opportunities in our target markets and trajectory for growth while concurrently returning capital to our shareholders.  Now turning to our outlook. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q4 results and what appears to be a more stable environment in North America and EMEA. We are cautiously optimistic for continued stability and improving trends as we move through the year. However, the macroeconomic environment remains fragile. And given continued global challenges in the and uncertainty, we are not providing full year revenue guidance. We would like to see improvements in the operating environment and consumer demand signals, including stability in China before revisiting our approach. At the same time, we are confident in our large, untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry and our ability to make progress towards our strategic initiatives. We intend to focus on the things we can control and influence, which includes strategic investments in sales, marketing, technology and innovation.  For full year 2023, assuming no additional material disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 20%.  With this backdrop for Q1 2023, we anticipate Clear Aligner volumes to be down sequentially, primarily due to weakness in China from COVID, partially offset by some stability from our Americas and EMEA regions. We anticipate Clear Aligner ASPs to be up from Q4 2022, primarily due to higher pricing and non-favorable and favorable foreign exchange rates. We anticipate iTero scanner and services revenue to be down sequentially as the business follows a more typical capital equipment cycle.  Taken in total, we expect Q1 2023 revenues to be about flat to Q4 of 2022. We expect our Q1 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be consistent with our Q4 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as we continue to make investments in R&D and other go-to-market activities.  For 2023, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $200 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. In closing, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results and the improved trends in sequential growth we saw in the Americas and EMEA regions and parts of APAC that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients. While still very early and many uncertainties remain, we're hopeful that we'll see continued stability across the business and regions, especially in China. As we continue to work through these challenges, we're confident in our ability to focus on our customers and deliver key technology and innovation that furthers our leadership position in digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. We are balancing investments to deliver shareholder value through transformative digital orthodontic solutions unique to Align. Align is a purpose-driven business, and we are committed to helping doctors transform smiles and change lives of millions of people around the world.  Over the last year, we have flooded our customer base with a lot of new technology that represents one of the largest new product cycles in our history. But there is still a great deal of room for innovation. In the next 1 to 3 years, you should expect to see new platforms from us that will continue to revolutionize doctors' practices and patients' expectations for doctor-led treatment. And scanning, making it simpler and faster. In software, saving both doctors and patients more time with improved clinical outcomes. In direct 3D printing, an evolution in both product and material science.  These 3 platforms will give doctors tools only dreamt of before with a singular focus to make the Invisalign system the standard of orthodontic and restorative care, and we couldn't be more excited about it. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call.  Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first call is from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Jason Bednar : Joe and John, congrats on seeing the stability return to the business. Maybe I'll start with that point. If you could talk about maybe what's changed versus, say, 3 to 6 months ago, the adult part of the market still sounds maybe a little sluggish, but you also saw that sequential improvement. Teens are holding in. Could you maybe speak to the visibility you have today versus where you sat last summer or in the fall? What has led to the greater confidence in demand forecasting? Joseph Hogan : Jason, it's Joe. First of all, I think we have a more stable macroeconomic environment. Mean obviously, 2022 was pretty unprecedented when you think about China situation, Ukraine situation in Europe, the rapid increase federal reserve rates that really put the economy in a lot of ways. So I mean we're working from a better platform in that sense.  And I think, obviously, Powell's comments today and 0.25 increase in all. I mean it shows a little bit of confidence on the Fed's partners and what they're seeing and what they're directing to. So I'd just say, Jason, from a broad standpoint, we feel really good about our portfolio. We feel good about the technology we talk about and all those things. We're just looking for a stable platform from an economic standpoint to operate from. Jason Bednar : Okay. No, that's helpful. It definitely sounds more macro related than anything else. But that's helpful. And then maybe, Joe, I wanted to pick up on one point you mentioned regarding the bracket and wire piece. It sure seems like maybe a profit motivated decision for docs, maybe shortsighted, but still profit motivated as they focus on the cost of brackets and wires versus that Clear Aligner lab fee.  Maybe what do you think it's going to take to reverse that trend back to Clear Aligners picking up meaningful share I guess, especially with teens, do market volumes need to come back in a bigger way to convince doctors to free up more chair time with Clear Aligners? Or is there something you can do on your end to really stimulate that shift back towards Invisalign? Joseph Hogan : Jason, that's a great question. First of all, I mean, doctors are doing what they think are in their best financial interest and from a patient standpoint, too. A stronger economic environment will help in that sense, because they'll have a higher patient traffic and the trade-off won't be as severe in that sense because of the patient throughput. But where we help us in technology and that's why we emphasize the technology developments and the investments that we're making that are really significant as we launch in this year. And like I talked about with just software alone to pick one in the sense of being able to move patients through faster being able to have doctors really do cases a lot faster before with our products like IPP in different areas.  So those technology advancements are really important. And then how we put those together in business models like our digital subscription programs really help doctors get over that line, too. So I feel we have a good format to be able to address that going forward. But again, I'll emphasize, we need a market that we can stand on in the sense and predict. Shirley Stacy : Appreciate it. Next question, please. Operator : Absolutely. The next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeffrey Johnson : Joe, I just want to ask a couple of questions here. I guess, one, just on the Clear Aligner volume guidance for 1Q. It sounds like it's because China, incrementally weaker stability in Americas and the EMEA, you kind of had that in the press release. You got some hedging words in there about primarily due to weakness in China and some stability in the Americas and EMEA. I mean, should we be thinking at this point that your Americas and the EMEA are kind of a baseline here?  And I know, obviously, macro can change from here, but assuming that macro change away, are we kind of at a baseline level now in absolute volumes for Americas and the EMEA? And do you think China, could it be a recovery play throughout this year? Are you seeing any early signs of some pickup in some of those big dental hospitals or the new adult standard product there or anything? Joseph Hogan : Jeff, first of all, on the front end with the Western economies is we just see stability. That's what we talked about. That's what we see versus before we saw the market falling away from us. So right now, we see it being stable. And feel better about that point. On China, I mean, uncertainty in China is incredible when you think about billion people being sick there right now or have been sick over the last couple of weeks. And Jeff, I refuse to give a forecast over a number of quarters now because a lot of it has to do with the uncertainty that we see in China and specifically, which our second biggest market in the world.  So I don't want to try to forecast China right now. I can tell you now it's a blur for us and very difficult, but just we feel good about where we stand with EMEA and the States from a stability standpoint. We try to reflect as much in our words, what we see for the first quarter for you, too. Jeffrey Johnson : Understood. And I'm sure there's going to be a lot more questions here on the short-term things. I don't want to look or ask you about the Desktop Metal deal, though. On that, right now, is it all for kind of milling using iTero to connect to the lab there for milling and/or 3D printing of just restorations. Are you guys doing any early work with them on 3D printing of Clear Aligners?  And just kind of again kind of update us maybe with your most recent thoughts on when we might start seeing 3D printing of the aligners in the office and kind of your competitive advantages you think you can -- as Align carve out in that kind of setting? Joseph Hogan : Yes, Jeff, that's a good question. The Desktop Metals is primarily we think about a restorative play, how labs play a huge role and restore a dentistry with general dentists. I mean, they're really strong partners in that sense. What Desktop Metal represents is you see a lot of 3D printing going on. There's some really great resin development around restorative types of things, dentures, different areas the Desktop Metal leads in and our iTero scanner can really help with that, too.  Also, we have a vision of ortho restorative where you use our orthodontic procedures in order to reduce the amount of tooth loss mass that often comes with restorative procedures, too, that we'll work together with Desktop about. The idea of printing aligners and standard types of STL kind of processes from a 3D standpoint. I don't see that. And honestly, Jeff, I'm not one to think that doctors should turn their offices into production facilities. 3D printing is hard. The materials are difficult. There's a lot of doctors actually trying it, but I feel like doctors are much better being physicians and doctors in that sense than trying to run a manufacturing operation. Jeffrey Johnson : Even in that first case to try to seal the deal and really lock that patient in as a pain customer? Joseph Hogan : Jeff, I just think there are some things that kind of make sense from a productivity standpoint and some things that don't. Maybe the technology changes to the point, Jeff, will have a different conversation. But as it stands today, I really don't believe that. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : I was wondering if you could talk about, one, how you sort of think about the OpEx spend in terms of particularly sales and marketing in this environment? Do you sort of -- obviously, with the uncertain demand profile, are there things that you're doing incrementally in fourth quarter and the first quarter that sort of switch that spend around? John Morici : Yes, I think what we always look at, Elizabeth, this is John. We're always looking at trying to find the right return on investment. So as you see some of the markets stabilize and start to come back that we see, that's where we'll continue to make investments. And as we see volumes come back, we'll invest even more. Like we talked about some of the stability in Americas and EMEA. So we'll also look at trying to find the right return on investment. And as those markets stabilize and come back, you'll see us continue to invest in there. And as we said, last year, we kind of had to pair some of that back based on the conditions. And ideally, we could be in a better situation where we can make additional investments this year. Elizabeth Anderson : That makes sense. And maybe I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the GP demand profile, because it was interesting how that was sort of holding up on a relative basis. I heard what you said, obviously, about the teen commentary. Is it something about that market or maybe the lower price point per case or anything like that, that would sort of be impacting that? I'd be just curious to get more color on that. Joseph Hogan : Elizabeth, it's Joe. Could you restate that question? I didn't quite get the entire question. Elizabeth Anderson : I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about the GP dentist sort of strength versus the ortho on a relative basis in the quarter. So I was wondering if you could talk more about sort of the underlying color about why that -- why you sort of think that is at this point? Joseph Hogan : Yes, that's a good question. When you think about it, we have -- we're an elective procedure, right? And so someone is going to go to an orthodontist on a procedure like this to have teeth straighten. With the GP dentist, there is patient traffic there constantly with cleaning and restorations and different things. And so just it's an area right now where -- since it's not just elective procedures there, we feel GPs are just seeing more patients than an ortho would when you compare period to period. Operator : The following question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block : Maybe for the first one, John or Joe, can you just talk about the 5.5% price increase for 2023? The 1Q guidance is lower cases, lower scanner and services but revs flat. So clearly, ASP benefits. And I think you realized the 5.5%, the doc stays on comprehensive or goes to 3 x 3. But how do we think about what flows to realized ASP, John, is that sort of a, I don't know, a plus 2% or 3% from the 4Q '22 levels when we think about 1Q '23 and into the balance of '23? John Morici : That's a good way to look at it, John, because you're going to have some cases that kind of carry over where they kind of order them and they get shipped a little bit later. And then you're right, you're going to have some mix shift between the 3x3, which is kind of the same price and then the full comprehensive. So 2% to 3% in that first quarter is about in that range. Okay. Go ahead, Jon. Jonathan Block : I'm sorry, I know it was to clarify. That was just 2% to 3% sequential, John, correct from the 4Q to 1Q? John Morici : Yes, that's correct. Okay. Jonathan Block : Okay. And sorry, the second question, just on the op margin, I think you said 18% non-GAAP for 1Q greater than 20% for the year. I'll just sort of load up a modeling question here. Do we think about a sequential improvement for each of the quarters throughout 2023? And then -- that might be for John.  And Joe for you. Just talk to us on how you're comfortable on that OM guide, when you still have a lot of moving parts with the economy, you've got what's going on in China? I think you framed it as a fragile environment. How do you get comfortable with that OM guide there's enough wiggle room, I suppose, in the OpEx where you feel you could titrate spend accordingly? John Morici : Yes, I'll take the modeling question, John. Yes, you would expect that just like we have in maybe prior years and so on, as you start to get that volume leverage, you'll start to see some of that margin improvement as you go throughout the year. So kind of starts at that lower point and you would model it to see some improvement as you go through the year. And like we said, total year slightly above the 20%. Joseph Hogan : And John, on the OM guide and the confidence is related to what we see right now and what we think is some macro trends that are much more stable than what we've experienced before. So from that, we understand our costs, and we know what we have give and take. And John and I watch it closely and we obviously manage it as a percentage of the total revenues are 2. So revenues have to adjust. We have to adjust to. But again, I think we know what the levers are in this business. And within the context of stability, we feel we can manage to the numbers that we've given. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Joe, I just wanted to kind of follow up on your comments about starting to commercialize. Obviously, product and technology cycle that you seem very excited about in that sort of ortho and restorative vision. I guess could you maybe just kind of help crystallize that for us in terms of how that kind of come to market in 2023 and the kind of type of investment that the company needs to make to kind of go after that opportunity? Joseph Hogan : Nathan, overall, obviously, we do spend a significant amount on R&D in the business. And the foundation of that is the history of Align because basically we realize we're a revolutionized digital orthodontics overall. But what we see is it's not just invention for inventions sake, we're always after, how can we do these cases faster, how do we do them more predictably, how do we make it simpler for doctors, a better treatment for patients overall and experience? And just to give you one statistic, right? So versus wires and brackets, which you talked about in the script. On an average, we do patient cases 5 months fast and 35% fewer visits to a doctor. And you do that from technology, right? You do that through remote monitoring, you do that through the consistency of your algorithms and moving teeth and knowing when those seats are going to land as long as patients were. And so the technology I talked about in those 3 areas, first of all, whether it's scanning, we get better on scanning every year. AI is a real important part of that because through AI, you can anticipate a lot of things move these scans through a lot faster. Inventions last year like IPP, Invisalign Personal Plan, those kinds of technologies really reduce the traffic and communications between a doctor and us in the sense of setting up treatment plans. And lastly, 3D printed devices, as I mentioned, has always been the holy grail because we're the biggest 3D printer in the world, but we don't really 3D print devices, we print molds, which you vacuum form over top of it. When you vacuum-form over top of a mold, you can't control wall thickness as you can in 3D printing. And all think this is really critical to move teeth. So all these inventions take a lot of time and money overall, but we just see a huge opportunity for us to be able to increase clinical efficacy, efficiency for doctors and patient experience, and that's why we're so excited about it. Nathan Rich : Okay. Great. And then just a quick clarification. On the adult side, cases were up 7% sequentially and it sounds like you saw a modest improvement in North America. I think that was the case in APAC as well. I guess I didn't hear reference to adult as you're talking about EMEA. I guess, was the -- kind of adult dynamic kind of more in -- when thinking about the Western economy is more in North America. Just curious if you also saw the same thing play out in EMEA as well? Joseph Hogan : If I get the question right, Nathan, I mean, EMEA was great, both adults and teens. We felt good about it. They came -- you always go around, I call it, the dark side of the moon in Europe in the third quarter, right? But when they came out from the third quarter, we had a good fourth quarter from that. And so we felt good on both the adult side and the teen side in Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : I always struggle with this number that you really haven't grown the number of docs and it's been a while. And I understand that when demand is down, you don't ship to docs every quarter. But even the ones that are registered Invisalign users haven't really grown. And I guess my question is, is there an issue with that? Like why hasn't that number really expanded over the last 4 to 5 quarters? And do you need it as part of your growth algorithm to keep expanding the number of doctors? Is it just a change in culture in the world right now? Or is it competitive pressures? Or is it just harder to find docs, who are willing to do this? Because the penetration of Clear Aligners would suggest there's a lot of doctors out there that could be doing this. Joseph Hogan : I mean, doctors both on the orthodontic side and on the GP side. I mean, obviously, you're right about that. And obviously, we expand a lot globally, too. So everything you said is true. I'll just give you one word on your questions on China. China is China is like -- it's down. We ship the thousands of doctors in China, we can't ship to right now. And that's the answer to your question since why it's gone down. There's no systemic overall issue in the sense of us being penetrated to the point that we can't buy more doctors, it's just we can't escape the downdraft of China right now. John Morici : And your equation is right. It's new doctors, doctors ship to as well as utilization. That is -- those are 2 key metrics that help us grow our business. Kevin Caliendo : Can I ask a quick follow-up? You talk about the need to see consumer demand signals improving. And how far ahead can you actually see that? Meaning -- is it -- is there something in ordering and planning? Like can you see 3 months ahead or 6 months ahead in terms of you're starting to see demand increase? Or is it really real time, like we've made -- we're starting to see an inflection point? I guess it gets to the point of like what do you need to see in terms of consumer demand? How far forward can you look before you can really feel comfortable that there's been an inflection plan? Joseph Hogan : Kevin, when we look at things, we're a real-time business, obviously, when you have 3D freebies like we do what we make. And there's no leading indicator that would say it hasn't or squared of overnight, 90%. But what we watch closely are the consumer confidence indices in the States and Europe where we can get good wins. Now they're more confirming than they are predictive in what we're seeing but they reflect the, I think, best from a demand standpoint of what we can expect in the consumer confidence indices that we see both in Europe and the States have flattened out or turned slightly positive in the last month or so. Shirley Stacy : Next question please. Operator : Absolutely. Our next one comes from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Brandon Vazquez : I wanted to ask one to kind of go back to a couple of us, who are trying to get at. You guided to a full year op margin above 20%, and you're a little bit below that now, of course, probably transient. The question being, do you need sequential improvements in sales to then drive the sequential improvements in op margins through the year? Like how should we be thinking about that? Or are you prepared to kind of deliver that 20% even if let's say, were just stable through the rest of the year rather than improving? John Morici : Yes, it's a good question. I mean we would expect as we start to see demand as it stabilized as things change in the world and give us a better operating environment, we would expect to see some sequential improvement in revenue as you go through the year. And that would help us get some of the leverage that we need from an op margin standpoint. Shirley Stacy : Next question please. Operator : Absolutely. The next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great. Just a follow-up to that last question, just to clarify, I understand you're not giving the full year guidance from a volume perspective. But if you do continue to see the environment is what you're saying sustained where it is today or get slightly better? You are in a position to grow volume year-over-year in 2023.  And then just a separate question on subscription offerings, particularly in retainers. And I'm curious how that's resonating with customers today as another revenue driver for the practice. And when do you think that, that will be material in terms of contribution? John Morici : I can start on the volume. I mean we would expect -- we're watching a lot of the signals closely. We tried to give more color around Q1 and the rest of the year will play out as things as things in the world change to the situation. So we'll watch volume closely. But like I said, we would expect some sequential improvement as you go forward through the year. But -- we're not getting into the specifics of what it is for total. Joseph Hogan : It's Joe, on the DSP program, originally, that was targeted primarily at retainers or orthodontists because a lot of orthodontists are making their own retainers in the back room and picking up for wires and brackets. And so we signed up, we also obviously do the touch-up cases with that too is 10 aligners less. That's worked out well. And we -- I think what you're referring to in the end is that's a subscription program to the doctor but we also have a subscription program we offer from the doctor through the patients, and we're implementing that now. There's a lot of enthusiasm from our doctors about that because it becomes a reoccurring revenue stream for them that they haven't many of them haven't tapped into before. And so we feel good about that. And we'll be working closely with our doctors to implement that more fully this year. Shirley Stacy : Next question, please. Operator : Absolutely. The next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Also on a couple of just real quick, some are very fast. First, on China. I think you mentioned that you used the word on more, which is kind of understandable. But any updated thoughts on BPP or any [indiscernible] Can you tell what's going on there while the COVID situation is ongoing? Or is it just kind of a box. And then I also wanted to ask on the tax rate, the non-GAAP tax rate, you called out 20% in 4Q, should we sort of assume that the tax rate go forward? John Morici : So Michael, this is John. On tax rate for the non-GAAP tax rate assumed 20% going forward. Joseph Hogan : On China, BPP, I mean, obviously, that program over there, we talked about it several times, it's in Tier 3, Tier 4 cities. It's really not in the middle of our portfolio. It was picked up by some Chinese competitors. We're primarily private over there. We will sell the public hospitals. The program is not exclusive in that sense, too. So may we feel like we can manage in China right now around this fine. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate your time today. This concludes our conference call. We look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including Chicago Midwinter, IDS and AAO. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact our Investor Relations line. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q1 financial performance and comment on our views for the second quarter in 2023. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. Overall, I'm please report better than expected first quarter revenues and earnings. The sequential increase in first quarter revenues of 943 million reflects stability across all regions for Clear Aligner business and favorable average selling price for the Clear Aligner and Systems and Services segments. Q1 sequential growth reflects an increase in non-case revenues, which also increased year-over-year driven by continued growth from our Invisalign Doctor subscription program the Vivera Retainers. And the team segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts 182,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligners during the first quarter, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year, which is encouraging as we head into the important summer season for teens and kids. Overall, remain confident in our large underpenetrated market opportunity globally. And our ability to deliver digital products and technology that are helping doctors transform smiles and change lives for millions of people. Processes and services in Q1 revenues of 153.3 million were down 9.7% sequentially, and 6.2% year-over-year. As expected Q1 systems and services revenues decreased sequentially consistent with seasonal capital equipment cycles compared to Q4. For Q1 system and services revenues were sequentially lower primarily in the Americas and APAC regions, offset somewhat by an increase in EMEA. For non-system scanner revenues Q1 was up sequentially in year-over-year, reflecting increased scanner rentals, upgrades and certified pre-owned or CPO leasing programs to one CPO sales and food initial shipments of leasing units to desktop metal, who's supplying iTero element flex scanners to desktop labs. One of the largest lab networks in the United States serving general dentists. On a year-over-year basis Q1 services revenues increased primarily due to higher subscription revenues resulting from the large number of iTero scanners in the field. We also had higher non-systems revenues related to our scanner leasing and rental programs previously mentioned. The Q1 total Clear Aligner of revenues of 789.8 million was up sequentially and down year-over-year. Q1 sequential revenue growth reflects increases across the regions driven by price increases favorable foreign exchange and more additional liners. Q1 non-case revenues were up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from DSP, Vivera Retainers in commerce sales, which include everything from a liner cases to whitening and cleaning products. DSP has been very successful and enabling doctors to purchase aligners on a subscription basis, giving them flexibility to treat simple touch up cases, or offer their patients a superior flexible and convenient retention solution. We introduce DSP in North America during the pandemic, and are continuing to expand DSP offerings in the main region. The contribution of DSP to non-case revenues is important to understand, especially the impact overall Clear Aligner volumes. While we don't report the number of DSP, Clear Aligners shipped, and we don't include them in our total Clear Aligner volumes, if we were to calculate an equivalent case shipment for touch up patients, using our DSP aligners, we estimate those cases would increase approximately 25% sequentially. Q1 call total Clear Aligner volumes of 575.4,000 were down slightly sequentially reflecting stability across regions, and improvements in consumer confidence, as well as the easing of COVID restrictions recently in China. For the Americas Q1 Clear Aligner volumes were up slightly sequentially reflecting higher orthodontic cases, especially teen case starts with growth in both Invisalign Teen case packs and Invisalign First treatment for kids as young as six, offset primarily by a decrease in adult patients from the GP dental channel. Based on the most recent gauge practice analysis tool that collects and consolidates data from approximately 700 ortho practices in North America, overall, new patient flow and adult exams were lower this period while teens outpaced adults. During this period, wires and brackets cases continue to grow ahead of Clear Aligners, although at a slower rate than in recent quarters. And Invisalign cases outpaced other Clear Aligner brands. The gauge report also included a few data points regarding no shows which are exam schedule, which we believe may provide insight into consumer sentiment and macro conditions. Regarding no shows, over the last 12 months, there's been a large increase in the number of patient no shows. However, that rate appears to be stabilized. Conversely, over the last 12 months, future exams scheduled were negative year-over-year, but the rate has steadily improved in the most recent months covered by the report, which we believe may be a good gauge for consumer optimism. For EMEA, Q1 Clear Aligner volumes include strong adoption of Invisalign moderate across the region in both the adult and team segments. Invisalign Moderate Package's a 20-stage treatment option designed for patients whose treatment goals fall between the existing Invisalign Light and Invisalign comprehensive packages. For APAC, Q1 Clear Aligner volumes reflect improvement in China and continued growth in markets like Japan, Korea and India with positive year-over-year growth, including teams. Teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for Clear Aligner sales to orthos. We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal prices through teen specific sales and marketing programs and product features, including Invisalign First for kids as young as six, which is up sequentially across all markets. For Q1, total Clear Aligner cases for teenagers were up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting improving trends across the regions. On a sequential basis, growth was driven by increased submitters in the APAC and Americas region. On a year-over-year basis, teen case starts were up in EMEA region by reflecting increased utilization and the recent introduction of Invisalign moderate across the region, which outpaced the year-over-year growth rate of Invisalign First, which also continues to perform very well across markets. Invisalign First was also up sequentially and year-over-year across all regions. Invisalign First is designed to treat a broad range of -- issues in growing children from simple to complex. And because Invisalign First is removable, it's easier for kids to brush and flows. There's also no discomfort from rubbing braces or poking fires for metal braces. These benefits, along with positive compliance experience, may also contribute to continued momentum for Invisalign First. In fact, the majority of surveyed Invisalign orthodontists agreed that their young patients are highly compliant with Invisalign First treatment. Understanding that younger kids are highly compliant and Invisalign First provides an opportunity to sort of overall practice growth. The Q1 Clear Aligner volume from dental service organizations, or DSO customers continue to outpace non-DSO customers. Q1 Clear Aligner volume from DSO customers increased sequentially, reflecting growth in the Americas region. DSOs make up approximately 20% of the dental market and represent one of the most important channels for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. Through their network of doctors and systematic approach to clinical education and practice management, DSOs are uniquely positioned to drive adoption of new technologies and tools that increase practice efficiency and profitability and deliver a better patient experience. We have well-established relationships with many DSOs, especially in the United States, with DSOs such as Smile Docs and Heartland Dental. And we are continuously exploring collaboration with others that drive adoption of digital dentistry. Each DSO has a different strategy and business model. And our focus is working with them and encouraging DSOs align with our vision, strategy and business model goals. One of the most digitally minded DSOs is Heartland Dental. And today, we announced a $75 million equity investment in Heartland. Heartland is a multidisciplinary DSO with GDP and ortho practices across the U.S. Their growth strategy includes Heartland's de novo dental practices, which feature modern technology, are located in areas with strong community need for dentistry, where Heartland provides practices with opportunities for mentorship, leadership training and continuing education. In the last three years, Heartland opened 188 state-of-the-art de novo practices across the United States and are planning to continue investing through more de novo openings. We have a shared sense of purpose with Heartland. Their mission is to help doctors and their teams deliver the highest quality digital dental care to the communities they serve. The ban creation remains an important strategic growth driver, and we continue to invest in consumer marketing programs that create awareness of the Invisalign system and that drive demand to Invisalign practices. In Q1 '23, we delivered 7.8 billion impressions and had 22.1 million visits to our websites and continue to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube across markets. For more details on our programs and key Q1 performance metrics, please see our presentation slides on our website. We're also developing digital tools and apps for consumers, patients and for doctors. The Q1 adoption of the My Invisalign consumer and patient app continue to increase with 3.1 million plus downloads to date and over 350,000 monthly active users, representing 28% year-over-year growth. Usage of our other digital tools includes ClinCheck, Live Update, which is used by 38,000 doctors to reduce time, spent modifying treatment plans of up to 13% and Invisalign practice app with 58,000 doctors actively using this feature and uploading more than 5.1 million photos to date. Finally, in addition to our focus on consumer marketing and digital tools, we're committed to driving excellent treatment and align innovation through industry and align hosted clinical education events. Our team has just participated in the annual AAO conference, which took place in Chicago, where we engaged with a broad range of orthodontists. In March, we participated in IDS in Cologne, Germany, one of the largest dental shows in the world focused on digital dentistry and the technologies shaping the industry. Earlier in the quarter, we hosted the second align's symposium on the digital practice, a smaller align event from the most engaged in experience Invisalign orthodontists in the world. It was an amazing opportunity to come together with long-term global partners and thought leaders in orthodontics to see how we are driving the digital transformation of dentistry together. By our participation in each of these events and opportunities, we continue to reinforce the importance of peer-to-peer clinical education and our investments in the orthodontic specialty. We are grateful for all of our customers, GP, orthodontists, corporate practices but we know that the orthodontic specialty leads the way in adoption of digital orthodontics. We are excited about the future we see them in the orthodontic profession. Align abruptly supports the orthodontic profession through education, grants and continued innovation. Our educational pathway was created to support recent graduates, and we career doctors at critical career transition points. As a result of schooling and early career initiatives, graduates will be educated on digital dentistry and digital orthodontics, connected with and supported by colleagues more experienced ortho experts in the Align team and engaged with Align Digital Platform. Align supports doctors throughout all stages of their career, from educating facilities at dental schools and orthodontic programs to education for residents. Early to mid-career providers and more seasoned professionals looking to expand their clinical capabilities and practices. Align is expanding its global footprint of education centers to provide a forum for hands-on learning and continued development in key cities across our regions. We are also focused on continuing to innovate in digital dentistry, scaling capacity to manage the millions of digital requests, patient scans and orders flowing through our systems, while also using technologies like AI and machine learning to increase efficiencies, speed treatment planning and quickly deliver products so patients can begin to pass to transforming their smiles. In the next one to two or three years, Align believes our newest technologies and innovations will revolutionize our existing offerings in the ways in which doctors and their patients experience orthodontic treatment. Together with our customers, we are developing the future of digital dentistry and digital orthodontics not just the technology that drive treatment, but the models reshaping how we interact with customers and deliver treatment experiences for their patients. We look forward to sharing more with you in the coming months. With that, I'll now turn it over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $943.1 million, up 4.6% from the prior quarter and down 3.1% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q1 '23 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $25.8 million or approximately 2.8% sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately $34.9 million year-over-year or approximately 3.6%. For Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $789.8 million were up 7.9% sequentially primarily from higher ASPs and higher non-case revenues, partially offset by lower volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Clear Aligner revenues were down 2.5%, primarily due to lower volumes, lower ASPs, including unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher non-case revenues. For Q1, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and decreased slightly year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect price increases, favorable foreign exchange and higher additional liners, partially offset by product mix and larger discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the ASPs for our comprehensive treatment were almost flat, primarily due to product mix shift, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts, mostly offset by price increases and higher additional aligners. For Q1, Invisalign ASPs for non-comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the increase in ASPs reflect price increases, favorable foreign exchange and higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in ASPs reflects price increases and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts. During the quarter, we launched Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product in most markets. The three and three configuration offers our doctor customers our Invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional aligners included within three years of treatment end date. Instead of unlimited additional aligners within five years of the treatment end date. At the 2022 Invisalign comprehensive product price, over time, we have come to learn that on average, Invisalign doctors complete a comprehensive Invisalign treatment with less than two additional aligners. We are pleased with the initial adoption of the Invisalign comprehensive -- and anticipate that its impact will be more meaningful, providing doctors the flexibility they desire and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product. As revenues from subscription retainers and other ancillary products continue to grow globally, some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total Clear Aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $32 million or up 2.6% sequentially and $150.9 million or up 13.6% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners per shipping. Q1 23 systems and services revenue of $153.3 million were down 9.7% sequentially primarily due to the seasonally lower scanner volume, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold, higher revenues from our CPO and leasing rental programs and favorable ASPs, down 6.2% year-over-year primarily for the reasons just stated. Q1 '23 systems and services revenue was impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $4 million or approximately 2.7% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, System and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $5.8 million or approximately 3.6%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $2.2 million or 0.8% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in scanners sales and deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase and up $24.2 million or 9.8% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins and provide refurbished scanners for certain markets. As such, our model is changing. We expect to continue to roll out programs such as our certified pre-owned leasing and rental offerings -- by possibly leveraging our balance sheet and selling the way our customers desire. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing scanner sold. Moving on to gross margin, first quarter overall gross margin of 70%, up 1.5 points sequentially and down 2.9 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.8 points sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 71.7%, up 0.9 points sequentially due to higher ASPs, partially offset by higher manufacturing absorption. Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was down 3.1 points year-over-year, primarily to lower ASPs, increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume. Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was 61.6%, up 2.8 points sequentially primarily from increased manufacturing efficiencies. Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was down 1.8 points year-over-year due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher services revenues and ASPs. Q1 operating expenses were $527.1 million, up sequentially 4.4% and up 3.1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $22.1 million, primarily from higher incentive compensation and consumer marketing spend partially offset by restructuring and other charges not recurring in Q1. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $15.9 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and our continued investments in sales and R&D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $490.5 million, up 6.7% sequentially and up 2.1% year-over-year. Our first quarter operating income of $133.5 million resulted in an operating margin of 14.2%, up 1.7 points sequentially and down 6.2 points year-over-year. Operating margin was favorably impacted by approximately 1.5 points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange and higher gross margins. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin. Investments in go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately two points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, offset by restructuring and other charges. Operating margin for the first quarter was 18.5%, up 0.2 points sequentially and down 5.5 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the first quarter was an income of $1.1 million compared to an income of $2.7 million in the fourth quarter and a loss of $10.6 million in the first quarter a year ago, primarily due to net foreign exchange gains from the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. The GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.8% compared to 63.8% in the fourth quarter and 28.4% in the first quarter of the prior year. The first quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the fourth quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to increased earnings in low tax jurisdictions in Q1 2023 and an audit settlement in Q4 2022. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly periods in 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. First quarter net income per diluted share was $1.14, up sequentially $0.60 and down $0.56 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was favorably impacted by $0.14 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.21 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $1.82 for the first quarter, up $0.09 sequentially and down $0.43 year-over-year. Note, the prior year 2022 non-GAAP net income for diluted share in our prior year 2022 non-GAAP EPS reflects the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities was $921.4 million, down sequentially $120.2 million and down $199.2 million year-over-year. Of the $921.4 million balance, $310.5 million was held in the U.S. and $610.9 million was held by our international entities. During Q1 2023, we purchased approximately 942,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $307.74 per share for a total purchase price of $290 million, completing a $200 million accelerated share repurchase from Q4 2022, a $250 million ASR from Q1 2023 and in our May 2021, $1 billion stock repurchase program. During Q1 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2023 $1 billion stock repurchase program. Q1 accounts receivable balance was $884 million, up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was $83, down approximately two days sequentially and down approximately four days as compared to Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $199.9 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $64.1 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $135.8 million. Now turning to our outlook, as Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q1 results and what continues to be a more stable environment across all regions. We remain cautiously optimistic for continued stability, as we move through the year. However, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain. And given continued domestic and global challenges and unpredictability, we are not providing full year revenue guidance. We would like to see consistent improvements in the operating environment and consumer demand signals before revisiting our approach. We remain focused on making investments to drive growth and penetration into a huge untapped market opportunity, including our strategic investments in sales, marketing, technology and innovation. We are confident in our ability to address the massive opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, with our execution centered on our strategic initiatives. With this as a backdrop for Q2 2023, we anticipate Clear Aligner volume and ASPs to be up sequentially. We also anticipate Systems and Services revenue to be up sequentially. For Q2 2023, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $980 million to $1 billion. We expect our Q2 2023 non-GAAP gross margins to be flat to slightly up from Q1 '23, and our Q2 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be up by approximately one point sequentially as we continue to strategically prioritize our investments in go-to-market activities and R&D to drive growth. For full year 2023, assuming no circumstances beyond our control, we reiterate our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 20%. For 2023, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $200 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. Finally, as it relates to the $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental that Joe discussed, our investment is less than 5% of the Company and the line has no oversight or involvement in management of Heartland Dental or its affiliates. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. In closing, we're pleased with our first quarter results that reflected an environment of continued stability for our doctor customers. However, degrees of uncertainty remain from market to market. We're confident in our durable competitive advantage as we continue to transform the orthodontic industry, bringing digital dentistry and clear line of treatment to more doctors and the patients they serve, driven by our strategic initiatives of international expansion, orthodontist utilization, general dentist treatment and patient demand and conversion. We will continue to focus on the next phase of new platform innovations in scanning, software and direct 3D printing while prioritizing the needs of our customers for the ultimate benefit of their patients. We are a purpose-driven organization with a tireless commitment to transform more smiles and change more lives. We're the only digital orthodontic company in the world today with the scale and reach to address the 500 million potential people that could benefit from teeth straightening within the line system. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Jason Bednar : I wanted to start first maybe with the 2Q outlook. You're pointing to a sequential uplift in cases in the quarter. I think that's consistent with what we typically see in a normal year from first quarter to second quarter. I think it's normally a 5% to 10% uplift. So maybe a good sign if we're continuing to move back towards normal, I'm not sure if you're willing to touch a typical pattern there, Joe or John, just to comment on the second quarter. But regardless, can you elaborate maybe on the rhythm of activity you're seeing in the U.S. or international markets that contributing to the visibility today and calling for those improved case volumes in the second quarter? Joe Hogan : Jason, it's Joe. First of all, I'd just describe what we have is stability right now. I mean you talk about the quarter-over-quarter seasonality of the business. We haven't really seen that for a long period of time. Obviously, that's embedded in our forecast right now. But I'd characterize again, what we're seeing right now is stability, which I feel is good in the sense that we've had such instability over the number of years. And from quarter-to-quarter, we're seeing some consistency in that sense. And I think -- in this economic environment right now with the uncertainty in different aspects going on out there, I think the stability piece and that's what we're leaning on as we move into Q2, is the right theme and the right kind of focus. Jason Bednar : Okay. All right. Understood. Maybe to follow up and press a little bit more on maybe on the utilization side. Could you talk about maybe the puts and takes around some of the utilization metrics you're putting up here in the quarter and as we think forward in the future. It seems like that ortho channel is seeing some good uplift. The first sequential improvement we've seen in over a year. international utilization did tick lower, but I'm wondering if there's a dynamic plan out there where some of your China doctors are coming back online and starting to do cases, but not yet fully back up to normal. So maybe just curious if you could unpack what you're seeing with utilization in those two channels, the North American ortho channel, your international customer base. Joe Hogan : Utilization statistic is, Jason, obviously, important to us. Remember, it often gets somewhat muddled in the sense of DSO aggregation and different things in different areas that we've had a report in an investment community at times. Your point on China is a good one. China was somewhat dark for us during the COVID piece, and we do see that coming back. The orthodontic piece is a good signal to. So overall, I feel good about those -- the utilization numbers. I felt obviously good about the gauge data. I hate to see the wires and brackets moving up, but you could see we outperformed on the Clear Aligner segment on that piece, too. So, we're seeing good doctor engagement and that's on both the GP side and the ortho side. I think the overall piece here is you have to look at a continued challenge from an adult standpoint, when you look at our numbers across the globe. And I think that's more reflective of the consumer index and confidence things that we've talked about in the past. And the teens in that certain window of treatment are more certain for this in treatment than some of the adults in those cases. And that addresses your question, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : So, my first question would be, I know you said China is coming back. Are you seeing that continue to sort of improve as we think about the second quarter? I mean, obviously, you're lapping some of these shutdowns last year, but I'd be curious about how that was improving. And then just to, I think you called out some broader utilization and improvements to help drive the margins higher in the second quarter and the guidance that you just gave, but could you go into a little bit more detail about what specifically is helping to push those up? John Morici : I think, Elizabeth, I'll take the kind of the margin piece. This is John. We'll see improvements as we produce more product, sell more product. We talked about that being sequentially up from a volume standpoint and utilize our facilities, whether it's clear liner or on the Systems and Services side. So that's definitely a help. And in particular, with some of the improvements that we're seeing with higher utilization in Poland, as that plant continues to ramp up, will -- we see improvements in gross margin that way. Joe Hogan : Elizabeth on China, I could -- it was kind of a difficult quarter in a sense of how it started. But we saw good unfolding as the quarter went forward. I'd say when I hear people say China returning, China is coming out of a COVID crisis. I think we see, obviously, across different industries. China improving in that sense, but I'd say no way is China back in the sense of we envision China four years ago or so before we went into this mess. Right now, I'd say what we've seen in China the last few months is just stability, I'd say, some stability and a more clear signal out of China than we've seen in the past, but nothing that we're ready to forecast through individual growth standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block : Maybe somewhat of a similar line of the question, but I just want to stick to maybe the March quarter. So let's say, most of the 1Q '20 revenue be is specific to ASP related, if you would. So I'm curious how Invisalign cases trended throughout the March quarter. And if there's anything to call out within the different regions and how that played out, call it, from a Jan to March -- because when you do start some of the implied math based on, John, your commentary where 1Q ASP was going to land, it seems like case falls were maybe on your number prior, not ahead. So again, just any color around case falls throughout the quarter and by region would be helpful. John Morici : John, this is John. So I would say in specific, as we said in China, we saw improvement in China. I mean it went from January with a lot of the COVID cases and February was better than January and March was better than February. We saw that. And then as Joe described, we've seen stability in a lot of the other markets where there's puts and takes, but overall, more stability throughout the quarter. And that's what kind of got us to our overall volume numbers. Jon Block : Okay. So then I'll ask my follow-up and I'll ask my second question. I think on the initial guide, China was supposed to be down Q-over-Q, was China still down Q-over-Q, 4Q to 1Q based on your commentary? Or was that up and you gave it back a little bit somewhere else. That would just be the follow-up to the first question. The second question is just burning one on 2Q a little bit. When you say ASP up 2Q versus 1Q, is there a dart throw of maybe low single digits or 1% to 2%. I'm guessing you get the stub on the price increase. You get the full quarter in 2Q that you didn't get in 1Q. And maybe FX, as we sit here today is more favorable for the June quarter versus March. John Morici : Yes. Thanks, Jon. Yes, on China, we didn't specifically guide for China in Q1, and it played out as we described there, but that's what we saw in China, which adds to what Joe was talking about just that stability that we saw there that we haven't seen in three years or so. On ASPs, you're right. We expect it to be slightly up over Q1. It's getting that full quarter of price change and so on the price increase we have and kind of taking the FX where it's at right now so slightly up compared to what we saw in Q1. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson : Following up on John's question, I think he was trying to get up the same thing. But look, I mean, revenue in 1Q came in clearly ahead of what you guys were talking about. 2Q is at least being guided above the street, which I say encouraging. You're talking about stability throughout the quarter. So I guess I'm trying to understand why isn't that translating to slightly better margins? I think your margin number in the 1Q was spot on with us. It was above the street right on what we were thinking, but your full year guidance is staying the same. And it sounds like you feel a little better about the end markets. You're definitely translating that to better revenue. I would just think even with fixed cost leverage, maybe we would have seen a little bit better margin in the 1Q and a little bit more optimistic outlook for the year. John Morici : I think, John, when you look at -- or sorry, Jeff, when you think of the total year, there's still uncertainty in the second half. So we tried to give a good view of where we think Q2 will be based on that guidance, but they're still uncertainty in the second half. And that's why we've stayed away from that revenue guide for the total year and kept our op margin that we talked about, the non-GAAP at or slightly above kind of out there just for that uncertainty still in the second half. Jeff Johnson : Okay. And then maybe a follow-up. I just want to make sure on DSP. I think I know the answer to this. I don't want to expose my -- pay if it is that. But I know there's commercial product in there. I know obviously, there's -- there do any cases get captured within DSP? Obviously, as DSP is growing nicely, the 575,000 cases you did this quarter, the 598,000 cases you did last year in the first quarter. If we subtracted out DSP or if that didn't exist, would those case volumes be different at all, is the down 3%, 4% year-over-year being impacted at all by more things moving to DSP? Just want to understand the impact that has as we look at these reported global case volumes. John Morici : No, you're right, Jeff. I mean, so as DSP grows, there are some non-comprehensive typically cases that get caught in there. Those would be minor adjustments, minor movement cases that those doctors would want instead of going into a non-comprehensive case, in ordering that, they're using DSP. And so therefore, DSP kind of includes it. It's great revenue for us. It's additional revenue. That's why when you think of that other revenue piece of it. It's growing faster as DSP grows, and it's really fulfilling the way the doctors want to be sold to. But some of that case volume gets trapped within DSP. Shirley Stacy : But Jeff, just to make sure we're talking kind of apples-to-apples, you asked if you stripped out those cases from our reported case volumes, they're not counted in the case volume is the point, and that was the comments that John made on the script about the implied impact of DSP revenue growth because those aren't counted in case shipments. Jeff Johnson : Right. And as they're growing, then I'm assuming the 4% year-over-year case volume contraction you reported this year in the first quarter looks a little worse than it actually would have been if DSP wasn't out there. And that's what I'm trying to get at. Is there any way to quantify that? Would cases, if not for DSP, been closer to flat year-over-year? Or is there just any way to kind of guide us round about what that impact of DSP growing nicely year-over-year, but then that's capturing -- DSP is capturing more cases this quarter -- this year in the first would have then did last year in the first quarter. John Morici : Yes. We haven't broken that out, Jeff, within DSP. But you're right. The year-over-year case volume change would not have been down by as much. It would have been more -- it would have been adjusted because DSP is growing, and there's more cases that kind of get trapped within there. But as Shirley said, we don't report those DSP cases. They're not there. They just show up in our other revenue. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez from William Blair. Your line is open. Brandon Vazquez : I think first, I just wanted to focus kind of on the adult side. The cases were down quarter-over-quarter. Those are the cases a little more exposed to the macro side. But you are also guiding to sequential improvements in volumes going forward. So just kind of curious if you can talk about that dynamic. Is team quarter-over-quarter growth enough to kind of offset that? Are you expecting adults to also improve -- just kind of any dynamics around that would be helpful? Joe Hogan : It's Joe. Look, I think when you look at adults, I look at that as really tied to the consumer confidence indices, particularly in the western world that we can track. And look, I'm not -- we're not smart enough to project where that's going. It looks like that's stable right now, too, when you look at the way those lines are trending in the United States and different parts of the Western world. On the teen side, our second quarter is a big teen season. In the western world, third quarter is big teens for China. And so that's why we talked about it in my script is that we came out of the first quarter with really positive signs on teens. As we go into the quarter, we have some momentum in that sense. And so we stay focused on adults and we'll execute well around adults. But in teen season two, we keep a very sharp focus there because we think that demand equation is much more consistent. Brandon Vazquez : Okay. And then maybe I'll take us a step away from kind of the near-term stuff and just talk a higher-level strategy on the DSOs. It looks like you guys are having good progress there. Can you talk about -- are there any kind of like fundamental differences of going to that market? Any commercial strategy differences? Are there potential margin benefits because you're kind of dealing with one large organization that sells to bigger accounts, anything you can call out there for us? Joe Hogan : Yes, it's a good question. The DSOs, you're right, there's something we call OpEx, some cost aspects you don't have to have as high as the number of salespeople calling on that account, you organize resources differently to make sure you support a team like Heartland, the way they need to be supported. What's really great is a very synergistic effect, too, in the sense of how they execute on their clinicals throughout their organization from an efficiency standpoint, how to teach our doctors to use our product to enhance what their capability is in the digital dentistry side. And so -- and then obviously, we help to teach through their teachers in the sense of how we train the doctors and all. So what we really like about with Heartland, and we have a good relationship with other DSOs with Heartland is a really good focus from a digital standpoint and good execution around how they want to move that to the marketplace to their doctors. It's very professional, and that's why we've seen growth in that channel and -- we see that with Smile docs also on the orthodontic side, there are strong orthodontic DSO. And we're really, really happy to partner with them because we have the same vision and the same focus on expanding the marketplace for digital orthotics. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Nathan Rich : Maybe going back to China, if I could. Joe, is there any way to characterize kind of where case shipments were March relative to maybe where the business was prior to the lockdowns? And can you maybe just talk generally how you feel about the consumer there and they're kind of coming out of these lockdowns willingness to spend on dental treatment. Joe Hogan : Well, I think we're coming out of a complete blackness, okay, when you get it. So Nave's really hard to pull a signal out of all that noise, except for we had a reasonable quarter, and you can see we're predicting that in the second quarter for China. That's kind of as far as I want to go. When you think about China itself, from a consumer standpoint, you have to look at the private institution. You have to look at the public hospitals. And again, that data isn't clear enough for us in the sense of what the sustainability is on that piece. So we're just being cautious. I don't think China is going to revert back into a COVID kind of a shutdown. I think we all know that. But that economy is somewhat questionable right now in the sense of how fast it will rebound and what direction it rebounds in We're just being cautious in the sense of how we're going to forecast Nathan Rich : Okay. Sounds good. And then, John, maybe a follow-up for you. Could you maybe just help us get a sense of where the 3x3 case penetration was in 1Q and it sounds like you're expecting a pretty meaningful step up in 2Q. I don't know if you can kind of put any numbers around that in terms of what that will do in terms of the revenue recognition that you'll get kind of incrementally relative to the first quarter as that penetration increases? John Morici : Well, I think first off, the three and three, it's a great product that our customers want and they're utilizing and so we're happy to see in the markets that we've released good adoption started in January for us, and we saw it progressively increase as we went through -- in through the quarter. So every month got better. And it really gives doctors more options in terms of how they want to purchase our product. As I said in my remarks, many of our doctors -- most of our doctors don't do more than two refinements. So this is a product that's perfect for them, allows them to treat patients the way they can. And then from a revenue recognition standpoint, it -- because we don't have -- we have pretty much a defined number of aligners only up to three refinement. And it's over a three-year period. So we're able to recognize revenue over a shorter period of time and the adoption of this as well as other factors are in the overall Q2 guide. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin : I want to follow up on an earlier question regarding what you saw in adult versus teens, recognize your point on adults being a little bit more consumer exposed and maybe some of that is a little bit more macro driven. But just wondering, anything you can comment to in terms of how that progressed through the quarter? Or any difference you're seeing U.S. versus Europe versus EMEA, just given anything on progression there? I think with that? Just to sort of that back to your comments on stability, it would be really helpful to bridge that. Joe Hogan : Michael, it's Joe. I mean if anything has been consistent, we have seen the pressure on adults during this whole downturn. Now we can see pressure on teens, too, but not to the same extent. These things vary by country in Europe. There's no Europe, you have to look at by country or whatever in the United States. But in general, we see very similar trends from an adult and team standpoint, with more teen demand, not saying positive team demand, but stronger teen demand than we've seen with adults. So what we feel good about is that we're seeing decent stability in those numbers. And adult creep up a little bit. We saw our DSOs in the United States execute really well around adults, which shows you that if you have the right kind of focus, you can still have a good patient yield on the adult side, if you're working that piece. But in general, I think until we see significant economic improvement, I don't know if that adult -- teen kind of ratio in the sense that we're seeing is going to change dramatically. I think we have to see a good upturn in consumer confidence before we see that reflected in the adult volume. Doesn't mean that confidence doesn't affect teens, but it doesn't affect it to the same degree. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then on the ASP front, again, I know you guys just talked about the price hike for a while and you discussed some of the factors that led to the ASPs in 1Q and sort of out for 2Q. I'm just wondering, we've always sort of debated price elasticity or demand elasticity as it relates to price. I know there's a lot of going on that earlier this year. Just wondering if now that you've got a full quarter under your belt any additional learnings on price sensitivity in the market, ability to take more price through another price hikes. So what are your thoughts on that a couple of months in. Joe Hogan : I think price elasticity is a good question in this marketplace. Michael, I think we've always known it's been there. I mean we see -- our competitors don't necessarily compete at all on technology, they compete on price. And then we know that it's had a certain amount of success in a certain part of the marketplace, and that will always be there. But when you look at our price increase here, and I think you're associating our price increase with price elasticity and our volume is our 3x3, which we didn't increase. And obviously, there's a limitation on additional aligners. It was really well received by the marketplace and very from a GP standpoint and ortho standpoint too. And our increase on our comprehensive was seen as fair and also the other parts, I would say -- but everybody loves a price increase, and we see our NPS score. But if I've been here long enough to have enough data points to tell you that, I think this price increase -- our pricing approach was received better by the marketplace than any other one that I've instituted since I've been here. And so, I feel good about it because I think it matched our customer expectations with what we need from a business standpoint. And so I don't think that that elasticity was negative at all in the sense with the price increases here. And most of our competitors, they are truly competitors followed in that sense with price increases, too. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erin Wright : I'll ask my question both upfront here, but first on Heartland and the investment there. And how does the relationship change now with the investment? And would this constrain any future relationships with DSO partners. Did you contemplate any sort of conflict of interest that could arise there? And then second question would be on the scanner business and how we should be thinking about the quarterly progression of the segment and stability across the business? And how we're just thinking about just equipment demand trends in general overall with iTero? Joe Hogan : Erin, it's Joe. I'll take them. On the DSO side, I don't see a conflict of all. We have DSOs that really want to address digital dentistry through digital orthodontics and we're excited about our -- obviously, our digital footprint and what we can offer from a platform standpoint. And so Heartland is helping the lead on the GP side in that sense, and I mentioned the Smile docs on the ortho side is there, too. So again, I don't expect this to be an issue within any of our accounts because we will engage with them and to help them on a demand equation if they want to be as aggressive and inconsistent and this implementation is what Heartland has been and which our docs have been, too. So -- and I don't see a conflict of interest at all. When I hear that term, my hair goes up in the year. I don't see anything that's conflicting at all. I think this is completely in line with what we believe in. We want to drive digital orthodontics as fast as we possibly can. And those DSOs and frankly, not just DSOs, just we have several doctors that have multiple practices that we engage with to try to expand those practices with them because we know they've committed to digital orthodontics and can drive those things forward. So I'd look at this as a positive statement that we're ready to engage and invest with our partners that share our vision. And then secondly, on the scanner business, I think you look at what happened between fourth quarter and first quarter. I think you have to take that in context. Fourth quarter is always a big capital equipment cycle. And first quarter is lower. This wasn't much different when you look at the numbers. When you look at our overall services business through that business because we have such a broad installed base that held up very well. So as I look at the scanner marketplace and where we stand today, I believe we have the largest installed base out there. We monetize that well from a services standpoint, we work with those accounts. When you look at our NPS scores of customers that use iTero, significantly higher customer satisfaction than ones that don't and try to use PVS impressions or something else, too. So when I look at our technology versus technology from competitors, I feel we lead, and we'll continue to lead in the marketplace. So our iTero scanner is critical for us going forward. It's a key part of our digital platform. Don't look at the fourth quarter and first quarter as any kind of a signal to say that we're losing momentum in that business. We always see that difference between fourth quarter and first quarter. John, you add anything? You... John Morici : That's good. I mean, it's very consistent. Operator : Our final question today comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : I just want to go back to Heartland. Can you tell me how much volume you did with Heartland in '22? Is this going to potentially impact that going forward? Like is there any guarantees or any buy-ins or do you maybe more contribute to their growth as they continue to grow? And I guess the follow-up to there is, how are you accounting for this? It says less than 5% ownership. I'm assuming that means whatever runs through the P&L would be a noncontrolling interest, right? And -- or is it somehow above the line? And is this impacting margins in any way, shape or form? Joe Hogan : Kevin, I'll take the first one. John is our expert in accounting here. I'll let them take the next one. So on Heartland, look, we don't give individual numbers like this, but you can guess Heartland is the biggest DSO in the world, and they're very effective DSO in that sense. And this is a meaningful investment, and we're seeing meaningful growth with those guys. And I think we're trying to model something, I think, of us a model. It's a good relationship and has a good trajectory from a growth standpoint. John accounting? John Morici : Yes. In terms of the investment, less than 5%, it doesn't show up in our op margin or anything of that nature. And it's an investment that we made, and it stays on our books that way. But there's nothing that would show up in our op margin or anything else related to that investment. Joe Hogan : Kevin, also just -- as John talking and thinking of my comment to you is your comment might have inferred something like a quid pro quo or something like that. There's nothing like that. There's no piece of that. We have a joint vision in the sense of how we can move digital orthodontics through the general dentistry, and we share that, and we're helping to invest in that so we can drive it forward. But there's no give and take in that sense. Appreciate your questions. Kevin Caliendo : Hopefully, it's a good financial investment. You make money as well as advanced digital dentistry. If I can ask... Joe Hogan : Follow up. Yes. Kevin Caliendo : U.S. case growth, do you expect U.S. cases to grow year-over-year beginning in 2Q? Is that part of the assumption or how we should think about that? Can you get down to that kind of granularity, U.S. or Americas? John Morici : Yes. We're not at the -- we're just not giving that case growth numbers, we just kind of wanted to talk sequentially, but you would expect, as we've kind of said from Q1 to Q2, we would expect overall volumes to increase sequentially as you get into teens and others, it's going to vary by region. But if you're talking specifically the U.S., you start to get into more of a teen season basis, and that's the expectation for our overall numbers. Shirley Stacy : Yes. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your time today, and thank you for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and meetings. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may now disconnect your lines at this time.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments, system services and clear aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q2 financial performance and comment on our views for the third quarter and 2023 overall. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and we'll open the call to questions. Overall, I'm pleased to report another better-than-expected quarter with Q2 revenues and operating margins that exceeded our guidance. Q2 results reflect improving trends across regions, strength in teen and younger patient volumes, driven by momentum in both submitters and utilization as well as continued growth from Invisalign First. In the Teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, 195,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners during the second quarter. An increase of 7% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, reflecting the highest annual growth rate in the teen segment since 2021. For Systems & Services, second quarter revenues of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially and down very slightly 1% year-over-year. For Q2, sequential increases in systems and services revenues, reflects increased scanner volumes across the regions and higher services and non-system revenues, reflecting increased sales of certified pre-owned or what we call CPO scanners and higher subscription revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 services revenues increased primarily due to higher subscription revenues from a large number of iTero scanners in the field. We also had higher non-system scanner revenues related to our certified pre-owned again CPOs and our scanner leasing and rental programs. For Q2, total clear aligner revenues of $832.7 million up 5.4% sequentially and 4.3% year-over-year. Q2 sequential revenue growth rate is consistent with our historical three year average and reflects growth across all regions. Q2 non-case revenues at $80 million were up 6.2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from Vivera retainers and Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP, our monthly subscription-based clear aligner program. And Commerce sales for aligner-related consumables, like aligner cases and whitening and cleaning products. DSP has been successful in addressing an important and growing opportunity for experienced Invisalign doctors. It is our first subscription-based clear aligner program that enables doctors to reach new patients and provide them with a better overall experience. DSP enables doctors flexibilities to treat simple touch-up cases or offer their patients a superior, flexible, and convenient retention solution. We introduced DSP in the United States and Canada in 2021. We expanded it to Spain and the Nordic countries in Q2 2023, and we'll launch DSP in France and the United Kingdom in the second half of this year. We have also extended DSP to DSO partners who recognize the value of our Invisalign subscription aligner put model. Over the past two years, our DSP subscription program has continued to ramp and in Q2 drove strong volume growth in touch-up cases typically five to 10 stage cases of aligners. For Q2 '23, we shipped over 18,000 DSP touch-up cases in North America, up from 15,500 in Q1 '23 and more than double the case volume in Q2 '22 last year. Given its continued success and contribution to our growth this year, DSP touch-up cases are included in my overall commentary for clear aligners. Otherwise, specified in my remarks, our case volumes and metrics do not include DSP and touch up cases. For Q2, total clear aligner volumes were up 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Q2 clear aligner volumes, including DSP touch-up cases, were up 5.4% sequentially and up 2.4% year-over-year. For the Americas, Q2 clear aligner volumes reflect sequential growth across the region from both ortho and GP dentist channels, an increase in teen case starts driven by momentum from Invisalign First and increased adult patients from the GP dentist channel. In North America, adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product drove sequential volume growth. For Q2, North American ortho utilization was up sequentially and down a fraction year-over-year, including DSP touch-up cases. Q2 North American ortho utilization was up both sequentially and year-over-year as noted in our Q2 '23 earnings slides. For EMEA, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region and continued adoption of Invisalign Moderate, Invisalign Comprehensive three and three products as well as an increase in teen case starts, which grew sequentially and year-over-year driven by Invisalign First and our new Invisalign Teen case packs. On a sequential basis, clear aligner growth was led by Iberia, Italy, DACH, and Turkey. For APAC, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and up year-over-year, reflecting improving trends in China as well as other key markets like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and India. Q2 APAC results also reflect increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization, especially for teen patients, driven by growth from Invisalign First in the orthodontic channel, which is especially important as we enter the China team season in Q3. Q2 APAC results also reflect growth in the GP channel with increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization sequentially and year-over-year. During Q2, we continued to roll out the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product in APAC, where it is now available in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, and India. We plan to launch Invisalign three and three in China in Q3. We are also pleased with the additional adoption of three and three product in APAC, where the majority of cases treated are comprehensive, allowing our doctor customers more flexibility within the Invisalign product portfolio. In June, we hosted 2023 Invisalign APAC Summit in Singapore and brought together nearly a 1,000 orthodontists and general practitioners, dentists and clinic staff from 18 countries across the Asia Pacific region. The Summit showcased Invisalign and iTero products, the Align Digital platform and the recent and upcoming innovations, while also highlighting our doctors' experience with digital transformation, and how it improves the patient treatment journey. Attendees joined expert sessions focused on enhancing treatment planning efficiency, optimizing digital workflows, addressing the unique needs of teens and younger patients in exploring the essential aspect shaping today's digitally driven orthodontic practices. Teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for clear aligner sales to Orthos. We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through teen-specific sales and marketing programs and product features unique to the Invisalign system. For Q2, total clear aligner cases for teenagers were up 7% sequentially and 9.7% year-over-year, reflecting improving trends across the regions. On a sequential basis, growth was driven by increased submitters in the APAC and EMEA regions on a year-over-year basis. TNK starts were in the APAC region, driven by increased submitters and in the EMEA region, driven by increased submitters and utilization, both in the orthodontic channel. Last year, we introduced the Teen Case Packs in the United States and Canada, and in Q1, Q2, we launched them in France, Scandinavia and Iberia. For the quarter, Teen Case Packs increased sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength in EMEA. Invisalign First also was up sequentially and year-over-year across all regions and continues to drive adoption of Invisalign treatment among young patients. Invisalign First aligners are designed for Phase 1 treatment, typically in growing children six to 10 years old, making up about 20% of orthodontic case starts. For the dental service organizations, or DSO customers, Q2 clear aligner volumes increased sequentially primarily from the Americas region. Overall, clear aligner growth rate from DSO doctors continues to outpace non-DSO doctors and our DST touch-up cases are ramping nicely up as DSO doctors understand the value of the subscription program brings regarding pricing and flexibility for their patients. Invisalign is one of the most trusted brands in the orthodontic industry globally among both doctors and patients. On the consumer marketing front, we delivered $10.3 billion impressions and had 30.9 million visits to our website in Q2 '23. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents teams about the benefits of Invisalign brand, we continue to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram across all markets as well as key social media influencers and brand ambassadors. In the Americas, we focused on reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents through our influencer and creator-centric campaigns partnering with leading smile squad creators, including Marshall Martin, Rally Shaw, and Jeremy Lin. Each of these creators shared their personal experiences with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners. Additionally, in the United States, we work closely with athletes over time, a high school sports social media platform that showcases the benefits of Invisalign treatment. Brand interest remained strong throughout the quarter with 9.2 million consumers visiting our websites in the Americas region, representing 17% growth year-on-year. In EMEA region, we partnered with new influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta. In Germany, we launched new testimonial campaigns highlighting the stories of 70 young adults and teens who share why they chose Invisalign treatment and how it impacted their lives. Our consumer campaigns delivered more than 1.7 billion media impressions and 9.7 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 12 million visitors to our websites and over $4.8 billion impression. We expanded our region in Japan and India via TikTok, Meta and YouTube. We partner with key influencers like [indiscernible]. We saw increased brand interest in consumers as evidenced by 270% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website in India and a 46% year-over-year increase in Japan. Adoption of My Invisalign consumer and patient apps continued to increase with 3.1 million downloads to date and over 350,000 monthly active users, a 28% year-over-year growth. Uses of other digital tools also continue to increase. ClinCheck live update was used by 40,000 doctors on more than 580,000 cases, reducing time spent and modifying treatment by 20%. Invisalign practice app is increasing in adoption with 88,000 doctors who are actively using this app and 5.1 million photos were uploaded in Q2 via the Invisalign practice set. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.002 billion up 6.3% from the prior quarter and up 3.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q2 '23 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.3 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. And unfavorably impacted by approximately $19.4 million year-over-year or approximately 1.9%. Clear aligners Q2 revenues of $832.7 million were up 5.4% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, higher non-case revenues and higher ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 clear aligner revenues were up 4.3%, primarily due to higher ASPs, higher non-case revenues and higher volumes. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect larger discounts and product mix shift to lower-priced products partially offset by price increases. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for non-comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the increase in ASPs reflect lower discounts, higher additional aligners, price increases, and favorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in non-comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional Aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. In Q1 '23, we launched Invisalign Comprehensive three and three products in most markets, and we have continued to expand into more markets, as previously mentioned. The three and three configuration offers our doctor customers, our Invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional aligners included within three years of the treatment end date, instead of unlimited additional aligners with five years of the treatment end date at the 2022 Invisalign comprehensive product price. Over time, we have come to learn that on average, Invisalign doctors complete a comprehensive Invisalign treatment with two or fewer additional aligners. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product and anticipate that it will continue to grow, providing doctors the flexibility they desire and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time, compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product. As revenues from subscriptions, retainers, and ancillary products continue to grow globally, some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy. Q2 '23 clear aligner revenues impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.2 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.3 million or approximately 1.9%. Clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $13 million or up 1% sequentially and $138.6 million or up 12.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q2 '23 systems and services revenue of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially, mostly due to higher scanner volume, higher revenues from our certified preowned program and higher services revenue from our larger base of scanners sold, partially offset by unfavorable ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were down 1%, primarily due to lower scanner volume and unfavorable ASPs, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and higher revenues from our CPO and leasing rental programs. Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $0.1 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.1 million or approximately 1.8%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $2.3 million or 0.8% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase and up $8.6 million or 3.3% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales, and the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands, and we introduced new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins, and provide refurbished scanners for certain markets. As such, our model is changing. We expect to continue growing our programs and as offering our CPO units for purchase and selling the way the customer -- our customers desire. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners, is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanner sold. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 71.2%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 0.3 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 72.4%, up 0.7 points sequentially, primarily due to the lower mix of additional aligners, favorable manufacturing variances and higher ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was down 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher ASPs and lower freight. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was 65.1%, up 3.5 points sequentially, primarily from lower service and freight costs, partially offset by lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was up 5.3 points year-over-year, primarily from lower service and freight costs and higher services revenue, partially offset by lower ASPs. Q2 operating expenses were $541.7 million, up sequentially 2.8% and up 8.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $14.5 million, primarily from higher consumer marketing spend and higher incentive compensation. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $42.3 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and our continued investments in sales and R&D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $505 million up 2.9% sequentially and up 8.4% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating income of $171.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.2% up 3 points sequentially and down 2.2 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to higher gross margin, as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange of 0.1 points. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 1.1 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, offset by restructuring other charges, operating margin for the second quarter was 21.3%, and up 2.8 points sequentially and down 2 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.3 million compared to an income of $1.1 million in the first quarter and a loss of $14.6 million in the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.8%, consistent with the first quarter effective tax rate of 34.8% and 35% in the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly results in 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.46, up sequentially $0.32 and up $0.02 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.02 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.15 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.22 for the second quarter, up $0.40 sequentially and up $0.07 year-over-year. Note that the prior year 2022 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in our prior year 2022 non-GAAP reflects the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term, and long-term marketable securities were $133.8 billion up sequentially $112.4 million and up $56.6 million year-over-year. Of our $133.8 billion balance $314.3 million was held in the U.S. and $719.5 million was held by our international entities. In Q2, we completed a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental a multi-disciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the U.S. During Q1 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2023 $1 billion stock repurchase program. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $908.4 million, up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 81 days, down approximately two days sequentially and down approximately four days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $251.9 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $58.5 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $193.3 million. Now turning to our outlook. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q2 results. While the macroeconomic environment still remains uncertain, we have seen improvements in the operating environment and the consumer demand signals that influence our outlook. For Q3 2023, we anticipate our worldwide revenue to be in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion, up approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our Q3 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly up from Q2 2023 as we continue to strategically prioritize our investments in R&D and go-to-market activities to drive growth. For full-year 2023, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 worldwide revenue to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $3.99 billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We also expect our full-year 2023 GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 17% and our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 21%, a 1 point improvement from the guidance we provided in April of 2023. For 2023, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued international expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : At our continued growth despite the economic slowdown in uncertain environment. Q2 results demonstrate our resilience and adaptability. While we cannot predict future economic conditions, we're confident in our ability to focus and execute on our strategic growth initiatives. As a leader in digital transformation, we offer a powerful suite of innovative digital tools that make up the aligned digital platform, which provides a seamless end-to-end digital experience for doctors and their patients. Innovations launched over the last year include ClinCheck live update for 3D controls. This enables doctors to generate modified Invisalign patient treatment plans in real time, reducing modifications that used to take weeks to as little as two minutes. Improving practice productivity while also improving the quality of treatment plans. Invisalign Personal Plan, or IPP streamlines the treatment planning process and helps doctors achieve their desired treatment plans more consistently and efficiently. Invisalign Smile Architect allows general dentists to integrate clear aligner therapy into their comprehensive treatment plans by combining tooth alignment and restorative planning in a single platform. Invisalign Virtual Care, equips doctor with a next generation remote monitoring solution that has new artificial intelligence assisted capabilities to streamline their workflows. Cowen being computed tomography or CVCT, enables doctors to visualize the patient's roots as part of the digital treatment planning process. Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro, expand Align's existing Invisalign outcome simulator technology and adds the benefit of the company's ClinCheck in-face visualization tool that combines a photo of a patient's face, with their 3D treatment simulation, creating a truly personalized view of how their new smile will look. Itero-exocad Connector integrates iTero intraoral camera and NIRI images with exocad DentalCAD 3.1 software, and allows dental professionals to visualize the internal and external structure of teeth. In addition to these and other incredible innovations in the coming years, we'll continue to build a digital platform and add new capabilities to improve clinical outcomes and elevate the patient experience to drive continued practice growth and positive patient experiences. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to speaking to you at our upcoming Investor Day on September 6, where we'll share with you our views about the incredible market opportunity we have and how Align is uniquely positioned to continue to lead the transformation of the digital orthodontic industry. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Hey Joe, congrats on a nice bounce back quarter here. I wanted to start really on the teen market. Obviously, that's where we all focus long-term on the business. But that 9.7% year-over-year growth, when I look back last year, it was your first quarter in a long time of negative year-over-year growth in teens. So you had a bit of an easy comp there, although, obviously, '21 was a fantastic year. So I guess I'm trying to figure out in this economy, when I think about comps from '21 that were so tough, when I think about competition that's out there, where do you think that 9%, 10% teen growth is relative to where you expect to be normalized? Are we still expecting a nice improvement of this over the next few years back to kind of mid, upper teens, something like that? I just would like to get your views on that. Joseph Hogan : Jeff, I mean you know how important that teen market is to us, like I talked about in the script of the 21 million case starts and the majority of those 75%, 80% being teen. So I look at that sequential growth in teens is being really positive. Now we did have a good number to compare against, like you said. But when I highlighted in our -- the Invisalign First product line and how well that product is doing overall, and it continues to grow phenomenally throughout the world in all three regions that we have. Our teen packs different business models or plans that we put together, really helps with that piece, too. So Jeff, when you look at our coming technology improvements and products and those kinds of things, they're targeted really well with the teen market also. So the numbers that you mentioned about potential growth and penetration in that marketplace, in line with our investments and where we think we'll go in the marketplace. But let's be honest, it's been -- that's a struggle to get orthodontists to really move on teens. But our top docs are almost exclusively Invisalign across the board. Our job is to bring this new technology out, but also infuse it well within doctors, so they're comfortable with the work practices and comfortable with the clinical outcomes. And I feel we've made really good progress in that area. Jeffrey Johnson : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just would like an update maybe on China. Obviously, third quarter tends to be a big teen season there, but we're also seeing some mixed macro feedback on China as a whole kind of from an overall economic standpoint. So just what's kind of current tenor of business in China? And just remind us how bad were things in third quarter last year in China, we just kind of lose track of the COVID shutdowns and all that, but should third quarter be an easy comp in China? Or were things opening back up there before we got to the beginning of this year where they shut back down again. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Yes. China, obviously, from an economic standpoint, Jeff, it's -- we watch that closely as everybody does, too, but we have to take it as it is right now. And we had a good quarter. We had a good start in the first quarter, too. And so we're seeing good sequential momentum, an improvement in that sense in the business overall. Obviously, when you look at the third quarter, I mean, we all know you watch our stock closely. We know the third quarter is a huge teen market in China, as I mentioned in the script, too. And we're really good on that, but we feel very confident in the sense of our positioning there and where China stands right now. I can't comment on future economic activity there with any more accuracy than you can. But what we've experienced in the second quarter and what we see going into the third, we feel good about it. Jeffrey Johnson : Thank you. Joseph Hogan : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Jon. Jonathan Block : Good afternoon. Hi, Joe. I'll start on innovation. And Joe, going into '23, you called out this year is one of the biggest for Align in terms of innovation when we think about the company's history. At the end of the prepared remarks, that was really helpful. You laid out a handful of innovations. Where are you with the next wave? And when I say the next wave, any details that you can give with paddle expansion in terms of timing in the U.S., maybe if you can elaborate a little bit on the limited rollout in Canada to date. And is there anything else that we should expect more near term, i.e., maybe next three to 12 months before some of those longer-term aspirations come into play on direct printing? And then I'll ask my follow-up. Joseph Hogan : Jon, obviously, the Invisalign Palate Expander has come a long way. You probably get -- that we've had some four ways into Canada recently and good feedback on our product line. When we look at the investor conference coming up, we'll obviously give you a much more detailed discussion in the sense of where that product stands, and how we'll commercialize it. But overall, what I'd tell you, John, we know how to make it. We have a process that makes it. Remember, with our business though, just making it doesn't mean anything, you've got to scale this thing to million. And so that's what our focus is right now is how we scale, how we roll this out. There's obviously a lot of regulatory qualifications we have to meet in each area because it's a new device, too, but I feel good about that. And Jon, when you look our development, you know this well, you can almost draw a line between the production of product and then the software that we talked about with the software piece. Obviously, IPE represents both of those, right? It's new software and new kind of treatment planning, but it's actually a 3D-printed device that we haven't launched before. So just think about in the scale-up mode, but when we see you on September 6, we'll have many more details for you. Jonathan Block : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe as my second question, sort of one of those famous two partners. John, to start with you, can you elaborate on the ASP for comprehensive Q-over-Q? I believe you said it was down Q-over-Q, little confused because I think you would have had the full quarter the price increase on the 3x3 and the comprehensive. So if I've got that right, maybe if you can tease out why it would have been down Q-over-Q. And then, Joe, the upside for the cases, I'm packing it around 10,000 relative to the implied guide that you gave back for 2Q. I've got the U.S. cases essentially in line with our estimate. International seems to have really been the driver of the upside. And maybe to build on Jeff's question, can you just give some more details where the outperformance was? Was it China? Was it EMEA? Where do you see maybe the better-than-expected results specific to those international regions? Thanks guys. John Morici : Yes. Just first on the ASP, Jon. Yes, the comprehensive were down slightly, just a reflection of some of the product mix that we had as well as some of the discounts that we have partially offset by price decrease. So nothing out of the ordinary there, we actually saw an increase on a sequential basis for non-comp. But the comprehensive was just more mix. Joseph Hogan : Jon, back to me is -- yes, you're right. I mean, when you look at from a regional standpoint, EMEA and APAC stood out. Really across the board in EMEA, I mean like I mentioned in my script, had Iberia did well. U.K. did well. The Nordic side, we just introduced DSP and different things. We're excited about those areas, too. So -- and then the teen growth there overall across those geographies was good. So I mean, it's just -- I think just good strong performance. And then when you think about the EMEA economy, too, Jon, I mean last year there was a lot of uncertainty with the Ukraine situation that hasn't gotten any better, but Europeans and the European countries, I think have solidified their economies around that. And just we're seeing some improvement from a consumer sentiment standpoint, too. So that's reflected in our numbers also. On APAC, obviously, China was good year-on-year. Japan actually was very strong for us, too, along with Korea, in different parts of Asia, as I mentioned. So it's still broadly really good improvements in both of those regions by country and also specifically in that teen segment that I mentioned. So we're seeing good improvement Jon, from a sequential standpoint. Shirley Stacy : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great, good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. Hey Joe, hey John. I guess, could you maybe just talk about how adult cases performed relative to your expectations, improved slightly, but I think still down a little bit year-over-year. And how are you thinking about the biggest swing factors that could impact revenue in the back half. Does the guidance kind of just reflect a continuation of the environment that you saw in 2Q? And is there any kind of part of the business that you're watching specifically, either teen versus adult or certain markets that you feel are especially big swing factors in the back half? John Morici : Yes, I'll take that one, Nate. This is John. When you look at the commentary that we gave, we saw improving trends as we went into the second quarter. We see that in the results. And our guidance reflects that. It shows up in Q3, and it also gives us the confidence to talk to a guide for the total year. So that's how we've kind of factored things in and looking at the normal metrics in indices that help us with that. As far as adult versus teen, as we said, teen season now. We saw good results in Q2, and we expect that to continue in Q3. As we've said, China is a big market, U.S. big market in Q3, and we expect that to continue. And adults important for us, too. We have a lot of capabilities to be able to go to those general dentists and try to work where those adults might be wanting to come into treatment and be able to help provide for them as well as our orthodontists. So we feel good about the efforts that we have to try to improve both teen and adult as we go through this year. Nathan Rich : Okay, great. And then just a clarification on the touch-up cases. So -- it sounds like that's pressuring the North America ortho utilization metric. But if you back that out, or kind of include touch up, it would have been up year-over-year. I'd just be curious to get your sense of what portion of those 18,000 touch-up cases would have been cases kind of in your view in the past prior to DSP just so we get a sense of what that shift might look like? John Morici : Yes. So those touch-up cases, as we talked to those 18,000, those would have been -- those are the touch-up cases that would have been the lower-stage products that we had 5 stage, maybe 7 up to 10, but in that range, 5 to 10, but probably more on the low side of that in terms of the stages. And we see this great adoption with the DSP program, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it doubled from last year. We wanted to give some commentary about how big this is becoming and show them in our kind of our discussion about the year-over-year, and the sequential and so on. And at Investor Day in September, I'll give a lot more detail about kind of where it came from, how it's become more and more important and what it means going forward because we're going to include these cases going forward. But in the end, we see in all cases where we see -- we've seen the DSP program, it drives incremental volume for us. Those doctors continue to do those comprehensive cases that we see, but those doctors are also doing these low stage touch-up cases as well as retention. And we think that's a good thing for our doctors. Nathan Rich : Great, thank you. John Morici : Thanks, Nate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Brandon. Brandon Vazquez : Hello, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up first on the DSP program. If we're doing our math correctly, it seems like most, if not all of the year-over-year increase in case volumes is actually coming from the DSP program. So one, is that correct? And two, maybe if it is, can you talk about where do you think the mix goes eventually to DSP? And is DSP at this point accretive to your case volumes? Or are you seeing accounts kind of switch what they would have been doing as kind of normal base volumes into DSP? John Morici : We're actually seeing DSP as accretive. So we're not seeing -- we're seeing -- fundamentally, we're seeing doctors who were either making them themselves or going to lab or other ways of making the Aligners actually switching over and continuing to give us those comprehensive cases, but then they're also now giving us the DSP cases. Remember, most of DSPs, the majority of DSP is retention, and it's the retention that we're providing. But then a subset of that is these touch-up cases and like I said, about 18,000 or so. And what we've also commented to it would have -- it would have helped us by about 1.5 points on an overall basis. So we reported our volumes up about 0.9%. And they would have been up 1.5 points on that to 2.4%. So it's accretive no matter how we look at it, and it's certainly accretive from a standpoint of the margin that it generates. It's generating some of the highest margin from our product portfolio that we have because the cost to serve is very straightforward for us. There's no additional liners or anything else. So we recognize all the revenue as soon as we ship without additional aligners related to that. Brandon Vazquez : Okay. And then one other second on...... Joseph Hogan : Other clarification on your question was whether you put DSP or not, we were up year-over-year in our numbers. Brandon Vazquez : Got it. Joseph Hogan : So sequentially not sure -- go ahead. Brandon Vazquez : Got it. That's helpful. The next question is just on teens. I think, Joe, you had said a little earlier, a little frank about there's hurdles within the teen market and kind of pushing that share into existing accounts to get a little deeper -- can you guys just talk about what are kind of the top hurdles right now? Why has it been a little bit tougher to get the incremental share in the teen market? And what are you guys kind of focused on in the next six to 12 months to push that share forward? Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Hey Brandon, in general, when you look at orthodontic workflows, if they're not completely digitized in the sense of what they do and you're kind of in a down cycle right now with orthodontists and their challenge. They feel like on a wire bracket side, they can just make more money with wires and brackets versus Invisalign because the raw material costs are 3.5x. Now if you're fully digitized your workflows and everything else, obviously, you make more money with Invisalign. But I think in these kind of challenging economic times, it's just more difficult to move the orthodontic community over to the clear aligner piece because they're just used to the workflow of what we have with versus wires and brackets. I can say Invisalign First seems to be an exception to that. In the sense of how Phase I kind of patients are treated. That's not a constant when you look at what's going on in the orthodontic industry. But we see a lot more interest in Phase I with Invisalign First than we thought before. I think that's going to help to be a span breaker for us in this whole thing. In the future, there's no doubt to us in the sense that clear aligners of the future, no white spot lesions, obviously six months faster than a normal kind of a treatment, much easier for patients. We know all those things. When you ask what the biggest issues are, they're not basically clinical anymore. It's about workflow, workflow and confidence in orthodontic practice. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks so much for the question. One, this -- don't take this as a complete because I'm very happy that we have full-year guide. What I was -- wanted to ask was like what -- did you guys see sort of in the end markets or in your -- the visibility of your results to the macro picture that made sort of this time the right time to kind of move on from what we've had in the quarterly guide, the last couple of quarters into this sort of longer guidance. Joseph Hogan : Yes, I'll give you the high-level view, and I'll turn it over to John, Elizabeth for the ground thing. But I mean, obviously, we had a good second quarter, and we feel we can see through to the third quarter whatever. At that point, too, like we said, with the qualifiers is continued economic situation that we see now, we feel confident just based on what we understand from a cyclical standpoint to be able to call the fourth quarter. And so look, we're still in very difficult economic times and uncertain times. But with the second quarter out of the way and with what we talked about improvement, particularly in a sequential sense, we just felt like I mean we're going to give it to you, you're going to make it up. So we might give the best guess we have. But John can give you more. John Morici : Yes look, I can't add much more to that. We've got now a couple good quarters behind us. We've seen stability kind of turning to improving trends. It's a good position to be in. We continue to see that into the third quarter. As Joe said, it's not great, but it's better than it has been from an overall economic standpoint. And so based on the order trends and kind of how things are looking, we felt comfortable about Q3 and translate that to total year as well. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. And just as a follow-up, are you guys taking any different approach to sort of like, sales either so from like a personnel perspective or a focus versus earlier in the year? I know sometimes you guys have sort of been ramping reps. And then that had sort of flatlined. So I just wanted to understand sort of like how you're thinking about that as we go into the balance of the year and sort of set up for 2024? Joseph Hogan : Elizabeth, I'd say our sales practices are consistent and dynamic in the same way, consistent in the sense of the number of salespeople we have, how we train those salespeople, how they go to market. We obviously offer different products in different areas. We split up orthodontics salespeople and general dentistry salespeople specifically because it's just a different kind of a call. So there's no I'd say, big change in the sense of how we go to market. And obviously, our iTero sales force works really closely with the Invisalign sales force and overlaps in some areas. But I might be missing your question, but there's no, I'd say, material changes going on from a sales as salespeople, a number of salespeople standpoint and specifically the way we approach the market. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay, thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Thanks for taking the questions. I got a couple of quick ones. One is well, actually kind of related. One is just related to the results, 1Q to 2Q and sort of your outlook for 3Q -- just sort of a yes or no question. Is it safe to say that you're kind of back to the usual seasonality you've seen historically, it's been a little volatile for the last couple of years, but it seems like we're setting the back in that routine. Is it safe to say that, that should be our base case approach going forward? John Morici : Well, I think what we see is in terms of our Q2 to Q3 guide, that is more of a typical seasonality flat to slightly up from Q2 to Q3. So that's -- that is that how that goes going forward. I think given the commentary that we've given just the overall macro uncertainty, we're not ready to say that. We're completely back to normal seasonality. But what we see in the short term here in the guidance that we gave that reflects that. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And then the second one would be on the Analyst Day. I mean, a couple of pieces there. One is, could you just what goes into the thought process that now is the right time to have the Analyst Day. As you say markets are still pretty uncertain. There's still some volatility, visibility is not fully back. So kind of what goes into that decision? And then related to that, the long-term guide, is that something you're going to be addressing just as we start thinking about modeling 2024 and going forward from there? Joseph Hogan : We usually do this about every two years, Michael. It is a really sophisticated algorithm we use to figure that out, but it's about every two years. And we think it's just about time for that, too, from the standpoint of just to reinitiate the investor base in the sense of where we're investing, how we see the marketplace. And just a good summary of a lot of the questions that have been asked. Michael Ryskin : Got it. Shirley Stacy : Yes, sorry. Is there one more question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Jason. Jason Bednar : Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions guys. I wanted to touch on a few things that stood out to us in the quarter. Maybe first, just the combination of a sequential increase in doctors you ship to plus higher utilization across all channels that you serve again, always good to see that combination come together. I know you don't provide the granularity anymore on doctor shipped across the U.S. or international markets. But -- just I guess, directionally, are you able to specify whether the increase in doctors is exclusive to China coming back online and expansion in APAC? Or did you see an increase in users in your North American channels and EMEA channels as well? John Morici : Yes, Jason, you're right. We don't give that level of detail, but we saw more doctors that we ship to in APAC related to China, as you said, and we saw it in other regions as well. So we are pleased with the number of doctors that we're shipping to. It's a reflection of our products. And what they want to do and then as well, being able to be up on a utilization basis is a good metric as well. Jason Bednar : Okay. I guess maybe just to follow-up there, John, real quick. Can you confirm whether or not you saw that increase in North America in Orthos or GPs or both? John Morici : Yes, we saw improvement for North America as well. Jason Bednar : Okay, all right. Great. And then I know we got some good details on some of your APAC markets, including China. But I guess wondering if you can talk about just monthly cadence of U.S. trends throughout the quarter and maybe even here in July. Some of the work we've done shows that there's maybe a bit more mix trends in April and June, May was pretty strong. I guess just wondering how that drives what you were seeing in your case shipment trends throughout the quarter? And then same question for EMEA, if you could elaborate just on how the quarter unfolded in that region? Thank you. John Morici : Yes. We're really not giving -- like -- I don't really want to get into the month-by-month activity. I think the results kind of show where they were, Jason, and then it also kind of reflects what we've been able to give from a guidance standpoint as well. But without getting into months by country and region and so on, it gets a little difficult to give that level of detail. But I think the results that we have for Q2 and what we've talked about how the sequential improvement and what we were able to see on a quarter-over-quarter basis and what it means for the guidance kind of speak to that. Jason Bednar : Okay, fair enough. Thanks. John Morici : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brandon Couillard : Hey thanks guys. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Brandon. Brandon Couillard : You mentioned scanner ASPs as a bad guy in terms of segment gross margin sequentially and year-over-year. Joe, could you just talk about the competitive environment and whether you're seeing pricing pressure intensifying, just your macro view there would be helpful. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : Yes, I wouldn't call it, a bad guy. I think what we tried to communicate was, we have a mix in there that's from a price standpoint. We feel good about our upper-end product line and the prices we're able to get for a 5D Plus and 5D Flex and it's a premier scanner in the marketplace. As you mentioned before and as you know, I mean, there's a certain sensitivity in the marketplace about these kind of capital expenditures in a dental office when a lot of the economics are challenged right now in the orthodontic and in dental side. So we see that. But despite that, you could see we turned really good numbers around. Our CPOs help us to fight on the lower end. CPOs are the certified preowned that allow us to go down market if we have to. And obviously, when you look at the marketplace, it's pretty -- if you have the -- what we would call the confocal imaging scanners, like that we lead with. And then there's products like Metadata whatever they try to take the low end and whatever. But we feel -- I feel good about our capability, our value proposition, and I think our numbers reflect that this quarter and in the past too. So I'm not saying there's not a competitive environment. I just feel we have a superior product line, and then we have a good value stream that we offer from a standpoint of the integration with Invisalign through iTero and then [indiscernible]. Brandon Couillard : Great. And John, you mentioned freight costs coming down year-over-year as a positive tailwind to gross margins. I think first time in a while. I think that's been the case. Do you expect that to be sustainable over the next several quarters? And any color on how we should about gross margins in the second half of the year relative to 2Q base? John Morici : I think it's a reflection of just it's freight, but maybe some of the material costs and others that as we manage things, manage our business and we see less inflationary pressure from kind of the raw material/freight and other inputs. And we're always driving productivity. We're always trying to be improve our productivity. We saw that in some of our gross margin improvements, both for clear aligner and the scanner and services. And we'll work to continue to manage it. But seeing some of those pricing pressures, the input pricing pressure come down that continues. Brandon Couillard : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now hand the call back over to Shirley Stacy for closing remarks. Shirley Stacy : Thank you, everyone, and thank you again for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you at any financial conferences and industry meetings. And as Joe mentioned, Align is hosting its 2023 Investor Day, September 6 in Las Vegas. For more information, please visit our Investor Relations page on aligntech.com. Or if you have any questions, please contact Investor Relations. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, with Align Technologies. You may begin. Shirley Stacy : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, president and CEO, and John Morici, CFO. We issued third quarter 2023 financial results today via Businesswire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately one month. As a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events, products and outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available on our website and at sec.gov. Actual results may vary significantly and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. We have posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations, including our gap to non-GAAP reconciliation if applicable, and our third quarter 2023 conference call slides on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detail. Note as of Q3, DSP touch-up cases and associated revenues have been reclassified to the non-comprehensive clear Aligner segment and are now reflected in our reported clear Aligner case volumes, revenues and business metrics. Prior to this quarter, they were not reported in the non-case category. Unless otherwise stated all metrics include DSP touch up cases in reported clear Aligner volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align technologies President and CEO Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. On our call today I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Liners. Jon will provide more detail on our Q3 financial performance and comment on our views for the remainder of the year. Following that, we'll come back and summarize a few key points and we'll take questions. Our third quarter results reflect lower than expected demand in a more difficult macro environment than we experienced in the first half of 2023. Dental practices and industry research firms have reported deteriorating trends, including decreased patient visits and increased patient cancellations, along with fewer orthodontic case starts overall, especially among adult patients. The September Gauge report, which reflect more than 1200 North American Orthopactices shows deceleration for orthodontic treatment, and new orthodontic patient appointments were down 8.7% year over year, and ortho case starts were down 6.9% year over year, the biggest decrease in over a year. Despite these headwinds, total Q3 worldwide revenues of 960 million were up 7.8% year over year, with growth across all regions. For Q3, we had record clear liner shipments to teenage and younger patients, which increased 10% sequentially, and 8.4% year over year, driven by continued strength from iInvisalign First. Q3 year over year revenue growth also reflects improvement in APAC, offset by more pronounced summer seasonality in EMEA and North America. Our Q3 systems and services revenues were up 4.9% year over year despite continued challenges for capital equipment, primarily due to higher iTero scanner volumes in the Americas and APAC regions, reflecting certified preowned or what we call CPO sales, scanner, leasing and rental programs, as well as increased services revenue. Q3 systems and services revenues were down sequentially, primarily due to a weaker capital equipment cycle, as well as lower non-systems revenues. This was partially offset by higher scanner volumes in the Americas, reflecting an increased mix of iTero 5D plus scanners, including more trade in trade ups for DSO customer in Q3. Q3 non-case revenues were up 13.5% year over year, primarily due to continued growth from Vivera retainers and increased adoption of Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP, our monthly subscription based clear liner program, which includes retainers, low stage touchup and clear liner treatment. For Q3, we shipped over 19,000 DSP touchup cases, primarily in North America, an increase of more than 70% year over year from Q3 '22. DSP continues to be well received by our customers and is currently available in the US, Canada, Iberia and the Nordics. We are excited about the DSP is proving helpful to doctors and their patients. We're continuing to expand the program in EMEA and with certain DSO partners in Q4. For Q3, total clear aligner volumes were down 3.3% sequentially and up 2.3% year over year, primarily reflecting weaker than expected demand for orthodontic treatment, especially for adult patients. As I said earlier, despite soft consumer trends, our teen and younger patient business was strong across all regions, up both sequentially and year over year, primarily due to continued adoption of invisalign first for kids as young as six years old. In terms of invisalign submitters, the total number of doctors shipped for Q3 increased sequentially to approximately 85.2 thousand doctors, the highest number in two years, driven by the Americas and APAC regions. From a channel perspective, orthodontist submitters were up year over year, especially from doctors submitting teenage cases, offset by fewer GP dentists year over year, particularly in the Americas. On a geographic basis, Q3 clear aligner volumes reflect a sequential increase in invisalign shipments from the APAC and Latin American regions, as well as North American Invisalign teenage cases, this is offset by lower volume and more pronounced softness from summer seasonality in EMEA and North America, primarily invisalign adult cases. For the America's invisalign case volume, Q3 '23 was down sequentially, primarily due to lower invisalign adult shipments in the GP channel and slightly down year over year. Q3 '23 clear aligner volumes reflect increased submitters in the Ortho channel, with an increase in teen and younger case starts driven by momentum from invisalign first. This is reflected in the September Gauge data, which shows an invisalign orthostart performed better than wires and brackets and other clear liners. In North America, adoption of invisalign comprehensive three and three product drove sequential volume growth in Q3 '23. Invisalign DSP touchup cases in North America also drove growth sequentially year over year. For a EMEA [ph] Q3 Three clear liner volumes were down sequentially, primarily from the impact of Q3 summer seasonality when doctors offices are closed for summer vacations and more consumers are traveling. This was partially offset by sequential growth in Italy, Benelux, Turkey and the Middle East. Year over year clear liner volumes were up reflecting continued adoption of invisalign moderate, the comprehensive three and three product, as well as an increase in Teen Case starts, driven primarily by Invisalign first and our new Invisalign Teen Case packs. For APAC Q3'23 Clear Aligner volumes were up sequentially and up year over year reflecting improving trends in China as well as other key markets like India, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Thailand. Q3 APAC results also reflected increased invisalign submitters and higher utilization, especially for teen patients driven by growth from invisalign first in the Orthodontic channel during our typically strong teen season in China. Q3 APAC results also reflect growth in a GP channel with increased invisalign submitters and higher utilization sequentially and year over year. During Q3, we continue the rollout of Invisalign comprehensive three and three product in APAC most recently launched in China. Invisalign comprehensive three and three is also available in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan and India. We are pleased with the adoption of the three and three product in APAC, where the majority of cases treated are comprehensive, allowing our doctor customers more flexibility within the invisalign product portfolio. During the quarter, we also shipped to a record number of doctors in APAC, increasing both sequentially and year over year. Invisalign is the most trusted brand in the orthodontic industry globally, and it's important that we continue to create demand for invisalign clear aligners, especially given the macroeconomic pressures on doctors and their patients. In Q3- three, we delivered 11.1 billion impressions and had 27.7 million visits to our websites globally. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents and teens about the benefits of the invisalign brand, we continue to invest and create campaigns in top media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, WeChat and Dillion across markets. The underlying market opportunity for clear liner of treatment, especially for teens and kids, remains huge and significantly underpenetrated. We know invisalign clear liner of treatment is faster and more effective than Braces [ph] yet the vast majority of orthodontic cases are still treated using brackets and wires. Differentiation is key to increasing invisalign share of the orthodontic case starts, especially among teens and their parents. We are continuing to differentiate through novel campaigns such as our new Invis is Drama Free campaign ., which uses humor to juxtapose the significant benefits of invisalign treatment over metal braces. Similarly, to differentiate invisalign treatment for adults, we launched new campaigns globally using powerful patient stories that share how important a smile is and how invisalign treatment increases self confidence that transforms lives. Reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents also requires the right engagement through invisalign influencers and creator centric campaigns, which delivered 5.8 billion impressions in the Americas in Q3. Creators such as Michael Simoneau, Jalen Hall, NFL player Darren Warren and also Leilani Green showed their results and why they chose to transform their smiles with invisalign aligners. In the EMEA [ph] region, we partnered with Influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms including TikTok and Meta, and launched our Global Consumer Campaign for teens and parents of teens, highlighting the benefits of invisalign treatment versus braces. In Germany, we continue to see positive engagement with our patient testimonial campaigns launched in the previous quarter. Our consumer campaigns delivered more than 1.4 billion media impressions and 6.9 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 3.9 billion impressions and 11.9 million visitors to our websites in the quarter. We expanded our reach in Japan and India via Meta and YouTube, and partnered with key Influencers to reach consumers across social media. We saw increased brand interest from consumers, as evidenced by an over 800% increase in unique visitors to our website in India and 135% increase in Japan. Finally, digital tools such as My Invisalign Consumer and Patient app continue to increase with 3.4 million downloads to date and over 367,000 monthly active users, representing a 19% year over year growth. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks Joe. Now for our Q3 '23 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $960.2 million, down 4.2% from the prior quarter and up 7.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q3 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million, or approximately 0.3% sequentially and favorably impacted by approximately $4.2 million year over year, or approximately 0.4%. For clear aligners, Q3 revenues of $794.9 million were down 4.5% sequentially, primarily from lower volumes and lower ASPs. On a year over year basis, Q3 clear aligner revenues were up 8.5%, primarily due to higher ASPs, higher volumes and higher non case revenues. For Q3 invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year over year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect larger discounts, product shift, mix shift to lower priced products and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners. On a year over year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners and price increases, partially offset by larger discounts and unfavorable product mix shift. For Q3 invisalign ASPs for non-comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year over year. On a sequential basis the decrease in ASPs reflects larger discounts, higher sales credits, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by higher additional liners and favorable foreign exchange. On a year over year basis, the increase in non-comprehensive ASPs reflects price increases, higher additional aligners and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by product mix shift. In Q1 '23 we launched the invisalign comprehensive Three and Three product. The Three and Three configuration offers our doctor customers invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional liners included within three years of the treatment end date, instead of unlimited additional liners within five years of the treatment end date. At the 2022 Invisalign comprehensive product price, Invisalign comprehensive Three and Three product is available in North America and in certain markets in EMEA and APAC, most recently launching in China, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign comprehensive Three and Three product and anticipate it will continue to increase, providing doctors the flexibility they want and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product. As we begin to ship more additional aligners for comprehensive Three and Three products, we expect to see an ASB benefit. As revenues from subscriptions, retainers and other ancillary products continue to grow globally some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be a more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy. Q3 '23 clear aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $2 million, or approximately 0.3% sequentially. On a year over year basis clear aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.8 million, or approximately 0.5%. Clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $14.1 million, or up 1.1% sequentially and up $116 million or up 9.9% year over year, and will be recognized as the additional liners are shipped. Q3 '23 systems and service revenues of $165.3 million were down 2.5% sequentially, mostly due to unfavorable ASPs and lower revenues from our certified preowned program, partially offset by higher scanner volume and higher services revenues. On a year over year basis, Q3 '23 systems and services revenue were up 4.9% due to higher scanner volume, higher services revenue from our larger base of scanners sold, and higher revenues from our certified preowned and leasing rental programs, partially offset by unfavorable ASPs. Q3 '23 systems and services revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $0.7 million, or approximately 0.4% sequentially. On a year over year basis system and services revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $0.4 million, or approximately 0.3%. Systems and services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $4.4 million, or 1.6% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in the deferral of service revenues included with scanner purchases and essentially flat or up slightly to 0.1 million or 0.1% year over year. Services deferred revenues will be recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increase the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade ins and purchase certified pre owned scanners in certain markets. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. Moving on to gross margin, third quarter overall gross margin was 69.1%, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 0.5 points year over year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.1 point on a sequential basis, and favorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.1 point on a year over year basis. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 70.7%, down 1.7 points sequentially, primarily from higher manufacturing spend and a higher mix of additional aligner volume and lower ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was roughly flat year over year, primarily due to increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland, partially offset by higher ASPs. Systems and services gross margin for the third quarter was 61%, down 4.1 points sequentially, primarily from lower ASPs, partially offset by favorable manufacturing variances, lower service and freight costs, and higher services revenues. Systems and services gross margin for the third quarter was down 2.3 points year over year, primarily from lower ASPs, partially offset by favorable manufacturing variances, lower service and freight costs, favorable foreign exchange, and higher service revenues. Q3 '23 operating expenses were $496.7 million, down sequentially 8.3% and up 4.5% year over year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $44.9 million, primarily from lower consumer marketing spend and lower incentive compensation. Year over year, operating expenses increased by $21.2 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation in our continued investments in sales and R&D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing, as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $458.2 million, down 9.3% sequentially and up 3.3% year over year. Our third quarter operating income of $166.3 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.3%, up 0.1 points sequentially and up 1.2 points year over year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.3 points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange. The year over year increase in operating margin is primarily attributable to operating leverage, partially offset by investments in our go to market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.1 point. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating margin for the third quarter was 21.8%, up 0.5 points sequentially and up 1.6 points year over year. Interest and other income expense net for the third quarter was a loss of $4.2 million, compared to a loss of $0.3 million in the second quarter and a loss of $21 million in the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.1% lower than the second quarter effective tax rate of 34.8%, and lower than the third quarter effective tax rate of 40.7% of the prior year. The third quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the second quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to the application of newly issued tax guidance and lower US taxes on foreign earnings in Q3. As a reminder, in Q4 '22, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly periods in 2022 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Third quarter net income per diluted share was $1.58, up sequentially $0.12 [ph] and up $0.65 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.08 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.05 on a year over year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.14 for the third quarter, down $0.08 sequentially and up $0.51 year over year. Note that the prior year 2022 non-GAAP net income and prior year 2022 non-GAAP EPS reflects the Q4 '22 change in our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2023, cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities were $1,301.9 billion [ph] up sequentially, $268.1 million, and up $160.9 million year over year. Of our $1.3 billion dollar balance, 381 million was held in the US and $920.6 million was held by our international entities. Q3 accounts receivable balance was $904.2 million down sequentially, our overall day sales outstanding was 84 days, up approximately three days sequentially and down approximately two days as compared to Q3 last year. Cash flow from our operations for the third quarter was $287.2 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $21.6 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures amounted to $265.6 million. Now, turning to our fourth quarter outlook. For Q4 '23, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our worldwide revenue to be in the range of $920 to $940 million down sequentially from Q3 of '23. We expect both clear aligner and systems and services revenues to be down sequentially, reflecting a more challenging macro environment for doctors and patients with fewer orthodontic case starts overall unfavorable foreign exchange given the strengthening of the US dollar against key currencies and longer sales cycles for capital equipment purchases. For our clear aligner business, we expect clear aligner teen volume to be seasonally lower in Q4 of '23, and we don't anticipate improvement in adult volumes. For Q4 '23, we also expect clear aligner ASPs to be down sequentially, primarily due to the strengthening US dollar. For our systems and services business, we anticipate increasing headwinds for macro uncertainty and potential supply issues related to the war in the Middle East. We expect our Q4 '23 GAAP operating margin to be down sequentially from Q3 of '23 due to restructuring primarily related to severance as we adjust headcount for this environment. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating margin to be up sequentially from Q3 of '23. During Q1 '23, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2023 stock repurchase program. During Q4 '23, we expect to repurchase up to $250 million of our common stock through either or a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. For full year 2023, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 worldwide revenue to be in the range of $3.83 billion to $3.85 billion. We also expect our full year 2023 GAAP operating margin to be roughly one point lower than 2022 and our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 21%. For 2023, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued international expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. While our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook reflect weaker consumer sentiment and increased headwinds including foreign exchange, Align is in a unique position to continue driving the digital revolution in the dental industry to help doctors transform and grow their practices with invisalign clear aligners, Itero Scanners and Align digital platform. We are very excited about the recent innovations developed to further revolutionize digital treatment planning for Orthodontics and also restore to dentistry by providing doctors with greater flexibility, real time treatment plan modification capabilities, and digital solutions to help improve practice productivity and patient experience, which are even more important to our customers in the current environment. This includes clincheck live update for 3D controls invisalign practice App, invisalign personal plan or IPP, Invisalign Smile Architect, Itero exocad [ph] connector Invisalign Outcome Simulator pro and invisalign virtual Care AI software. These digital tools are continuing to gain adoption and help doctors gain efficiencies. In Q3 Clincheck Live Update was used by 41,000 doctors on more than 560,000 cases, reducing time spent and modifying treatment by 21%. Invisalign Practice app is now actively used by about 87,000 doctors, with over 5.2 million photos uploaded during the quarter via the Practice app. In addition, we will launch Invisalign Pallet expander or IPE system in Canada this quarter. IP is our first direct printed orthodontic device that provides a safe, comfortable, and clinically effective alternative to metal paddled, expanders and boosts our market opportunity in the teen market by addressing a portion of cases we couldn't otherwise treat without IPE. In summary, we're committed to balancing our investments in near and long term growth drivers while delivering improved operating margin as we navigate one of the most challenging operating environments in recent history with increasing macroeconomic pressure on doctors and their patients, we have an enormous opportunity to continue driving adoption of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry and a responsibility to optimize our investments for the current environment. Before turning the call over for questions, I'd like to address the war in the Middle East and our Itero scanner business. The situation continues to evolve and is very fluid. We are monitoring developments closely. Our singular focus at this stage is on the safety and security of our employees and their families and our doctors and their staff and patients. Align offices and scanner manufacturing facility in Israel are currently open and operating. While we hope the situation will improve, we're preparing mitigation plans to ensure business continuity and we'll update our customers and other stakeholders as needed. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Your question, please. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Jason. Operator : Jason, you might have your phone on mute. Shirley Stacy : Operator, you want to go to the next question? Operator : Certainly. Shirley Stacy : And we'll come back. Operator : Certainly. One moment. And our next question comes in line Brandon Vazquez from William Blair. Your question, please. Brandon Vazquez : Hey, everyone, thanks for taking the question. On the first one, maybe can we just start a little bit? It sounds like macro, and given the data that you guys were talking about is probably getting a little worse into the end of the year. Maybe just talk about how that kind of trended through the quarter, how we're trending now. I think what a lot of us are trying to get our head around is what's the direction of macro in the dental space going into the end of the year and into 2024, especially as you look at kind of the consumer and then CapEx on scanners. So how are you guys seeing that from your end right now? Joseph Hogan : When you look at the fourth quarter and the way we have done our forecast overall, we felt great about teens in the third quarter and what we reported to, but adults were really highly affected. And when you run through the fourth quarter, it's primarily an adult season for us. And China is a big teen season in the third quarter, too. When you look at the gauge data for September and what we see in October so far, and even some of the consumer profiles around how they're feeling about their finances and all, we've basically just projected what we've seen in September forward to the fourth quarter. Brandon Vazquez : Okay. And then maybe as a follow up on the teen side, it sounds like the Ortho channel, based off the market data you have, is that teens are declining year over year. But you guys, or at least sequentially, you guys are up both, it looks like. So are you guys taking share within the teen market? It's a little bit of a funny dynamic because I think earlier this year, as the Ortho channel got a little weaker, they were going to wires and brackets. But it seems like now you're taking share. How durable is that and what are you guys kind of seeing that's driving that in the underlying market? Thanks. Joseph Hogan : We were happy to see that change and the gauge data that showed wires and brackets going down and competitive aligners going down and us going up. But you can't draw a line through one dot. We feel good again about the technology and all that. We're presenting the Efficiencies and all we're offering to Orthodontists, and we think that's a good stimulant in that sense. But right now, we're going to have to take this thing quarter to quarter. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Joseph Hogan : Hi, Jason. Operator : Jason, we're still not hearing you. Shall I move on? Yes, please. Certainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your question, please. Operator : Mr. Johnson, your line is open. One moment - certainly as we go to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Your question, please. Jon Block : Hey, guys, can you hear me okay? Joseph Hogan : Hey, John. Just fine. Jon Block : All right, so far so good. Maybe a couple of questions. I'll start right now, you just seem highly tethered to the consumer. But in '24, you've got some incrementals, right? You just launched IP in Canada. You've got remote monitoring. We think maybe you have a new scanner. So just like your thoughts on the ability for the company to manufacture more of your own growth in 2024, and any commitment to grow revenues year over year in '24. And where I'm going with that is even the revised guidance you'll grow year over year in 2H '23. But if I annualize your 4Q number and just sort of run rate that you arguably land down year over year with call it a more dynamic set of innovation. So not asking for a number, but clearly things are moving around. And how do we think about what that means again, to manufacture your own growth in '24 and any commitment to have positive revenue growth in '24? Joseph Hogan : Hey, John, it's a good question that's one of the things we talk about obviously here is with what we presented at the Investors conference and the new technology that we're offering, those are areas that we can really expand what we call our penetration in the marketplace and control a certain amount of our destiny. I think you know as well as know we can't fight a market from a down standpoint in the sense of that that won't affect us in some way. I would throw DSP into that whole question also because you see the continued growth in DSP and I'd say a business model change. And so those kinds of things, I feel like we can drive more demand in the marketplace as we get into 2024. I just can't preclude what that consumer sentiment is going to look like at that point in time, but it certainly gives us also the efficiency gains that we show through the software that I just talked about in my script, too, with different orthodontists that seem to be taking hold and you pick up in your surveys also, John. So we do feel good about that. It's just the uncertainty of this marketplace and it obviously surprised us coming out of the third quarter. We're going to have to get through this quarter, and as we go into 2024, we can be more specific about what we think, what that opportunity is. Jon Block : Okay, that was very helpful. And then maybe just this might build on Brandon's question earlier, but when you guys guide, you've got almost half the quarter in the bag. So clearly things changed, notably in the last seven weeks of the third quarter. I know you guys called out Gage's September data. Joe, you referenced the October what was the 3Q deviation? I mean seems like it was largely North America. And EMEA, did APAC perform as expected, if you could answer that. And then I guess where I'm struggling is I think we all know it's not a robust consumer out there and that narrative around soft landing or not, if that holds true, but it doesn't seem like things changed all that dramatically in the last seven weeks. And so anything you can give Joe to elaborate, because clearly the exit rate in the quarter was very different than the way things started. Thank you. Joseph Hogan : Yeah. John, you know, third quarter is I call, our most non linear quarter, and it's the most difficult to predict. And it's because it know three major components to it. One is obviously the seasonality of our European business because of the vacation base or whatever, and the way that comes back is not always consistent. And in this case, it did not come back in the way that we had hoped it would. Secondly is you count on a big China teen market. And we did well in China, I feel, from a growth standpoint, but it wasn't to a point that it could offset a slower rebound overall from a European standpoint. And the last thing is, in the United States, that lack of adult cases I mean, we did well on teen that lack of adult cases when we went into September was really felt. And so it's those three key variables that I think, is how we came out of this differently than what we anticipated as we went in. Jon Block : Thanks, guys. Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI your question, please. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. My question is so if we think about obviously we're talking about consumer weakness and sort of the cyclicalness of the business. If we think about sort of the headcount reduction and the SG&A spend can you help us parse out a little bit more about the cuts and how to think about how to sort of preserve margin as sort of we're seeing weaker demand and then how you need to invest again on the upcycle in order to continue to push penetration in what's obviously a very largely underpenetrated market over a longer period. John Morici : Hey, Elizabeth, this is John. So as we go through our planning process, like we do every year, we're prioritizing investments that we can continue to invest to be able to help grow the business. So we look at some R&D and some of the investments we make. We have a lot of new products coming to market, as we've talked about at Investor Day. We want to preserve that flow of products. We want to make sure we're properly reaching our customers so we prioritize some of the sales and go to market activities that we have around that. But we're looking at all parts of the business to say, okay, what can we adjust? What can we make adjustments to still deliver on our priorities that we have as a business to help try to grow with the means that we've seen, but then also deliver the profitability and being able to see this margin accretion. We've seen that all year as we've gone through. And essentially what we're calling for in the fourth quarter is the continuation of that margin accretion. And that's just through a combination of just looking at those investments and making sure that we properly invest for the future. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. And maybe as a follow up, obviously I have hope for the safety of all of your employees in Israel. Can you talk about sort of the capacity of that organization if sort of things stay as they are? Is that something where you're sort of drawing down inventory elsewhere, not able to produce, if any, more details you could provide on that obviously unfortunate situation. John Morici : Back to know we're producing over there right now. I don't give you this. It's a reasonable amount of capacity. I've had other businesses in Israel at times like this, too. Not this bad. But in those situations, I feel like where it is now, we can manage it. As we talked about in the script, if the things get worse, the war over there. We can't guarantee what we have. But we have a terrific team there, very dedicated team. They're working both sides of the angle right now. We're bringing in materials. We're converting those materials, we're shipping those out. So the business is operating fine right now, but we have to just wait in the upcoming weeks and see what develops on their homeland. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Yeah, thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Wright from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Aaron Wright : Great, thanks. I'm curious if you could break down a little bit the key components of the teen case volume trend you saw in the quarter by geography, specifically in the Americas region, and what's driving that. And I think you mentioned, like, invisalign first and how we should be thinking about visibility across that patient cohort just given you have some more inherent control over maybe that segment in this sort of environment. And then second part of my question is just more of a clarification, I guess, in terms of the fourth quarter guidance. Does it specifically assume that there's a further deterioration in the macro or just a continuation of what you saw in this September experience? And I just want to understand the buffers I guess you have in that expectation at this point. Thanks. Joseph Hogan : As far as the teenage patients, again, we're really pleased with the growth that we saw in teens, and it's a very important teen season. I think the teens perform extremely well. We saw strength across every geography. We saw in Europe. We saw in North America. We also saw it in China. I think our portfolio helps us a lot invisalign first. We led with that. Remember, those are patients that are anywhere between six and ten years old. We really have terrific results in those areas, but also with permanent dentition. We saw some good growth, too. So overall, I feel like it's a strong indication in the sense that we're hitting the dot, in the sense of where we want to with those specific consumers, and through the advertising programs that I talked about and also through our digital platform and then the specific products, like invisalign first and then IPE that rolls into Canada. And then more broadly as we move into 2024. John Morici : And just on the fourth quarter, Aaron really taking what we see in September continues into October, and we assume that things don't get better than what we saw in September. So it's a tough macro environment. There's less orthodontic case starts, lower patient traffic. And so we factor in all those based on what we saw, and that's what our projection is for. Q four. Aaron Wright : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your question, please. Jeff, I don't know if you're on a speaker phone, but if you could lift the handset if that were the case. Still not hearing anything from Mr. Johnson. One moment for our next question .And our next question comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Your question, please. Still not hearing Jason? Shirley Stacy : That's strange. We certainly will follow up with both Jeff and Jason. Operator, do you mind just going to the next question, please? Operator : Certainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Nathan Rich : Great, thank you. Can you hear me okay? Joseph Hogan : Yes. Nathan Rich : Okay, great. Joe, you mentioned the focus on delivering improved operating margins and you guided to non GAAP margins being up sequentially in the fourth quarter despite the reduction in the revenue guidance. I guess as we think about the business going forward, should we think about that four Q margin as a good base level for the business even in an uncertain demand environment? And are there additional actions you can take on the cost side to give yourself some additional cushion for margins going forward? Joseph Hogan : You've been watching us long enough to know that each of our quarters have a certain personality in the sense of the kind of operating profit we deliver. You can see in the fourth quarter that we feel good about where we stand right now and the levers that we can pull in order to deliver the operating margin that John talked about. So \u2013 I think you know, more than anything, I want the investors to understand that while we have this uncertain environment, from a demand standpoint, we're going to be responsible on cost. We'll invest in technology and we'll focus in those areas, but we're always looking closely in the sense of where we can rationalize, also where we can prioritize in different areas that will help in that operating profit area. John, anything you want to add on that's? John Morici : So we'll see the benefit that we've seen all year to be able to see that operating margin improvement. But as Joe said, we're prioritizing our investments. We look at this time as we finalize our plan for next year. But we have got a lot of technology coming and we want to make sure that we're properly invested there as well as being able to deliver like we can on an margin basis. Nathan Rich : Okay, great. And if I could just ask a follow up on the 4Q guidance for clear liner volumes. I think you had said that you don't expect improvement in adult and had talked about, I guess, modeling what you saw in September through the fourth quarter. I guess how should we think about adult cases relative to the 381,000? I guess when we take that together, given how it sounds like September shaped up, should we expect a decline off of that 381 level in the fourth quarter for the adult cases specifically? Joseph Hogan : I think when you look at things, Nathan, like we said, teen showed up well in the third quarter. We're pleased with that. Seasonally comes down in the fourth quarter. And based on what we saw in September and so far in October, I think you would expect to see adults down as well. Nathan Rich : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jeffries. Your question, please. Brandon Couillard : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just a clarification, Joe or John on the adult trends and the weakness, is that predominantly in the US or is it about to extend outside the US as well? If you have any chance, you're willing to take a stab at some of the factors behind that and whether or not student loan repayments may be contributing to some of the [indiscernible] and sentiment in that customer base. Joseph Hogan : Remember, third quarter is a big teen quarter, but adults are obviously a large component of that. We saw that adult phenomenon in North America, but we saw it across each geography. Brandon Couillard : Okay, then just to follow up, John, on the fourth quarter, margins operating margins up with revs down sequentially, is that all coming from OpEx, or would you expect gross margins to bounce up sequentially as well? John Morici : When we talked about down sequentially on Op margin, that was on a GAAP basis. We have some of the restructuring and other things that include we expect sequential improvement on a non-GAAP basis from Q3 to Q4. And we didn't give specific gross margin guidance, but we're working to try to make sure that we work on our gross margin as well. But right now we've kind of given the guidance down to our margin. Brandon Couillard : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Ryskin from Bank of America. Your question, please. Mike Ryskin : Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I got a couple real quick here. First, hopefully you can hear me. First I want to ask on the right, sizing or some of the layoffs you discussed. I'm thinking back to 2020, sort of like peak COVID when everyone was panicking and some of your competitors or other players in the dental space announced some layoffs and you held fast and powered through it. And then the argument was that you saw it as being transient and you wanted to invest in growth and sort of be ready for the rebound. Just contrasting that with a decision to implement some cuts here. Does that mean anything in terms of your thoughts on the duration of the macro slowdown? Why, if this is just macro related and as you said, September slowed pretty suddenly, if there is a rebound, why not continue to invest given the balance sheet is strong, the free cash flows are strong, just sort of compare and contrast and lay out your thinking on that. Joseph Hogan : First of all, when you go back to 2020 that you referenced, and we did power through that personally, what I looked at that is I looked at that as not an economic issue. That was obviously a pandemic kind of an issue and I think I anticipated it have a clear beginning and a clear end. And so in that sense, I think it's easier to make that decision, whether that's right or wrong, with that kind of a thought process in mind. In this case, we're seeing unprecedented change from an economic standpoint. We're seeing consumer sentiment down. I mean, I'll have to go through all the economic data. You probably know this better than me, so there's a lot of uncertainty there. But I don't want to be misinterpreted that we're going to disadvantage this company in a rebound. No way. We're going to make sure that we're responsible in the sense of the resources and the restructuring that John talked about, too. We're going to make sure that we're well positioned in the key areas, too, that if we have a rebound, we'll be able to respond with the right kind of capacity and the right kind of product. So I feel like we're balancing that well right now. Mike Ryskin : Okay. All right. I appreciate that. And then second point, sort of piggybacking on I think it was Block's question earlier. Not going to ask you for the specifics on '24, but just thinking about this year. The price you took earlier this year certainly contributed to your revenue growth as we think forward to next year and your ability to take price again or potentially have to give price, given how much the macro has changed and how the demand dynamics have changed, how do you feel about pricing and products? Any opportunity to take that up again next year? Or on the flip side, are you potentially getting some pressure there where you might have to give a little bit? Joseph Hogan : Mike, I appreciate the question, but as far as price goes, we wouldn't make an announcement until our doctors really know in that sense, and we're still working through 2024. Mike Ryskin : Okay. All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Shirley Stacy for any further remarks. Shirley Stacy : Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining the call today. We look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings. If you have any questions, please follow up with Investor Relations Team and Jeff and Jason we certainly will get back to you after the call and speak on one and one Thanks everyone, have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.+",

Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO. We issued fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 1 month. As a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website and at sec.gov. Actual results may vary significantly, and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We have posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations, including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, if applicable, and our fourth quarter and full year 2023 conference call slides on our website under quarterly results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us.  On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, Systems, Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q4 financial performance and comment on our views for 2024. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.  I'm pleased to report fourth quarter results with better-than-expected revenues and earnings. As of the end of Q4, we achieved several major milestones, including 17 million Invisalign patients treated, including 4.7 million teens, plus 4 million Vivera Retainer cases and over 100,000 iTero scanners sold. And for the full year -- fiscal year 2023, total revenues exceeded our prior outlook, and we delivered fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating margin above 21%.  For Q4, total revenues were up 6.1% year-over-year, reflecting increased Systems and Services revenues. Strength in Clear Aligner volumes for teens and international doctors as well as continued growth from Invisalign touch-up cases, under our Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP. Our Q4 Systems and Services revenues were up year-over-year, primarily due to increased services, CAD/CAM and nonsystems revenues, including scanner leasing and rental programs and certified preowned scanner sales.  Q4 total Clear Aligner shipments were slightly lower year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner volumes were down for the Americas and EMEA regions and were up for the APAC region. For Q4, Clear Aligner shipments include approximately 20,000 Invisalign DSP touch-up cases, primarily in North America, an increase of more than 60% year-over-year from Q4 '22. DSP continues to be well received by our customers and is currently available in the U.S. and Canada, Iberia and Nordics and most recently, the U.K. We're excited that DSP is proving helpful to doctors and their patients as we continue to expand the program.  For fiscal 2023, total Invisalign DSP touch-up cases shipped were 73,000, up 85% year-over-year. For non-case revenues, Q4 was up 13.3% year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth from Vivera Retainers along with Invisalign DSP retainer revenues. On a sequential basis, Q4 total revenues were down slightly, 0.4%, primarily reflecting anticipated seasonally lower teens case starts, especially in the U.S. ortho channel and unfavorable foreign exchange offset somewhat by increased revenues from System and Services as well as an increase in Clear Aligner volume for adults and noncomprehensive cases and stronger volumes from Canada and the EMEA region.  Q4 total Aligner shipments were slightly lower sequentially. On a sequential basis, Clear Aligner volumes were down for the Americas and APAC regions and were up sequentially for the EMEA region. The December gauge practice analysis tool that collects and consolidates data from approximately 1,000 orthodontic practices across the U.S. and Canada reported year-over-year decline for new patients, total exams and total starts, particularly among teens and kids. It also shows a year-over-year decline for wires and brackets and total Clear Aligner starts with Invisalign case starts better than the Clear Aligner brand.  And the teen segment for Q4, a 197,000 teens and younger patients started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligner Systems, up 6% year-over-year and were a record number of teen cases shipped compared to prior fourth quarters. Q4 teens starts were down sequentially, consistent with historical seasonality, primarily in China as well as seasonally fewer teen starts in North America compared to Q3.  For fiscal 2023, total Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and younger patients reached a total of 809,000 cases, up 8% compared to the prior year and made up 34% of total Clear Aligner shipments. During Q4, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the Invisalign Palatal Expander System, we call it IPE, Invisalign Palatal Expander for commercial availability in the United States. The FDA 510(k) clearance is for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens and adults. Full early intervention treatments such as Phase I or early interceptive treatment, makes up about 20% of the orthodontic case starts each year and is growing. Together with Invisalign First Aligners, IPEs provide doctors with a solution set to treat the most common skeletal, dental malocclusions in growing children. The addition of mandibular advancement features to Invisalign aligners also provides doctors with more options for treating skeletal, dental joint balances and bite correction and for their growing patients during their teenage years. Essentially, we now have an Invisalign digital treatment solution for every phase of treatment.  IPE is currently available on a limited basis in Canada and the United States, and we recently received regulatory clearance in Australia and New Zealand where we anticipate commercialization in Q2. We expect IPE to be available in other markets pending future applicable regulatory approvals.  We're also launching ClinCheck smile video, the next generation of In-Face digitalization with AI-assisted video that is expected to be available to all doctors who use the Invisalign Practice App and ClinCheck treatment planning software. This new tool is designed to help improve patients' understanding and of the confidence in Invisalign treatment and is based on iTero Intraoral Scanner and doctors ClinCheck plan for Invisalign treatment.  ClinCheck smile video simulates the doctor's ClinCheck treatment plan with a short video of a patient's face, and they talk and smile, which helps patients visualize their potential new smile and can lead to a higher patient treatment acceptance. We expect to roll out ClinCheck smile video in Q1 '24 in North America and EMEA, followed by APAC later in the year.  Before I turn the call over to John for our fourth quarter financial review, I want to share one more exciting news. Today, we introduced the latest innovation in the iTero family of inter-oral scanners. The iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner designed to meet the needs of doctors and their patients by offering smaller wand with unparalleled data capture capabilities for effortlessly scanning by clinical members. The iTero Lumina Inter-oral scanner is a breakthrough technology. With 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller wand that delivers faster scanning, higher accuracy and superior visualization for greater practice efficiency. iTero Lumina quickly, easily and accurately captures more data while delivering exceptionally scanned quality and photorealistic images that eliminate the need for inter-oral photos altogether.  Doctors can now scan at twice the speed with a wide field of capture, multi-angled scanning and large capture distance, meaning they can capture more dentition in greater detail throughout the scanning process. To date, Align has filed over 30 patent applications covering technology related to the iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner. I believe iTero Lumina has the potential to set a new standard of care for dental practices by simplifying the scanning of complex oral regions while offering superior chairside visualization and more comfortable experience for patients, especially kids. Initial doctor feedback has been very positive, noting that iTero Lumina scanner is much faster, clear, less invasive for their patients and the imaging and visualization translates to better communications and patient experience. The iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner is available now with orthodontic workflows and will be available in the second half of 2024 restorative workflows, although we expect that GP practices can benefit now from the new scanning technology. A global broadcast to unveil iTero Lumina and provide attendees with insights and detailed information from our iTero team and early customer users is planned for February 15. Registration will open on February 1 and the link has been provided in our financial slides as well as in today's press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $956.7 million, down 0.4% from the prior quarter and up 6.1% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q4 '23 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $12.8 million or approximately 1.3% sequentially and were favorably impacted by approximately $13.8 million year-over-year or approximately 1.5%. For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of $781.9 million were down 1.6% sequentially, primarily from lower volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were up 6.9% and primarily due to higher ASPs and non-case revenues slightly offset by lower volumes. For Q4, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, higher sales credits and higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, price increases and favorable impact from foreign exchange partially offset by higher discounts in product mix to lower ASP products. For Q4, ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflect the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher net revenue deferrals, partially offset by price increases and lower discounts.  On a year-over-year basis, the increase in ASPs reflect price increases, the impact from favorable foreign exchange and higher additional aligners, partially offset by a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher discounts. Last quarter, we announced about a 5% global price increase for some Invisalign products across most markets effective January 1, 2024. Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product is available in North America and certain markets in EMEA and APAC, most recently launching in China, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product and anticipate it will continue to increase, providing doctors the flexibility they want and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product. Q4 '23 Clear Aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $10.7 million or approximately 1.4% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $12 million or approximately 1.6%. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $14.9 million or 1.2% sequentially and $74.6 million or up 6.1% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q4 '23 Systems and Services revenues of $174.8 million were up 5.8% sequentially primarily due to higher ASPs and an increase in CAD/CAM and services revenue, partially offset by lower volumes and were up 2.9% year-over-year, primarily due to higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and increased nonsystem revenues related to our CPO and leasing rental programs mostly offset by lower ASPs and scanner volume.  CAD/CAM and services revenues for Q4 represent approximately 50% of our Systems and Services business. Q4 '23 Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.1 million or approximately 1.2% sequential. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenue were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.9 million or approximately 1.1%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet were down $4.3 million or 1.6% sequentially and down $13.1 million or 4.8% year-over-year, primarily due to the recognition of services revenue which is recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins and purchase certified preowned scanners in certain markets. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold.  Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 70%, up 0.9 points sequentially and up 1.5 points year-over-year. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 70.5% up 0.9 points sequentially and up 1.2 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.4 points sequentially and favorably impacted by approximately 0.4 points on a year-over-year basis.  Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.1% up 0.4 points sequentially primarily due to lower manufacturing spend, partially offset by higher freight costs. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 0.3 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher manufacturing spend and freight costs.  Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.8%, up 3.8 points sequentially due to higher ASPs, partially offset by higher service and freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 6 points year-over-year due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower ASPs. Before I go into the details, I want to note that during Q4 '23, we incurred a total of $14 million of restructuring and other charges, primarily related to post-employment benefits. Q4 operating expenses were $498 million, roughly flat sequentially and down 1.4 points year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly due -- primarily due to restructuring and other charges, offset by lower employee compensation. Year-over-year operating expenses decreased by $7.1 million primarily due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs, partially offset by employee-related costs and slightly higher restructuring charges.  On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $446.7 million, down 2.5% sequentially and down 2.8% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating income of $171.5 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.9%, up 0.6 points sequentially and up 5.4 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.6 points sequentially primarily due to foreign exchange. The year-over-year increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage and proactively managing our costs as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.6 points.  On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, the amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisition, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 23.8%, up 2 points sequentially and up 5.5 points year-over-year.  Interest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was an income of $1.3 million compared to a loss of $4.2 million in the third quarter and income of $2.7 million in Q4 2022, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.3%, higher than the third quarter effective tax rate of 25.1% and lower than the fourth quarter effective tax rate of 63.8% in the prior year. The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to onetime benefit related to tax guidance issued in Q3, partially offset by lower U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in Q4.  As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Fourth quarter net income per share was $1.64, up sequentially $0.06 and up $1.10 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.07 on a sequential basis and favorably impacted by $0.08 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.42 for the fourth quarter up $0.28 sequentially and up $0.69 year-over-year.  Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities were $980.8 million, down sequentially $321.2 million and down $60.8 million year-over-year. Of our $980.8 million balance, $196.1 million was held in the U.S. and $784.7 million was held by our international entities. In October 2023, we purchased approximately 1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $190.56 per share through a $250 million Accelerated Share Repurchase. And in November and December 2023, we purchased approximately 466,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $214.81 per share through a $100 million open market purchase, both under Align's current $1 billion stock repurchase program. We have $650 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock under this stock repurchase program. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $903.4 million, slightly down sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, flat sequentially and year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $46.9 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $33.4 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $13.5 million. Now turning to our outlook. Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, we provide the following framework for Q1 and fiscal 2024. For Q1 2024, we expect our worldwide revenues to be in the range of $960 million to $980 million, up slightly from Q4 of 2023. We expect Clear Aligner volume and ASPs to be up slightly sequentially. We expect Systems and Services revenue to be down slightly sequentially, although less than the historical seasonal decline, given the launch of the iTero Lumina for ortho workflows in Q1 2024. We expect our Q1 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above Q1 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. For full year, we expect fiscal 2024 total revenues to be up mid-single digits over 2023. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner and Systems and Services revenues to grow year-over-year in the same approximate range as our 2024 total revenues. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner ASPs to be up slightly year-over-year primarily due to price increases and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a higher mix of noncomprehensive products, which have lower ASPs. We expect fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above the 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. We expect our investments in capital expenditures for the fiscal 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued expansion.  In summary, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results, and I am especially proud of our continued focused execution of our product road map and innovation pipeline. We are committed to delivering on our strategic growth drivers of international expansion, patient demand, orthodontist utilization and GP dentist treatment to extend our leadership in digital orthodontics and dentistry. I believe that the next wave of innovation that we are introducing into the market will further differentiate Align and allow us to continue to increase our share of the large untapped market opportunity of 22 million annual orthodontic case starts as well as an additional 600 million consumers who could benefit from a healthy, beautiful smile using Invisalign Clear Aligners. With that, I'll turn it back to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. In closing, while I'm pleased with our better-than-expected fourth quarter results and start to the year, I'm even more excited about Align innovation in 2024 and our next wave of growth drivers.  When I spoke to you about a year ago, I discussed the innovations that we are planning to bring to market that we continue to revolutionize the orthodontic and dental industry and scanning software and direct 3D printing. We are delivering on that promise. With the introduction of iTero Lumina powered by Multi-Direct Capture technology, we are pushing the boundaries of what inter-oral scanners can do. iTero Lumina is a combination of years of research and development to offer visualization capabilities that support doctors, clinical decisions while also enhancing their patients' comfort and overall treatment experiences. Building on more than 20 years of expertise in revolutionizing imaging technologies, the iTero Lumina scanner elevates the standard in digital scanning to achieve exceptional clinical outcomes and increased practice efficiency. The iTero scanner is at the forefront of digital dentistry.  With the closing of our acquisition of Cubicure, a pioneer of direct 3D printing solutions for polymer additive manufacturing, we will enable the next generation of 3D printed products, helping to create more unique configurations for aligners that are more sustainable and also efficient solutions. We also expect it to extend and scale our printing materials and manufacturing capabilities for our 3D printed product portfolio, which now includes the Invisalign Palate Expander System. And with the introduction of IPE, we have expanded the clinical applicability of the Invisalign system to nearly 100% of the orthodontic case starts. The ability to direct 3D print, IPE will eventually lead to other direct printed products with the goal of direct 3D printed Invisalign Clear Aligners, which we hope to achieve in the next couple of years.  As a company, Align has multifaceted competitive advantage, technology innovation, where we invest up to $300 million in R&D per year to bring in some of the most disruptive products in digital dentistry and orthodontics to the market in a highly regulated industry. A direct sales force that consists of 5,000 highly trained specialists, a doctor-centered model because we understand the importance of doctor-directed care, a $1 billion brand trusted by over 17 million patients worldwide and global scale and manufacturing to deliver millions of customized Clear Aligner parts every day. We are extremely pleased with our latest innovations and commercialization of products to better serve our doctors, customers and their patients. Our belief in the future business overall is unwavering.  Before we turn the call over to the operator, I want to address an important matter regarding DTC or direct to consumer Clear Aligners in our industry. Align has always believed that a doctor-centered model for orthodontic treatment is the safest for patients, and we're always looking for new and better ways to support doctors as they work to create better smiles for their patients.  Recent news regarding the bankruptcy of a DTC clear aligner company has led many consumers to reach out to Invisalign providers to address their unmet needs, including helping those DTC patients with incomplete treatments. To support these former DTC patients who are seeking help from Invisalign providers and practices, in Q4 we introduced a program in the U.S. and select other markets, offering up to a 50% off Invisalign case submission in Vivera Retention to help offset any additional cost to finish their treatment. We want to help everyone achieve a healthy beautiful smile and strongly recommend that individuals who are impacted by this matter seek the advice of a licensed orthodontist or dentist. Our concierge team is always available to answer questions and help connect consumers with Invisalign practices.  With that, I'll thank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Congrats on the quarter. I was wondering if you could walk us through the components of the mid-single-digit guide. I got -- for 2024. I understand what you said that like Systems and Services and Clear Aligners would be in the same range. I guess I'm just sort of thinking about like how to think about that. It seems like maybe it's like low single-digit ASP improvement and then sort of low to mid-single-digit case growth. Is that the right way to think about it? Like what else can you -- is there anything else you can sort of clarify on that? And sort of how do you expect at least currently, the sort of pacing of the year to progress. John Morici : Yes. Elizabeth, this is John. You haven't framed the right way. We're looking at the segments up mid-single digits and then ASPs because of the price increase. We have some offset due to some of the lower-stage products that we have, including the DSP touch-ups and so on, that you would expect then a little bit lower of ASP impact year-over-year. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. That makes sense. And then separately, how has the volume in sort of market in China been progressing across the fourth quarter and maybe into the first quarter so far as you can comment. Joseph Hogan : Elizabeth, it's Joe. We felt good about China last year. But remember, we had year-over-year comparisons that were really favorable because of the COVID shuts down over there last year. But overall, as we exited the year, we felt good about our performance there, and we feel good about as we move into 2024 about our competitive position there in -- a China market that I think is a little more predictable because it's not the overhead that we've seen with COVID over the last, really, several years. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. And sorry, maybe one last one for me. Can you just remind us the sort of 1Q dip in the operating margins and then how it sort of steps up across the year. I understand the guidance you gave for the first quarter of the year, but just why that first quarter has a sort of different perspective than the rest of the year? John Morici : Yes. So we wanted to give to prior year because in that prior year, when you start the year, you have certain expenses that you incur right at the beginning, payroll, taxes and other things that you incur initially some of the investments that you make that you then get leverage on as you go through the year. So it's similar to how we position things from last year in 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeffrey Johnson : Can you hear me out there? Shirley Stacy : Yes. We hear you fine. Jeffrey Johnson : John, maybe I want to -- I'll follow up on Elizabeth's margin question there beyond just the 1Q. Let's say, you hit your guidance this year on operating margin is up nominally from 2023 level. It'd be 3 years in a row kind of in that low to mid-21% range. I think pre-COVID you were up in the 25% range or so. What's it going to take to get those margins moving back towards those pre-COVID. You've taken price increases 2 years in a row. It feels like your R&D should be coming down a little bit. Obviously, with Cubicure and that, I know you're continuing to invest aggressively, but IPE is out, Lumina now out, things like that. So just help us understand when could we start to see a path back towards getting those margins maybe up a few points from where they've settled in the last few years? John Morici : Yes, Jeff, this is John. Really, when you start to get some of that volume leverage, we're positioned as having our manufacturing and the organization that we have that's really set to drive more growth. And once we get some of that volume leverage, we should see that benefit showing up in our numbers. And it's really what we saw as we went through the quarters last year where you see some of that volume benefit. You get that benefit as well when you go through the year, but really looking to try to drive as much volume as we can and you'll start to see some of that leverage that shows up in our numbers. Jeffrey Johnson : All right. Fair enough. And then, Joe, I think we've talked for many years now how iTero is carved out such a commanding, strong competitive position. You've sold a ton of iTeros over the last 5, 6 years or so. They're all probably getting, I don't know, close to their end of their useful life or so. Lumina for the first time feels like that kind of product with a better form factor, especially things like that, that could really cause some of these docs to say, I got to get rid of this big iTero and go back down to this much smaller one, and things like that, just things that would actually matter to the docs, and I'm sure the technology does this, too, I don't want to just put it on the size. But just thinking there, is this the kind of product that can finally kick off that multiyear upgrade strategy or path in iTero that we've kind of been waiting to see? Joseph Hogan : Jeff, the easy answer and the quick answer is yes. I mean it's just a brand-new platform. Now we set up -- I mentioned in my script about we have 100,000 units out there that we've sold so far. About 1/3 of those are 5D pluses, which are upgradable by just wand switch out. This is the way we've designed Lumina. And so that part's easy. Also, we've been really aggressively upgrading our installed base between E1 and E2 out there too to better position it for this kind of a move. So as we develop Lumina, we had exactly in mind what you just questioned, and we think we're in a good position to do that. Jeffrey Johnson : And if you switch out that wand from the 5 to the Lumina, there is a fee there, right? It's not like, hey, you bought this knowing that you could always upgrade at no charge to Lumina? Joseph Hogan : There's no charity here at Align. There will be a charge. Jeffrey Johnson : I like to hear that. God bless capitalism. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block : So Joe, maybe this one's for you. Video 1Q '24 IPE some markets today, but more in the common IPE should have longer term with team, docs might take a little bit of a wait-and-see approach. You talked about the new scanner. In your opinion, like is innovation are we seeing that in the '24 guide? Or is that more of like a ramp in the '25? And maybe even to take that a step further, John, for you, is there a way to sort of quantify out of that mid-single-digit revenue growth, what can you attribute to these new products coming on board in '24? I'm just trying to think about the impact of '24, is this more the ramp or the slope in the '25 for the innovation hitting? Joseph Hogan : Jon, I like the way you set that up. It's a ramp, it really is. But we feel good that we can play offense with these product lines. Now we still have to scale IPE. We have a great team that knows how to scale, and we'll get through that. Obviously, Lumina is a completely different set of outside of the computer itself. The wand itself is we feel good about the scale part of that as we sell through the marketplace. But overall, I think the way you described it is a ramp of this new technology really beginning in 2024 is a good foundation for that kind of thought process. Jonathan Block : And any way to quantify what's in there from the current guide or no? Is that just too difficult to tease out? Joseph Hogan : It really is just too... Jonathan Block : Okay. Okay. So second one is maybe a multipart. But just first on the CapEx, $100 million. I mean I was really surprised on how low that number was for this year. It's $400 million in '21, $300 million in '22 million, and I was maybe even more surprised when I think about the direct fabrication initiatives. So I know the slides say hoping to print Invisalign Clear Aligner \"next couple of years\". Do we still think retainers 2H '24, 1H '25? When do we feel like you proved it out, so to say? And do we start to see gross margin benefits from this as early as next year, turning accretive in 2025. And then admittedly just a jump to another question. For the guidance, can you just help us what's embedded in there? And I bring that up because we've seen this big move in U.S. consumer confidence. Europe still seems very choppy. So when we tie back to your guidance for the year, what are you extrapolating out, if you would, for the current macro? John Morici : I'll start with that, Jon, in terms of the current guidance. Look, we're looking at the environment that we're all in. It's not a great economy, most places, but it is more stable, and we're building off of that. And then as Joe said, we're doing things to play offense. New products that we have with Lumina and IPE and so on, which we think, can help us grow in this environment. Joseph Hogan : Jon, your question about the ramp up, the margin piece or part of that, what's that mean in 2025 or whatever. Look, we feel confident, and as you know from our discussions and our analyst presentation last year is 3D printing is foundationally, it can be less expensive as we scale. And so I mean, we'll start to see that come through as we scale that. But we need time to scale this. No one's ever had this polymer before that has a scale. No one's ever used the Cubicure system to the degree that we need to use it. Now we did this with 3D systems years ago because we basically scaled those systems through our team and team knows how to do that. I just can't tell you specifically within those in the next 1 to 3 years, with this being the first year, exactly when that really hits that hyperbolic side. John Morici : And just to close on the CapEx, those prior years, that was -- a lot of that was -- it was equipment. Of course, we are always adding capacity, but a lot of that was very much unique for buildings, adding buildings for our locations, manufacturing and so on. And when we add some of the capacity that we're adding for our manufacturing, it will go in existing buildings. So we don't have to add another building in most cases for this. So that's why the CapEx is where it is. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Brandon Vazquez : On the guidance, maybe one other way I wanted to ask you and see if I could tease out a little bit of color on what's assumed here. If I kind of go back to some old sequentials in the teen side, assuming that's a little less susceptible to macro headwinds, you can probably kind of get to a low single-digit volume growth, I think, for the entire Clear Aligner business already, but probably not even including some DSP. So is that -- am I thinking about this correctly that really out of adults on a year-over-year basis for full year '24, you're really assuming kind of flattish, maybe even down depending on how teens and some of the DSP cases are doing? John Morici : I would characterize it, Brandon, this is John, that both teen and adult are positive on a year-over-year basis, expect maybe adults to grow faster as we've seen compared to -- teens grow faster than adults as we've seen in the past, but I would expect both of them to be up and show our numbers that way. Brandon Vazquez : Okay. And then can you just reiterate maybe both for IPE and for Lumina exciting. It seems like they're going to ramp over the coming quarters. Are there any like key quarters and catalysts that we should think about that might take that up. You're talking about a ramp, but we get to the next level on the ramp on any of those when they go from maybe a limited launch to full market relief, anything like that? Joseph Hogan : Brandon, Joe again. On the Lumina side, remember, our restorative scanner for GPs comes out in the third quarter. But as like John indicated, we indicated, we feel we can sell that into the market now with the capabilities it has, but that will ramp in -- that will probably be more hinged to the regulatory approvals we have to get around the world. Right now, as I mentioned, we only have the United States and Canada and ANZ. Secondly, on IPE, it's the same thing is we're regulatory constrained. We still have to go through Europe. And as I mentioned, IPE will come out in the second quarter in Australia and also. And as we gave that, obviously, we'll be scaling IPE too and understanding the dynamics around that. So it's more of a ramp, as I mentioned a few calls ago than anything. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Jason Bednar : I'm going to pile on here on the guidance, just to focus there first. You mentioned noncomprehensive mix as being an offsetting factor to ASPs. I know you've got that DSP factor. I had thought maybe originally you were signaling adults growing better than teens, but doesn't seem like that's the case just given your comments there to Brandon. But I guess, regardless on adults, are you seeing this market getting its footing back, it sounds like it, but if you are, what's giving you the confidence? Or what are you seeing that kind of the day-to-day or month-to-month that's showing adults are coming back into the office for treatment. And then sorry to load a few in here, but should we expect this faster noncomprehensive mix also to have gross margin benefits for the year as well? I think it typically does, but I don't think we've gotten kind of a gross margin cadence outlook for '24. Joseph Hogan : Jason, I'll take the first part of your question and hand the rest off to John, is we feel we're on a more stable, I'd call it, economic platform than last year. And so the adult and teen question that you had is we expect that to carry through in 2024, as we indicated with our guidance, too. So when I look back, everybody has a clear vision backwards than forward, we look back to last year, a pretty unstable platform that we experienced for the year and the third quarter was a tough one in that sense. But I think we all see it right now, we have more confidence that at least we're dealing with stability from an economic standpoint in most parts of the world from what we see. John Morici : And on the noncomprehensive and gross margin questions and related to that. Look, as we have the mix that shifts through and you might have an ASP lower on some of the non-comp DSP and others that fall into that. Those are our highest gross margin products from a rate standpoint. So they're helpful for us as a business. It's really what that customer wants for him or her to run their practice and that's how we balance things out. But overall, we expect that we would see benefits in gross margin just like we're talking about op margin year-over-year benefits, we should see a benefit as well in gross margin. Jason Bednar : All right. That's helpful. And then for the follow-up here, I'll ask on teens. It does look like you're back to gaining share against brackets and wires. It looks like the kind of the second consecutive quarter of that. I'm curious if you could talk maybe bigger picture, what's changed to what you think has changed over the last 3 to 6 months versus maybe the 12-plus months that preceded that. But do you think the share gains you're seeing versus brackets and wires, does that have to do with changes you made to that Teen Guarantee program middle part of last year? Or are there other items at the practice level or associated with your go-to-market activities that are driving that shift? Joseph Hogan : You can always say that at Align, there's no single variable equations. And this is another one. The Teen Guarantee, we think is some of it, obviously, our portfolio and how we put that together, our DSP programs, the uniqueness of Invisalign First. All those things really help. And from an adult standpoint, with the firmer economic platform I talked about, I just think there's more confidence out there that we're starting to see lead through. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : I want to start with DSP kind of where you left off really successful, obviously, and you had great growth year-over-year for the whole year. But it's kind of moved in sort of like a step function. If I just look at the numbers, 6,000, 7,000, 9,000 and then you're kind of like an 11,000, 12,000 range. Now you're in the 18,000, 19,000, 20,000 range. Is there another step function coming next year? Is there -- could you dig into a little bit into what's driving that? And just sort of where do you see that going over the next couple of years? John Morici : Michael, this is John. I would say as we look to expand this out, it's been successful, every place that we've done, we've seen, as you said, North America starts with this. So you see some doctors start and then we have more and more doctors that sign up for the program. And then as the doctors sign up for the program, then they end up doing more and more volume with us. We've taken that same approach to other countries, and now we've introduced this in EMEA and other places. And the same thing happens. More and more doctors sign up for it. They start to see the benefits of it, and then they utilize it more. So it's really just a matter of now scaling this to other parts of the world because we find that this is really a nice way to supplement how a doctor wants to run their practice. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And then maybe a follow-up on a few questions that were asked on Cubicure and Direct 3D printing earlier. Really exciting technology that you unveiled late last year, and definitely see the opportunity. But could you help walk us through the road map a little bit sort of like what should we be looking for as sort of goal post 6 months out, a year out, 2 years out, just to sort of track progress and see how it -- see how it's progressing? Joseph Hogan : Michael, it's Joe again. I think the best way to describe it to you, it's -- like I said in my script, it's a 1- to 3-year journey. And obviously, we'll -- we know how to make these aligners now. We understand how to do it. It's just a scalability of resin in the Cubicure process and that takes time. And we'll obviously report on it quarter by quarter. So you really understand where we're going and what the hurdles are and what the opportunities are. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Maybe if I could just tweak that a little bit. Is there -- just help us understand, is there anything in terms of -- when you talk about scalability of the resin and the polymer, if you're looking at comprehensive, noncomprehensive, you talked about retainers and being able to put those. Is there anything in terms of your portfolio that makes some products more amenable or would be amenable earlier than others? Or is this just going to be all or nothing? Joseph Hogan : I mean obviously, the scale, you look at retainers first because units of one. And that's why you'd end up with comprehensive full cases in some way. And that's basically how we'll ramp. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : I wanted to ask on the Systems and Services revenue guidance for 2024. This looks low to me just given -- I think growth in '23 was basically flat, up slightly. With the Lumina launch, we thought it would maybe be up more than it was in 2023. So I don't know if you could just maybe elaborate on what you're expecting for that segment? John Morici : Nate, this is John. We're looking at, like we said, this year, you're kind of in that mid-single digits. We do have Lumina, which helps, but there's also unknowns about the macro economy. We were very pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter with doctors buying and actually doing better than what we had really guided to. So we're pleased with the performance of Q4, but we just want to make sure that as we ramp up Lumina that we're properly positioned there, and we'll update as we go along. Nathan Rich : Okay. Great. And then just going back to the margin cadence, I guess are there any either upfront or onetime costs associated with either the launches of Lumina or IPE that impact the margin in the early part of the year just as we think about cadence and sort of what the right baseline is. John Morici : There is some of that in Q1. We're ramping that up. So it's not a big, huge splash where there's a lot of expenses and kind of hits all in 1 quarter. But there is some ramp up, but that's factored into our guidance. So when we say that we expect the year-over-year in the first quarter to be slightly up, it's factored in -- those expenses are factored in. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : You mentioned at the end of the call, some of the DTC customers that you are tailoring some of the offerings to. I guess, was this material at all in the quarter? Maybe it's not large enough at this point, but any sort of contributions in 2024 as we think about picking up some of that business? And then also, DSO relationships, has there been any changes there in terms of the relationships on that front? How would you characterize those at this point? Are you seeing any greater traction there? Do some of these new products really move the needle on some of those relationships or conversations you're having? Joseph Hogan : Ann, on the DTC customers, we've always argued that, that wasn't our marketplace in the sense of the price point and all. But I mean, obviously, these patients will pursue treatment. Now probably more so for doctors than DTC. And we're just doing what we can in order to support those customers going forward. But again, as I was clear in my script, we're a doctor-focused client company, and we'll keep it that way. But we do see this as being a certain opportunity. It's just hard for us to quantify right now. On the DSO relationships, I'd say this has gotten stronger all around the globe. Two to call out would be Heartland and [indiscernible] being more new ortho side and Heartland being more on the GP side. But we have really good relationships and we leverage our portfolio well with them to help them grow and we grow with them. So I feel good about our position with DSOs, and we have good strong relationships out there with them. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Brandon Couillard : Joe, given the positive macro shift we've seen in the last few months with consumer confidence coming back, any chance you can comment on what you've seen in case starts in January an inflection? And then with respect to the '24 growth outlook. Any chance you could break that out between Americas and International. Joseph Hogan : Yes. I can't -- I really wouldn't break it out between Americas and International because we felt good about the geographies in general as you went across the world for especially latter half of the fourth quarter of last year. As we go into this year, as I talk about, we're looking at, I think, a stable economic platform. Some of the data that you cited would support that overall. And we feel good about our new products. We think we can play offense. And that's what we're focused on right now. Brandon Couillard : Okay. And then one housekeeping one for you, John. The fourth quarter operating cash flow was pretty weak. Can you just unpack any of the moving parts that might have been onetime in the quarter. It looks like there was a spike in prepaid expenses on the balance sheet. But anything you would call out? John Morici : Things that related to like tax payments and things. It's just some timing as things go through the year. But we feel great. I mean, it's a great model. It generates a lot of cash. It gives us a lot of flexibility, and we were able to use that cash, that $350 million buyback that we did last quarter. Operator : And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Shirley Stacy for closing remarks. Shirley Stacy : Thank you, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at upcoming financial conferences and at industry meetings such as Chicago Midwinter. If you have any questions or follow-up, please contact our Investor Relations. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, with Align Technology. You may begin. Shirley Stacy : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO. We issued first quarter 2024 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 1 month. As a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website at sec.gov.

We have posted historical financial statements with corresponding reconciliations, including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, if applicable, and our first quarter 2024 conference call slides on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on our call today. I'll provide an overview of our first quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, System Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q1 financial performance and comment on our views for the second quarter and 2024 in total. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. I'm pleased to report better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the first quarter and a solid start to the year. For Q1, total worldwide revenues were up 5.8% year-over-year, reflecting 3.5% growth from our Clear Aligner segment and 17.5% growth from Systems and Services. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 revenue growth was up across all regions and was driven by strong Clear Aligner volumes, primarily in the Asia Pacific region. Year-over-year growth also reflects strength in the orthodontic channel with total Invisalign case starts from teens and younger patients up 5.8% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum across all regions from Invisalign First, as well as Invisalign DSP touch-up cases. On a sequential basis, Q1 total revenues were up 4.3%, reflecting a sequential increase in Clear Aligner revenues. Especially for North American orthodontists, as well as strong Systems and Services revenues, primarily driven by iTero Lumina wand upgrades in North America. During the quarter, we achieved several significant milestones. We completed the acquisition of Cubicure, a leader in direct 3D printing solutions, which is the foundation for our next generational aligner manufacturing. We successfully launched the iTero Lumina intraoral scanner, our next generation of digital scanning technology. We launched the Invisalign Palatal Expander or IPE system in the U.S. and Canada and received regulatory approval for the Invisalign Palatal Expander in Australia and New Zealand. Q1 Systems and Services revenue year-over-year growth reflects nonsystems revenues driven by iTero Lumina wand upgrades and higher scanner volumes and increased services revenue from a larger base of scanners sold. On a sequential basis, Q1 Systems and Services revenue were up 3.1%, reflecting growth from nonsystems revenues and higher scanner ASPs, partially offset by lower volumes due to seasonality, a strong fourth quarter. The iTero Lumina intraoral scanner is available now with orthodontic workflows as a new standalone scanner or as a wand upgrade to iTero Element 5D Plus. The restorative workflow is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2024. In the meantime, GP practices can benefit from the iTero Lumina's new multi-direct capture technology that replaces the confocal imaging technology in earlier models. The iTero Lumina intraoral scanner has a 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller and 45% lighter wand, delivering faster scanning speed, higher accuracy, super visualization and more comfortable scanning experience. Overall, we're really pleased with the launch of iTero Lumina scanner. Customer feedback has been positive, and we're really excited about the feedback from doctors. So we've included some great verbatims in our webcast slides. Q1 total Clear Aligner revenues were up year-over-year reflecting revenue growth across the regions from strong year-over-year volume growth across APAC markets, as well as the EMEA region. For the Americas region, Q1 Clear Aligner volume was consistent with prior year. For Q1, total Clear Aligner shipments were up 2.1% sequentially, reflecting seasonality with increased volumes in the Americas regions, offset somewhat by EMEA and APAC regions. For Q1, Clear Aligner shipments include over 23,000 Invisalign Doctor subscription cases or DSP touch-up cases, primarily from North America ortho channel, an increase of approximately 49% year-over-year from Q1 '23. The DSP touch-up cases are a component of the overall DSP program, which consists of retainers and touch up cases or aligners, and it continues to be an important offering for our customers and their patients. DSP is currently available in the United States, Canada, Iberia, Nordics, the U.K. and most recently, in Italy, France and Poland. We expect to continue expanding DSP into other country markets and EMEA in Q2 including a 14-stage touch-up aligner offering. For non-case revenues, Q1 was up 7.5% year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth from Vivera Retainers along with Invisalign DSP retainer revenues. In a teen market, nearly 200,000 teens and younger patients started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligners in Q1, up 5.8% year-over-year. This represents a record number of teen cases shipped as compared to prior quarters, reflecting strength in APAC and EMEA. Teen starts were up sequentially 1.2%, reflecting strength in EMEA and North America, offset by seasonally fewer teen starts in China. While the teen market tends to be less susceptible to consumer demand around discretionary spending and more resilient than adult orthodontic case starts, we're pleased that in Q1, our Clear Aligner volumes for both adults and teens were up sequentially and year-over-year. We believe the Invisalign Palatal Expander system is one of the most exciting innovations we've developed in our 27-year history and is a better option for expanding a growing patient's narrow pallet. Initial response from doctors and patients for Invisalign Palatal Expander system is positive. The Invisalign Palatal Expander system is not a traditional Invisalign aligner. It's a series of direct 3D-printed orthodontic appliances based on proprietary and patented technology that has 4 systems designed for skeletal expansion. Clinical data shows that Invisalign Palatal Expander system is safe, effective and proven to deliver skeletal expansion. Specifically, our clinical data is based on 49 patients across the United States and Canada between the ages of 6.9 and 11 with a mean age of 8.8 years. In this group, the mean expansion of 6 millimeters was achieved with minimal tipping with ranges between 3.4 and 10.7 millimeters as measured using the change in intermodal width between the initial and post-expansion scans with a mean expansion efficacy of 97%. In addition, we found that survey doctors agree the Invisalign Palatal Expander is less painful than traditional expanders and facilitates better oral hygiene compared to traditional metal expanders. Phase I or early intercepted treatment includes both skeletal, orthopedic and dental orthodontic arch expansion and makes up to 20% of the orthodontic case starts each year. Combined with Invisalign First aligner treatment, Invisalign Palatal Expanders provide doctors with a full early interceptive treatment solution that allows doctors to treat all Phase I patients. We expect Invisalign Palatal Expander to be available in other markets pending future applicable regulatory approvals. Today, Invisalign is the most recognized orthodontic brand globally, and Invisalign Clear Aligner treatment is faster and more effective than traditional metal braces. Yet the underlying market opportunity remains huge and untapped. We continue to invest in consumer marketing and demand creation initiatives to raise awareness and drive potential patients to Invisalign practices globally. Below are several highlights from Q1 and more information is available in our Q1, '24 earnings webcast slides. In Q1 '24, we delivered 14.5 billion impressions and had 43 million visits to our websites globally. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents and teens about the benefits of the Invisalign brand, we continue to invest and create campaigns in top media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and WeChat across markets, reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents also requires the right engagement to Invisalign influencers and creator-centric campaigns. Our teen Invis is Drama Free campaign was recently recognized by the Association of National Advertisers with a silver award in the REGGIE Awards for creative and strategic excellence. In the U.S., in addition to our ongoing influencer campaigns, we partner with athletes such as Maxx Crosby, TikTok Gen Z influencer, Overtime Meg and the famous fashion designer, Kristin Juszczyk to create a compelling brand activation at the Super Bowl. Our campaigns delivered more than 6.1 billion impressions and 18.1 million unique visitors to our consumer websites across the Americas. In the EMEA region, we partner with influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta, and launched our global consumer campaigns for teens and parents. Our campaigns delivered more than 1.6 billion media impressions and 8.9 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 6.6 billion impressions and 16 million visitors to our websites, a 195% increase year-over-year. We expanded our reach in Japan and India via Meta and YouTube and partnered with key influencers to reach consumers across social media. We saw increased brand interest from consumers as evidenced by a 285% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website in India and a 129% increase in Japan. Finally, digital tools such as My Invisalign consumer and patient app continue to increase with 4 million downloads to date and over 381,000 monthly active users, 15% year-over-year growth rate. Q1 '24 Clear Aligner volume from DSO customers increased sequentially, reflecting growth in the Americas and the EMEA regions and increased year-over-year reflecting growth across international regions. Dental service organizations, or DSOs, represent a large and growing opportunity to help drive adoption of digital technology across the dental industry. We have established relationships with many DSOs globally, that recognize the benefits of digital workflows enabled by our portfolio of products and services that make up the Align digital platform, including increased practice efficiency and profitability, as well as delivering a better patient experience from shorter cycle times and proximity to their customers. Smile Docs and Heartland Dental are some of the largest DSO partners and are continuously exploring collaboration with DSOs that can further adoption of digital dentistry. Each DSO has a different strategy and business model and our focus is on working with the encouraging DSOs aligned with our vision, strategy and business model goals. Today, we announced an additional $75 million equity increase in Heartland, following the previous $75 million equity investment a year ago. Heartland is a multidisciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the United States. Their growth strategy includes Heartland's de novo dental practices, which feature modern technology, located in areas with a strong community need for dentistry where Heartland provides practices with opportunities for mentorship, leadership training and continuing education. In the last 4 years, Heartland opened 240 state-of-the-art de novo practices across the U.S. and are planning to continue investing through more de novo openings. We have a shared sense of purpose with Heartland. Their mission is to help doctors and their teams deliver the highest quality digital dental care to the communities they serve. With that, I'll now turn it over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $997.4 million, up 4.3% from the prior quarter and up 5.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q1 '24 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $10 million or approximately 1% sequentially and were unfavorably impacted by approximately $4.8 million year-over-year or approximately 0.5%.  For Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $817.3 million were up 4.5% sequentially, primarily from higher ASPs and higher volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Clear Aligner revenues were up 3.5%, primarily due to higher volumes and ASPs and increased non-case revenues. For Q1, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs primarily reflect higher additional aligners and price increases and the variable impact of foreign exchange partially offset by a product mix shift to lower ASP products. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs primarily reflect higher additional aligners and price increases partially offset by a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher discounts and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. For Q1, Invisalign ASPs for non-comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflect unfavorable country mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in non-comprehensive ASPs reflect the product mix shift to lower ASP products, unfavorable country mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by lower net revenue deferrals. As a reminder, we announced about a 5% global price increase for some Invisalign products across most markets effective January 1, 2024. This price increase did not include Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three products. Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product is available in North America and in certain markets in EMEA and APAC, most recently launching in French territories and in the Middle East. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product and anticipate it will continue increasing, providing doctors the flexibility they want and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time compared to our traditional Invisalign Comprehensive product. Q1 '24 Clear Aligner revenues were impacted by a favorable foreign exchange of approximately $8.4 million or approximately 1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.9 million or approximately 0.5%. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet decreased $26.7 million or 2% sequentially and increased $15.8 million or 1.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q1 '24 Systems and Services revenue of $180.2 million were up 3.1% sequentially, primarily due to increased nonsystems revenues, mostly related to upgrades and higher ASPs, partially offset by lower volumes. Q1 '24 systems and Services revenue were up 17.5% year-over-year primarily due to increased nonsystems revenues, mostly related to upgrades, higher scanner volumes and higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold. CAD/CAM and Services revenue for Q1 represents approximately 51% of our Systems and Services business. Q1 '24 Systems and Services revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.9% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $0.9 million or approximately 0.5%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $14.3 million or 5.5% sequentially and down $25.3 million or 9.4% year-over-year primarily due to the recognition of services revenues, which will -- which is recognized ratably over the service period. The decline in deferred revenues both sequentially and year-over-year reflects the shorter duration of service contracts with initial scanner purchases. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade and make trade, in addition to other scanner leasing and rental programs. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and our DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. We're pleased to be able to leverage our technological innovations and operational capabilities and efficiencies to provide different types of go-to-market models to our customers, such as rentals and leasing, selling the way that our customers want to buy. Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 70%, approximately flat sequentially and year-over-year. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.3 points sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.1 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 70.9%, down 0.3 points sequentially due -- primarily due to higher manufacturing spend, partially offset by higher ASP. Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was down 0.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher manufacturing spend, partially offset by favorable ASP. Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was 65.9%, up 1.1 points sequentially due to higher ASP partially offset by manufacturing variances. Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was up 4.3 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASP, lower service and manufacturing costs. Q1 operating expenses were $543.7 million, up 9.2% sequentially and 3.1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up by $45.7 million from higher incentive compensation and consumer marketing spend, partially offset by restructuring and other charges not recurring in Q1. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $16.5 million, primarily due to our continued investments in sales and R&D activities and higher incentive compensation. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions and restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $506.1 million, up 13.3% sequentially and up 3.2% year-over-year. Our first quarter operating income of $154.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 15.5% down 2.5 points sequentially and up 1.3 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to investments in our go-to-market teams and higher incentive compensation. The year-over-year increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage and proactively managing our costs, partially offset by unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately 0.7 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions and restructuring and other charges, operating margin for the first quarter was 19.8%, down 4 points sequentially and up 1.3 points year-over-year. Interest and other income expense net for the first quarter was an income of $4.3 million, compared to an income of $1.3 million in Q4 of '23 and an income of $1.1 million in Q1 of '23, primarily driven by a gain on our equity investments and net interest income and offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.7% compared to 28.3% in the fourth quarter and 34.8% in the first quarter of the prior year. The first quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the fourth quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to discrete tax benefits recognized in Q4 of '23, partially offset by increased earnings in low tax jurisdictions in Q1 of '24. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 20%, which reflects our long-term projected tax rate. First quarter net income per diluted share was $1.39, down sequentially $0.24 and up $0.26, compared to the prior year. Our EPS was not impacted on a sequential basis from foreign exchange. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.09 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.14 for the first quarter, down $0.28 sequentially and up $0.32 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short term and long-term marketable securities were $902.5 million, down sequentially $78.2 million and down $18.9 million year-over-year. Of our $902.5 million balance, $217.5 million was held in the U.S. and $685 million was held by our international entities. In January 2024, we received approximately 37,000 shares of our common stock upon final settlement of the $250 million accelerated share repurchase from Q4 of '23. In total, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price per share of $230.13 under the Q4 ASR contract. We have $650 million available for repurchase of our common stock under our January 2023 repurchase program. During Q2 '24, we expect to repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchase or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. Q1 accounts receivable balance was $950.7 million, up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 86 days up approximately 1 day sequentially and up approximately 3 days as compared to Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $28.7 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $9.4 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $19.3 million. We're continuing to use our healthy balance sheet to drive growth and profitability. During the quarter, we continued to make disciplined investments in our strategic growth drivers. We completed the acquisition of Cubicure, which will enable us to scale our 3D printing operations to eventually direct print millions of custom appliances per day, and we exited the quarter with a healthy cash flow position and no long-term debt, maintaining a strong position to support our additional $75 million investment in our DSO partner Heartland Dental and our $150 million stock buyback. Now turning to our outlook. Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, we provide the following framework for Q2 and fiscal 2024. For Q2 '24, we provide the following business outlook. For Q2 '24, we expect worldwide revenues to be in the range of $1.030 billion to $1.050 billion. We expect Clear Aligner volume to be up sequentially and Clear Aligner ASP to be down slightly sequentially, primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange. We expect Systems and Services revenue to be up sequentially as we continue to ramp iTero Lumina in Q2 2024. We expect Q2 '24 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above Q1 '24 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins, respectively. For fiscal '24, we provide the following business outlook. We expect fiscal '24 total revenue to be up 6% to 8% versus 2023, which is higher than our prior outlook of up mid-single-digit growth compared to 2023. The increase in our 2024 revenue outlook reflects our Q1 results, Q2 outlook and continued execution of our growth strategies. We anticipate that the incremental revenue reflected in our 2024 outlook will be roughly split 50-50 between our 2 operating segments. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner ASPs to be slightly up year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above the 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. We expect our capital -- our investments in capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joseph Hogan : Thanks, John. In summary, Q1 was a good start for the year. While I'm pleased with our results, I'm even more excited about Align's innovation in 2024 on our next wave of growth drivers that we believe will continue to revolutionize the orthodontic and dental industry in scanning software and direct 3D printing. Our focused execution of our product road map and innovation pipeline has resulted in the largest introduction of new products and technologies in our history, further advancing our software scanning and 3D printing capabilities. We're excited about the potential for these strategic investments to enable a new phase of growth to transform the orthodontic industry again. The iTero Lumina intraoral scanner has the potential to set a new standard of care for dental practices by simplifying the scanning of complex oral regions while offering superior chairside visualization and a more comfortable experience for patients, especially kids. The Invisalign Palatal Expander increases the clinical applicability of the Invisalign system to nearly 100% of orthodontic case starts. It is a revolutionary removable 3D-printed appliance that is clinically proven to be safe and effective. It is less painful than traditional metal expanders and promotes better oral hygiene. And our recent acquisition of Cubicure, a pioneer of 3D printing solutions for polymer additive manufacturing, brings a talented team and unique cutting-edge technology into Align to help us scale our 3D printing operations, providing ultimate design freedom and highly customized outcomes from a customer and patient standpoint as well as operational benefits to the business. We see incredible opportunities in this business and continue to make the Invisalign system the standard of care in orthodontics. By continually innovating and developing digital technologies and services that enable more doctors to easily diagnose and treat patients with crooked teeth and help them retain their healthy beautiful smiles. We're increasing access to care for millions of people, who might not otherwise receive orthodontic treatment. With that, I thank you for your time today. We look forward to sharing our continued progress in leading the digital transformation of the orthodontic and restorative dental industry. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : I was wondering if you could talk about how you're seeing the overall demand environment? I guess, I'm particularly curious about the U.S. sort of how you're seeing it from like a consumer demand perspective, especially and any comments you could make on the SmileDirect impact on volumes in the quarter? And then secondarily, if you could comment a little bit more on the broader demand environment in China, that would be super helpful. Joseph Hogan : Elizabeth, I'll start off and have John jump in on anything. First of all, we describe the business right now as stable. The same things that we talked about as we came out of the fourth quarter, and we see that stability broadly around the globe. And you saw in our script that we just read to, that it's good from an adult standpoint and also a teen standpoint, too, which, again, led to that kind of stability that we talk about. If I look around the world, I mean we've -- that stability exists, whether it's in Asia, whether we've seen it in parts of Europe and we see it in the United States and the Americas also. So I -- it's hard for us to call out a particular region or whatever that is dramatically down or dramatically up. We just see them moving pretty much in unison in the first quarter. John, would you add anything? John Morici : No, I agree. And that's -- we're driving the growth strategies. As we've said, we've seen that stability in the environment and we're executing against that. Joseph Hogan : And Elizabeth, last thing on your SmileDirectClub comment, them not being advertising like they were before or whatever, we can't attribute any part of the demand equation up or down as part of that. And obviously, that was more pronounced in the United States than it was anywhere else in the world, but I can't attribute any change in the marketplace because of them not advertising at this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Brandon Vazquez : I wanted to focus for a second on the -- on the teen side, you have the Palatal Expander out there now getting great reviews, and it seems like it closes, if I'm understanding the numbers correctly, maybe 20% of that market that you haven't been able to hit before. This is such a big opportunity. I'm curious if you can just reflect on like how does commercialization within teens look in the next couple of years now that you have kind of a broader and more fuller portfolio here compared to the prior couple of years? And what does that mean for growth rates within that teen section and adoption within teen that's underpenetrated relative to teens as we look forward the next couple of years? Joseph Hogan : That's a good question, Ben. I think we -- as we mentioned, it's 20%. And there's -- we don't -- we call them tweens, really. They're young students before they really hit the teen years and have a mature dentition. With Invisalign First and now with IPE, we can handle the 20% that's out there on the Phase I. And some teens just need -- tweens just need dental expansion and some of you really have to split the suture and widen the pallet overall. We feel in both those cases, with IPE and Invisalign First, these are very unique products specific to that area. And we think it will actually make doctors that aren't comfortable with the Phase I, may be even more comfortable now because of the impact on patients is not what it was before when you tried to work these kinds of cases with wires and brackets or higher risk expanders and those kinds of things. But like anything in the orthodontic community, it takes time. It takes time for acceptance. And the good thing about this is IPE is about a 30- to 35-day kind of an episode. So our feedback loop is really good. You can tell from my transcript also is right now, we're approved in the United States and Canada and recently in ANZ. And right now, we're throttled by the regulatory procedures we have to go throughout the world. So we'll be able to give you more specificity on this brand as we go forward. But as I mentioned in my closing too, we're really excited about that technology. And we didn't tie together the new Lumina scanner has such a broad kind of a bandwidth from a scanning standpoint, it scans that palate that you have to cover with Invisalign First extremely well. So those technologies thread together very well out there. So we're excited about it and more to come. Operator : Next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block : Hoping to ask 2, maybe just the first one, throughout the quarter, there was sort of like an obsession or a big focus from investors on month-to-month trends. There was talk about February strength, March weakness. I don't think if anyone really knew if it was the consumer or the calendar or both. So maybe you guys can talk a little bit about how it played out for you guys, elaborate on February and March? And as much as you can, just touch on April here for the first 2 to 3 weeks. And then I'll ask my follow-up. John Morici : Yes, Jon, this is John. Look, from -- as we talk about the quarter and think about -- we're very pleased with our results in Q1, we saw stability, as Joe mentioned, and that really continued from the end of the year into the quarter, less about month-to-month. I mean it was the stability and then the execution that we had throughout the quarter with our products. Jonathan Block : Okay. And then I'll just shift gears. John, I might stick with you. I believe the wording is slightly above the 2023 OM, which I think is 21.4% unchanged. Despite the higher revenues, the midpoint going from roughly 5% to 7%. So can you talk about where that extra spend is going? Do we see the returns on that this year? Or will that aid and give you some more tailwinds into 2025? And then just to tack on to that, the new higher guidance doesn't -- implies at a 6% in the back part of this year, year-over-year growth, which isn't too dissimilar from 1H, but the comps get more difficult. So the stacks need to accelerate. Why should we be comfortable with that? Is that just an accelerating contribution from some of those new products like Lumina and IPE? John Morici : I think that latter point is how I would look at it, Jon. We're making investments. We make investments throughout the year. We get the shorter longer-term investments that we make different returns on whether they're short or long term. But what we see is a stable environment, continued investments in go-to-market activities, we have new products coming. So that helps us accelerate with things that we'll have on the iTero side, as well as IPE and others that Joe talked about, where we really get the approval later in the year. So it's about a stable environment, making investments into that environment and then executing on our growth strategies, and that should give us the benefits that you described in the second half. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeffrey Johnson : John, maybe following up on Jon's question there and just a little finer point on the guidance itself. You've taken that guidance from mid-single digits to 6 to 8 scanner and CAD/CAM services came in obviously strongly in the double digits, upper teens. Should we think about kind of that double digits, maybe not in the upper teens, but double digits is kind of where the scanner and services continues this year? And your Clear Aligner revenue guidance kind of still in the mid-single digits. I think last quarter, we were talking about both those segments being mid-single-digit growers. It seems like to me now, maybe the raise here is being driven more by the scanner and CAD/CAM services. And as Joe calls the market stable, then maybe the Clear Aligner revenue still kind of expected to be in that mid-ish single digits. Is that a fair kind of way to look at guidance? John Morici : That's a fair way to look at it, Jeff. I mean, you would see, given the new products that we have with Lumina and iTero, we'll see a little bit faster growth. We're very pleased with what we saw in the first quarter. Typically in the first quarter, you don't have a sequential gain in revenue from the fourth quarter being an equipment business. So we're very pleased with what we saw there. But then we also look at the Clear Aligner business, and we expect to be able to grow and continue to grow there, both in terms of the investments that we're making in a relatively stable environment and some of the new products that should help supplement that growth. Jeffrey Johnson : Yes, that's helpful. And then one other follow-up. I think it's been asked in the past maybe at an Analyst Day or something. I don't remember if you've given a clear answer. But it's something I keep getting asked here more recently, and that's a percentage of your patient base of maybe orthodontic cases that get financed through some sort of third-party patient financing company. We have seen in areas like full arch implants, some of the aesthetic procedures outside of dental, where lending standards have gone up, FICO scores have gone from the 500 to 700, something like that to qualify for patient financing in this cost of capital and tougher capital environment. So what percentage -- do you know a percentage or round about of what cases get financed? And if those lending standards have changed at all and put an incremental pressure on patients here more recently? John Morici : Yes. What we see, Jeff, is it varies country by control say U.S. is maybe the most -- and I'll combine ortho and GP together, roughly 1/3 of the cases that we see get some type of external financing. Remember, many patients or parents will pay in advance. That's great for doctors. Many doctors, especially orthos will do some type of kind of internal financing where you kind of pay as you go and so on. And many doctors are continuing to do that, especially in the tougher environment. And we're doing things to help doctors to try to give them a little bit more extension in payments so that they can provide and pass that on to their patients as well. And we'll work with DSO partners to really try to help them work with these external companies to try to give better financing rates to try to get these patients to go into treatment. So we're well aware. We know we can help. We have the balance sheet and the cash to be able to help with our customers, so that they can pass that on. And that's something that we want to keep working towards. Jeffrey Johnson : John, any change to note over just the past few months even in those lending standards getting tougher? Or do you feel like that's stable as well as just kind of the overall environment as you've described that way? John Morici : I look at that as more stable. I think there was a lot of things. If you go back to last year, people are really getting a bit of sticker shock in terms of the higher interest rates, when they came to try to go into treatment. I think people are past that. I think when I see this or what I hear from doctors or see from our customers that it's a little bit more stable. There's not a big change. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Michael Cherny : Can you hear me okay? Shirley Stacy : Yes, we can hear you fine. Michael Cherny : Okay. So just relative to the spend, I want to dive in a little bit more, if possible. You talked about the investment growth. Can you delineate relative to that investment, how you're thinking about the growth into, call it, your core markets or some of the new product launches? And especially with regards to the ramp on the printing side, how much incremental printing spend, so to speak, is coming now versus where you think it's going to grow, what the run rate should be on ramping that over time? John Morici : Yes. I think we have a core business that we're running. And obviously, there's a certain amount of investment that you have to be able to grow around sales, sales and marketing and the go-to-market activities that we have. There's also R&D spending that we've had throughout the time. And now as that R&D in the case of acquiring Cubicure and now turning this into more of a platform to be able to build our 3D printing. There's a certain amount of spend that we have. How that lays out, it varies over time that we'll have. But rest assured, we know how to scale products. We know how to scale 3D printing. We'll make the right investments to be able to start scaling up that direct fab printing while making sure that the core business has the right investments for growth, and we'll balance that as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Jason Bednar : First I want to build on some of the macro questions that have been asked. I don't want to belabor the point, but other consumer discretionary companies called out a downtick in March. It doesn't sound like you saw any of that, but just wanted to confirm that's the case with respect to Invisalign demand. And maybe speak to your confidence to drive Clear Aligner volumes going forward, now that comps turn a little bit tougher. How much do you think you might need to fund that growth with investments to drive more traffic into the office? Joseph Hogan : Jason, on the first part is, we talk about the stable environment that we've seen that stability of it. We read and I read, what's going on there with the consumer investment, some concerns, particularly in the luxury goods or what's going on out there. But honestly, I think often what we see and analysts who follow us here just really pick up the U.S. data. And what we see is differences all around the world, and that's what's great about having an international business. You have some counter cycling in the sense of the demand patterns and what goes on out there. But I would say there's nothing that we would highlight right now. I would say that we think something has changed in what we saw in the second half of 2023, to what we saw in the first quarter of this year. John, you? John Morici : And in terms of investments, we make the investments that we need go to market and manufacture and other expansion as we continue to grow. We'll continue those investments. But as we've talked about, not only for the -- now the second quarter when we're talking about that sequential improvement in op margin and what we've talked about in total year where we expect the year-over-year improvement in margin. We're making sure that we're investing with that right amount of profitability. To still be able to grow into our market and expand the opportunity -- expand on the opportunities that we have, but then being respectful in terms of what margin we need to be able to deliver for the company. Jason Bednar : All right. Very helpful, Joe and John. And maybe one follow-up here to maybe a multi-partner on teen. So bear with me. But this might be a nuanced look. It seems like a lot of emphasis here just recently in product development and marketing that's really trying to tap into that much younger market, that Phase I opportunity. IPE fits in there, your new marketing branding plans and emphasis there. There seems to be some benefits for younger patients with Lumina. So it's really -- it seems intentional, but wondering if you could bifurcate for us, how your Invisalign business is performing in this younger patient population relative to the teen as a whole? Where does your penetration sit in those younger patients versus the broader teen channel? And maybe what kind of outsized growth you're expecting from this part of the channel as we look out over the near to intermediate term? Joseph Hogan : Jason, just I'll back up on your question, just to give you a kind of a conceptual view. When you think of Phase I, it's actually been controversial in the orthodontic market for years, some orthodontists don't want to do Phase I because as I mentioned before, the kind of devices that have been used, have been kind of difficult from a consumer standpoint. And so those wait for all permanent dentition and move on to there. We feel confident that within this Invisalign First now for dental expansion and then for palate expansion or a morphological change, IPE will do that. And we think a little track more orthodontists to begin Phase I treatment, but this is an industry that takes a while for things to bake in and for them to gain confidence and I understand it because you're working with kids' teeth and mouths and their dentition. But we actually think that a significant amount of growth could come from this area, but we think it will take time, but it's been a great focus for us. And it's going to be interesting to watch how orthodontists in the future actually focus on Phase I, Phase II because these kinds of devices make it simpler for them and for patients in the future. So right now, I can just kind of give you the ground rules on that, that we've changed those roles. In a sense, but I can't project exactly where it's going. Jason Bednar : Any sense penetration-wise or maybe where you're at relative to the broader teen market? Joseph Hogan : I'd say we're just in that story. I mean even Invisalign First is used sometimes on more permanent dentition too. So it's hard -- we'd have to split our cases out of Invisalign First is what the age of patients are or whatever. But as we get more data and we really get through with IPE and some more specificity around this, we'll share it with you and the rest of the.... Shirley Stacy : The only thing that -- I mean if you've tracked us for a while, you know that our average age of teen patients gets younger and younger, I think we're 14 now versus 15 plus before. So I mean that's a reflection of just being able to go after those younger patients with First. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Great. I wanted to go back to the guidance. I know it's kind of been touched on a few different times. But I wanted to ask on the Clear Aligner revenue outlook. It looks like you're raising the outlook for the full year by about 1%. I guess could you maybe just touch on what changed specifically with respect to that outlook? It sounds like maybe it's expectations around IPE and DSP versus market improvement. But I'd be curious, any color you could share there? And maybe anything on teen versus adult within the updated guidance would be great. John Morici : Yes, I'll start, Nate. So overall, we went from -- we had talked about mid-single digits, so call it 5% to raising it to the midpoint of 7% on a year-over-year, so up 2 points. And really, that's a reflection of a few things. One is the continued stability that we're seeing. We're operating in an environment that's more stable. We saw that coming into the fourth quarter and now into this quarter as well. So that's good if we want that stability there. And then you look at the execution that we have about -- on our core business to be able to grow with a lot of the innovations that we have, the promotions and other things that we have as we get into further into teen season, supplemented with the various new products that we talked about. We feel really good about Lumina and the launch that we have on iTero and the further expansion that that can drive as well as some of the new products like IPE and others to really not only help those unit sales there, but then as Joe described, we had to pull in other products around Invisalign First and others to really help drive some of that growth that we can see in the teen business. So it's a combination of things, Nate, but it's what we're seeing in stability, how we're executing on our core strategies and then some of the new products really supplementing the extended growth to help us. And that's why we adjusted our total year. Nathan Rich : Okay. That's helpful. And then, John, maybe just sticking with you. The 2Q operating margin, I know up slightly sequentially, but down year-over-year. And I think historically, it's been a little bit variable, but you've seen more of a step-up in the second quarter than I think what the guidance implies. Anything to call out with respect to FX? Or I think you mentioned some manufacturing cost spend, but just anything there that we should keep in mind as it regards the margin cadence? John Morici : Well, and certainly, we are seeing a stronger dollar. So that's something that we talked about when we think about our guide too, we see a stronger dollar coming out of -- out of the first quarter into the second quarter. Our guide reflects that as well. But then you look at the continued investments that we're making to be able to drive more submitters, more doctors into our ecosystem and then ultimately drive more and more utilization. Some of it's that core business that we have to be able to drive growth. And some of it's some of the new products where there's a certain amount of OpEx spend that we have with that. But we're being very mindful of what we can do to be able to drive growth. And then what it also means from an operating margin standpoint. And we're delivering that sequential improvement from 1Q to 2Q in operating margin and then talk to the total year of being up on a year-over-year basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wilson Wright : Great. I'll ask me 2 upfront here, but follow up on the guidance, and I don't want to belabor this too much, but do you think you have better visibility now just on the underlying demand trends globally? Or would you say that there's still an element or a healthy element of macro uncertainty that's still embedded in your guidance and some conservatism there? And then second would be on Lumina and the launch. And just can you talk about where you're seeing the most success with the launch in the target markets and promotions that where you're focused in terms of expanding share and upgrades as well? John Morici : Erin, this is John. I'll talk a little bit about visibility and guidance. I think what we -- what we enjoy now and what we want to be able to have in an operating environment is more stability, and that stability is there. Markets are open. There's a higher overall higher inflation and interest rates, but people are operating in that environment. That stability transcends it to other things that we have. We see the Michigan index or other indices that kind of point to that stability. Based on that stability, the investments that we're making, how we're going to market, some of the new products that we have, other things that we know that could, on a core basis, drive our business as well as the new products and initiatives that we have, that's what gives us confidence to be able to have a guidance that we gave for Q2 and what it means for the total year. Joseph Hogan : And Erin, on the Lumina piece, it's Joe, obviously, is -- as I mentioned in the closing of my script, we're really excited about that technology. We've been working on it for 6 years. It is a true new platform. It's not a derivative of the old confocal imaging platform. And there's really no other scanner in the world that's like that and how we've built it. So -- and it will take a while for the, I think, the market to absorb that as you have to do this doctor by doctor and place by place. But we've had a very enthusiastic response from the orthodontic community, but also the general dentistry community too, even though we're not completely ready for the restorative piece, and we mentioned it will be the fourth quarter this year we'll have that capability out. It's just the speed of that one, the simplicity of being able to scan, the dimensional tolerances and all that's used in the sense of both comprehensive and orthodontic cases are really unmatched. So we're excited about that, but we just have to take this thing. We've only had it out now for roughly a couple of months, but we are expecting to have a really strong year, but more importantly, to have that really be the set of standard from a scanner standpoint for the industry going forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Congrats on the quarter. I want to follow up on something, I think, Joe, you touched on in the prepared remarks. If I caught it correctly, you kind of pointed to a little bit of strength in U.S. ortho or Americas ortho in the quarter stood out for us. It seems like it's one of the stronger results in a number of quarters. Just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. Is it the Lumina launch? Is the fact that you're moving into younger teens and younger kids, which obviously is going to be a little bit more ortho-focused? Just any structural change you're seeing there with that group of dentists? Or am I just reading too much? Joseph Hogan : Michael, I understand your question. I'd say it's -- we feel it's -- we've seen more stability in that market this year than we have last year. We've always known that the teen segment of that much more solid than the adult segment, but the adult segment held up for us in the quarter 2. And so that aspect of the adults was good for us also. But I'm very cautious about projecting this market going forward because as you can see with a lot of the surveys that are done, this moves pretty dramatically from month to month. But again, it's not just the United States market we're focused on, the global market has been good for us too in that sense. So we're going to take this thing a month at a time, but we're confident enough to say this is stable, that we have products in here that are very helpful from an orthodontic standpoint in new, like you mentioned, Lumina and also IPE that gives us more ground to stand on the sense of those orthos. And so we're excited about that. But in no way do I think there's a phase change between what we saw last year and this year in ortho. It's just more stable and we have more continuity is another word that I'd use to describe it. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up if there's time. Again, also impressed by the DSP touch-up progress. You called it out in the deck. You got some additional launches later this year. You got the 14-stage touch-up aligner offering you're talking about. Any way you can start framing in terms of would you incorporate that into guidance at some point in terms of where you think that can go in terms of volumes and revenues or any update longer term, how you see DSP and touch up evolving over time? John Morici : Yes, Mike, I'll take that one. Look, DSP is very popular because it really serves the needs that doctors have. They want to be able to buy things kind of the way they want to buy. They want to be able to instead of making things or doing things themselves, they can use our aligners as part of that DSP and be able to treat those touch-up cases. And we like that, that's incremental for us in terms of what we see there. And they can also then use a lot of the aligners that they have for retention. And that's great too because that's typically incremental volume that we have. So I think when we see us rolling this out, like we said a few years ago, it was U.S. and North America and now into Europe, it continues to do what we expect it to do. Doctors start. They adopt it more and more because part of their workflow and we see positive volume from that. And in success for projects -- programs like that, we'll continue to expand those out. Shirley Stacy : Operator, we can take one more question. Operator : And our last question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : I have 2 questions. So the first one is on Heartland. Can you talk a little bit about the benefits of the Heartland investment operationally? And also Heartland is -- my understanding is a pretty profitable business and now with 2 separate investments there, how does their profits or how does the accounting work for that from your perspective at this point? .  And then secondly, if you can provide -- I guess, with regards to the guidance, I think we understand it. But was that in any way based on the trends that you've seen so far in April? Or if you can elaborate on those in any way, that would be great. John Morici : I can start with the guidance part of that, Kevin. Look, we use a lot of factors to look at where our guidance is. So we're using data from Q1 and the most recent information. But it goes back to the stability that we've seen. You can see it in a lot of the surveys and other things that a lot of people do, but what we see is that stability, coupled with what we're trying to do to go to market to drive the initiatives we have and the new products that we have. So that's a key part of what we factor in into our guidance. No change from what we normally do. This is how we've come together in terms of a guidance standpoint. In terms of Heartland, we look at Heartland as this is a great investment from investing in a company that shares a digital orthodontic mindset that we have, to be able to do things in a similar mindset, to be able to expand like they're expanding, to be able to get into markets that in some cases, we don't have much market share with or a big presence there. And they share that same mindset, that expansion. They've been around for a lot of years as well. With this investment, it's less than 5%. There's no consolidation or anything else that's required. And we'll evaluate going forward on whether there's any mark-to-market that we have to do going forward. But it's a continuation of that investment the expansion that they're doing, and we're pleased with the results that we've seen over the last year. Shirley Stacy : That actually concludes -- sorry, go ahead, operator. Operator : And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Shirley Stacy for closing remarks. Shirley Stacy : Thank you so much, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including the American Association of Orthodontics meeting in New Orleans, May 4 and 5. If you have any questions, please give us a call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on our call today. I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments, System and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q2 financial performance and comment on our views for the third quarter and for 2024 in total. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. Overall, I\u2019m pleased to report solid second quarter results. Total Q2 '24 revenues of $1,028.5 million were up 3.1% sequentially and 2.6% year-over-year, reflecting growth in both Clear Aligner volumes and Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services revenues. Q2 '24 total revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $11.6 million or 1.1% sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately $18.1 million or 1.7% year-over-year. For Clear Aligners, Q2 '24 volumes increased 6.2% sequentially and 3.2% year-over-year, driven by growth from adult patients, and strong teen case starts across the regions, led by strength in Asia Pacific, EEMA, and Latin America. Our Q2 results also reflect a record number of doctors submitting cases, and record doctors shipped to for the quarter. Q2 '24 Clear Aligner ASPs were down sequentially and lower than anticipated in our second quarter outlook, due in part to greater impact of unfavorable foreign exchange across multiple currencies, especially the Japanese yen, Euro, and Brazilian real, as well as discounts, and product mix shift to lower ASP products. As a result, total Q2 revenues were slightly below the expected range for our Q2 quarterly revenues. Notwithstanding these factors, non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 22.3%, up 2.5 points sequentially, and up 1.0 point year-over-year. For Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services, Q2 '24 revenues increased 9.2% sequentially and 16.1% year-over-year reflecting continued adoption of our next-generation iTero Lumina scanner, which made up the majority of our equipment sales, iTero Lumina wand upgrades, iTero Element scanner trade-ins, as well as increased iTero scanner leases. For Q2 '24, adult patient case starts were up 5% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, reflecting our highest number of adult shipments in 8 quarters, driven by strength in the GP channel, led by North America and APAC dentists. In teen and growing kids\u2019 segment, over 216,000 teens and younger patients started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners during the second quarter, an increase of 8.8% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year, reflecting growth across regions, especially from Invisalign First in the EMEA and APAC regions. In Q2, the number of doctors submitting teen or younger patient case starts was up 8% year-over-year, led by continued strength from doctors treating young kids also known as \"growing patients. The response from doctors and their patients to Invisalign Palatal Expander System continues to be positive. We believe that Invisalign Palatal Expander System is a better option for expanding a growing patient's narrow palate compared to traditional appliances used today. The Invisalign Palatal Expander System is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We expect it to be available in other markets pending future applicable regulatory approval. Non-Case revenues include our Vivera retainers, which include retention aligners ordered through our Doctor Subscription Program or DSP, as well as clinical training and education accessories in eCommerce. Q2 Non-Case revenues were up 3.5% sequentially and up 5.1% year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth in retainers and DSP. For Q2, total Clear Aligner shipments include approximately 25,000 Invisalign DSP touchup cases, a record high quarter of 37% year-over-year. DSP continues to drive growth and is currently available in North America and certain EMEA countries. During the quarter, we extended DSP into more countries in Europe and we anticipate expanding into additional markets going forward. DSP is also now available in 14 stage touch up aligner offering across all markets where it's available. As a result, Touch-Up cases increased significantly in Q2. Q2 '24 Clear Aligner volume and DSO customers increased sequentially year-over-year reflecting growth across all regions. DSOs represent a large and growing opportunity to help drive adoption of digital technology across the dental industry. We have well-established relationships in many DSOs globally that recognize the benefits of digital workflows enabled by our portfolio of products and services that make up the digital platform. Including increased practice efficiency and profitability, as well as delivering a better patient experience from shorter cycle times and customer proximity. Smile Docs and Heartland Dental are two of our largest DSO partners. We are continuously exploring collaboration with the DSOs that can further the adoption of digital dentistry. Each DSO has a different strategy and business model, and our focus is working and encouraging DSOs aligned with our vision strategy and business model goals. Today, Invisalign is the most recognized orthodontic plan globally and Invisalign, Clear Aligner treatment is faster and more effective than traditional metal braces. Yet the underlying market opportunity to remains huge and untapped. We continue to invest in consumer marketing and demand creation initiatives that raise awareness and drive potential patients to Invisalign practices globally. In Q2, we had more than 17 billion impressions in 50 million visitors to our websites globally. Below are additional highlights from Q2 and more information is available in our Q2 '24 earnings webcast slides. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents and teens about the benefits of Invisalign brand, we continue to invest and create campaigns in social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, U2, Snapchat, WeChat, [indiscernible] across the markets. Reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents also requires the right engagement through Invisalign Influencers and creator-centric campaign. In the Americas, our influence in social media campaigns, featured Olympic athletes such as Rebeca Andrade from Brazil, Andre De Grasse from Canada, Jordan Chiles from the United States and Paralympic athlete Lizzi Smith from the United States. To bolster T demand -- teen demand, we launched new activations with teen high school sports, social media platform, Over Time, including several programs focused on showcasing elite high school athletes across boys' football, girls' basketball, girls' soccer. We highlighted why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners and showcase their results. In the EMEA region, we partnered with influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta, and launched our global consumer campaigns for teens and parents. In APAC, we continue to invest in consumer advertising across the region and expanded our reach in Japan and India via meta and YouTube and partner with key social media influencers. Finally, adoption of my Invisalign consumer patient app continued to increase with over 4 million downloads to date and over 384,000 monthly active users and 8% year-over-year increase. Usage of our other digital tools also continued to increase. ClinCheck live update was used by almost 50,000 doctors on more than 692,000 cases, reducing time spent and modifying treatment plans by an average of 16.3%. Invisalign practice app is increasing in its adoption with 85,000 doctors who actively are using the app and 5.9 million photographs were uploaded in Q2 via the Invisalign practice app. Year-over-year growth in Q2 system and services revenue were up 16.1%, reflect higher scanner ASPs and non-system revenues driven by a terra luminal wand upgrades increased service revenues in a larger basis, scanner sold. On a sequential basis, Q2 systems and services revenues were up 9.2%, reflecting higher scanner volumes, higher scanner ASPs and higher non-system revenues driven by a iTero Lumina terra wand luminal wand upgrades. The iTero Lumina is new multi direct capture technology replaces the confocal imaging technology in earlier models and has a 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller and 45% lighter wand, delivering faster scanning speed, higher accuracy, superior visualization, and a more comfortable scanning experience. Lumina is currently available with orthodontic workflows as a new standalone scanner or as a wand upgrade from iTera element 5D Plus scanner. During the second quarter, we had a record number of competitive trade-ins demonstrating the continued success of the iTera Luminous Scanner in the marketplace. We're also seeing a halo effect with Invisalign scans. We're pleased to see more doctors coming into the digital ecosystem with an increase in first time Invisalign case submitters as well as return of lapse submitters. Overall, Q2 we're very pleased with the continued uptake of iTero Lumina Scanner with ortho workflow and response from customers. We're looking forward to a limited market release for the restorative software on Lumina in Q4, followed by full commercialization in Q1 '25. Today we introduced the iTero design suite, offering doctors an intuitive way to facilitate designs for 3D printing of models, bite splints, and restore restorations and practice. This software innovation is designed to help doctors increase their practice efficiencies and elevate patient experiences by shortening the time to treatment through an intuitive way to design for in-practice 3D printing. The Align digital platform provides an innovative portfolio of customer-focused technologies that enable seamless end-to-end workflows for dental professionals. iTero Design Suite is now available through an early access program. Doctors using an iTero scanner can submit their interest via their scanner, or my iTero portal. Software is expected to be available later this year in selected markets. With that, I'll turn it over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1,028.5 million, up 3.1% from the prior quarter and up 2.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q2 '24 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $11.6 million or approximately 1.1% sequentially and were unfavorably impacted by approximately $18.1 million year-over-year or approximately 1.7%. For clear aligners, Q2 revenues of $831.7 million were up 1.8% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 Clear Aligner revenues were flat, primarily due to higher discounts. A product mix shift to lower ASP products and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange offset by lower net revenue deferrals, higher volumes and price increases. Q2 '24, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $9.5 million or approximately 1.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $14.7 million or approximately 1.7%. For Q2 Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in a SP primarily reflects higher discounts, a product mix shift to lower a SP products and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in comprehensive ASPs primarily reflects higher discounts, a product mix shift to lower ASP products and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, mostly offset by lower net revenue deferrals and price increases. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for non comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflects the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, higher net revenue deferrals, and a product mix shift to lower ASP products partially offset by price increases. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in non-comprehensive ASPs reflects higher discounts, a product mix shift to lower ASP products, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the unfavorable impact of a price adjustment in the UK to make the recently mandatory application of VAT to our liners cost neutral to customers. Our Invisalign comprehensive three and three product and anticipate adoption will continue to increase is available in North America, EMEA and its certain markets across APAC. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign comprehensive [3-in-3] product and anticipate an adoption will continue to increase. Comprehensive [3-and 3] provides doctors the flexibility they want while allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product and benefiting us with a more favorable gross margin. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet decreased $7.8 million or 0.6% sequentially and decreased $5.2 million or 0.4% year-over-year. Ambo will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q2 '24 systems and services revenues up $196.8 million were up 9.2% sequentially, primarily due to higher volumes, higher ASPs and non-system revenues mostly related to upgrades Q2 24 systems and services revenues were up 16.1% year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs, increased non-system revenues, mostly related to upgrades and our leasing rental programs and higher service revenues. We are pleased to be able to leverage our operational and financial capabilities to provide different types of go-to-market models for our customers such as leasing and rental options. In the end, we are focused on selling the way our customers want to buy. Q2 24 systems and services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.1 million or approximately 1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, systems and services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.4 million or approximately 1.7%. Systems and services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $20.4 million or 8.3% sequentially and down $43.4 million or 16.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the recognition of services revenues, which are recognized ratably over the service period. The decline in deferred revenues both sequentially and year-over-year primarily reflects the shorter duration of service contracts applicable to initial scanner purchases. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we are increasing the opportunities for customers to upgrade and make trade-ins. In addition to our scanning, leasing and rental programs. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and our DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. The structural programs we have implemented across both of our operating segment benefit our customers by providing them with more options to choose what they need. In some cases at a reduced price that may impact our ASPs, but the cost of service for us is, is lower and the benefit is then reflected in our gross margins. Moving to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 70.3%, up 0.3 points sequentially and down 0.9 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.3 point sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 70.8%, down 0.1 point sequentially due primarily to lower ASPs, partially offset by lower additional aligners and leverage manufacturing spend. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was down 1.7 points year-over-year due primarily to lower ASPs and higher manufactured spend as we continue to ramp up Poland manufacturing facility and the impact of unfavorable foreign an exchange. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was a record 68.2% up 2.3 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs and manufacturing efficiencies. Systems and services gross margin for the second quarter was up three points year-over-year for the reasons stated above. Q2 operating expenses were $575.6 million, up 5.9% sequentially and 6.3% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up by $31.9 million due primarily to about $31 million in legal settlements year-over-year. Operating expenses increased by $33.9 million, primarily due to legal settlements and higher employee compensation, partially offset by lower outside services, advertising and marketing expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation. Amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, restructuring, legal settlements and other charges, operating expenses were $499.5 million, down 1.3% sequentially and down 1.1% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating income of $147 million resulted in an operating margin of 14.3% down 1.2 point sequentially and down 2.9% year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted from foreign exchange of approximately 0.6 points sequentially and unfavorable impacted by 1.2 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, Amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, restructuring legal settlements and other charges. Operating margin for the second quarter was 22.3%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 1 point year-over-year. Interest and other income expense net for the second quarter was an expense of $3.2 million, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange compared to an income of $4.3 million in Q1 of '24, and an expense of $0.3 million in Q2 of '23. Recall that Q1 '24 included a non-recurring gain on our equity investments. The GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.9% compared to 33.7% in the first quarter, and 34.8% in the second quarter of the prior year. The second quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to discrete tax events is recognized in Q1 of '24 that did not reoccur in Q2 of '24, and that benefit was partially offset by an increase in non-deductible expenses. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20%, which reflects our long-term projected tax rate. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.28, down sequentially $0.11 and down $0.18 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.11 on a sequential basis, and $0.17 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.41 for the second quarter, up $0.27 sequentially and up $0.19 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities were $782.1 million, down sequentially, $120.4 million, and down $251.7 million year-over-year. Of our $782.1 million balance, $140 million was held in the U.S and $642.1 million was held by our international entities. During Q2 '24, we repurchase approximately 0.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $250.73 through $150 million of open market repurchases. As of June 30, 2024, $500 million remains available for repurchases of our common stock under the January 2023 big purchase program. During the quarter, we completed a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental, a multidisciplinary DSO with GP and Ortho practices across the United States. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $1,020.1 million, up sequentially. Our overall day sales outstanding was 89 days, up approximately 3 days sequentially and up approximately eight days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $159.8 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $53.5 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures amounted to $106.4 million. Now turning to our outlook, assuming those circumstances occur beyond our control, we provide the following business outlook for Q3 and fiscal 2024. For Q3 2024, we expect our Q3 worldwide revenues to be in a range of $980 million to $1 billion. We expect Clear Aligner volume to be down sequentially as a result of Q3 seasonality and clear aligner ASPs to be down sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange and product mix. We also expect systems and services revenues to be down sequentially because of Q3 seasonality. We expect our Q3, 2024 GAAP operating margin to be below Q3, 2023, GAAP operating margin and Q3' 2024 non-GAAP operating margin to be flat to Q3 2023 -- non-GAAP operating margin For fiscal 2024, we expect fiscal 2024 total revenue growth to be up 4% to 6% year-over-year. Doing part to lower Clear Aligner ASPs year-over-year from continued unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix. In addition, our revised revenue outlook reflects our anticipated commercial launch of iTero Lumina with restorative capabilities to occur in Q1 of 2025 instead of 2024 as previously of 2025 instead of 2024 as previously anticipated? We expect fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin to be slightly below 2023 GAAP operating margin and 2024 non-GAAP operating margin to be above 2023. non-GAAP operating margin, we expect investments in capital expenditures for fiscal '24 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of continued expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments, Joe. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. In summary, I'm pleased with our overall performance for Q2 and the growth we delivered across the business for clear aligner volumes as well as strong revenues from scanners and services. Notwithstanding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange on our revenues, we believe the end markets are stable overall and we're committed to supporting our doctor customers in the future of digital innovation. Our purpose is to transform smiles and change lives with the goal of being the standard of care and orthodontics with Invisalign Clear Align of treatment. Clinically, we believe that we can treat the vast majority of orthodontic cases today. From the simplest to the most complex clinical efficacy is no longer a question. We now focus on the treatment experience for patients and on efficiency and growth for our doctor customers. The orthodontic case start market is vastly underpenetrated and there are millions of consumers who would benefit from digital orthodontics. We continue to evolve to better meet the needs of doctors, potential patients who increasingly seek convenient, elevated digital experiences. Our digital platform of integrated technologies, software and services has helped improve orthodontic treatment from millions by delivering seamless workflows and dental practices on mobile devices and through remote monitoring, and are designed to help doctors and patients realize the benefits of a truly seamless end-to-end digital workflows and patient experiences. But the journey from analog to digital has proven difficult for practices. The orthodontic practice of the future requires full digital transformation to truly realize the promise of digital. And there is no other med tech company in the world that can help practices meet this challenge. With that, I thank you for your time today. We look forward to sharing our continued progress as we move the industry forward through digital orthodontics. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Leerink Partners. Your question please. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking all the question. Maybe if I can just dive in a little bit on the guidance change and some of the moving pieces. In particular, I want to get a sense from you of what you view as within your control versus outside. Obviously, FX is something that management can't control, but you think about the guidance in particular on the ASP side, how do you think about the flow through of what isn't within your control on mix? Is there something you do on promotion? Is there anything else that can come from a pricing competition that you should be worried about? Just want to dive a little bit more into that number given that it seems to be the biggest fulcrum point relative to the guidance change. John Morici : Yes, it's a good question, Michael. This is John. Look, when we looked at the total year when and based on what we're seeing now, we see the unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We saw it in Q2 and we continue to see and project that that will continue for the rest of this year. So that's in our outlook. Just over a point of our reduction in our total year is related to foreign exchange. The mix effect that you talked about, that's really the way our customers want to buy. In some cases, they're buying lower price products, it's part of our portfolio. We see that as incremental in cases like doctor subscription program. They're just at a lower ASP. But what we end up seeing then is a better gross margin. Our cost to serve in many cases is lower than that, but it really is a reflection of what doctors want to do with the cases that they buy. Michael Cherny : Okay. Thank you. John Morici : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you had just regarding the guidance, if you had any insights that you could share on whether any of the iTero restorative scan revenue was originally contemplated in the 2024 guidance and now with the push out on the launch, if that was sort of an impact on the guidance as well? And then as a follow-up, if you could talk a little bit more about the acceleration in the teen revenue, or sorry, in the teen cases, which accelerated off a tougher comp, that would be helpful to also get some more additional perspective there. Thanks. John Morici : Yes. Hi, Elizabeth. Yes, you're right. The Lumina restorative that we expected to launch in the fourth quarter, now the full launch in -- into next year. That revenue was expected for this year. So that's part of the reasoning for taking down our overall guidance, in addition to the FX as I said on the previous question. And then your question on teen, look, we're pleased with our teen growth. We saw good over 8% growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis, 8% growth on a year-over-year basis. We saw good adoption in many places around the world. And it's a further reflection of the various products that we have, the adoption that doctors have. A lot of new doctors coming into the ecosystem to get trained and then actually become customers of ours. So we're pleased with the progress that we're seeing within teen. Elizabeth Anderson : Great. And any chance you want to quantify that iTero restorative contribution change or no? John Morici : Yes, We're not getting it directly, but its less than a 1%, slightly less than a percentage of the total. Elizabeth Anderson : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Your question please. Jonathan Block : Hey, Joe, good afternoon. Yes, where to start? Everyone was nervous about cases and then you come in and you beat cases handling, and obviously the focus is going to be on the ASP. So John, maybe let me know if I have these numbers right. But it looks like the aligner ASP was down roughly 4% Q-over-Q. The FX hit was about a 1%. So can you talk in detail as much as possible, the other 3% decline in the ASP Q-over-Q, if I've got that right, it seems like a big deviation from where your head was at 3 months ago. How much of it was mix versus discounts? And if it was a lot of mix, why did mix become so pronounced over the past 3 months? And maybe we can start there please. John Morici : Yes, Jon, when you look at mix that we have, we see doctors utilizing DSP more and more as a record amount of DSP that we had in a quarter that's at a lower ASP. We saw a lot of GP growth. We talked about adult cases being up, and the best volumes that we've seen in several quarters, and many times that's lower stage products, that we end up seeing come through. And so when we see the ASP, it's just a reflection of the different products that are being sold and those doctors are taking those up, at that. But you also know, and we've talked about where margins in many cases are better at those lower stage products, and we end up seeing this as a benefit to be able to see show up in gross margins and also off margins. Jonathan Block : Okay. So I, I guess to maybe just as a follow-up to that, are you saying that discounts weren't more aggressive, call it in 2Q '24 than maybe what we've seen historical? And just tack on to that follow-up, you brought down the midpoint of the rev guide from about 7% to 5%. You said FX was a 1%, you said the GP restorative push on Lumina was slightly less than 1%. I mean, are you sort of implying that clear aligner revenue by and large for 2024 is somewhat unchanged or maybe down a smidge and, and then I'll ask my quicker follow-up. Thanks. John Morici : Yes, Clear Aligner revenue down a little bit for the total year because of the ASPs that we spoke about not necessarily due to any volume changes. Like you said, we are pleased with the Q2 volume that we have. But that\u2019s how we\u2019ve look at the change. Mostly the FX for the total year as we've described, and then some mix, but then the rest of it due to iTero changes from this year to next year. Jonathan Block : Okay. And last question for me. I guess online, just John, if I've got this right, it looks like the revenue comes down a little bit, the midpoint, but I believe the non-GAAP EBIT margins came up slightly, I think before it was like flat to slightly up, and now you're saying slightly up. So maybe just talk through the dynamics where you're able to arguably increase the non-GAAP EBITDA margin assumption for '24 even off the more modest revenue base. And thanks for the time, guys. John Morici : Yes, no, it's a good question. And so as we looked at and as we talk about some of the -- I know ASP gets a focus, but really when you look at the margin that we get on all of these products is as they go to some of the lower stage products, we end up with a better margin. Our cost to serve is lower, which shows up in gross margin and flows its way to op margin. And I think the rest of it as you saw with this quarter from an OpEx standpoint and how we think about the levers that we could pull or not pull, we're very mindful of that in this environment and want to be able to deliver as much volume and as much top line as we can, but be very mindful of the operating profit that we need to deliver. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your question please. Joe Hogan : Hey Jeff. Jeff Johnson : Hey Joe. Good afternoon, guys. Wanted to start maybe on your doctor ship to number in the quarter. You shipped to a little over 86,000 docs this quarter. I think for 3 straight years you've kind of been in that 82,000 to 85,000 range. So maybe not a big breakout, but at least some of these underlying numbers on utilization is doctors ship to and that are starting to perk up a little bit. So I guess what I'm trying to understand on that doctor ship to number, are you starting to see some benefits of some of the investments Jon has been talking about the last couple quarters on getting that doctor prescribing base to expand? Is it expanding that base? Is it slowing the outflow of that base? As we know you've had some competitive losses here over the last couple years. Just maybe help us understand the inflow and the outflow rates and what's moving between those two pieces. Thanks. Joe Hogan : Hey Jeff, Joe. First of all, we're pleased with that. It's good to see a utilization go up. It's also great to see the doctors go up too. And obviously there's a strong concerted effort. We talk about that underserved marketplace out there and we know there's still a lot of doctors to train and there's still doctors do a lot more cases. So it's a big focus for the business. When you ask that question, are we loser in fewer or gaining few? There's always a mix and a change in those kinds of things, Jeff. But overall you can see here that we're gaining, it's not saying that we don't lose some docs sometimes, but you know, we often bring them back too. The whole story with what we've been through as competitors have entered the marketplaces, sometimes we'll lose some doctors, they often come back and one of the things about our business too, sometimes it takes 18 months for doctors to figure out if those competitive cases are actually going to work. And obviously I think we\u2019re -- we're making good progress in the sense of convincing doctors to move ahead with us. And this growth in doctors and utilization occurred across the globe, which is great. It wasn't like it just came out of one region. Jeff Johnson : Yes, understood. All right. And then maybe just a follow-up on the manufacturing side. We saw the news maybe a couple months ago of Emory's new role leading Direct Fab. He's going to stay in that role it sounds like through 2026 when he is going to write off into the sunset. So does that tell us anything about timelines on Direct Fab? I mean, Emory just doesn't seem like the kind of guy that would want to walk away in the middle of something. So is that kind of drawing a line in the sand that by 2026 you should be up and running fairly well, fairly maybe not efficiently, but fairly completely in getting that Direct Fab plans all put together and rolling out some of that 3D printed stuff in a bigger way? John Morici : Hey Jeff, it's a good question. We have a lot of faith in Emory. He's been here for so long and he's the only guy that's ever scaled, aligners to the point, that he has. And so it's really fun to have him in this role because he gives us great feedback in a sense of where we are. Jeff, the best I can say what we've talked about with the analyst is we're looking at 2 to 3 years on this scale. And don't think of it as a linear line. This is one where you have to do a lot of equipment work at first to get the efficiencies, to have this equipment work 24/7. And then secondly, this is a brand new resin [ph], it's never been sourced before. And so finding the source of the resin, making sure you have the reactor capacity, all those things take time. So I look at over the next year, we do a lot of that groundwork and then you'll start to see products and different things that will roll from that. So, but it's best to fix in your mind that it's a 2 to 3 year kind of a rollup. Jeff Johnson : Understood. Thank you. John Morici : Okay. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Vazquez from William Blair. Your question please. Brandon Vazquez : Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I'll ask two upfront because it's kind of guidance related. One a little near-term, which is basically, I think if you do the sequentials and the implied numbers on the guidance that you've given us, there's maybe like a high single digits revenue increase going into Q4. I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's kind of like pre-COVID levels of seasonality, back when the business was a little more normal. So the question near-term being, given the uncertainty in the market, what kind of gives you the confidence that you guys can kind of return normal seasonality within this year? And then the follow-up to that on kind of a long-term guidance question is like, okay, we look with [indiscernible] three years out, what's kind of the growth expectations of this business sort of growth algorithm? Any color you can give us around that, assuming that, we're, it seems like we're stuck in somewhat of a an uncertain end market stable, but not exactly where you want it. So talk about the opportunity to accelerate if even possible, in an end market like this over the couple plus three plus years. Thank you. John Morici : Yes, Brandon, this is John. I could take the question kind of on the remaining part of this year and so on. So we've guided to what we can see, based on how the quarter played out. We actually saw in the second quarter. I mean, I'm not saying it's a return to normal seasonality, but it was much more seasonal in the second quarter in terms of how our volume progressed and how it changed quarter-over-quarter to more normal seasonality. And so our reflection of what we tried to do for the rest of this year based on what we see. In terms of volume, takeout FX and some of that noise that gets caught into Q2. But from a underlying volume standpoint, we saw, um, more normal seasonality. And as we play out the rest of this year, we expect that to continue with teen season that comes in, that we're in now. China in the third quarter is a strong quarter for them because of team season, Europe, not so much. We expect that to, uh, play out more normally as it moves from Q3 to Q4. When we think of the total and looking out into 3 years, and so look, we're in an underpenetrated market and we've talked about a lot about that. We think we have the products and the go-to-market capabilities to really move this market forward. And it's up to us to be able to help drive this market forward. And when we look out and we look out in our long-term model, we believe in, in the opportunity revenue growth is 25% plus percent and up margin 25% plus. And that's how we are positioning things for growth, for whether it's Direct Fab, and the growth opportunities that we have there and the efficiencies that we can drive as well as the standard production that we have now. That's how we're building from an investment standpoint. We're mindful of changes that can happen short-term and economy and so on. And that's why we give you kind of the guidance that we have, at least now in short term, but in longer term we believe in, in our model. And, and that's how we're investing in the future. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Your question please? Q - Jason Bednar : Good afternoon everyone. Joe Hogan : Hey, Jason, Jason Bednar : Hey, there, I wanted to touch on one near-term item with third quarter guidance, some of the spend discussed already, but clearly over the -- lower than where you'd probably model things out internally 3 to 6 months ago. And I guess I'm just reminded of maybe where we were a year ago in the third quarter, you had higher expectations than where ended up finishing. So I guess I'm curious maybe how much of that experience from last year informed your view on volumes and product mix versus, say, the trends and macro data points that you've seen develop the last few months? And then maybe include here if you could just how you're seeing that team season develop since we are in the thick of that right now. John Morici : Yes, Jason, I can take that on, on the Q3. Some of those specifics, certainly we look at last year, we look at the 2022, you know, you got into those COVID years, they're tough to call and then you have to jump before COVID. So now you're talking almost 5 years ago. So, you look at what you see at the time knowing that most recently you have, we know we have Europe, has a summer kind of shutdown, comes back into September. We want to be able to see in September that they do come back. USS is in team season, China to get into the teen season as well. And we want to see how that plays out. So we call based on based on what we expect, both from a volume standpoint and we are really trying to give the foreign exchange that we see, that started the quarter, in July, where that FX is and not make an assumption as to whether things are going to get better or worse. We want to put that out there and really try to give you more of the underlying performance for the business. Joe, you want to talk about purchase? Joe Hogan : Yes, on the teen side, Jason as I said in my script, and we were pleased with the team growth. It was over 8%, which is great to see. A lot of that was supported by Asia and also Europe when you really got to get into team numbers. Again, IPE is part of that. It's -- we look at that as obviously pre-teen and we watching the ramp up of that, that is obviously pre-teen and we were watching the ramp up of that and the acceptance in the marketplace. So hope I'm answering your question, but overall, we feel good about the team now. There's a big team season in China in the third quarter, we're watching it closely. We expect be able to perform in that side too. So I'm optimistic as it stands. Jason Bednar : Okay, great. Then just for my follow-up, I'm going to pack a few in here. Maybe bigger picture, if we step back and look at some of the recent developments. I know there's a lot of initiatives, different initiatives, marketing programs, menu expansion, customer incentives, so on and so forth. Those all help contribute to expanding that utilization line, improving doctor productivity. You've got the Costco relationship that's been discussed. We uncovered what looks to be one of the larger changes to your advantage program in at least a few years. So I'm curious how you'd have us think about these in the broader context of your commercial efforts. Would you consider things like the Costco and Advantage changes, either are both more impactful than what you typically do? Have you seen any change maybe in doc behavior, just in response to these advantage changes? And then what's the right way to think about each of these influencing that ASP line that's now coming to focus more significantly with today's results? Thank you. John Morici : Yes, that's a good, great question, Jason. I look at -- just to answer it a couple different ways, because I think one is like on the advantage you brought up, that's really a reflection of trying to put some structure, a little added structure to our Advantage program where many of our promotions we're trying to get to. And in the end for an Advantage program is trying to get new doctors in, give them a progression of, how they can get discounts as they do more and more cases drive utilization. So that's, that's good for new doctors, that's good for existing doctors. So the Advantage changes really we're trying to put more structure into that, into the second half and then carrying forward because they really had better refreshed, like, what we've got now. But it's all about driving utilization, getting doctors to do more and more cases. Programs like we're testing or piloting with a Costco is really just trying to drive more conversion. Find ways where those consumers or those potential patients are out there, they're shopping around, they're looking at, you see the economy, you see inflation, you see other things. We know those potential patients are out there. We just have to find ways to be able to connect them with a great product that we have with our customers, with our doctors. And Costco is an example of that, that we'll test and we'll see. But it's really that specifically is designed around conversion drive as much conversion as we can. Jason Bednar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Your question please. Michael Ryskin : Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys. Joe or John, I want to follow-up on a point that you touched on a couple times already in terms of the ASPs. You talked about part of it is the mix shift and a lot of it is how your customers want to buy, whether that's different products within portfolio, whether or DSP, things like that. But what I want to get at is, are you concerned by that trend itself at all? Is that, that customers want the lower products? I guess that gives you the option to still meet them in the air and that still drives the volume, but is that something that you expected. This shift down? As you say, the market's still very unpenetrated. It's a big untapped market, so you'd think that you wouldn't be seeing the demand elasticity type of price that you are. So is this temporary because of the current macro environment and consumer sensitivity, or does it say something deeper that the rest of the market that's out there really doesn't exist at that, 1,300 plus ASP maybe it's lower and lower and lower. Joe Hogan : Hey Michael, it's Joe. Look, I think the ASP piece to try to explain as much as we can is, we're always staring at the margin side to make sure that our margins are good. We find out that all over the world, I mean, if you're in India, they ask for a different product and they ask in the United States at different areas, and some people want a 5x5, someone want 3x3, all these things are different products for different kinds of applications. And GPs [indiscernible] at times too. So what we're seeing and there's varying ASPs on it, but we always have -- you see, our margins have actually moved up on that. So you're seeing not necessarily the market just driving price down, you're just seeing us having a variation of options that customers or doctors want around the world and making sure that we supply those well. One -- we talk about 25,000 cases came through DSP. Remember, those are cases that, that doctors used to mold these things in their offices in order to address those, right. And now they're buying three or four of ours now, yes, we're getting great margin on that product line, but overall it's a lower ASP in that sense as part of the DSP program. So what you're seeing is just us responding to a market. It's a good market out there with varying degrees of price and value, and you'll see us continue to do that in order to grow the marketplace. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And then much quicker follow-up hopefully, sorry if I missed it, but did you call up why the Lumina restorative was pushed out to 1Q '25? Was this commercial decision or something on the development side? Joe Hogan : Yes, Michael, well, there's like five areas of restorative that you have to be very good at as you go through this. And truth of reviews, we made extremely good progress on most of them. But we just -- we wanted to take a little extra time to make sure we get this right and we want to make sure that we run it through our doctors who are actually going to use it, the luminaries out there that help to promote the product and make sure that they're comfortable with it too. So we just feel it's diligent and responsible to make sure that we take a few more months here, launch it in the first quarter so that we have the world's best product. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Thanks. Makes sense. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Erin Wright : Thanks for taking my question. So did you see any recent changes, for instance, in the adult case volume dynamics throughout the quarter? And just what are you seeing so far in the third quarter in terms of adult cases? I guess, has anything changed in terms of your view on the macro environment and for the remainder of the year? And I hate to belabor this, but also for the Americas too, but on the macro question, are you generally expecting stability in your guidance or are you anticipating a range of outcomes from a consumer and macro environment standpoint for the remainder of the year? Joe Hogan : Aaron, we -- I mean, we had that in our script and we talk about it as we're expecting stability. I mean, obviously not stability and exchange rates, right? We can't, we're not that smart. We'd be working somewhere else if we knew exchange that well. But as far as the market overall and how we want to go about it, we still feel we're dealing in a stable environment. The last thing I'll say about this, this is a very global business. You saw that the Japanese yen, Brazilian real, the business is growing substantially that way, and there's a certain amount of stability that we have that plays across geographies too. John Morici : And that adult piece we saw growth. We saw highest quarter in many quarters. So we're pleased with it. I think it's a reflection of our GP business, growing GPs, growing with DSOs and so on being able to, to get some of that volume through. Like Joe said, it's more of a stability that we're seeing, but we're pleased with that adult growth. And some of that contributes to some of that lower ASP product. It's great if that's how doctors want to buy to be able to treat those adults, we're happy to sell it to them. And as Joe said, it -- it's a better margin for us. Erin Wright : And you mentioned China too and the key market there, but just generally speaking, can you give us an update on kind of China, the underlying demand trends and market dynamics there? Joe Hogan : It's Joe again, Erin. China performed the way we wanted China to perform, just as we predicted. Overall, I mean, the market is challenging. I think that Tier 3 and 4 cities are actually challenged more than the private and one and twos. But overall there's no surprise we have a good team there. Juno [ph] is a great leader for us there and we like the results and we're looking forward to a good team quarter there, which is third quarter is always the biggest quarter for China. Erin Wright : Okay. Thank you. Joe Hogan : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Shirley Stacy for any closing comments. Shirley Stacy : Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry events. If you have any questions, please follow-up with our investor relations team. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation at today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy with Align Technology. You may begin. Shirley Stacy : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO, and John Morici, CFO. We issued third quarter 2024 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately one month. As a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website and at sec.gov.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q3 financial performance and comment on views for the remainder of the year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. Overall, Q3 '24 results were mixed and reflect strong Systems and Services year-over-year revenue growth, as well as good Clear Aligner volume in the Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America regions, partially offset by declines in the U.S. As recently reported by many analysts and third-party research firms, the underlying dental market in the United States remains sluggish and our doctor customers cite similar trends. Q3 '24 revenues of $978 million increased 1.8% year-over-year and Clear Aligner volumes of 617,000 were up 2.5% year-over-year. Despite strong growth from Systems and Services revenues, a record [87,400] (ph) doctor submitters, a record 236,000 teens starting treatment, driven by record teen case starts in China, and a record 25,000 of DSP Invisalign Touch-Up cases, total revenues for Q3 were slightly below our Q3 revenue outlook in part due to more pronounced seasonality for Clear Aligners than expected, as well as continued weak consumer sentiment and a soft dental market, especially in the U.S. Q3 '24 non-GAAP operating margin of 22.1% was better than expected and increased year-over-year compared to 21.8% in Q3 of '23. For Clear Aligners, Q3 volumes were up year-over-year and down slightly sequentially. Year-over-year volumes were driven by strong growth in APAC, especially China, as well as growth from the EMEA and Latin American regions. On a sequential basis, Clear Aligner volumes were down from Q2, reflecting more pronounced seasonality and soft dental markets in the U.S., offset somewhat by strength in APAC and Latin American regions. In the teen and growing kids' segment, a record 236,000 teens and younger patients started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners during the third quarter, an increase of 9.1% sequentially and up 6.7% year-over-year, reflecting growth across regions, especially from Invisalign First in the APAC and EMEA regions. In Q3, the number of doctors submitting teen or younger patient case starts was up over 6% year-over-year, led by continued strength from doctors treating young kids, also known as growing patients. During the quarter, we continued to commercialize the Invisalign Palatal Expander, Align's first direct 3D printed orthodontic appliance. Q3 reflected steady momentum for doctor submitters and shipments in the United States and Canada. We recently announced commercial availability in Singapore, and we're excited to extend the availability of the transformative Invisalign Palatal Expander System to even more doctors and their patients in markets across the Asia Pacific region. We expect it to be available in other markets, pending future applicable regulatory approvals. Non-case revenues include our Vivera retainers, retention aligners ordered through our Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP, clinical training and education, accessories and ecommerce. In Q3, non-case revenues were up year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth in retainers and the DSP program, including non-Invisalign patients getting retainers. DSP includes Invisalign Touch-Up cases up to 14 stages and is currently available in North America and certain countries in Europe. For Q3, total Invisalign DSP Touch-Up cases were up nearly 30% year-over-year to more than 25,000 cases. Q3 '24 Clear Aligner volume from DSO customers increased sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growth across all regions. The DSO business in United States continues to outpace our retail doctors, driven by our largest DSO partners, Smile Doctors and Heartland Dental. We also had strong growth in iTero scanner sales from DSOs investing in their member practices and end-to-end digital workflows. Q3 was another strong quarter for our Systems and Services business, and year-over-year revenue growth was up 15.6%, reflecting higher scanner ASPs and non-systems revenues, driven by iTero Lumina, wand upgrades, increased scanner rentals and certified pre-owned or CPO leasing programs, as well as increased services revenues, partially offset by lower scanner volumes. On a sequential basis, Q3 Systems and Services revenues were down 2.9%, reflecting lower scanner ASPs and non-systems revenues, particularly offset by higher scanner volumes. The iTero Lumina's new Multi-Direct Capture technology replaces the confocal imaging technology in earlier models and has a 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller and 45% lighter wand, delivering faster scanning speed, higher accuracy, super visualization and a more comfortable scanning experience. Lumina is currently available with orthodontic workflows as new standalone scanner or as a wand upgrade from the iTero Element 5D Plus scanner. Overall, for Q3, we continue to be very pleased with the ongoing adoption of iTero Lumina scanner, with ortho workflow and response from customers. We currently expect to begin a limited market release for the restorative software on the iTero Lumina scanner in Q1 '25, followed by full commercialization by the end of Q1. Today, we announced new iTero scanner products innovations to further enhance digital dentistry workflows and integrated treatment options in oral health, restorative and aesthetic treatment in general dentistry. Align Oral Healthcare Suite with new comparison tools that aid in multimodality assessments and personalized oral health records and reports. Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro in multiple treatment simulation to drive chairside patient education about treatment options, and iTero Design Suite with intuitive design capabilities for in-practice 3D printing now commercially available in selected markets. We believe the iTero intraoral scanner innovations introduced today enable doctors to present a variety of treatment options to their patients, supporting chairside education and communications. That helps deliver a great patient experience and supports patients in making more informed choices about their dental treatment and consultation with their doctors. We're also pleased to share that Invisalign Japan was recently awarded the [Golden] (ph) Design Award for 2024 for the iTero Lumina Intraoral scanner, making this the second time we received this prestigious award in the past two years. The Good Design Award is globally known and recognized by domestic and international designers and is the only comprehensive evaluation and recommendation system of design in Japan. The award designation increases the recognition and reliability of awarded works of -- and companies, promotes problem solving through design and focuses on the significance of design to people and society. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to comment on the employment actions we announced today resulting from a global reorganization and restructuring. As part of Align's 2025 annual operating plan process, we identified positions to be eliminated or transferred to other locations. These are difficult actions, and valuable employees will leave the company. As part of this restructuring, Raj Pudipeddi's position as EVP and MD Americas and Chief Marketing Officer has been eliminated and he will leave in the fourth quarter. We thank Raj for his contributions to Align over the past five-plus years in leading our marketing and product innovation and management as well as overseeing the APAC and Americas regions. We wish Raj well. I'm pleased to welcome Frank Quinn back to Align. He is a well-established leader with a customer focus and proven track record in orthodontics and digital dentistry. Frank's deep experience, understanding and insights into what digital means for our doctor customers is key and he is excited to be rejoining Align. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks, Joe. Now, for our Q3 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $977.9 million, down 4.9% from the prior quarter and up 1.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q3 '24 revenues were not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially and were unfavorably impacted by approximately $14.6 million year-over-year or approximately 1.5%. For Clear Aligners, Q3 '24 revenues of $786.8 million were down 5.4% sequentially, primarily from lower volume, higher discounts, product mix shift to lower-priced products and geographic mix, partially offset by lower net revenue deferrals. Q3 Clear Aligner revenues were not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially. Q3 '24 Clear Aligners per case shipment of $1,275 was lower by $20 on a sequential basis due to higher discounts, product and geographic mix, partially offset by lower net revenue deferrals. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Clear Aligner revenues were down 1%, primarily from lower ASPs, reflecting the impact from unfavorable foreign exchange of $11.7 million or approximately 1.5%, a 20% price reduction in the UK to offset a 2024 ruling by the UK tax authorities in Q1 of '24 that requires a 20% VAT be applied to Clear Aligner sales in the UK, product mix shift to lower-priced products, geographic mix and higher discounts. This decrease was partially offset by lower net deferrals and price increases, along with higher volumes and higher non-case revenues. Q3 '24 Clear Aligner per case shipment of $1,275 was down $45 on a year-over-year basis due to unfavorable foreign exchange of $18, impact of UK VAT of $12, product and geographic mix, higher discounts and partially offset by lower net revenue deferrals and price increases. Our Invisalign Comprehensive [3-and-3] (ph) product is available in North America, EMEA and in certain markets across APAC. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive 3-and-3 product and anticipate adoption will continue. Comprehensive 3-and-3 provides doctors the flexibility they want while allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront, with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period compared to our traditional Invisalign Comprehensive product, which in turn allows us to benefit from a more favorable gross margin. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet decreased $6.2 million or 0.5% sequentially and decreased $25.8 million or 2% year-over-year and will be recognized as additional aligners are shipped under each sales contract. Q3 '24 Systems and Services revenue of $191 million were down 2.9% sequentially, primarily due to lower ASP and decreased non-system revenues mostly related to fewer upgrades, partially offset by higher scanner volumes. Q3 '24 Systems and Services revenue were up 15.6% year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs, increased non-system revenues, mostly related to upgrades in our leasing rental programs, and higher services revenue, partially offset by lower scanner volumes. Q3 '24 Systems and Services revenues impact by foreign exchange was approximately flat sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.9 million or approximately 1.5%. The Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $1.5 million or 0.7% sequentially and down $40.6 million or 15.4% year-over-year, primarily due to the recognition of services revenue, which are recognized ratably over the service period. The decline in deferred revenues, both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily reflects the shorter duration of service contracts applicable to initial scanner purchases. Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 69.7%, down 0.5 points sequentially and up 0.7 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially and was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.4 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 70.3%, down 0.5 points sequentially due primarily to lower ASPs and higher mix of additional aligners, partially offset by lower manufacturing spend. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was down 0.5 points year-over-year due primarily -- due to lower ASPs, partially offset by lower manufacturing spend. On a constant currency basis, Clear Aligner gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by 0.4 points year-over-year. Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was 67.5%, down 0.7 points sequentially due primarily to mix, partially offset by lower manufacturing spend and freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was up 6.5 points year-over-year due primarily to higher ASPs, partially offset by higher service and freight costs. On a constant currency basis, Systems and Services gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by 0.5 points year-over-year. Q3 operating expenses were $519.5 million, down 9.7% sequentially and up 4.6% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $56.1 million due primarily to non-recurring legal settlements, advertising and marketing and employee compensation. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $22.7 million, primarily due to employee compensation. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, restructuring, legal settlements and other charges, operating expenses were $472.7 million, down 5.4% sequentially and up 3.1% year-over-year. Our third quarter operating income of $162.3 million resulted in an operating margin of 16.6%, up 2.3 points sequentially and down 0.7 points year-over-year. Operating margin was favorably impacted from foreign exchange of approximately 0.1 point sequentially and unfavorably impacted by 0.8 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, restructuring, legal settlements and other charges, operating margin for the third quarter was 22.1%, down 0.2 points sequentially and up 0.3 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the third quarter was an income of $3.6 million, primarily due to foreign exchange compared to an expense of $3.2 million in Q2 of '24 and an expense of $4.2 million in Q3 of '23. The GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter was 30.1% compared to 32.9% in the second quarter and 25.1% in the third quarter of the prior year. The third quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the second quarter effective tax rate primarily due to adjustments related to tax return filings, partially offset by a small increase in uncertain tax position reserves. The third quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher in the third quarter -- than the third quarter effective tax rate in the prior year primarily due to recognizing a one-time benefit related to the application of tax guidance issued during the third quarter of the prior year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter was 20%, which reflects our long-term projected tax rate. The third quarter net income per diluted share was $1.55, up sequentially $0.27 and down $0.03 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was favorably impacted due -- primarily due to foreign exchange by $0.03 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.08 on a year-over-year basis. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.35 for the third quarter, down $0.06 sequentially and up $0.21 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $1,041.9 million, up sequentially $280.5 million and down $197.1 million year-over-year. Of our $1,041.9 million balance, $285 million was held in the U.S. and $756.5 million was held by our international entities. We have $500 million available for repurchase of our common stock under our January 2023 repurchase program. Beginning in Q4 2024 and continued into Q1 '25, we expect to repurchase up to $275 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. Q3 accounts receivable balance was $1,010.6 million, down sequentially. Our overall day sales outstanding was 93 days, up approximately four days sequentially and up approximately eight days as compared to Q3 last year. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $263.7 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $29.8 million, primarily related to investments in our manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $233.9 million. Turning to our 2024 outlook. Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, including foreign exchange, we expect the following business outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 '24 worldwide revenues to be in the range of $995 million to $1,015 million. We expect Q4 '24 Clear Aligner volume and ASPs to be slightly up sequentially. We expect Q4 '24 Systems and Services revenues to be up sequentially, consistent with typical Q4 seasonality. We expect Q4 '24 GAAP operating margin to be slightly lower than 14%, primarily due to restructuring charges related to severance for impacted employees. We estimate these restructuring charges will impact Q4 '24 GAAP operating margin by approximately 3 points. We anticipate Q4 '24 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly up sequentially. For fiscal 2024, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be above $100 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of continued expansion. As we have said many times, we continually evaluate and evolve our business model to provide doctors with the best tools and resources that they need to help them treat their patients while managing our operations responsibly. Today's restructuring action is designed to adjust our business to more closely align with the existing business environment. We expect the restructuring actions we announced today will give us margin accretion for full year in 2025 even as we scale up our next-generation direct 3D printing fabrication manufacturing. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, John. In closing, for Q3, I was pleased to report another strong Systems and Services quarter, and I'm excited about our next-generation Lumina scanner and its continued positive impact on our customers' digital workflow, with ortho software today and restorative software expected to be released in Q1 of next year. Q3 was also strong for our Invisalign Clear Aligner business in the Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America regions. For -- those markets are our fastest-growing regions and help to balance outperformance in other geographies. We understand that operating environment is more challenging, and we are adapting and driving our growth strategy despite continued weak consumer demand trends. especially in the United States and a sluggish dental market. In the face of inflation, high interest rates, less patient traffic and longer conversion cycles, especially for adult patients, orthodontists and dentists are facing challenges in practice growth and profitability that impacts the way many of them approach orthodontic treatment. It is more important than ever that we differentiate our products and services and become the best partner for our customers by creating solutions that drive more patients to their practices, accelerates treatment conversion and improves their experience and bottom line. As the innovation leader in digital dentistry technology, it's our job to ensure we have the organizational structure, focus and rigor to help doctors realize the full potential of this opportunity by doing more to engage our doctor customers and support their practice growth and to help consumers and potential patients connect with these practices to get to smiles that they love. We continue to evaluate and evolve our business to provide doctors with the best tools and resources they deserve. Align is the leader in digital orthodontics, and we are committed to supporting doctor customers and the future of digital innovation. We're committed to supporting doctor customers and the future of the digital innovation and are excited the next wave of growth drivers that we believe will revolutionize the orthodontic industry in scanning software and direct 3D printing. We're in the midst of several key technology developments that are critical for the business. We will take the needed actions to get us through this, while at the same time investing in the key areas that we know will transform our industry and our business. The restructuring actions we announced today focused on ROI investments and activities that drive revenue and enable margin expansion, while making room for investments in critical future technologies, including scaling our direct 3D printing operations. With that, I thank you for your time today. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming quarters. Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. You may proceed. Brandon Vazquez : Hey everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start on a little bit just the macro backdrop. Last year, the year-over-year comp also had a little bit of weakness in the September period, if I remember, in 2023. So, things are a little bit worse now. I'm just curious if you can talk about did things get worse from last year, which was already a little bit of -- a little weak. And in case that doesn't make sense, the crux of the question is essentially just talk to us about where macro is going into year-end? Is it stable? I think you guys have used that phrase before. Is it worsening? Just any thoughts you guys are seeing on end markets? Joe Hogan : Yeah, Brandon, it's Joe. I'd say, first of all, third quarter is always a tough quarter because of the discontinuities we have with Europe shutting down and different countries being on vacation at different times. So, I wouldn't say that the third quarter this year was worse in some way than the third quarter last year. I'd just say that it was the kind of seasonality in a difficult market. What we try to call out, as you could see, is that United States market seems to be one of our the most affected and it's really one of our largest markets, too. And so that's been a challenge in that sense also. John, do you want to add anything? John Morici : No, that's accurate. Brandon Vazquez : Okay. And then, as my follow-up just quickly, as we look towards 2025, right, and if we just assume end markets are stable, right, let's say things remain stable, how should we think about what the top-line on this business could do and what the P&L could look like in a year where things are stable, right? You guys are somewhat macro hindered right now. So, is it a continuation of what we're seeing in '24? Are there reasons to get a little bit more excited and accelerate the business? Any expectations around that would be helpful. Thank you. Joe Hogan : Hey, Joe, again. I'd just say we'd like to see some increased consumer confidence obviously in the United States and just an economy that feels better to consumers. We feel that this is more of an external issue than it is an internal issue when you look at Align overall in our growth rates, particularly in United States. And so, any kind of increase in economic activity and increase in consumer confidence, we think would be really positive for our customers and then for Align in turn. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Brandon. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. You may proceed. Joe Hogan : Hey, Jon. Jon Block : Hey, guys. Good afternoon, Joe. Joe, maybe just to start with you, and it sort of picks up on that last question, anything to call out with the different results in the U.S. versus international? In other words, I think I've got this right, but cases up 2.5% globally, but as you mentioned, down in the U.S. So, is it just the consumer? Is there anything to focus on from a go to market strategy? Do we have to think about incremental competition that might be more acute in the U.S. versus OUS? Just would love your thoughts on that dynamic. Joe Hogan : Yeah, Jon, it's a good question. I'd say it's mainly external when I look at it. I don't think there's been any dramatic changes from a competitive standpoint in the marketplace. If I look at our ortho channel and our dental channels, they're both challenged in the sense of patient throughput and their ability to close. I was just talking to some of our largest DSOs this morning and the comparison is similar. This is -- and these are -- the close rates at our customers are more difficult, too. It's customers come in, we know they want teeth treatment, but they're not really confident in the sense of their ability to pay for it or wanting to pay for it right now in the economic situation. So, I wouldn't call out anything externally from a competitive standpoint or whatever. This is more what we feel is external economics and consumer confidence issue in the United States. Look, we see, Jon, the same thing in Europe, but Europe has been a little better and a little different, because all those countries have different situations, but it's more pronounced in the United States because it's so large and so uniform in that sense. Jon Block : Got it. Okay, thanks. And then, second question will be sort of a famous two-parter, but John, just to start, I just want to be crystal clear, you guys are committing to overall op margin expansion in '25. If that's correct, it will be somewhat neutered by the direct 3D printing fabrication initiative. Maybe if you can verify that? And then, any thoughts on the top-line? That would just be first question or I'll call it Part A. And Part B -- sorry go ahead, John. John Morici : I was going to give the op margin. The op margin, yes, we made the restructuring actions, given us room, so that we can get the year-over-year margin accretion, while still investing in all the things that we've talked about with direct fab and five-minute ClinCheck and Lumina and so on. So, we're going to continue making those investments. The restructuring gives us some room to show that margin accretion. Jon Block : Okay. And again, the other part of that question was, any thoughts on the top-line? If you're committing to the OM expansion, what does that mean from a top-line perspective? And the second one, Joe, just if I can pivot and if you can talk to some of the initiatives out there? In other words, it seems like Costco is off to a slow start, [per our] (ph) checks. Do you need to be in the store? And then, more recently, we picked up on a new financing initiative that it seems like you're rolling out and sort of guarantees the case approval, denials have been a problem. Where are you with that initiative? And when do you expect it to have a more sort of prominent impact on the overall P&L? Thanks, guys. Joe Hogan : Yeah. Hey, Jon, I'll just kind of just frame your question. The first one like Costco, we've had some success in Costco, but it's nothing as material for the business right now, but I think you have to look at that as we do internally. It's a brand strategy. We have the number one brand in the world. We're looking at different areas of how we can leverage that brand to try to encourage consumers more in the sense of entertaining Invisalign treatment. As far as financing, we know that customers right now are challenged in the sense that they do want a treatment from an orthodontic standpoint, but they're really challenged from a financial standpoint. And John and the team are doing all they can. And also our DSO -- big DSO partners are doing what we can to offer the type of financing that would give consumers more confidence to move forward. John Morici : And on overall revenue, Jon, we'll give more of an update as we get closer into 2025. But as we've said and as we've made the adjustments, we're committed to driving growth, investing where we can find that growth, balancing our investments on some of the new technologies that we have that we know will transform this business. So that's all at stake now and things that we're mindful of, but we'll give more of an update on 2025 as we get closer. Jon Block : Thank you. Joe Hogan : Yeah, you're welcome, Jon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Joe Hogan : Hi, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi. I'm also going to try my hand at a two-parter as well, [since that's the theme] (ph). One, I mean, as you talk about the restructuring and sort of Frank coming back to the organization, I think you hinted at it a little bit. I know it's obviously a little bit early, so just sort of high-level quality of thought would be fine on this too. Like, what do you mean when you're -- what are you sort of -- like, what is he going to sort of drive or what do you -- is there sort of like an inflection that you're thinking about how he operates the business differently? And sort of as a corollary to that, like, I think you talked about getting closer to the consumer. If you could talk maybe about that portion of it? And then secondarily, it was nice to hear the positive commentary about China. So, I'd love to hear a little bit more about that market and sort of how you're thinking about the consumer outlook for that market as well. Thank you. Joe Hogan : Hey, Elizabeth, it's Joe. On Frank coming back, Frank was -- had been in the business from 2013. I think he left us in 2022 for another type of venture. Look, this business is about -- it's about three things. One is relationships. This is not a transactional business. This is one where you want to have good relationships and good trust with doctors, and Frank really brings that from a leadership standpoint. Secondly is, you would need a good understanding of the technology and types of programs that can help to drive growth. Frank is really an expert in that area. He's shown that over the years. When you look at our DSO program today, it's been really effective. Frank happened to put that together back when I first arrived, back in 2015, 2016 and really made that happen. Thirdly is, you need someone with scope in the sense of understands the industries, understands the competition, knows what really makes doctors make decisions, and orthodontists and how they make decisions versus the general practitioners. Frank has all that, and he's a trusted commodity within the business. So, we're excited to have him back. John Morici : And then, the last part of your question, Elizabeth, on China, we're pleased with China results, sold to more doctors, pleased with the utilization. It's a great teen season for us in China. We saw good adoption of various products, including Invisalign First and others, where we saw good utilization there. So, China, for us, from a teen standpoint, especially, played out really well for us. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. Thank you. Joe Hogan : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. You may proceed. Joe Hogan : Hi, Jason. Jason Bednar : Hey there. Yeah, good afternoon. I'm going to come back and follow-up on one of Jon's questions. I know a lot of us have been trying to estimate the margin upside or the margin impact from 3D printing over time, just given the cost benefits you can realize from the initiative. But the comment today here with the restructuring offsetting some of the -- maybe some of the investments you're making, it would seem like that this initiative may be dilutive to gross margins in '25. So, maybe just help us bridge the thinking that you're making in these comments today, reconcile some of those comments, and if you can, quantify kind of the puts and takes? John Morici : Yeah. I'll take my best at this. So, overall, we're talking op margin. We think that the restructuring that we're making is going to be op margin accretive on a year-over-year basis despite all the investments. You're right, from a gross margin standpoint, as we scale things, the direct fab printing, while gives us a lot of capability and a lot of benefits for our doctors, there is a higher cost initially until we start to scale that. But we're committed to that op margin accretion on a year-over-year basis for next year despite that. And then, as we have new products that come and we know the doctors are going to love what we're bringing to market, that will scale up. And as that scales up, then that really drives the overall productivity that we will see on the gross margin side, primarily from the materials and the less material that we need to go into the product. Jason Bednar : All right, understood. And I guess maybe one follow-up to there and then another separate follow-up. But just any timeline on when we might see the gross margin benefits or expansion off of historical norms once that 3D printing does scale? And then, just with the teen season maybe now mostly complete, just what's your assessment of that part of the market, Joe, inside the U.S., outside the U.S.? The data we see has been a bit more mixed between kind of the clear aligner and bracket and wire part of the markets the past several months. Your business has grown decently the past year and a half. So, just -- do you have better visibility on this part of the market? I'm just trying to understand this again in the context of the broader comments you're making on the U.S. being a little bit softer. Thanks. John Morici : So, Jason, this is John. I'll take the first part of your question on gross margin. Look, we've talked about it being like a two- to three-year journey to be able to help scale this up. I can say this, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making around resin and being able to scale that and get it at the right cost. So that's good progress there. As well as on the equipment side, we're making good progress around being able to scale up the actual manufacturing of this. But in terms of when you scale this and get it to a larger extent, it's really two to three years, but you will see some new products that we have on the direct fab showing up next year and in doctors' hands to give them those capabilities. Joe Hogan : Jason, on the teen market, I mean, when you look at the international teen market, obviously, we had really good success in Asia in the quarter. We have really a terrific portfolio when you think about our Invisalign First product. Now, we have Invisalign Palatal Expander. With that also, it's what we call mandibular advancement with occlusal blocks, which are used for Class IIs, usually for patients between 10 and 11 years old. So, when you look at those pre-teen ages, we have a really good portfolio to line up in that sense. So, I think you're seeing that come through with our sales overall. When you reflect back on the United States, obviously, our orthodontic customers are really challenged. And 80% on an average, 75% of what they do are teens. And some of the close rates on teens, just talking to some of the DSOs and different doctors that we have on the orthodontic side, the close rates are even tougher on the teen segment than what it's been in the past, too. And so, times like this, where they're pressed for traffic and they're pressed for margin, they will reflect back to wires and brackets to support the profitability of their practice. We know that. We understand it. It's our job to communicate to consumers and to orthodontists what the benefits are, particularly this early treatment and what we can do. And so, this is a doctor-to-doctor situation, but again, it's an external environment where consumers are concerned with their pocketbooks right now, and they're reluctant to make decisions and close at times. And obviously, the orthodontists are responding from an individual practice standpoint accordingly. Jason Bednar : All right. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Saxon with Needham & Company. You may proceed. David Saxon : Great. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start on iTero actually. I'd love to get some color around how we should think about iTero growth with the ongoing Lumina rollout, particularly with the restorative workflow coming out early next year, but then in the context of interest rates remaining high and then lapping comps from the initial ortho launch? Joe Hogan : Yeah, David, I think you have to start with, and I think I get the gist of your question, there's a lot of pressure on capital equipment sales in the marketplace given what we're talking about with customers being challenged in that way. I think what you have to do with the Lumina and think about it, it's truly a brand new platform. It's not an iteration of old technology like the next phase of our older technology. It's something that's really new, and it's captured doctors' attention. And I think it's the size of our sales and how well we've done, particularly in a traditional third quarter, it's a little bit slower, I think it surprised a lot of people. So, I think this is a testimony to the technology we've brought forward and the uniqueness of that technology, why we've been able -- to be able to have those kinds of sales at this point in time. We're excited about the restorative coming on in the first quarter. The team is making good progress on that. So, overall, it's just a great foundation to grow from. And what's wonderful about that platform, too, is we'll iterate from that platform going forward in different areas that will really help us to diversify the product line and target certain applications in the future. John Morici : And two things that really have helped iTero and kind of go through this, especially with the new product and so on, it's really given us a lot of opportunity on other products that we sell within the iTero kind of family. So, all the way from CPOs that we have certified pre-owned, all the way to the 5D. We actually sold a lot of 5Ds this past quarter. So, that really helps us. And then, the added part, in a tougher economy, we're giving a lot more flexibility to doctors to kind of sell the way they want to buy. Some don't want to purchase outright because of the economic conditions and so on. So, we see a lot more leasing or in other places we see more rental. And for us, that's a great trade. It will get that recurring revenue off of those different selling options, but then it's great when a doctor uses iTero because we know they'll do use more Invisalign. David Saxon : Great. Thanks for that. And then, on the U.S. side, on the Clear Aligners, can you give more color on kind of where that weakness is actually coming from? Is it the ortho channel or is it with GPs? And then, anywhere specifically from a portfolio perspective? Thanks so much. Joe Hogan : Yeah. I mean, it's almost equal in both. We see pressure on the ortho side. I mean, if you look at any kind of industrial data right now as far as patients entering the dental industry right now, the GP space, it's challenged overall. So, we see pressure in both of those areas for the same reasons we talked about before. Shirley Stacy : Yeah. Thanks, David. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. You may proceed. Joe Hogan : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Hey, Joe. How are you? Good afternoon, guys. So, Joe, let me ask one high-level question and then maybe just a modeling question for John. But from a high level, your R&D was down 4% year-over-year this quarter. You're making the headcount reductions. CapEx at $100 million is well below even the last couple of years, closer to $250 million those years. You're talking about increasing the buyback margin improvement next year. All of these comments kind of just point to a more mature company and that's not a critique at all. I think that's where we all know you are and see where you are. So, I guess my question is, how does this change your management style, your management objectives over the next few years? Obviously, you came into this business really pushing the top-line, but is there an evolution that's happening to go on with how you lead this company and lead this organization as well? Joe Hogan : Hey, Jeff. I think it's a really good question. I'd say we're responding to the times here. Don't make it a reflection on what the opportunity the company is at all. We're so underpenetrated, not just in United States or North America or whatever, but all over the world. And there's hundreds of millions of people that need to have their teeth straightened. And the only way you could ever do that in a broad sense is with digital orthodontics. So, don't miss that point, Jeff. We are going through a spell right now. And what you see with the R&D down and CapEx and different things like that, CapEx is, you know we're not putting on any more manufacturing right now. We have enough manufacturing, and we're still bringing up our Poland plant, right? We're being responsible from a business leadership standpoint for our shareholders in this specific situation, but at the same time, Jeff, we're pouring a lot of money into 3D printing, five-minute ClinCheck, next phases of Lumina. All these things will really enter into just another growth cycle when this market starts to come back with brand new tech. This is the technology of the future if you really want to play in digital orthodontics. So, what we're doing is funding that, being responsible to our shareholders, but not losing our enthusiasm and what we think our opportunity is in the future. Jeff Johnson : Yeah. No, that's all fair. You are holding a sell-side event or at least an investor event a week from Saturday. Would that be a time to evaluate though that LRP, that 20% to 30% intermediate longer-term top-line growth expectation? Joe Hogan : I think until we get a better read on what the economy is going to do, Jeff, I think that 20% to 30% represents how we feel that market could grow in the future, but we have to have the right economic conditions, particularly in the biggest markets in the world like the United States that we participate in. Jeff Johnson : Okay. And John, one modeling question. Just when I listen to the ASPs, I think the quick math on that is, it sounds like between the VAT issue that should anniversary at the start of next year, just remind me if I've got the timing on that correct, but should anniversary at the start of next year, currency headwinds should be -- we'll see what the U.S. dollar does post-election year, but should be reasonably moderating from here? So, I think ex currency and ex VAT, you had about 1.1% down ASP year-over-year. One, is that math correct? And two, is that about what we should be thinking about as we head kind of into '25 once VAT and hopefully FX normalizes a bit? John Morici : You're right about FX hopefully normalizes, it's hard to predict. VAT does anniversary at the beginning of next year. And what we've said in the past that that ASPs would be flat to slightly down. So, your percentage you're talking about is in that range. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Jeff. Joe Hogan : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may proceed. Joe Hogan : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Caliendo : Hey, thanks. Hi, Joe. Thanks for taking my question. This is maybe a little bit off, but just wondering if you guys have ever done this analysis in terms of thinking about the Venn diagram between people purchasing GLP-1s and people going and getting Invisalign treatments, because the cost for adults anyways might be close. And I'm just wondering if there's any -- if you guys have seen any correlation to maybe that's part of the weakness in the adult market as the shortages have -- in GLP-1s have come down or people may be investing $5,000 that way as opposed to into Clear Aligners. Have you done that analysis or seen anything? Joe Hogan : I can't say that we've been -- we've overly quantified it, Kevin. We hear that a lot. There's a lot of medical device companies that kind of talk about that that might be corollaries in the sense of what you're seeing with the GLP marketplace overall. I can't say that it's not a factor because it's obviously a high expense and something that's kind of on an annual basis in line to what it would cost to do an Invisalign treatment. But I haven't wanted to lean into that as one of the drivers here. I think it's just overwhelmed by an economy right now where consumers don't have a lot of money in their pocket or confidence about what it's going to be in the future. And GLP might play a role in it, it might not. I think also you can look around the world also in some of the markets, like Continental Europe, that's not necessarily as affected by it as maybe United States is. And I can't say I've seen that piece, too. So, there's an old saying that correlation doesn't mean causation, right? And so, I would stay with that right now. Kevin Caliendo : Fair enough. That's helpful. And just I know you don't want to talk about '25, but let's just think about the fourth quarter and sort of what you're implying for your guide in exiting the year sort of a midpoint of like 5%. Should we just sort of take that as a starting point, adjust for whatever we think the economy might do that might impact the adult side of the marketplace more and then think about Lumina as an add on to that? I mean, is that sort of how you're thinking about the business? John Morici : Yeah. I think we'll obviously give more as we get closer to this, Kevin, but I think -- look, you come out of the year, that's probably a good starting point to be able to build off of that and say, look, what do you think is going to happen to the economy, we're going to know more, maybe about interest rates and election and other things will kind of come about and we'll have a better view of that. But I think it's a good starting point as you think about next year, you're going to add in some of the things that we've talked about with, Lumina restorative and other things and then build off of that, but we'll give more details as we get closer, obviously. Kevin Caliendo : Appreciate it guys. Thank you. Shirley Stacy : Thank you. Joe Hogan : Yeah, thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. You may proceed. Michael Cherny : Hi, good afternoon. Maybe just one, following up on a question earlier on the some of the 3D printing work in the fab-related products that you're going to be pushing out. As you think about the potential for introduction to those products, how are you thinking, given that this is a bit of a obviously different manufacturing approach that you've taken before, about what the rollout will look like? Will it look any different in terms of the types of beta customers that you're going to be pursuing? How should we think about tracking -- I mean, tracking is not the right word, but making sure that you're hitting on the right customer experience, the right overlap, the right introduction process as you get what obviously could be a very scalable set of products, set of new opportunities out to market? Joe Hogan : Hey, Michael, it's Joe. Just taking your question is, as you think about it, when you think of what we do today, when you [indiscernible], obviously, you lose a huge amount of opportunity to differentiate the geometry of that particular product and how it can help a doctor. The one sector of our business that would I think will appreciate this the most will be the orthodontic community that do a lot of Class IIs, difficult cases, young teens, and we'll be able to produce products that are more and more tailored to consumers in that specific condition than what we could do today. And so, we would offer the product that way, and we think it'd be very appealing to them. Secondly, from a general dentistry standpoint, it's a big part of our marketplace, too, there's a lot that we can do to help them with this product line also. So, I hope I'm answering your question, but the design freedom that we have here in the end and we have to prove it when you can use relatively different thicknesses, you can do different configurations for different kinds of clinical issues that a patient might have, we expect to have more predictability in the sense of how fast you can move those teeth and more certainty and how long those cases will take. And I think doctors are going to appreciate that, but I think as we're certain of that, patients will appreciate that too, and we certainly would communicate that to patients. Michael Cherny : No, that certainly does help. And then maybe just one quick question, I promise it's not an attempt to go at '25 guidance specifically, but obviously, you've mentioned numerous times the UK VAT that's impacting ASPs internationally this year. Is there any outliers or one-time dynamics that we should be thinking about or contemplating relative to next year, something that like the UK VAT or anything else that could factor into the modeling that's non-normal? John Morici : Michael, this is John. Nothing that we would say is non-normal. I mean, the nice thing about the anniversary of the UK VAT is, it does anniversary. Obviously, we're doing things to try to work with that government there to explain and ideally not have a VAT on our products, because it affects what goes to doctors and how much they pay and then passing it on to potential patients. But there's nothing like that, that we would see on the horizon as that type of impact. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Michael. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Can you speak a little bit more on just the nature of the restructuring outside of the executive change today, I guess the timeline, scope, magnitude and anything that you can give us in terms of quantifying that benefit from a profit perspective into 2025 and what that translates into just broadly speaking, but also just what -- how this kind of came about in terms of what's on the table, what were your changes that you were thinking about in terms of the business outlook or backdrop that really changed in your view since it's been a sluggish kind of consumer backdrop for some time? Now, I guess what else has changed? Thanks. John Morici : Yeah, Erin, I could try to give you kind of an overview of where things are at. Just as part of a normal AOP process, you're always evaluating where you're going to make investments, where you're going to fund it, how you're going to fund it and so on. So, this is part of our process that we go through where we're planning out where we're going to end up for the year and what does it mean for next year and how do we grow and do all the things that we want to talk through. This type of restructuring, this is about 2x of what we did last year. Last year, we did about 350 or so, just over 300. This is close to 700 people. There's some restructuring charges, we've talked about that, this year. But really what it does and what -- I'll go back to what Joe was talking about, we want to be focused in on what we can drive as our business, what we can do from a growth platform standpoint, whether it's the direct fab, five-minute ClinCheck, Lumina restorative. We want to fund those, but we've got to also show some margin accretion and we want to be margin accretive on a year-over-year basis. So, we can fund what we need to fund to really be driving our business and we'll fund it based on some of these changes here, but it really set us up for a position to be able to show that margin accretion next year. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then, as we head into the fourth quarter, I guess, does your guidance assume a continuation of the same in terms of the sluggish environment in the U.S.? Or does it have any sort of changes across other regions that you anticipate either continued acceleration or deterioration across other kind of markets or geographies here? Thanks. John Morici : Yeah, Erin, it just kind of assumes what we've seen. I mean, like as we pointed out, U.S., North America not great, we kind of assume the same. Other places we actually saw good improvement, in parts of Asia, Latin America, Middle East, other places, and we continue to invest and expect to grow in those areas. So, like any forecast, you take the best information you have at the time, you try to translate to what that's going to mean for the upcoming quarter, and that's what we did for fourth quarter. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Erin. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Ryskin with Bank of America. You may proceed. Mike Ryskin : Hey, thanks, guys. Just a couple of cleanup follow-up questions. One, I think just kind of following up on what Erin touched there and John you touched on this as well. Two years in a row now, and again part of that is just natural attrition, natural cleanup of the business, but should we expect this to be sort of the normal going forward in terms of the restructuring? You guys famously kind of held off on that for a while. And very famously during COVID, you actually reinvested and you refused to cut when others were cutting. So, just help us think in terms of how we should factor that in going forward. Joe Hogan : Hey, comparing this time with COVID is a stretch, Michael, overall. When we didn't lay anybody off during COVID, our expectation was that wouldn't last as long as it did, but fortunately, that was a decision to pay off well when the market came back so strongly. Right now, we're looking at just a sustained economic malaise, I would call it, in the United States, and we're responding accordingly. We haven't lost our enthusiasm and our belief in how this business can grow and this market potential of this business. What you're seeing in the restructuring is we're responding to external pressures that we see and being responsible from a business standpoint and being sure that we fund these key three technologies that we know will lead into the future from an overall digital orthodontic standpoint. John Morici : And that's the key point of it now. It's being able to make space and have a budget to be able to fund these key technologies, because we know that's going to drive the future and it's doing things that we know no one else can do, no other company can do what we're trying to do with this. So, it's really important for us now to keep that focus through these budget changes and so on. It's what companies do to be able to push the future and do it in a responsible way where we could show margin accretion. We know we always talk about levers that we could pull or not pull. This is a part of it, and it just comes about it on a more annual basis as you assess the current environment. Mike Ryskin : Okay. And then, quick cleanup, if I could, on the ASPs. You talked about earlier, I think, in the Q&A, you touched on some of the factors that impacted you in the quarter and your thoughts about next year, but just on 4Q, I think you guided up ASP sequentially, and you've had some of these mixed dynamics, some of the discounting and FX for a number of quarters in a row. Just what are you seeing so far through October that's giving you confidence that you'll be able to reverse that? Because I think some of those headwinds don't fade till next year. John Morici : Yeah. Well, I think part of -- really all our Advantage programs kind of go from -- they end in at the end of June and then they reset as you come into that second half. So, third quarter kind of took the Advantage changes. So, that shows up in discount. So, I don't expect that to continue. And then, where you do have the benefit and in our case where Europe becomes a bigger part of our business in the fourth quarter and China and some of the other businesses become less, that's good from a mix standpoint. We have a higher ASP in Europe and a lower ASP in China. So, whereas that mix hurt us from a country standpoint, in a lower ASP in the third quarter, we actually get the benefit on that in the fourth quarter based on seasonality. Mike Ryskin : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Shirley Stacy : Thank you, Michael. Joe Hogan : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And we have reached the end of our Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back over to Shirley Stacy for closing remarks. Shirley Stacy : Great. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and for those of you who we'll see at the Invisalign Ortho Summit in Las Vegas next week. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact Investor Relations, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy with Align Technology. You may begin. Shirley Stacy : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO, and John Morici, CFO. We issued fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately one month. As a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website and at sec.gov. Actual results may vary significantly, and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. We've posted historical financial statements with corresponding reconciliations, including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, if applicable, and our fourth quarter and full year 2024 conference call slides on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments, System Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial performance and comment on views for 2025. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. I'm pleased to report that Q4 total revenues, Clear Aligner volumes, Systems and Services revenues were in line with our Q4 outlook, and both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins were better than our Q4 outlook. Q4 Clear Aligner ASPs were lower than our Q4 outlook due primarily to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange from the strengthening the US dollar against major currencies from late October through December, as John will explain in his remarks. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter revenues of $995 million increased 4%, reflecting 14.9% growth from Systems and Services revenues and 1.6% growth from Clear Aligner revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner volumes grew 6.1%, driven by increased shipments across all regions with strength in EMEA, APAC and LatAm regions and stability in North America. From a channel perspective, Clear Aligner volumes in the ortho and GP channels were up a year-over-year basis with a number of submitters and utilization amongst the highest in the past few years. On a sequential basis, fourth quarter revenue growth of 1.8% reflects continued momentum from sales of iTero Lumina scanners and increased Invisalign Clear Aligner volumes in the EMEA region, especially from teens and growing patients as well as growth from the LatAm regions. Across the orthodontists and GP dentists offset by clear aligner seasonality in in APAC, mostly China, which had a strong teen quarter in Q3. For the Americas, Q4 Clear Aligner volumes reflect a seasonally soft orthodontic channel, offset somewhat by strength in the GP channel in the adult segment. For the full year 2024, total revenues of $4 billion and Clear Aligner volumes of 2.5 million cases were both up 3.5% year-over-year. We delivered fiscal 2024 non-GAAP operating margin of 21.8%, above fiscal 2023 and in line with our 2024 outlook. As of Q4 2024, we achieved several cumulative milestones, including 272,000 active Invisalign trained practitioners, 19.5 million Invisalign patients, including over 5.6 billion teens and kids and over 2 billion clear aligners manufactured worldwide. For clear aligners in Q4, year-over-year volume growth in the Americas reflects strength in Latin America as well as improving trends in North America, especially for GP dentists. In the EMEA region, Q4 year-over-year Clear Aligner volume growth reflects increased volumes from core Europe as well as strong growth from EMEA, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa markets. From a channel perspective, EMEA Clear Aligner growth reflects strength in both ortho and GP as well as teens, kids and adult patients. In APAC region, Q4 year-over-year Clear Aligner volume growth was driven by China and Japan, as well as strong growth from our emerging APAC countries led by India, Thailand and Korea. For Q4, APAC growth also reflects increased utilization and submitters in both doctor channels and growth in both patient segments. Q4, we had 85,700 doctors submitters worldwide, a record total in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting a sequential increase in clear aligner volume for adults and non-comprehensive cases. In the adult clear aligner segment, we're pleased to see both year-over-year and sequential growth across all regions. In the teen and growing kids segments, approximately 216,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligners during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 8.6% sequentially off a record Q3 teen season and an increase of 9.8% year-over-year, reflecting growth across regions, especially from Invisalign First in the APAC and EMEA regions. For Q4, number of doctors submitting cases starts for teens and kids was up 6.2% year-over-year, led by continued strength from doctors treating young kids or growing patients. For fiscal 2024, Total Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and kids reached a record total of 868,000 Invisalign cases and shipped up to -- a year up to 7.7% compared to the prior year and comprising approximately 35% of the 2.5 million total Clear Aligner case shipments for the year. Teen-specific consumer marketing and sales programs, along with the continued momentum for Invisalign First for kids as young as six and Invisalign Palatal Expander systems help drive adoption globally. During the quarter, we continued to commercialize the Invisalign Palatal Expander with steady momentum for doctor's submitters and shipments. In its first full year of availability in North America, Invisalign Palatal Expander adoption was followed by similar trajectory in Invisalign First, which launched 2017. But Invisalign First did not require regional or country-specific regulatory approvals like Invisalign Palatal Expander is required. In Q4, we received the CE mark under the medical device regulation to market the Invisalign Palatal Expander system in most of Europe and also completed registration with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for the United Kingdom and overseas territory. Both approvals are for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens and adults with surgery or other techniques. These approvals mark a significant milestone in our efforts to enhance clinical outcomes and efficiency in orthodontics and enable us to commercialize the Invisalign Palatal Expander across most of the major EMEA region in 2025. We are continuing to make progress in establishing the clinical efficacy and improved patient experience of Invisalign Palatal Expander, which recently made to cover of the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics, or JCO, and an article published by Dr. Jonathan Nicozisis. There have been multiple peer review studies published on the effectiveness of the Invisalign Palatal Expander as well as mandibular advancement. We also are receiving positive parental feedback, as reflected in the article, 7 Reasons Parents Love the Invisalign Palatal Expander System. Overall, the Invisalign Palatal Expander system is gaining traction among orthodontists and patients due to its innovative design and user-friendly feature. As more clinical data becomes available and practitioners gain experience with the device and parents become informed, we believe adoption will continue to grow. Q4 non-case revenues were up year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth in retainers and our Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP, including non-Invisalign patients at getting retainers. Non-case revenues, including our Vivera Retainers, retention aligners ordered to our Doctor Subscription Program, clinical training, education, accessories and e-commerce. DSP also includes Invisalign touch-up cases, which includes up to 14 stages and is currently available in North America and certain countries in Europe and was most recently launched in Brazil. For Q4, total Invisalign DSP touch-up cases were up nearly 37% year-over-year to more than 27,000 cases. For fiscal 2024, total DSP touch-up cases shipped were over 100,000, up 37% compared to 2023. 224 Clear Aligner volume from DSO customers increased sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growth across all regions. The DSO business continues to outpace our retail doctors globally. And in the U.S., it's driven by our largest DSO partners, Smile Doctors and Heartland Dental, and also had strong growth in iTero scanner sales as DSO invested in their members' practices end-to-end digital workflows. In December, we completed $30 million equity investment in Smile Doctors, the largest orthodontic focused DSO in the U.S. with more than 450 locations in 32 states. Smile Doctors has a rich history of developing and growing affiliated practices by providing tools and technology that allow their orthodontists to focus entirely on patient care, and we are continuously exploring collaboration with DSOs that share our vision of furthering the adoption of digital dentistry. Each DSO has a different strategy and business model. We're focused on working and with encouraging the DSOs aligned with our vision strategy and business model goals. Those DSOs that recognize the benefits of digital workflows enabled by our portfolio of products and services that make up the Align digital platform, including increased practice efficiency and profitability, as well as delivering a better patient experience for shorter cycle times and proximity to their customers. Turning to Systems and Services. Q4 was another strong quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 14.9%. On a sequential basis, Q4 Systems and Services revenues were up 5.2%. In Q1 2024, we launched the iTero Lumina with orthodontic workflows as a new stand-alone scanner, or as a wand upgrade from our iTero Element 5D Plus scanner. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the ongoing adoption of iTero Lumina scanner, and we're looking forward to building on its success with the launch of the iTero Lumina scanner with restorative capabilities. During the fourth quarter, we began a limited market release of our restorative software on the iTero Lumina scanner, and doctor feedback has been outstanding. Our iTero Lumina innovation represents continuous advancement in our mission to deliver unparalleled value to customers and dental professionals worldwide. Doctors can continue to purchase the current version of iTero Lumina scanner today, knowing that it will automatically update to the new version free of charge once it becomes available at the end of March. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. John Morici : Thanks Joe. Now, for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $995.2 million, up 1.8% from the prior quarter and up 4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. This reflects an increase in clear aligner volumes up 1.9% sequentially and 6.1% year-over-year and revenue growth from Systems and Services of 5.2% sequentially and 14.9% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, Q4 2024 revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $0.8 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially and were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.9 million year-over-year or approximately 0.1%. For Clear Aligners, Q4 2024 revenues of $794.3 million were up 0.9% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, geographic mix shift to higher-priced countries, and lower net revenue deferrals, partially offset by product mix shift to lower-priced products and higher discounts. Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $0.7 million or approximately 0.1% from foreign exchange sequentially. Q4 2024 Clear Aligner per case shipment of $1,265 was lower by $10 on a sequential basis, primarily due to product mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by favorable geography mix and lower net deferrals. Even though FX had a minor impact on our reported quarter-over-quarter results, our Q4 guidance did not forecast any substantial change from the October spot rate foreign exchange rates. However, the U.S. dollar unexpectedly strengthened in November and December. If foreign exchange rates in October had remained constant for November and December, then Clear Aligner ASPs would have increased approximately $10 quarter-over-quarter, or the equivalent of $14 million. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were up 1.6%, primarily from higher volumes, lower net deferrals, price increases, and higher non-case revenues, partially offset by lower ASPs, reflecting the impact from unfavorable foreign exchange of $0.7 million or approximately 0.1% product mix shift to lower-priced products and geographic mix. Q4 2024 Clear Aligner per case shipment of $1,265 was down $55 on a year-over-year basis due to the impact of U.K. VAT of $13, product and geographic mix, and higher discounts, partially offset by lower net revenue deferrals and price increases. During Q4, we reached a favorable outcome with the U.K. tax authorities regarding cumulative assessments of approximately $100 million for unpaid VAT related to certain Clear Aligner sales made during the period of October 2019 through October 2023. In Q4, we received a full refund of this $100 million from U.K. tax authorities. This settlement also relieved us of any potential assessments for sales through mid-October 2023. As a result, we have approximately $7 million of VAT paid for periods up to December 2023 that are still in dispute. We expect a ruling by the UK courts in the first half of 2024 for this remaining VAT amount. This ruling will also give clarity whether a 20% VAT is required to be applied to all Clear Aligner sales in the UK going forward. We believe that Clear Aligner should continue to be exempt from that. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, decreased $51.3 million or 4.1% sequentially and decreased $92.1 million or 7% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped under each sales contract. Q4 2024, Systems and Services revenues of $200.9 million were up 5.2% sequentially, primarily due to higher scanner volumes, higher non-systems revenue, driven by iTero Lumina upgrades, partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Q4 2024, Systems and Services revenue were up 14.9% year-over-year, primarily due to higher scanner volumes, higher ASP and increased non-systems revenues, mostly related to upgrades and leasing rental programs. Q4 2024, Systems and Services revenue impact by foreign exchange was approximately $0.1 million, flat sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $0.2 million or approximately 0.1%. Systems and Services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was down $4.1 million or 1.8% sequentially, and down $40.3 million, or 15.5% year-over-year, primarily due to the recognition of service revenues, which are recognized ratably over the service period. The decline in deferred revenues, both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily reflects the shorter duration of service contracts applicable to initial scanner purchases. Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 70%, up 0.3 points sequentially and flat year-over-year. Overall, total gross margin was not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially or on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.2%, down 0.1 points sequentially due primarily to lower ASPs and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was down one point year-over-year, primarily due to lower ASP and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower additional aligners. Overall, Clear Aligner gross margin was not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially or on a year-over-year basis. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 69.4%, up 1.9 points sequentially due to lower manufacturing and freight costs, partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 4.7 points year-over-year due to manufacturing efficiencies and lower freight costs and service cost and higher scanner ASPs. Overall, Systems and Services gross margin was not impacted by foreign exchange sequentially or on a year-over-year basis. Q4 operating expenses were $552.8 million, up 6.4% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were $33.3 million higher due primarily to restructuring costs. Year-over-year operating expenses increased by $54.8 million, primarily due to restructuring, advertising and marketing expenses. Q4 restructuring charges related to severance for impacted employees were higher than anticipated. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $474.7 million, up 0.4% sequentially and up 6.3% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating income of $144.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 14.5%, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 3.4 points year-over-year. Operating margin was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.1 points sequentially and unfavorably impacted by 0.2 points year-over-year. The effective restructuring on GAAP operating margin was approximately 3.7 points. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 23.2%, up 1.1 points sequentially and down 0.6 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was an expense of $3.4 million compared to income of $3.6 million in Q3 2024, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange movements of $15.3 million, partially offset by higher interest income and gain on investments. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 2024 interest and other income and expense was unfavorable compared to income of $1.3 million in Q4 2023, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange movements, partially offset by higher interest income and gain on investments. The GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.3% compared to 30.1% in the third quarter and 28.3% in the fourth the fourth quarter of prior year. The quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves, partially offset by onetime deferred tax adjustments in certain foreign jurisdictions. The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the fourth quarter effective tax rate of the prior year, primarily due to the release of certain tax position reserves, partially offset by one-time deferred tax adjustments in certain foreign jurisdictions. On a non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20%, which reflects our long-term projected tax rate. Fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $1.39, down $0.16 sequentially and $0.25 compared to the prior year. Our Q4 2024 EPS was unfavorably impacted by a stronger US dollar, which amounted to approximately $0.14 per diluted share to net foreign exchange losses related to the revaluation of certain balance sheet accounts. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 2024 net income per diluted share was $2.44 for the fourth quarter, up $0.9 sequentially and up $0.02 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $1,043.9 million, up sequentially $2 million and down $106.4 million year-over-year. Of our $1,043.9 billion balance, $188.7 million was held in the US and $855.2 million was held by our international entities. During Q4 2024, we initiated a plan to repurchase $275 million of our common stock through open market repurchases. As of December 31, 2024, we had purchased approximately 0.9 million shares at an average price of $222.94 per share for an aggregate of approximately $202.9 million. The remaining $72.1 million of the $275 million was completed in January of 2025. As of January 30, 2025, $225 million remains available for repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program approved in January of 2023. As Joe mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we completed a $30 million equity investment in Smile Doctors, the largest ortho-focused dental support organization in the US. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $995.7 million, down sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 90 days, down approximately three days sequentially and up approximately five days as compared to Q4 last year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $286.1 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $23 million, primarily related to investments in our manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $263 million. Before I turn to our Q1 and fiscal 2025 outlook, I'd like to provide the following context around pricing and potential new tariffs. On March 1, 2025, we will raise the list price of clear aligners by about 3% on average in the Americas and EMEA regions. At the same time, we will remove the $10 to $15 per order processing fee for all new clear aligner orders, all new clear aligner refinement orders from past cases and non-DSP Vivera cases. We expect the net effect from these two actions on ASPs to be zero for 2025. We currently manufacture clear aligners in Mexico and ship them to the US primarily for our US customers, with the remainder eventually shipping to other international locations. The US-Mexico tariff situation remains very fluid, and we are unable to predict whether new tariffs will go into effect in the future. We are monitoring events closely. Our Clear Aligner COGS include material, labor, overhead and freight costs. We expect an incremental tariff if implemented, to be applied to transfer prices from Mexico shipments to the US. These transfer prices would not include treatment planning costs, freight and other overhead and similar costs. Align's global operations have evolved significantly over the past several years, and we have greater flexibility to support our global business. However, assuming a new 25% tariff on shipments the US from Mexico, we believe it still would be more economically viable to ship clear aligners from the US -- to the US for Mexico due to a variety of factors, including the incremental additional freight costs incurred, where we shipped from our Polish facility. Regarding China, we currently manufacture our products in China for the benefit of our customers China. With that as a backdrop, assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, including foreign exchange and new tariffs, for Q1 2025 and fiscal 2025, we provide the following outlook. We expect Q1 worldwide revenues to be in the range of $965 million to $985 million, down sequentially from Q4, primarily due to the impact from foreign exchange rates at current spot rates and lower capital equipment sales, reflecting historical Q1 seasonality. We expect Q1 Clear Aligner volume to be up slightly sequentially and expect Q1 Clear Aligner ASPs to be down sequentially, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates as well as continued product mix shift to non-comprehensive Clear Aligners. In addition to seasonality, we expect Q1 Systems and Services revenue to be down sequentially due to the timing of commercial availability of our iTero Lumina scanner with restorative software, which is expected at the end of March. We expect our Q1 2025 GAAP operating margin to be below Q1 2024 GAAP operating margin by approximately 2 points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates. We expect our Q1 2025 non-GAAP operating margin to be below Q1 2024 non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 1 point, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates. For fiscal 2025, we expect 2025 year-over-year revenue growth to be in the low single-digits, which reflects approximately 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates. We expect 2025 Clear Aligner volume growth to be up approximately mid-single-digits year-over-year compared to up 3.5% year-over-year in 2025. We expect 2025 Clear Aligner ASPs to be down year-over-year due to unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates and continued product mix shift to noncompetitive, non-comprehensive Clear Aligners. We expect 2025 Systems and Services year-over-year revenues to grow faster than Clear Aligner revenues. We expect 2025 GAAP operating margin to be approximately 2 points above 2024 GAAP operating margin, and we expect 2025 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 22.5%, which both reflect the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates, partially offset by the benefits from restructuring actions we took in Q4 to improve profitability and give us margin accretion in 2025, even as we scale our next-generation direct 3D printing fabrication manufacturing. We expect our investments in capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 to be between $100 million and $150 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements, as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued expansion. Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 results, particularly the year-over-year Clear Aligner volume growth, the record number of submitters, the continued momentum from our Systems and Services business, and our operating margin improvement. After repurchasing $353 million of our Align common stock during 2024, we continued -- we concluded the year with no debt and approximately $1.044 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our goal, as always, is to deliver value to our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call -- now I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe? Joe Hogan : Thanks John. In closing, 2024 was a year of solid progress across the business. Record full year total worldwide revenues of $4 billion, record full year total worldwide System and Services revenue of $769 million, record teen shipments and growth in both teens and adult markets, record 130,400 doctors shipped to, 19.5 million total patients treated, with 5.6 million teens in kids. We ended the year with over $1 billion in cash and equivalents after repurchasing 1.5 million shares for $353 million. In another year where the dental industry is down and we continue to grow, I feel good about where we ended the year, and I'm excited to kick off 2025 with a team focused on building the innovations introduced in 2024 that drive efficiency and growth for practices and that are committed in delivering the best customer and patient experiences in the industry. I want to highlight just a few of the Align innovations that we introduced in 2024 that we believe will continue to drive adoption and utilization. In January 2024, we unveiled a breakthrough technology, the iTero Lumina intraoral scanner with 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller wand that delivers faster scanning, higher accuracy and superior visualization for greater practice efficiency and with orthodontic workflows. We look forward to introducing at the end of Q1 2025, the iTero Lumina intraoral scanner with software capabilities to enable efficient restorative and ortho restorative workloads to help general practitioner dentists deliver exceptional restorative outcomes. The iTero scanner is the front end of Align digital platform, designed to give doctors the capability to run simulations and communicate with patients, so the patients can see their smiles and the time that it would take them to get that outcome. It's also a big part of our growth algorithm, and we've had good accretive margin on the iTero Lumina scanner product since its launch. We also started rolling out ClinCheck in minutes, delivering treatment plans based on doctors building personalized treatment preferences for almost touchless digital workflows, which we'll expand to more doctors this year, bringing an unprecedented level of speed and customization to digital treatment planning. Changing the paradigm for how doctors can treat growing patients is one of our biggest opportunities. As we continue to deliver innovations that help doctors achieve more of a treatment at younger ages, potentially decreasing the amount of orthodontic treatment that younger and teen patients need overall. As we continue to commercialize the Invisalign Palatal Expander system, Align's first direct 3D-printed device that provides doctors with a solution set to treat the most common skeletal and dental malocclusions in growing children, we anticipate introducing the next in a series of direct 3D-printed devices with a pilot for Invisalign First direct printed retainers in the first half of 2025. We have also Invisalign mandibular advancement with the occlusal blocks now in limited market release, giving doctors and patients a better option for Class II correction in younger patients while simultaneously strengthening their team. We're also excited about the future of digital orthodontics focused on growth opportunities as a company while driving margin improvement and our unique ability to leverage aggregated and anonymized data from approximately 19.5 million Invisalign cases to continue to gain more knowledge about the science of orthodontics to move the industry forward. And while we're now in our 28th year, in the same way, we're just at the beginning. It's that motivating and exciting for the whole Align team. With that, I thank you for your time today. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming quarters. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator? Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Michael Cherny from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good afternoon, and thank you for a ton of detail already. Maybe if I could just dive in a bit to the guidance, especially on the Clear Aligner side. Is there any way to give a little bit more of a breakdown as you think about the dynamics on volume versus price? Hear you loud and clear on the ASP impact from FX. But curious how to the growth dynamics on aligners as a whole, especially coming off of the mix of, obviously, easier comps in 2024 versus what's still an uncertain macro environment? Thank you. John Morici : Yeah. Michael, this is John. When we talk about the -- kind of give picture for the total year, we're looking at volume for Clear Aligners at up mid-single digits, and that's how we look at that. It varies like it does across different regions and different times of the year and so on. But we've looked at it that way, and that's the perspective that we have for year. We were pleased with how we exited in 2024 with the volumes that we had, and that's the overall guidance that we have for the year. Michael Cherny : And just along those lines and the volumes, mid-single digits, obviously, a really solid number. How do you think about the competitive dynamics in the market now? And are there opportunities either in terms of other competitors exiting? Or how do you think about the components of what drives that in terms of market dynamics, competitive dynamics, share gains, anything more to break down that obviously strong number would be great as well. Thank you so much. Joe Hogan : Yeah. And Michael, it's Joe. I think on the competitive dynamics, I don't see a big change in the dynamics when you look at 2024 and 2025. Overall, we feel our new innovation all continues to put us ahead. Obviously, the Minute ClinCheck really drives our super users to a level of productivity they haven't had before. So I feel really good about our competitive ability all around the world, including China, including some specific areas about it. So as we move into 2025, I really feel that we're gaining momentum in that sense. Operator : Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks so much for the question. I was wondering, if you could talk about two things. Maybe as regards to the Lumina and the scanner business more broadly, it looked like you were -- you obviously have the launch coming up in the first quarter. So if you could talk a little bit on your expectations for that, maybe given what you've learned on the ortho side for Lumina? And then two, you talked about sort of the impact, obviously, of more leases and things like that versus perhaps capital equipment sales. Can you talk about, sort of, help us understand maybe on a unit basis, how you're thinking about the growth in that business? I think that would be one thing that would be helpful. And then maybe if you could also help us understand a little bit better that maybe some of the growth dynamics, particularly in North America, DSO versus non-DSO customers? Thank you. Joe Hogan : Elizabeth, it's Joe. I'll take the first part of your question. When you look at what we learned in the orthodontic release of Lumina was a product was everything we hoped it would be. I talked about the wider field of view, the speed. I didn't talk a lot the optics. So image quality is fantastic on the product line. The lightness of the one and all that was really important for the technicians that that use wand day in and day out because in the past, we had a lot of complaints in the sense of the heaviness and kind of bulkiness of the wands that are in the marketplace right now, particularly on the confocal imaging side. So as we move that into more of the restorative marketplace, remember, we had a good take-up of GPs using that product line last year, too. This will complete the -- the whole system for GPs because they can do the restorative work they had on it and not just the orthodontic side. So we're excited about it. We're looking forward to it. Obviously, we'll talk about it coming up at the IDS, and we look forward to launching it in March and then bringing you through the second quarter. John Morici : And as Joe said, kind of to your second part of the question, Elizabeth, look, this rounds out our portfolio. We've got a complete portfolio from the most advanced scanner and the latest with Lumina to all other types of products that we have, all the way down to certified pre-owned. And so that portfolio is rounded up, but we also, as you mentioned, the leasing and other rental, we offer a lot of options for our customers. Some customers want to buy, and they want that legacy equipment, that's great, and they'll buy that new equipment, do trade-ins or just add another scanner and so on. But some also don't want to put that capital up, especially in this environment. So we offer them a lot of different opportunities to lease that equipment to use external financing that gets them at a good rate for external financing to purchase, or some just want to rent it. And so we feel like we can offer that customer any which way that they want to be able to utilize our equipment. And as we continue to release new products, keep we surf pre-owned in and so on. We're just expanding our base, which is helpful for our overall business. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Elizabeth. Next question, Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question will come from the line of Glen Santangelo from Jefferies. Your line is open. Glen Santangelo : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Joe, I also want to follow up on this volume issue because it seems like in the fourth quarter and into 2025, you're forecasting some pretty decent volumes. And I'm kind of curious, could you put that in the context of where you think the overall ortho industry is now? Do you feel like you're kind of getting some share back because in 2024, in 2023, the theme was macro uncertainty, but you're not really talking about that anymore? And I'm just kind of curious if you think maybe the industries get a little bit better? Or is some of these DTC offerings that may be faded into the background, like what's enabling you to improve your volume, you think? And then I just had a follow-up for John. Joe Hogan : Yes, Glen, it's a good question. I think we've been talking about stability for a while now, too. And again, I think we stand on that platform also. Each one of these regions are different from what we've seen. We felt good about Europe in the fourth quarter. We saw some momentum there, felt reasonable about APAC in a sense, I mentioned China and Japan. And increases in Thailand and different in China and different -- I mean, in different parts of the APAC region. When you come to the United States, the orthodontic marketplace, Glen, has really been flat for the last three years. Now, I think we made progress, good progress with the new products that we've had. But we've been challenged in that segment. And I wouldn't call it so much competition as I would -- it's been a wires and brackets kind of regression in that marketplace because of when doctors are seeing less patient throughput, they're looking to save margin, and it's difficult to really appeal to them with clear aligners when they're not at capacity in that sense. But on the counter of that, Glen, we've seen really good progress in GPs and good growth in GPs, not just in the US but all over the world, and that's really helped us. And so remember, we changed our channel strategy years ago to make sure that we went to the GP channel with the GP sales force and ortho, with ortho sales force, too. And I think that's really helped us to give us insight into the industry and position our products properly for both those areas. So I hope that helps to answer your question. I think our new technology, too, gives us a lot of confidence. Specifically in the orthodontic channel since offering differentiation, those early patients that we talked about. We feel we have the three products I mentioned in my script, we feel we have something that's special in the orthodontic community in a sense of that younger patient piece, and you'll see us push that really hard as we move into 2025. Glen Santangelo : That's awesome. And John, maybe if I could just follow up with you on this ASP issue, right? I mean, obviously, everyone is focused on the fact that ASPs will be down. And you highlighted FX and you highlighted mix shift. I was wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit to tell us -- and I'm sorry if I missed this, exactly how much FX is playing a role here on that ASP number in 2025? John Morici : Yes. Yes. That's a good question, Glen. Overall, when we look at 2025 in terms of how we've guided, we have about 2 points of FX headwind on a year-over-year basis. It's just the strengthening of the dollar. We saw that as it came out October and it continues to be strong November, December, January. We're basically forecasting what we see now on a spot rate standpoint and expecting it to be strong, and that impact is about 2 points unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block : Thanks, guys. Hey, Joe. First one, the 1Q 2025 revenue guidance is down around 2% at the midpoint. The full year revenue guidance is up low-single digits. And I think some of that is the 1Q comp, I believe also the scanner timing, if you would, due to the Resto launch. But I think it's an important question, Joe. Can you talk about other reasons why the rest of the year, you're arguably up, call it like low to mid-single digits versus the down 2% and 1Q 2025, again it's a guide? And then I think what people are going to be worried about is, is there an embedded assumption that things pick up in the guide? Or is it just sort of the moving parts again of the comp, the Resto launch, et cetera? And I'll sort of pause there and then I'll ask my follow-up. Joe Hogan : John, I'd say we obviously introducing the restorative scanner in March, we don't get the full benefit of that in the first quarter, and you're accurate in the sense of reflecting that in your comments overall. I would say we're not talking about a build as we go through the year. I think you have to look at exchange on a whole thing, and John can explain that in a sense of how we've baked that in overall. But obviously, you have a full year of IPE coming in this year. We have the regulatory approvals for that going into Europe and different parts of Asia, too, and we think we'll hit mainstream in that end too. And may deal with advancement with a plus of blocks too is another one that we think is going to be a specific grower for us also. So I mean, that's how I'd pretty much tackle that is that we have new technology rolling in. You have the iTero restorative coming in also. And John, what would you add? John Morici : Yes. And we're not expecting, Jon, any overall improvement in the macro economy. If it happens, great, that will be good for the entire business. But we're not expecting an overall improvement there. We did see as we came out of Q4, I mean, just the 6% growth in volume in Q4, that's the highest growth that we've seen in three years on a year-over-year basis. So that's good to see. We want to continue to see that that momentum. And like Joe said, we're doing everything we can with new products, new innovations, new ways to go to market to be able to continue that. Jon Block : Yes. No, beat on balance, got it ahead on balance for 1Q, I get that. And then just second question is, I think, Joe, this one is for you. But for a couple of quarters now, at least two, maybe more, we've heard you detail, call it, the faster growth from the DSOs. And so a couple of questions here. Joe, what is are the DSOs, call it, as a part of your North American business, if you could just give us a rough number? But more importantly, the plays that you run with the DSOs -- and we've heard of some those, the marketing support -- pardon -- this is my language, not your -- they might be more sophisticated with your help. Are those transferable to the fragmented GP market? And if so, how long does that take to go ahead and manifest on your part? Because clearly, if you could extrapolate that faster growth to the individual practices, that would be -- certainly, I'm positive and something to get excited about. So, maybe your comments on, again, the percent of their weighting of your bids? And more importantly, can you see yourself running the same plays with the individual practices? Joe Hogan : Hey Jon, it's a great question. Really, first of all, I look at -- I talk about it internally, too. I look at DSOs as a force multiplier. They can actually take our technology, what we learned in a sense of a sense of efficiency, what we learned from brand, from a demographic zone brand you can apply to. And they just have an ability to be able to disseminate that within their teams. Much better than doing that individually door-to-door like we do with our normal sales force, which is kind of obvious. But that doesn't preclude us from what we're taking to the DSOs in the sense of what we know and what they incorporate. Our salespeople are -- many of them have been with us many years, they understand that also. They just have to find the right orthodontists and the right general dentists to really want to implement those procedures in their marketplace. That's why I -- talking about the sales kickoff the other day down in Dallas. And it said that we have the longest or the hardest last mile of any company I've ever worked with because you are calling on these individual family-driven practices. And not that they're stupid or anything, they are very smart. But they're very -- not necessarily business minded always. They're clinically minded, and it takes a while to gain their confidence and move it forward. DSOs help to accelerate that, Jon, is the best way I can explain that. Jon, you've got-- Jon Block : Thanks for the color guys. Joe Hogan : Jon, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Saxon from Needham. Your line is open. David Saxon : Great. Good afternoon Jon and John. Thanks for taking my questions. Yes, I had a couple of follow-ups on the guide for Clear Aligner. So, mid-single-digit volume growth for Clear Aligners. Joe, based on your answer to a previous question, it sounds like U.S. volume growth should probably be slower than international, but I just wanted to confirm that's how you're thinking about it? And then on the ASP side, to down year-on-year for the full year, first quarter ASPs look be to down high single-digits year-on-year based off of the first quarter ASP guidance. But you have this price increase starting in second quarter. So, just I'd love to hear how we should think about pricing in quarters two through four on a year-over-year basis? Joe Hogan : Hey David, I'll take the first part of your question, which, yes, our forecast for next year does imply a slower U.S. than the rest of the world. And that's -- to me, that's -- we're just projecting what we saw in 2024 into 2025. But we don't have any data right now that would make us change that in some way from a consumer confidence. And to see or any kind of change in the last several quarters, I would say that it would be different going. As far as ASPs go... John Morici : Look, ASPs, they're heavily impacted with our business, over 50% of it outside the U.S. They're impacted by a stronger dollar. And I just tried to make it very clear in terms of our guidance based on what those spot rates are as of now and saying this is how it's going to play out in the future. Obviously, it changes. And -- but at least give you a reference point to jump off of. So when you look at Q1, you'd see that ASPs will be down. It's a reflection of the foreign exchange, and that's the primary driver of that. It will change as it goes through each of the quarters. I mean, by the end of the year, it kind of catches up, and that strength of the dollar that we saw in November and December won't have as much a year-over-year impact. But in Q1, it has that impact. David Saxon : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then maybe sticking with you, John. So operating margin down year-on-year in the first quarter, but guiding to expansion for the full year. So I'd love to just hear kind of the puts and takes that drive that ramp? And maybe it would be great if you could talk about quarterly cadence. Thanks so much. John Morici : Yes. When you think of the op margin that we'll have, we did actions last year to be able to get our op margin in a place from a cost standpoint to be able to provide that margin accretion. The first quarter is one where, as you start to ramp up, usually first quarter op margin is and at a rate standpoint, the lowest or one of the lowest for the quarters as you -- it builds as you go through year. It's based on volume. As we have more volume coming through our facilities, we generate additional productivity, and that shows up. We have new products, as Joe described, with the Lumina Restorative, different products where we're expanding out and so on that help us drive additional margin as we go through. So we've got the levers that we can pull and adjust as we go through the year to be able to generate that margin accretion on a year-over-year basis. And that is margin accretion that we talked about at 22.5%, that's despite unfavorable FX on a year-over-year basis. So you can tell some of that margin accretion that that we're talking about. But it's -- it's all about driving productivity through volume you have and being smart about the other investments that you're making. David Saxon : Great. Thanks so much. John Morici : Thanks, David. Operator : One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. Joe Hogan : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Johnson : Hi, thanks. Hi, Joe, how are you? Good afternoon, guys. So look, we're all going around kind of this 1Q, trying to understand it relative to the rest of the year. The one thing I haven't heard and maybe I just missed it, but you guys are talking about a 200 basis point headwind for the year from currency. I think that is pretty much flow through to ASP as to ASP as well, about a two-point headwind for the year well on the Clear Aligner side. But I haven't heard you quantify Q1. My math and my currency math is terrible, but my math would put currency at almost a 3, 3.5 point headwind in 1Q to both ASPs and global revenue. Am I close on that? Is it bigger in 1Q? John Morici : Yes. That's the right way to phrase it, Jeff. It is bigger just based on what the dollar was doing last year compared to this year. So there is a bigger currency effect in Q1 than on average for the year. Jeff Johnson : Ballpark, am I close on that 3, 3.5? John Morici : Yes. You're close on that. Jeff Johnson : Okay. And then just my other question is really kind of the same kind of FX question, but on the gross margin side -- sorry, on the company margin side, on the operating margin side. You're guiding to 70 basis points of year-over-year improvement at the op margin line on a non-GAAP basis. How much is currency weighing on, I don't care if it's gross margin or operating margin, however you want to provide the answer. But how much is currency weighing there? And then how much of the incremental direct fab investments potentially weighing this year on gross or overall margin? It seems like this could have been a year if currency neutral and you didn't have the direct fab incremental investments that we really would have started to see a recapture back towards those pre-COVID numbers. So just trying to understand all those moving pieces? Thank you. John Morici : Yeah. Jeff, when you talk about the FX impact on op margins, its over one point, you're right, it's two points at revenue on a year-over-year basis, falls to just over one point on an op margin basis. So a large part of that falls through. So, you're right, calling 70 basis point improvement year-over-year. That's despite having one point of op margin pressure from an FX standpoint. And then, of course, all the other things that we're doing to invest in. So and there's some offsets to that in terms of scaling up our growth platforms and so on. But that's all in the number that we have at the 22.5%. So if FX was going the other way, you would see even more margin accretion, and we'll see how that foreign exchange plays out as we go through the rest of the year. Jeff Johnson : Understood. Thank you guys. Joe Hogan : Thanks Jeff. Operator : One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Vazquez from William Blair. Your line is open. Brandon Vazquez : Hi, everyone. Thanks. Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Joe, maybe for you on the IPE side, I think we're a little bit over year after the launch of that product now. Curious if you could comment on maybe two things. One, what's the adoption curve looking like relative to your expectations now that we're about a year in? And then two, is this a product that could maybe be a catalyst within the teen market to let you get that next incremental leg of adoption given that that's kind of the third year end market that you guys are underpenetrated in? Joe Hogan : Yeah. Brad, first of all, I mean, the adoption curve has been good, as I mentioned in my script, it follows Invisalign First. Invisalign First is what we call a dental expansion product. It's kind of moving your teeth, but it's not moving bone in that sense. In this case with IP, we're moving bone. And so that's why the regulatory things and all that I mentioned that we have to go through each region in order to move that through. I feel really good about it. It's such a breakthrough product and a different product. It takes doctors a while in a number of cases to become comfortable with it. We have a wonderful feedback from patients in the sense of the comfort of the product line. And many of the patients or parents have gone through the Hi-Res [ph] device and the wrench and those kind of things. And that makes parents a little more susceptible to wanting Invisalign Palatal Expander too. So I feel good about it. We've had some things too on the release. We didn't have full visualization from a scanning standpoint when we first started. There were some attachment pieces that we had to improve in the sense of how you attach. And then there's also some just wearability aspects about how long you wear this. But we've come over those and we're making good progress in it. So I'm very optimistic about it. And it's great to see it really go from a regional standpoint to a global standpoint now. But we have a great one, two punch in that marketplace with Invisalign First. And that's also worth mentioning, too, we're seeing many doctors, as they do the upper palate expansion, they use Invisalign First on the bottom in order to expand the teeth to be -- to make sure that they're in line with the sense of the bite as they're setting in their upper arch, too. So it's good to see a synergistic effect on those two products. I hope I answered your question, but that's the momentum that we're talking about. Brandon Vazquez : Yeah. Maybe as a quick follow-up on a separate note. International has been more durable for you guys in the Americas these days. Is that simply a result of just being earlier in the adoption curve and so things are doing a little bit better there? Or is macro and international just doing a little bit better than the Americas? Just trying to understand how durable international outperforming should be as we go into 2025 even if macro and Americas stays relatively muted? Thanks. Joe Hogan : It's hard to be discrete on that answer. Overall, Brandon, I would say there are certain areas where, obviously, it's the initial penetration of our product line in certain area, but I certainly wouldn't say that about Latin America. We've been now for many years and we see continued growth in that sense. Middle East, Africa in those areas too, some of the places of Africa are new, and they'll hit a certain inflection point. But overall, I feel like we face better economies in those regions. They didn't necessarily, I think, overextend their economies, the way we saw in the Western world and which has affected a large part of Western Europe and also in the United States. And specifically in Asia, outside of China, the other countries in Asia just came back out of COVID in a better position than we were before. But some of those countries are penetration. Some of those countries are just expansion too. So I think overall, it's just a good mix there, Brandon. And I like that. It's good to have. And then as you roll out these new technologies, remember it offers you new opportunities in those countries, too. So that expansion piece can continue. Shirley Stacy : Thanks, Brandon. Operator, we want to try and get through the covering analysts that are still on the line. So -- and if I can ask folks to limit to one question so we can get through everyone's questions, please. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Jason Bednar : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'll try be an quick here. I really want to ask on just maybe thematically reducing frictions -- I'm sorry, trailing to pack kind of a combo in here, but this is -- is there a way to reduce frictions within the teen channel and really address what has been maybe a bit of a challenge or sluggish ortho environment? Anything that you can do from a marketing initiative to really create better demand pull effect? And then also on the friction side, maybe help with the business rationale, removing that $10 to $15 process, and you see you all neutralizing it with price increases. Is that -- have you had pushback on the processing fees? Has this caused friction with doctors that you're trying to remove? Thank you. Joe Hogan : Yeah, Jason, that's a good question. First of all, the friction in teen channel is -- a lot of it has to do with the economics in the orthodontists office today. We talked about the orthodontic offices in the United States haven't really -- in North America haven't seen really any substantial growth in the last three years. And so again, there are individual practices, and I think they're trying to maximize their bottom line as much as they can. And so I think they've been very cautious from a business standpoint. The friction you talked about with our processing fees and all, those are real. We have a pushback, not as much in Asia. We had a lot of pushback in Europe and in the US on that. And we decided to roll that back with that aggregate price increase. And we have a good response from our doctors in order to do that. And that is a friction piece. And it was -- to me, it was an annoyance to the sales team to have to kind of fight through that when they had to talk to doctors in either joining what we were doing or having been with us for a while and explaining those things. So I think that's very helpful. John, I'm sure you have some ideas to it. John Morici : I mean, in the end, we want to focus on driving this driving this business, category, driving our products too and less about some of the other minor things like this with processing fees and so on. So this is a good opportunity to kind of put this together, get it in the right place and talk about the future of the business versus some of the other past expenses like this. Shirley Stacy : Yes. Thanks. Jason Bednar : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Steven Valiquette from Mizuho. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Thanks everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So obviously, there's a lot of puts and takes related to the evolving tariff situation. But one area I was just hoping to get your thoughts on is given that there's a large competitor Chinese base as some investors are watching closely as that competitor tries to establish a larger market share in the US market, really, with this new political backdrop for the next four years under the new administration, I'm wondering whether some practitioners in the US may be a little more hesitant to want to buy into the ecosystem of really any competitors that are headquartered or based outside the US, just given the heightened risk of trade wars, et cetera. So perhaps I could play into your hands favorably, at least in the US market, which I think it's still your biggest market. So just a high level, just curious to get your thoughts on that potential dynamic? Thanks. Joe Hogan : Hi, Steven, it is, just to confirm, US is still our biggest market in the world in that sense. Remember, I just talked about the orthodontic market not really growing for the last three years, too. So we have had competition. Obviously, we know that your comments really refer to Angel Aligner or maybe some other Chinese suppliers coming in. I think overall, you first win with customer service and you win with technology, you win with relationships, and that's what our sales force is really talking about. We felt that the Chinese have come in on unsustainable prices. When you look at -- we kind of know the prices you have to charge in order to have a decent return. And we think that always takes care of itself one way or another, and we've seen that with other competitors in the marketplace also. So I don't \u2013 I can't really speak for 10,000 orthos or GPs that are around the United States and how they feel about international politics or anything they do. But our job is to make sure that we keep our heads down. We deliver the best technology, best productivity, the best brand, all those things to make sure we win in the marketplace, and we'll let that other piece decide for itself. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for the question. This is Dylan on from \u2013 Dylan Kim on for Kevin. Thanks for the question. A quick question on direct fabrication. You guys previously have talked to potentially commercializing products this year, I believe, starting with the retainer product. So any update there on commercialization of products? And maybe detail on the P&L too into both revenue and investment into costs, into the manufacturing capabilities that you can call out? Joe Hogan : First of all, I'd say our IPE device is 3D printed, but it's not the Cubicure process and it's not the resin that we'll used in the Cubicure process. So as I mentioned in my script, we will begin to -- just with limited release, an Invisalign First retainer. Invisalign First retainer is a very complicated. It has to have a high modulus. It has to have a huge amount of variability in the sense of how you structure that depending on where that person's arch is at that point in time. And it's the perfect fit for us as we try to ramp up and we ramp up our new our new Cubicure process with resin too. So again, like I mentioned, you'll see just the beginning of that in the first half of this year. And in the second half of this year, we should begin to get ourselves more ready for general release in third and fourth quarters of that product line. That's the beginning. After that, we'll move into what we call mandibular advancement. But any kind of aligners that have auxiliary types of things that you would have to have printed on those or difficult cases where wall thicknesses need to be different in some ways. So, we're really excited about the efficiency of that particular technology, but also the design and incredible design capability and design freedom orthodontists will have in order to do that. So, that's about as well as I can do for you now. Shirley Stacy : Thanks. Next question please. Operator : Our next question from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just one quick one for me, hopefully. John, I appreciate the commentary you had on tariffs to Mexico and realize there's still a lot of moving pieces, but I just want to make sure I understood that. Just a comment on transfer prices. I mean, I hear you on overhead and freight cost, treatment planning not being included. How should we think of it as a percent of your COGS? I think if you just go through the P&L with something like $375 COGS per case roughly? Is the transfer -- like how much would be impacted? Is it 50% to 75% of that? And just walk us through the transfer price math, just so we can--? John Morici : No, it's a good question, Mike. And you're right. I tried to give a perspective of, look, you start with COGS and then there's some hard COGS that have nothing to do with what we're doing in Mexico freight and treatment planning and other things, specifically the value add and the work that's being done there than that transfer price. I guess to put it in perspective in terms of -- there's been a lot of people thinking about what this could be, just based on your question and so on. But like on an average month, that tariff, if it's that 25%, might impact us $4 million to $5 million of cost or that might be the cost perspective of this. So, that gives you an idea of like how this kind of fits into this. This is something, as I said in my prepared remarks -- look, if at that amount of tariffs, 25%, if that ever was implemented, it's not a big enough cost on tariff for us to switch some of the manufacturing and move from perhaps manufacturing in Mexico to Poland. But we'll evaluate that as we go forward. But I just want to kind of size that for you. We'll evaluate as we go forward, we'll understand more as these days come about. We hope there's not anything, but we have a perspective in terms of what it means from a cost standpoint, and we will make decisions based on that. And that will impact us what we do in the short and long-term. Michael Ryskin : Thank you. Thanks. Shirley Stacy : Operator, we'll take one last question. Operator : And our last question will come from the line of Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a follow-up on that last one. Just to clarify, so there's no buffer kind of embedded in your guidance as it stands today from a tariff perspective? And just on China, just the environment there, not necessarily from a tariff perspective, but just more so from demand trends? And even China from a competitive standpoint, I guess, expectations for the balance of the year, if you could touch on those? Thanks. John Morici : That's great, Erin. I'll take the first one on tariffs. So we're not in our forecast and what we've given for guidance at that margin of 22.5%. There's no additional new tariffs that we've contemplated in that number. So, we'll see how things come about. But in the framework, if there is a tariff, and it should be 25% from Mexico to the U.S., it's $4 million to $5 million depending on volume per month from an expense standpoint. And then on China, I don't know if you want to give -- Joe, any other perspective on the kind of the market there? Joe Hogan : I'd say the China market, we were pleased with the third quarter. The fourth quarter, obviously, is always less in China what the third quarter was. There was nothing in that that quarter made me think that anything was different in China and since its trajected the business, from what we've seen. So overall, I'd call China stable right now. Erin Wright : Okay. Thank you. John Morici : Thank you. Joe Hogan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And I will now turn the call over back to Shirley Stacy for any closing remarks. Shirley Stacy : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. We appreciate it. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations. We look forward to seeing you at our next industry events, including the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show coming up here later in February. I hope everyone has a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Everyone, have a great day.",
