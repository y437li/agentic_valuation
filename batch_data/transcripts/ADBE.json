Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. Adobe is redefining the Creative and Digital Marketing categories with our industry-leading cloud offerings. Through a steady stream of innovation, we will expand adoption of Creative Cloud; grow multi-solution sales of Adobe Marketing Cloud; and drive integration across our cloud offerings. We made progress on all fronts this quarter. In Q1, we achieved $1 billion in revenue, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30. We drove strong performance across key growth metrics, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, annualized recurring revenue or ARR, and Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings. In Digital Media, Creative Cloud momentum continued. Creative Cloud ARR grew to just under $1 billion in Q1 and we exited with over 1.8 million subscriptions. Driving that customer adoption and satisfaction is the ongoing flow of innovation in the Creative Cloud platform. Coming off our delivery of more than 500 new features and capabilities last year to Creative Cloud subscribers and enterprise users, in Q1 we delivered numerous updates including major features in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. We are excited about the amazing innovation we will deliver in a major update to Creative Cloud in the next few months. Our digital publishing business continues its momentum, where we are building on our success with publishers in the corporate market, like General Motors and Disney. Last month, we announced the integration of Digital Publishing Suite and Adobe Experience Manager, part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud. This integration enables publishers and brands to create, deliver, and measure experiences across the web and content-rich apps like digital magazines using one set of assets. This enables a faster and more efficient publishing process. In Document Services, Acrobat continued to achieve solid performance, with online document services continuing their momentum. EchoSign adoption continues, with brands including Citrix, Electronic Arts, Kia, NEC Financial Services and UC Berkeley using our eSignature platform. Combined with Acrobat ETLAs, Document Services ARR grew to $164 million exiting Q1. Between our Creative and Document Services businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $1.15 billion at the end of Q1. In Digital Marketing, Adobe Marketing Cloud achieved 24% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. We continue to have the most comprehensive offering in the market for Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Revenue Officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers. To create even more impact for our marketing customers, we are focused on integrating our six Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. In January, we announced the integration of Adobe Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager. This will allow marketers to use a single digital asset management repository and integrate data from anonymous visitors and identified customers to create personalized customer experiences. Campaign is off to a strong start, as it addresses marketers\u2019 challenge to manage communications with their customers across multiple channels. Examples of customers licensing multiple Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions in Q1 included GMC, Kohl\u2019s, MGM, NBC Universal and Under Armour. Last month, we had an exciting event when NBC Sports used Adobe Primetime to deliver the Sochi Olympics to desktops, tablets and other mobile devices. Millions of viewers were able to access events live and on-demand. NBC was able to use Primetime\u2019s analytics, authentication, ad delivery and media playback capabilities to stream video across screens. With more than 10.2 million video stream starts, the men\u2019s hockey game between the U.S. and Canada stood out as the biggest, authenticated online event in history. Next week, we will hold our Digital Marketing Summit in Salt Lake City, with over 5,500 attendees. Summit has become a premier industry venue where we engage with current and prospective customers as well as an ever growing list of global partners. We have a number of significant announcements on the docket as well as an amazing speaker lineup, including senior marketing executives from brands like Audi, FedEx, REI and Sephora. I am proud to share we donated over $300 million of software and training to the White House\u2019s ConnectED initiative. The goal of ConnectED is to advance digital learning among our youth, and we are excited about enabling 15,000 schools across the country to help students express their creativity and build skills for future success. We delivered another strong quarter and continue to make great progress against our goals in both Digital Media and Digital Marketing. Next week at Summit we will walk you through more details about where we are headed. We hope to see you there. Now, I will turn it over to Mark. Mark Garrett : Thanks Shantanu. In the first quarter of FY \u201814, Adobe achieved revenue of $1 billion, at the high end of our targeted range. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.09, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.30. Highlights in the quarter included : Adding more than 405,000 net new Creative Cloud subscriptions. Creative subscription reported revenue exceeding perpetual licensing revenue for the first time, growing Digital Media ARR by over $200 million to a quarter ending total of $1.15 billion, driving 24% Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth. Increasing deferred revenue by $52 million to a record $881 million. And exiting Q1 with 52% of our $1 billion of Q1 revenue as being recurring, this is truly a major milestone in the company\u2019s transformation. In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $641 million. This segment has two major components of revenue : our Creative family of products and our Document Services products. In our Creative business, customer adoption of Creative Cloud grew quarter-over-quarter. We exited Q1 with 1.844 million paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions. With this achievement, we hit a milestone, where Q1 reported Creative revenue from subscriptions and ETLAs exceeded reported revenue from perpetual licensing for the first time. Our success with subscriptions, ETLAs and Digital Publishing Suite adoption helped to drive Creative ARR to a total of $987 million exiting Q1, an increase of $186 million quarter-over-quarter. As of the end of Q1, 96% of Creative Cloud subscriptions were annual plans. The percentage of single app subscriptions grew as a percentage of total subscriptions as a result of our successful Photoshop/Lightroom bundle, which is expanding our overall market opportunity. We are making good progress migrating individual, team and enterprise customers to Creative Cloud. In addition, we are offering incentives to accelerate migration of Creative Suite customers, acquire new creative customers, and further expand in the photography market. Retention and renewal rates after promotions expire continue to track ahead of our internal projections. The resulting average revenue per user, or ARPU, was lower in Q1 as expected. As a result of Creative Cloud success across teams and enterprises, we will soon end general availability of CS6 perpetual licensing in the channel. This decision is consistent with our comments last December when we stated we expected no material revenue from perpetual licensing of CS6 in the second half of fiscal 2014. We anticipate this change will align channel resellers to exclusively focus on Creative Cloud for team subscriptions. In Document Services, we achieved revenue of $194 million in Q1. Our success in this category is being driven by continued adoption of Acrobat, Acrobat ETLAs, Acrobat cloud services and our EchoSign e-signing solution. Document Services ARR grew from $143 million exiting Q4 to $164 million exiting Q1. Total Document Services subscriptions spanning EchoSign, Create PDF Online and related services grew to nearly 1.8 million. In our Digital Marketing segment, there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering, and in Q1 we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $267 million, representing year-over-year growth of 24% and ahead of our target of 20% growth in FY \u201814. We drove strong bookings in the quarter, which puts us on pace to achieve our target of 30% bookings growth this year. Total transactions managed by all our Marketing Cloud solutions grew to more than 5.4 trillion in Q1. Mobile device use continues to be a driver in our Digital Marketing business. Mobile transactions increased to 36% of total Adobe Analytics transactions, up from 33% last quarter. Next week at Summit, we are hosting a Financial Analyst Briefing and we intend to update you on numerous metrics, which reflect our leadership and momentum in our Digital Marketing business. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $47 million in Q1 revenue. As a reminder, late last year we introduced a path for LiveCycle customers to migrate to our Adobe Experience Manager offering. As a result, we expect LiveCycle revenue will continue to decline, while Connect revenue will remain relatively flat. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $45 million in Q1. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX decreased revenue by $0.7 million. We had $2.8 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201814 versus $3.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY \u201813. Thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue was $1 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $10.9 million. Comparing the $2.8 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201814 to the $7.1 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201813, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $15.2 million. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 27.5% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher primarily due to stronger than forecasted profits in the U.S. Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 11,802 versus 11,847 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 44 days in the year ago quarter, and 52 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $252 million in the quarter. And our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.13 billion, compared to $3.17 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares at a total cost of $263 million. Now, I would like to go over our financial outlook. In Q2 of FY \u201814, we are targeting a revenue range of $1 billion to $1.50 billion. Assuming the midpoint of our Q2 revenue range, we are targeting total Digital Media and Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue to grow sequentially. We also expect LiveCycle and Connect revenue to decline sequentially. And we are targeting Print and Publishing revenue to be relatively flat. During the quarter, we expect to add approximately the same number of Creative Cloud subscriptions and amount of Digital Media ARR as what was achieved in Q1. We are targeting our Q2 share count to be 508 million to 510 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $16 million and $18 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of 28% to 29% on a GAAP and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.06 to $0.12 per share, and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.26 to $0.32. Looking to the second half of the year, in the coming months we are planning a major launch of our Creative products and the removal of legacy CS6 products from the channel. We expect both of these will cause channel partners and our customers to increase their focus on Creative Cloud adoption. Finally, based on this roadmap, and factoring our Q1 performance and our Q2 targets, we expect we will meet or exceed all of the annual FY \u201814 targets we provided in December. These targets are available in the financial targets document on our Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Saviage : Thanks Mark.

We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. On the Adobe Marketing Cloud, it was a little shy of what I think our estimate in the Street was at, I was just curious if you could just walk through the dynamics there? And I realized you\u2019re still guiding to 20% plus growth, can just maybe walk through where you see kind of the lowest hanging fruit in that business in the dynamics in the market? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. I will take that Brent. I mean, when we look at the prospects for the Marketing Cloud, we continue to be very optimistic. The bookings were strong during the quarter. As you know in the enterprise business, you have a seasonally weak Q1 after what was an extremely strong Q4, but when we look at it big picture, we just continue to see great awareness, good traction with all of our solutions, people adopting the new solutions rather than point products. And I am sure you will get a lot more information next week at Summit and Campaign was off to a strong start, so that adds to another solution that we have now as part of the offering. So, we continue to be very excited about the prospects for the Marketing Cloud. Brent Thill : And just a quick follow-up, in terms of the duration of some of the contracts customers are signing, can you just give us a sense of what the general trend you are seeing there? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I mean, I think people are still continuing to sign contracts. And I would say the average is probably 18 months, Brent, but it\u2019s \u2013 you have multiple that are three years and retention continues to be fairly high in that space. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citigroup. Your line is open. Ken Wong : Hi guys. This is Ken Wong for Walter. Just a quick question on the point products, I mean, you noted that, that was driving some of the subscriber adds this quarter, I think the last time you guys updated us on the mix, it was about 80% were on the full Creative, I mean, how should we think about the mix going forward? Does that trend closer to kind of roughly two-thirds being on a full suite that you guys had when it was a desktop product? Shantanu Narayen : I would think, Ken, that overall we would continue to have a higher mix for the entire Creative Cloud when we think about the Creative Cloud offering as opposed to the equivalent comparison with the Creative Suite product. And when we think about what happened in Q1, overall unit demand for the Creative products continue to be really strong and I think you will see mix changes during the quarter as long as we continue to have the perpetual option. The other thing I would say is we saw a lot of strength with new customer acquisition in the Photoshop and Lightroom bundle that was quite well received, but overall I would say that we continue to expect that overall mix in the Creative Cloud will continue to be towards the entire offering. Ken Wong : Got you. And then just \u2013 go ahead. Mark Garrett : I was just going to add to that, this is Mark, that like I mentioned we have this major launch coming with a big marketing campaign. And as we said, we are going to take CLP and TLP out of the channel and those two actions together are going to help drive Creative adoption and ARR in the second half of the year. Ken Wong : Got you. And then Mark, you mentioned raising well you guys would beat the financial guidance you guys laid out there for fiscal year \u201814, does that also include the 3 million Creative Cloud subs? Mark Garrett : Yes. All the targets we laid out we feel good about meeting or exceeding. Shantanu Narayen : I would again continue to impress like I think we have for investors that the annualized recurring revenue is really the right long-term way to look at the health of the business. We are off to a strong Q1. And again as Mark said, that gives us confidence for us to expect to continue to beat the targets that we have. We are just not updating the guidance every quarter, annual guidance. Ken Wong : Got you. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Brendan Barnicle : Thanks so much. Shantanu, I was interested in where you guys might be seeing leverage between the Creative Cloud and the Marketing Cloud and I am guessing it something will see more of next week, but do you have any commentary on that or how we might start to think about the TAM or new opportunities that you are seeing as those two products increasingly get used together? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. We are seeing actually more and more, Brendan, it\u2019s a good question. I mean I will give you some customer examples. The publishing industry certainly, they want a single asset repository and workflow to create content once and repurpose it across web and mobile applications and video. We are seeing in retail actually a number of innovative customers are looking to accelerate the entire time to market. So they have their design done with hopefully an enterprise version of the Creative Cloud ETLA. And then they are actually providing that design directly through manufacturing, through the workflow that we have, so instead of using traditional product databases they are actually using our content repository system. We are seeing marketers accelerate campaigns by having the content assets directly flow into the marketing platform. And you know in video, I think you are seeing creation, delivery and ad insertion also all done through a single system like Primetime. The two products that we have specifically in that space the digital asset management that\u2019s represented within the Adobe Experience Manager and also we have the integration right now between DPS and AEM. So hopefully that gives you some color of how customers are actually aggressively wanting us to further integrate both within the clouds and across clouds. Brendan Barnicle : Great. Thanks. And Mark just a quick one, any reason to assume Creative Cloud subscribers would decline sequentially at any point through the second half of the year? Mark Garrett : Not based on what we see coming with the launch and like I said the removal of CLP and TLP from the channel. We are feeling good about subscribers and growing them in the back half of the year? Brendan Barnicle : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Mark Garrett : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Creative Cloud mix in the quarter, in particular any color around demand from individual or a team versus ETLA? Shantanu Narayen : Well Jennifer, I think demand from individuals continues to be strong. I think the ETLA pipeline again you traditionally have a strong close to Q4 and then we start building up the pipeline in Q1. And so ETLAs will see a sequential seasonal decline between Q4 and Q1 and team continues to get stronger every quarter as we see both CS6 being longer in the tooth as it relates to channel fulfilling demand from the customers as well as people looking at the value added innovation that\u2019s available through the Creative Cloud, team continues to get stronger. So that hopefully gives you color. And if you look at the individual application mix versus the overall you will also see that the Photoshop/Lightroom combination did well. As we have done survey on those customers we are definitely seeing market expansion and attracting new customers to the platform. Jennifer Lowe : Great and just a quick follow-up clarification question, Mark to your answer earlier to Brendan, you said that you expect Creative Cloud subscribers to continue growth throughout the year, should we expect the rate of subscriber adds to grow throughout the year I just wanted to clarify that? Mark Garrett : I didn\u2019t get that specific but again with the launch and the removal of CLP, TLP in the back of the year, we would expect subscribers to grow. I would leave it at that for now. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of from the line of Ross MacMillan from Jefferies. You line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thank you and congratulations. Mark you mentioned that the Creative subscription revenue was greater than perpetual licenses for the first time, is there any more color you can provide around that approximate mix between the two in Q1? Mark Garrett : I don\u2019t know is that we want to get that specific I mean what, like I said on the call it\u2019s really pleasing to see more than half of our total revenue in the quarter coming from ratable sources now and more of the Creative revenue coming from recognized subscription revenue than from perpetual revenue. We did say that a couple of times now that perpetual revenue really falls off dramatically in the back half of year, again even more so now with the CLP TLP coming out of the channel. So I think it gets fairly de minimis like we talked about in the back half of the year. Ross MacMillan : And just on that removal of the Creative Suite from the channel, does that apply also to direct sales as well so from adobe.com or through other mechanisms, in other words will it be basically impossible to get your hands on Creative Suite in the second half of the year? Shantanu Narayen : No, Ross. I mean, the way we are looking at it we first feel that the offering that will be coming out later this year is going to be so strong. CS6 is definitely going to look longer in the tooth. I mean, we have created all of the appropriate training with the channel partners as well as making sure, the two licensing programs that we had CLP and TLP, both of them will still be available. We will in certain markets continue to offer the licensing. Again, that would be de minimis in the second quarter. And then electronic software download, you will continue to see us offer that, but even today honestly on adobe.com, the vast, vast majority of all purchases is clearly the subscription. So, Adobe.com has already made that transition. The direct enterprise business is all driving ETLAs. The channel mix is slightly different, but we feel so confident that we now have the product offering, we have the appropriate way for both the channels to resell our products as well as for people who are acquiring it within enterprises to have an admin console. I mean, all of that just leads us to make sure that we have a unified story about what the right product is for all of our customers. Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s really helpful. Maybe one last one just on ARPU, obviously it was lower as you expected in Q1 as a result of the Photoshop/Lightroom shift. Given the changes that are coming here in the second half, would you expect ARPU to actually begin to increase given I think the changes are going to drive more traditional suite users to move to the full Creative Cloud, I was just curious so that ARPU trend that you see this year? Mark Garrett : Yes. So I mentioned this in the script, Ross. But again, the best measure of the business we still believe is ARR, because that incorporates everything obviously. And as we looked at the segmented offerings with individual team and enterprise, ARPU was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter across each of those offerings, but in aggregate, it was down due to mix and still remains kind of in the mid 30s, which we feel good about. And like we have said, over the longer term we feel that there is plenty of opportunity to drive that ARPU up. Right now, we want to drive subscriber adoption and we are going to do things that are prudent to do that, but again, ARPU remains in the mid-30s and it was affected by mix this quarter more than anything else. Shantanu Narayen : And directionally, Ross, if you actually look at the ARPU, when you take out the Photoshop/Lightroom bundle, it was actually up slightly. And so again completely on strategy in terms of execution when we get Creative Cloud, we get people to renew at the upper price, all of that\u2019s working well. So we continue to see an expansion opportunity with Photoshop/Lightroom, but if you remove the SLR from the mix, ARPU was actually slightly up? Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much guys. Nice cover on the new sub adds. Mark, can you talk about the 12.8 million subscriber base that you disclosed at the Analyst Day back in May and what percentage of that is roughly the breakup between commercial versus education government? And do you think that this ARPU of mid-30s can sustain even if you were to go back to a mix in your subscription base with CC as you get back into cumulative CS base of 12.8 million? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Mark Garrett : Kash, to be honest, we are not going to be updating that installed base migration at least not on the call here. That\u2019s something that we would do maybe down the road at an Analyst Day or something, but like we said we continue to see good adoption from people that are both perpetual users as well as new users on Creative Cloud. Kash Rangan : So is it possible then to give us some feel for when you have more of a normal mix of education versus commercial in your Creative Cloud subscriber base, how do we expect the ARPU to shape up our ASP to shape up, is it I mean relatively flat? How do you feel about the integrated pricing in the so-called non-commercial markets? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Well, in the non-commercial markets, I think when we think about education, Kash, I mean it will continue to be a seating strategy in order to get people and it will probably be a lower ARPU much like the ARPU was lower when we think about what we had with the Creative Suite. We also continue to offer ETLAs within educational institutions, which is doing well. So the direct sales force has moved to educational institutions. So when we think about the education market specifically think of it as individuals within the education whether they are students, whether they are administrators or whether they are faculty they will have the ability to get Creative Cloud at a lower price point. You will have the equivalent of team for deployment within labs that product is also going to get updated as we talked about and at the higher end for enterprises. But it\u2019s a great seating strategy and it allows us to continue to have people embrace our products as the products of choice as they embark on a creative career. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Steve Ashley : Thanks very much. I was just going to inquire about the dichotomy between your performance in geographies with your Asia-Pacific market being down 22% year-over-year. I was just wondering if you can give us a little color on that, does that have to do anything with the adoption of Creative Suite there and how that might have performed versus your expectation? Shantanu Narayen : Clearly, Creative Suite started off strong in the U.S. and we are rolling it out kind of around the world it\u2019s like anything else it seems to kind of move from the U.S. to Europe to Asia. So Asia has probably got the biggest opportunity in terms of Creative Cloud adoption moving forward. I don\u2019t think there was anything we saw Steve around the world from a demand perspective that was troubling. Like I said, we saw stable demand across all the geographies. So it was nothing unusual in the numbers. And there is definitely upside on Creative Cloud adoption in Asia. Mark Garrett : And when we talk Steve about digital marketing I think we have made it explicit about our focus on developed economies as the first area of focus and so as the percentage of digital marketing revenue in our overall revenue mix grows that will also show up more disproportionately in both the U.S. as well as in Europe. Steve Ashley : It\u2019s helpful. Maybe one last thing Mark, in the past you have been able to give us the ETLA ARR as a metric, I was wondering if we could get that at this time? Mark Garrett : Yes, we actually have not split that out in the past I mean it\u2019s fairly straightforward if you take the ARPU in the mid-30s times the number of users that we told you about in the quarter. You can kind of back into an enterprise ETLA ARR number. We have never really broken it out to be honest Steve. Steve Ashley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. You line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. I would like to ask first about businesses where you get paid in effect or at least in part based on customer activity, Shantanu you have alluded to DPS and I was wondering if you could update us a bit more on how that\u2019s progressing and another business where you in affect get paid according to customers activity such as Media Optimizer and whether there were any other opportunities like those to where you could be on the meter in terms of revenue like those first two I mentioned then would follow-up? Shantanu Narayen : Sure Jay. I mean I think with DPS we might have mention that we had about 150 million downloads. I think if we update that, it would be closer to 170 million right now. And so that traction continues. What\u2019s exciting about DPS is that actually a lot of the new business is in commercial accounts as I think we mentioned, so that that all goes well for us as we see deployment within enterprises. Media Optimizer continues to do well, grow year-over-year in terms of the annualized marketing spend that we have. But I would actually say that all of Marketing Cloud is really transaction based. And when you sort of look at what\u2019s happening with mobile and the move towards mobile devices and mobile traffic, I mean that is driving whether it is the number of multichannel messages that are communicated, whether that\u2019s the amount of advertising spend that we do, whether it\u2019s the amount of targeted offers that are going out on behalf of our customers. So the good thing about the Marketing Cloud is that as transaction volume increases with mobile clearly driving adoption that actually all goes well for all of Marketing Cloud. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay. The second question has to do with your services and support revenue you had mentioned a quarter ago during Q&A that customers don\u2019t want to do their own integration as far as digital marketing is concerned and your various solutions and you alluded to the same this evening. But we noticed that your services revenue were down sequentially and year-over-year, is that a function of older maintenance running off an older LiveCycle and Connect services revenue running off, but underneath it all you are seeing growing engagements in services revenue for Marketing Cloud than anything else? Shantanu Narayen : Jay, I will let Mark answer that specifically. I think big picture as it relates to people adopting Creative Cloud, you are seeing more and more partners in the ecosystem who are standardizing on the Adobe Marketing Cloud. And again, I think you will see some exciting announcements next week about how more and more people are creating digital practices on our marketing platform. And so our strategy continues to be how do we engage those partners, how do we educate those partners, and for some of the key customers, we will certainly be prime, but we want the entire ecosystem to evolve. Mark Garrett : And then Jay, you are right, on the services line to the extent that we have more and more customers adopting ETLAs, which is consistent with our strategy and where the sales forces really performing very well, you will see maintenance falloff on the old model and move into more of an ETLA model for Creative. Jay Vleeschhouwer : One clarification, sorry Mark, one quick clarification regarding adobe.com, where you said the vast majority of Creative Cloud subs activity is occurring, is the total amount of adobe.com revenue now larger than it would have been two years ago before you began the transition when you were still relying largely on perpetual business going through the site? Mark Garrett : Honestly, I have to look at that, Jay. I don\u2019t know about the recognized subscription revenue specifically from adobe.com versus perpetual from adobe.com. I would think that if it\u2019s not there already, it\u2019s certainly going to get there, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s there yet. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you so much. And I apologize, because I have juggling between a couple of different calls tonight, but I was wondering you talked a lot in the year ago if we go back to the Marketing Summit that you had, you talked about how you are integrating your products. I mean one of the things we hear from looking at the sales forces in the Facebooks and the Googles of the world as people would like one dashboard to kind of manage all their different marketing offerings and I think you guys are obviously in the pole position to offer that. I am just wondering if you could share with us kind of the current experiences of some of the customers that you have been winning as a result of that and what the common themes are and what you think the opportunity is to kind of increase that penetration into your installed base? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Heather. So, as you know, we announced at the last Marketing Summit that we would be moving all of the 20 or 30 products that we had into essentially five solutions that then got expanded when we made the Neolane acquisition into Adobe Campaign. If I look at our results for Q1, the vast majority of that revenue is now coming from solution. So it\u2019s clear that people are buying the solutions as opposed to the individual point products and some of those solutions again have multiple point products of the past. So that\u2019s one really positive dataset. The second one is as we delivered Adobe Campaign, which was off to a strong start it comes with the same user experience. So we have already built a single dashboard that allows people to in a unified way, use all of our different solutions. I think that two other things maybe I will leave you with. The first is managed services when we have an Adobe Experience Manager solution, it provides us with a great opportunity to not just have the Adobe Experience Manager solution as part of the installation, but to actually have all the solutions ready to go and all that a customer has to do is to turn it on rather than to explicitly have to contract with us. And finally, I think one of the things that is exciting for us is a lot of the CMOs are now looking at it and saying whether it\u2019s their spend across multiple channels, whether it\u2019s their communication across multiple channels, the entire media mix and attribution we are uniquely qualified to solve that for CMOs across their entire marketing spend. And so stay tuned for some exciting announcements in that front as well. Heather Bellini : Thank you so much. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks. This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. Could you touch on the competitive environment in marketing given the continued consolidation in the space? And also I wanted to ask about the acquisition of Neolane, any initial feedback from customer and how should we look for Neolane to be more integrated into Marketing Cloud? Shantanu Narayen : I will do the second one first. I mean it\u2019s already integrated, it\u2019s Adobe Campaign. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that it\u2019s off to a strong start and so having that multichannel orchestration capabilities across all of our offerings across all the channels is a very strong add already to the Marketing Cloud. I think in terms of what\u2019s happening in a competitive landscape, you are right. I mean there is more activity because it\u2019s probably the most explosive new enterprise software category. And I think our D&A about creativity and marketers continued to give us a lot of optimism about how we are going to perform in this. We are the leaders and we are going to continue to differentiate honestly by integrating entire content delivery into this platform. So hopefully that gives you some indication. But yes there is more competition I think it\u2019s just raising awareness of the entire category. And if you look at the industry analyst reports, we continue to be the leader not just in the entire platform but also in individual solutions. Mike Saviage : Operator, we will take two more questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open is open. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks. Shantanu you just mentioned that the customers are shifting to solution deployments in the Marketing Cloud, I am just curious if there is any general metric you can provide in terms of the ASP uplift from this change? Shantanu Narayen : I think you are going to hear some of that next week. You do know we are doing an FA summit there as well Derrick. So we will leave some information for you to come listen to both the announcements as well as an update on the business. Derrick Wood : Okay. And just a follow-up on the Marketing Cloud, I mean given the publicity from the breach at target, I know that\u2019s more on the point of sale side of things, but I am just curious if that\u2019s having any impact in spending trends kind of in the e-commerce vertical? Shantanu Narayen : No, I think customer behavior is really driving more e-commerce across every single device and I don\u2019t know of a single customer that \u2013 of a single customer or partner who doesn\u2019t believe that the move towards online digital commerce is going to diminish. So it\u2019s just going to increase. Derrick Wood : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Breza from Sterne Agee. Your line is open is open. Rob Breza : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Mark, maybe just a quick question I know was asked a little bit beforehand, but as you think about the geographical mix, I know Asia was around 16% for the last two quarters here, is that a trend or should we expect it\u2019s kind of return back to that normal 20%? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Well, I think over the right period of time, you will see Asia come back to where it was. And there is no reason to believe that it wouldn\u2019t like that both I and Shantanu said they are going to be a little bit behind on Creative Cloud adoption. They are certainly behind on Digital Marketing adoption. And as perpetual falls off more and more that changes the mix, but there is no reason to believe that those mixes shouldn\u2019t come back to where they were over the longer period. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you again for joining us. We are executing well against the strategy and feel really great about the progress we have made. When we look at it, we think Q1 was a strong start in both our growth initiatives. In Digital Marketing, we do have the most comprehensive marketing platform, strong year-over-year bookings growth and we will share more details on the roadmap as well as industry partnerships that we are signing to accelerate that business. And in Digital Media, the strength of Q1 coupled with the innovation that we are on track to deliver later this summer leads us to expect to exceed the annual target that we had provided. We look forward to seeing you at Summit. Thank you. Mike Saviage : This concludes our call. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Shantanu Narayen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. Adobe\u2019s business momentum continued in Q2. I am happy to report we achieved $1.68 billion in revenue, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37, both exceeding the high end of our targeted ranges. We drove strong performance across key growth areas, including Creative Cloud, Adobe Marketing Cloud and Document Services. In Q2, Creative ARR grew to $1.2 billion and we exited with more than 2.3 million Creative Cloud subscriptions, well ahead of the target we set for the quarter. More importantly, moving forward all Adobe and channel focus will solely be, on Creative Cloud offerings and CS6 perpetual revenue becomes de minimis. Building on our strong Q2 momentum, tomorrow we will unveil a broad set of Creative Cloud innovations, including desktop and mobile applications, new services and specialized offerings for key customer segments. In addition to targeting Creative Professionals and CS customers, we will expand the core Creative Cloud platform to target hobbyists and consumers, including former Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom customers. We believe this addresses a larger market opportunity. While Creative Cloud customers regularly receive access to new features, products and services as part of their subscription, this is our biggest update since CS6. We are excited to share what we have been working on and will host a live customer event in New York that will be webcast on Adobe.com at 1 PM Eastern Time. In Digital Publishing, we continued to see traction in the corporate market. New DPS customers include Booz Allen Hamilton, Dow Jones & Co., Honeywell and Procter & Gamble. In addition, Samsung will support DPS as the publishing platform for their new magazine service, Papergarden. In Document Services, Acrobat continued to achieve solid performance and our hosted Document Services offerings continued their momentum. With EchoSign, we teamed up with Progressive Insurance to make electronic signature solutions available to their more than 35,000 agencies in the U.S. to help them tackle their biggest business challenges, combining the reliability of Adobe PDF with EchoSign e-signatures, so agents can close business faster, more easily and securely. Combined with Acrobat ETLAs, Document Services ARR grew to $183 million exiting Q2. Across our Creative and Document Services businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $1.38 billion at the end of Q2 compared to $444 million exiting Q2 of last year. This year-over-year growth in ARR demonstrates the stellar progress we have made in transforming our Digital Media business. In Digital Marketing, Adobe Marketing Cloud achieved strong bookings in Q2 led by Adobe Experience Manager. Every enterprise is faced with the task of re-platforming their web infrastructure to deliver more personalized, relevant content to their customers and provide a first class mobile experience. Given our number one position in the web experience management and analytics categories and integration with our Campaign, Social and Target solutions, we have the leading offering in the market. In addition, Adobe Marketing Cloud integration with Creative Cloud and DPS is a unique differentiator enabling Adobe to target the C-suite with corporate-wide, mission-critical solutions. During the quarter, we held Digital Marketing Summits in Salt Lake City and London. Both events were sold out and have generated strong pipeline for the Adobe Marketing Cloud among our growing number of partners and direct enterprise customers. Major announcements at these events, included the introduction of new core services, innovation in mobile solutions and deep integration across our Marketing Cloud offerings. Early in Q2, we announced a global agreement with SAP, which will resell Adobe Marketing Cloud with their HANA platform and hybris Commerce Suite into their base of 250,000 enterprise customers. We are hard at work with SAP to address goals such as improved product and solution integration, sales enablement and partner education. Adobe continued to earn strong industry analyst recognition of our Marketing Cloud solutions in Q2. We were recognized as a leader in Forrester\u2019s Web Analytics Wave report achieving the highest scores in all major categories evaluated, current offering, strategy, and market presence. In Gartner\u2019s Multi-Channel Campaign Management Magic Quadrant, we achieved leadership positioning and the highest scores in completeness of vision, underscoring the progress we have made with the Neolane integration and the competitive advantage we have built with Adobe Marketing Cloud. In summary, we are pleased with the great progress we have made against our strategy in the first half of the year. Creative Cloud ARR has grown faster than expected. User satisfaction and retention remains strong and Creative Cloud customers will benefit from exciting new innovation in the second half of the year. Our leadership in the digital marketing category is widening with industry recognition, a thriving ecosystem of partners and Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth ahead of our target for the year. I am proud to share that we were named the greenest technology company in the world, according to Newsweek\u2019s just released 2014 Green Rankings. This is an important recognition of our commitment to make Adobe a sustainable business and a great place to work. Our employees are at the core of our success. We thank them for our strong results and the momentum we have built. Now, I will turn it over to Mark. Mark Garrett - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Shantanu. In the second quarter of FY \u201814, Adobe achieved revenue of $1.68 billion above the high end of our targeted range. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.17 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.37, both also above the high end of our targeted ranges. Highlights in the quarter included : adding 464,000 net new Creative Cloud subscriptions; growing Digital Media ARR by $227 million to a quarter ending total of $1.38 billion; achieving 23% Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth; generating $368 million in cash flow from operations; growing deferred revenue by $48 million to a record $929 million; and exiting Q2 with 53% of our quarterly revenue as being recurring. In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $692 million. This segment has two major components of revenue : our Creative family of products and our Document Services products. In our Creative business, customer adoption of Creative Cloud accelerated quarter-over-quarter. We exited Q2 with 2,308,000 Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions. Q2 was the last quarter we broadly offered perpetual volume licensing of CS6 through the channel. As a result, there was a high demand by customers serviced by the channel who wanted to add to their perpetual seat capacity. This drove the upside relative to the high-end of our total targeted Q2 revenue range. We believe these customers will migrate to Creative Cloud over time. Beginning in Q3, the channel is solely focused on licensing Creative Cloud. Our success with subscriptions, ETLAs and Digital Publishing Suite adoption helped to drive Creative ARR to a total of $1.2 billion exiting Q2, an increase of $208 million quarter-over-quarter. Our strategy with segmented Creative Cloud offerings is to target existing customers across all user categories as well as attract new customers to the platform. Overall, we are seeing strength in migrating the installed base as well as expanding our market with new user adoption. Enterprise customer migration is proceeding well with Adobe\u2019s direct sales force driving new enterprise term license agreements, or ETLA adoption. Adoption of the full Creative Cloud offering in the Creative Professional segment was strong in Q2, with acceleration over Q1. Creative Cloud for team subscriptions has now become a significant percent of overall subscriptions and is expected to grow given increased channel focus with the elimination of CS6 perpetual licensing; and we are expanding the overall opportunity with our Photoshop/Lightroom offering targeting the Photography segment. This offer is enabling us to acquire new customers as well as migrate those who historically licensed Photoshop Elements and Photoshop/Lightroom. Retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions, including renewals after promotional pricing expiration, continues to track ahead of our initial projections. Q2 average revenue per user or ARPU in each Creative Cloud offering was consistent with Q1. As you know, the Photography offering has a lower ARPU than the rest of the Creative Cloud business and is also responsible for a majority of the subscription upside we have achieved in the past couple of quarters. Given total subscription mix, the growth in Photoshop/Lightroom subscriptions slightly decreased total Creative Cloud ARPU in Q2 while expanding our overall market opportunity. In total, Creative Cloud subscription and ETLA adoption drove stronger than expected Creative ARR in Q2, which reflects the strong health of the business. In Document Services, we achieved revenue of $196 million in Q2. Our success in this category is being driven by continued adoption of Acrobat, Acrobat ETLAs, Acrobat cloud services and EchoSign. Document Services ARR grew to $183 million exiting Q2. Total Document Services subscriptions spanning EchoSign, Create PDF Online and related services grew to 1.9 million exiting the quarter. In our Digital Marketing segment, there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and in Q2 we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $283 million representing year-over-year growth of 23%. We drove near-record bookings for any quarter, which is impressive for a Q2 and continues to put us on pace to achieve our target of 30% Marketing Cloud bookings growth this year. Total transactions managed by all our Marketing Cloud solutions grew to more than 6.3 trillion in Q2. Mobile device use continues to be a driver in our Digital Marketing business. Mobile transactions increased to 37% of total Adobe Analytics transactions. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $47 million in Q2 revenue flat with Q1 revenue and consistent with our expectations. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $46 million in Q2. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX increased revenue by $3 million. We had $2.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201814, versus $2.8 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201814; thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue was $2.8 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $3.1 million. Comparing the $2.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201814 to the $15.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201813, the net year- over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $9.6 million. In Q2, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 27% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted primarily due to stronger-than-forecasted profits outside the U.S. Employees at the end of Q2 totaled 12,026 versus 11,802 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 45 days, which compares to 42 days in the year-ago quarter, and 46 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $368 million in the quarter. And our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.33 billion, compared to $3.13 billion at the end of Q1. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a total cost of $166 million. Now, I would like to go over our financial outlook. As I noted earlier, our reported revenue in Q2 included final demand for CS6 perpetual product. Moving forward, we will be solely focused on subscriptions and ETLAs. With this as context, in Q3 of FY14 we are targeting a revenue range of $975 million to $1.25 billion. In Q3, we expect to add approximately $250 million of Digital Media ARR, with Digital Media segment revenue declining sequentially. We are targeting Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue to grow approximately 20% year-over-year. We expect combined revenue with LiveCycle and Connect to decline sequentially and we are targeting Print and Publishing segment revenue to be relatively flat. We are targeting our Q3 share count to be 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 tax rate of 26% to 28% on a GAAP and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.02 to $0.08 per share and a Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.22 to $0.28. In the second half of fiscal 2014, we expect Creative Cloud adoption to continue to accelerate. We are targeting Digital Media ARR to grow sequentially in Q4 to a total of $1.925 billion exiting the year, an increase over our prior annual target of $1.85 billion. We expect to add approximately 1 million net new Creative Cloud subscriptions in the second half of the year, with sequential growth in each quarter. This means we expect to achieve approximately 3.3 million Creative Cloud subscriptions by year-end, which is 300,000 higher than our target of approximately 3 million that we gave entering the year. Our updated Digital Media ARR target exiting the year reflects the Creative Cloud subscription and ETLA product mix we expect, including continued success of the Photoshop/Lightroom offer that is expanding our market opportunity. We also continue to target at least 20% revenue growth and 30% bookings growth with Adobe Marketing Cloud for the year. I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Saviage - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks Mark. Before we get to Q&A, a few logistics items. Adobe MAX is coming up in October and will be held again in L.A.

We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Walter Pritchard - Citigroup: Hi, thanks. I am wondering, Mark, if you could talk about ARPU in Q3 have a few factors here with acceleration potentially in team edition, which carries a higher ARPU and then continued growth in the lower end. Just wondering how we should think about ARPU headed into Q3? Shantanu Narayen : Walter, why don\u2019t I start and then Mark can add, because overall we continue to track ARPU for CC subscriptions, which again just to remind everybody, it does not include the enterprise ETLAs. And to give you all some color, excluding the Photoshop/Lightroom bundle, overall ARPU across individuals and teams, single applications as well as the complete Creative Cloud in all markets, including education, which you know is priced lower than commercial has actually increased every quarter for the last few quarters and is now in the high 30s. When you blend in Photoshop and Lightroom that\u2019s priced at approximately $10, the ARPU, the resulting ARPU is now in the low 30s. So, keep in mind that with the PS/LR bundle, we believe that the overall opportunity is larger than when we first outlined the Creative Cloud opportunity and therefore presents a great ARR potential. So, that\u2019s how we have seen ARR progress. Mark Garrett : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t add much to that. I think it\u2019s doing exactly, Walter, what we would like it to do. Across each of the different offerings, it\u2019s holding up very well. And as Shantanu said, the important part is on the Creative Professional side, it\u2019s been increasing the last several quarters. It really just \u2013 I was just going to say it\u2019s just going to move around based on product mix every quarter. Walter Pritchard - Citigroup: Got it. And I guess just a follow-up to that, would you expect that you did see sort of a nice reacceleration in the full suite adds this quarter from it being flat in Q4 to Q1? I am wondering if you look into Q3 and Q4, do you expect that as part of the subscriber guidance that you gave that the full suite additions would continue to accelerate along with the total? Shantanu Narayen : I think we will continue to strength, Walter, in the full units as well. And as you know, the channel I think we identified that the channel is also going to focus exclusively on the complete offering as well as the team offering. And so I think the combination of those give us confidence for the number that we outlined for the remainder of the second half. Walter Pritchard - Citigroup: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird: Thanks very much. Shantanu, my question is about the Creative Cloud and I am assuming one of your goals is to get the Creative Cloud customers to save more of their content to the Cloud. I first want to confirm that, that is something you would like to do? And number two is there any steps you would hope to take to encourage that behavior? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Steve, that\u2019s a good question. And yes, we do want people to be able to collaborate effectively whether it\u2019s freelancers who are working with other freelancers on a project, whether it\u2019s people who wish to show their portfolios on Behance as well as within an enterprise people wanting to collaborate either through Creative Cloud or through our Marketing Cloud, Adobe Experience Manger solution. So being able to allow people to collaborate is a clear goal. We have actually now turned on the ability for people to save files for anybody whether you are a trial user or whether you are a full user, we have functionality that is now present in Creative Cloud that people \u2013 allows people to share individual files, allows people to share complete folders. And the way we will continue to encourage that is by integrating it directly into the desktop applications. Again tomorrow, I think there is some exciting announcements hopefully you will all be on the call to hear about what\u2019s new both in services and mobile apps as well as in desktop apps. Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird: Great. And maybe a quick follow-up for Mark, in the Marketing Cloud we all know there is a business transformation going on in the Creative Cloud, but there is also a little bit of a business model change taking place in the Marketing Cloud with Experience Manger shifting to subscription and can you talk at all maybe qualitatively about the impact it might be having on a reported revenue growth and/or when that might normalize year-over-year in the future? Mark Garrett : Yes, sure Steve. I mean clearly in Digital Marketing, AEM is the hottest solution and it\u2019s a competitive advantage for us that we have both in on-premise perpetual offering as well as term based managed services offering. We believe that the better option for most customers and for Adobe frankly is the term based offering. And while it may vary quarter-over-quarter, the hosted offering now represents over 50% of the bookings in Q2 and we would expect this trend to continue in \u201815 to your point, in FY \u201815 we would expect the vast majority to be term bookings. So, we are kind of getting through the bulk of that little mini transition if you will. Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill - UBS: Good afternoon. About a year ago you articulated the Creative Cloud base are on the credit solution was around 12.8 million when you looked at the CS3 to CS6 cycle with 2.3 million of that 12.8 million you get to kind of 18% of the base that\u2019s converted, is that still the numbers that we should be looking at in terms of judging the conversion over? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Brent, firstly when we outlined the number that you talked about that does include the enterprise customers. And as you know when we talk about the subscription numbers we are only talking about the subscription numbers that are individual and team. So I think it\u2019s important to remember that 12 million plus includes our enterprise customers. The second thing I would say is that when we think about the longer term opportunities for Creative Cloud given the initiatives we described with the photography offering, it\u2019s actually increasing our available market opportunity. And you also have to remember that when we last did our surveys, a number of the people that are now signing up for Creative Cloud are new customers and therefore that\u2019s expanding the available opportunity. So, we are not providing the longer term numbers at this time because we are really focused on driving financial performance in the second half. But I think you should look at big picture and say we are making good traction migrating the existing customer base. We are attracting new customers to the platform and we are providing market expansion opportunities with the Creative Cloud platform to target a broader set of customers. Brent Thill - UBS: Okay. And just a follow-up for Mark just as a follow-on given you are still in the infancy of converting the base over that ARPU in the near-term we should assume that you are going to continue to effectively try to drive everyone on that versus trying to drive ARPU off as it relates to that the conversion rate that you are at today inside the install base? Mark Garrett : Yes, that\u2019s right Brent. Right now the key is to get people to move over to Creative Cloud, get those new users to adopt Creative Cloud. There will be ARPU expansion opportunities down the road. Brent Thill - UBS: Terrific. Thank you. Mark Garrett : By the way one other point on all that, we keep saying this, but keep in mind we firmly believe the true health of the business is measured through ARR. ARR encompasses everything, it encompasses ARPU, it encompasses retention. So, while I understand the focus on ARPU, the right way to look at the businesses on the ARR side. Operator : Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch : Hi, thank you very much. Shantanu, could you give us a bit of an estimate on how much the base of 12.8 million expands by as a result of the new offerings that you are going to be targeting tomorrow to launch? And also as you pointed out, you are trying to reach to a broader base of individual point solutions and recognizing that 12.8 million is more of a thing of the past looking backwards. I am curious if I could think about the percentage expansion to that number as a result of targeting new users, point solutions, etcetera? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Kash and first\u2026 Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch : Is it 10% more or 20% more or there is just some rough magnitude? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Kash, first the expansion opportunities that we are talking about, I do want to reflect that they are already represented in the outlook that we have for the second half of the year. And so the 1 million subs that we are talking about as well as the 1.925 billion ARR both reflect our expectation of what we expect to see with the announcements tomorrow. Again, Kash, we really want to focus on the second half. We give you color relative to the 20% new customer growth that we have been seeing, but expanding that entire available opportunity and articulating what the numbers are, we are not providing updates to that at this time. Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch : Got it. Understood. And sorry, this is another longer term question for Mark, just wondering how is your confidence level today relative to say three months back or so with respect to earnings targets for fiscal \u201815 and \u201816 being at least 2 and at least 3 respectively? Thank you. That\u2019s it for me. Mark Garrett : Hey, Kash. Well, unfortunately, I am going to give you the answer that Shantanu just did. I mean, obviously we have put those targets out there. They are still there, but we are not going to update them on a regular quarterly basis as we get through towards the end of this year and get ready for FY \u201815 that will be the appropriate time to update some of those longer term targets. Shantanu Narayen : And Kash, I hope you are seeing that everything that we have articulated, we continue to focus on execution against it. And we certainly believe in the company that we have had a good first half and we expect to see a strong second half as well as to continue to expand on our opportunities. Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch : Got it. My question is more, just spurred by looking at that subscription revenue growth rate and the very little operating expense growth rate you would have to put through to get that almost 70%, 80% subscription growth rate. It feels like the operating leverage in your model is finally starting to really come through and this seems to be the pivotal quarter of that happening. Congrats. Mark Garrett : Yes, thank you. Keep in mind we did have upside this quarter like we said because of perpetual, right. The beauty of the story this quarter is as in the past prior to this transition when we have revenue upside, you are going to have earnings upside and that\u2019s starting to come back into the picture. So, going forward, just like in the past when we have revenue upside, we will likely have earnings upside. Shantanu Narayen : And just to confirm again, Kash, in response to your question, what I wanted to say was in the surveys that we are doing 20% of the user base that we are finding who are adopting the Creative Cloud are new users to the platform. Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch : Wonderful. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein : Sure. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. So, maybe you just answered that and I didn\u2019t catch it completely, but what percent in terms of the net new users within the subscriber base? How many of the \u2013 what percentage of subscribers are net new? Do we have that yet? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Mark, we do surveys on a periodic basis is what we were saying and it\u2019s approximately 20% of the users are net new. That\u2019s sort of an order of magnitude way of looking at it. Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. So, that\u2019s still staying constant. And then a follow-up for Mark, cash and cash equivalents has been growing quarter-over-quarter, is this U.S. cash that\u2019s growing? Was it all overseas? Shantanu Narayen : Well, it\u2019s both. But as we have said in the past, the great majority of our cash is overseas. We still believe that the best way of returning cash to shareholders is in the form of share repurchases. We continue to do that. You saw we bought a bunch of stock again this quarter. We will continue to do that. And obviously, we look at our capital planning and our capital structure on a regular basis. But right now, we think that\u2019s the right answer. Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein : Perfect. Thank you. I appreciate it. It\u2019s also important. Mark Garrett : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne - Evercore: Yes. Thanks very much. Can you talk a little bit about the progress you are seeing in terms of cross selling with the Digital Marketing and the Digital Media solutions in your customer base, I think we all understand that you guys have a very strong product offering both in a very big customer base of Digital Media, I guess how well or I guess can you give us some anecdotes that give you some comfort that the progress and some of the advantages you have in say the CMO officer are starting to play out especially as it relates to the Digital Marketing business? Shantanu Narayen : We certainly track that internally and we continue to feel good about the progress that we are making in having larger enterprises adopt both the Creative Cloud, ETLA offering as well as multiple Marketing Cloud solutions. I think there are two areas where we see the most traction. The first area where we see traction is where people are now adopting the Creative Cloud and doing all of the asset management within the Marketing Cloud, Adobe Experience Manager, asset management solution so that\u2019s one area where we see traction. The second area where we see traction is certainly in the area of people wanting to use the same workflow for both delivering mobile applications using PhoneGap Enterprise as well as DPS which is the Digital Publishing Suite option. And last but certainly not the least there is no question that when we look at the new deals that we are having we are selling to the C-suite. We are selling the combination of the entire content LiveCycle. And while there maybe specialist sales force that are selling one solution or the other, the number of quarter backs that we have in these large accounts selling the entire Adobe story is certainly drawing. So hopefully that gives you some color. With respect to which markets, I would say retail continues to be an area where we are seeing quite a bit of traction when we see travel, automotive these are a couple of the industries where \u2013 and financial services where we are seeing synergy between the two solutions. Kirk Materne - Evercore: And just a quick follow-up if I may, you guys announced a partnership with SAP at the summit, I guess any update on how that\u2019s progressing or your thoughts on how that might impact the digital marketing opportunity in the back half of the year? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I think we said when we announced the partnership that we don\u2019t expect a material impact, it\u2019s all baked into our targets as well Brad Rencher certainly was at Sapphire where as you know it\u2019s their largest event and they showcased the partnership as well in terms of what we are jointly doing together. I think long-term and next year what you are going to expect to see is that both companies will jointly go to market. I think the real areas of synergy, is as commerce is becoming a bigger player for SAP with their hybris commerce suite the integration that we have with that. And for the real time enterprise the integration that we have between HANA as well as our Adobe Marketing Cloud, but we are hard at work educating their sales force on our offerings and we are starting to see both companies go into join customer accounts, but it\u2019s early yet. Kirk Materne - Evercore: Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley : Great. Thank you. Just to go back to ARPU a little bit I know this topic has almost been beaten to death at this point, but just looking at Q2 I think coming into the quarter the guidance that\u2019s been for subs adds similar to last quarter and Digital Media ARR at similar to last quarter, we saw the Digital Media at similar to last quarter it looks like from an ARR perspective, but certainly the subs came in much, much better than we and others had expected from what we thought in Q1, so just sort of running those two items through that would suggest that there is something in the ARR that maybe didn\u2019t play out the way that you had thought given that you didn\u2019t see the similar magnitude uplift in ARR, so is there anything that kind of surprised you negatively or didn\u2019t play out if you were thinking coming into Q2 given the outperformance in subs with more in line-ish number on the ARR side? Shantanu Narayen : No, I don\u2019t think there was anything that actually surprised us. I remember when you look at the Creative ARR are $1.2 billion, we did say that the significant amount of the over achievement in the subscriptions was as a result of the PSLR bundle, but the team continued to do well and it\u2019s actually we expected to continue to do well but the channel focused on it Jennifer. So, we are pleased with the mix, we are pleased with the market expansion as well as again as I mentioned if you look at just the Creative ARPU, it is in the high 30s and it actually been increasing sequentially. Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley : And switching gears a little bit, one of the things that they have talked about in the past as being capacity constrained in the Marketing Cloud and you also highlighted on the call some of the efforts to build that direct sales capacity around ETLAs on the media side, can you just talk a little bit about the growth in direct sales force and your efforts in building out some of the capacity there? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Matt, who heads up field operations, we continue to focus on adding capacity both directly as well as the partner revenue that we are starting to see in the Marketing Cloud in particular is actually increasing. So, a very substantial portion of our Adobe Marketing Cloud also has a partner element in it, which we think is good, because it actually enables us to work effectively with partners. We still continue to think Jennifer that we are capacity constrained as opposed to market constrained. We are focused on a few countries right now, because that\u2019s where we see tremendous opportunity and will continue with geographic expansion as we continue to build out into the second half of 2014 and beyond. But we don\u2019t provide numbers specifically in terms of the direct sales capacity. Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna International : Thanks. You guys have the outage on Creative Cloud last month, we have seen this with many cloud companies obviously in the past, but just curious what the reaction has been? And it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like you have seen any impact in terms of your guidance, but do you think there has been any impact at all? Shantanu Narayen : Well, with all cloud-based services as you mentioned, Derrick, the new reality is that we have to be even more vigilant about making sure that we have 100% uptime. The outage that occurred in Q2 should really never have happened. There was a sequence of things. And we have learned from it as well as introduced additional safeguards and redundancies as a preventive measure. I think our outreach to our customers has helped address any issues and you are right we did not see any real impact from that outage. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna International : Okay. And quick question for Mark, any \u2013 now that CS is withdrawn from the channel, can you give us any color on the degree of step down in product revenue expected in the second half? Mark Garrett : Well, it\u2019s really baked into the guidance. I mean, if you look at the 10.68 this quarter going down to 9.75 to 10.25, I mean, that\u2019s really driven by this sequential decline in perpetual revenue. I mean, that is the reason for the decline, because obviously Creative Cloud subscription revenue is increasing. Digital Marketing Cloud revenue is increasing. So, it\u2019s really that, that is the size as it declined right there. Derrick Wood - Susquehanna International : Okay, alright. Thank you. Mark Garrett : And like we said, you don\u2019t have to worry about perpetual revenue much anymore. It\u2019s literally de minimis in Q3 and beyond. Mike Saviage : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities : Got it, thanks. Good afternoon. Shantanu, Mark, I would like to ask about the potential magnitude of Creative ETLA as a metric, it would appear that for the last couple of quarters, the year-over-year growth of ETLA has perhaps been triple or more, that\u2019s at least our inference, but the comps get harder of course into the second half of this year and into next. But when you think about the potential for corporate maintenance renewals, capacity, access to new technology and so forth, wouldn\u2019t it stand to reason that over time that Creative ETLA number could be potentially a several $100 million number substantially higher than it is today? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Jay, first I will say that the field team has done a really good job of educating customers on the benefits of the Creative ETLA and helping transition them from perpetual offering to the term-based offering. I think when you look at the potential that we still have to get customers to the Creative ETLA, you are right, the growth that we have seen in that business has been quite significant, it is a little bit more seasonal that ETLA and that you build a pipeline over the year and then you tend to have a stronger Q4 and the Creative ETLA much like you might see in Digital Marketing bookings. We are not going to provide specific targets of how large the creative ETLA business can be, but I think we have outlined in the past how much licensing was meaningful component for the Creative business and certainly that licensing revenue should move into what is now ETLA. So it\u2019s an area of significant focus for us in the company because it enables us to have a good relationship with the customers. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities : Alright. Thank you for that. My follow-up is on that EPS and I was wondering if you could update us on the volume to-date that you have seen there versus the 1.70 that you have reported at the end of Q1 and could you comment as well on how the corporate versus traditional publisher customer base mix has evolved over the last year or so and how you are thinking about that? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Jay, I think directionally the corporate customers is where we have been focusing a little bit more because we have a number of the publishers already as customers and so when you look at the growth that we are finding in DPS it is for all of these other use cases whether it\u2019s training or manuals or corporate brochures, I think Mike used it for our annual shareholder report. So that\u2019s where the growth is. I don\u2019t have the exact download number with me, but growth continues in the publishing segment as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities : Thank you. Mike Saviage : Operator, we will take two more questions. Operator : And your next question is from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks guys. Nice quarter. I guess follow-up to Jay\u2019s question. You guys have a large ELA installed base, I guess I am wondering should all former ELA customers become ETLA customers or will some of those fall into different segments and I guess if so, is there a way to kind of think about the split there? Shantanu Narayen : No, I think the way of looking at it is all ELA customers should become ETLA customers, in fact directionally we have also said that some of the customers that may have in the past had smaller licenses which may have \u201cmoved to team offering could also move to the ETLA customers\u201d. So getting a relationship with small marketing departments, entire media agencies through ETLAs is very much a part of our strategy. Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s great. And then maybe one quick question on the geography, it looks like Asia-Pac was down again a little bit and clearly more in line with your expectations, should that market start to grow in the second half? Shantanu Narayen : With Asia-Pacific the important thing to remember is that what you are seeing is the Digital Media business moved to subscriptions and in Digital Marketing it\u2019s not as much of a market as some of the other markets. So Asia continues to perform well. We believe that Australia and some of those other markets are really good markets for Digital Marketing, but it\u2019s not as extensive market for us in Digital Marketing as it has traditionally been in Digital Media and so the growth that we are seeing in Digital Marketing in the U.S. and Europe make that as a percentage of our revenue greater than it formally was. Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s great. Thanks guys. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Robert Breza with Sterne Agee. Robert Breza - Sterne Agee : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just I think most questions have been asked but Mark you I think tried to make the point you are very clear that one perpetual license are gone, we shouldn\u2019t probably see any seasonality, is there anything else that we need to think about as we look out towards FY \u201915 and \u201916 in terms of seasonality or changes to the model that you could kind of point us towards? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Not really as we move forward now this frankly gets easier for me, it gets easier for you as well to model out I mean the percent of ratable revenue going into quarter is only going to increase with perpetual coming out. You don\u2019t need to worry about the decline of perpetual in any given quarter. We really do think now that Q3 could be the low point from a revenue perspective. I mean one little caveat would be if for some reason we sold unusual amount of AEM perpetual in any given quarter, so you will see Q4 revenue go up from Q3 due to seasonality, particularly around AEM. And then you have that seasonality come out in the first quarter, but we really think that Q3 could be the low point here. Again, with the little caveat around AEM, but for the most part, this gets much easier to forecast. Robert Breza - Sterne Agee : Perfect. Thank you very much. Shantanu Narayen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks again all of you for joining us. It feels like we are executing really well against our strategy. We had strong first half financial results and with upside in both Digital Media subscriptions as well as ARR. And in Digital Marketing also we feel good with strong year-over-year revenue as well as bookings growth. And as you saw the earnings upside has accompanied revenue upside demonstrating the leverage of our financial model. We look at Q2 as a significant milestone for the Creative Cloud business as we eliminated most of the options to license CS6. So, both Adobe, our customers as well as our partners can now focus solely on driving more Creative Cloud adoption. And most important, I think we continue to innovate with successful product launches of our marketing products that we unveiled at the U.S. and Europe summit events. And hopefully all of you will tune in to the global Creative Cloud launch scheduled for tomorrow that should lead to a strong second half. Thank you joining us. We think Adobe is in great shape. Mike Saviage - Vice President, Investor Relations : And this concludes our call. Thanks for joining us today.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Adobe\u2019s strong performance continued in Q3. We achieved $1.005 billion in revenue, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. Adoption of Creative Cloud, Adobe Marketing Cloud, and Document Services was robust, demonstrating continued momentum across our businesses. In Digital Media, we continued to deliver new innovation and enhanced value for our customers spanning our Creative and Document Services businesses. In June we unveiled a major update to Creative Cloud with 14 new versions of our desktop applications and four new mobile apps, and we announced the Creative SDK for mobile devices. We added new offerings for enterprises, educational institutions and photographers. With the pace of innovation accelerating with Creative Cloud, adoption from existing as well as new customers has been outstanding. We exited Q3 with $1.4 billion of Creative Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, which now includes more than 2.8 million Creative Cloud subscriptions and reflects a record increase of more than 500,000 from the prior quarter. To capitalize on the large opportunity with Creative Cloud, we remain focused on three growth initiatives. First, we are aggressively converting the large installed base of CS customers to Creative Cloud. This transition is going well as CS customers realize the significant value they obtain when they migrate. We are driving this conversion with individuals through trials and promotional pricing on Adobe.com, and moving enterprises and teams to Creative Cloud through direct sales and the channel. Second, we are expanding the market opportunity through acquiring new customers with tailored offerings such as Creative Cloud for photographers. The potential market for creative expression has never been greater, with the desire to use creative tools at work, at home and at school. While Adobe remains dedicated to meeting the needs of the creative professional, we see big opportunities ahead with a broader array of workers, students and consumers \u2013 and you will continue to see new targeted offerings for these audiences. And third, we will significantly expand the definition of Creative Cloud with mission critical and valuable services such as mobile apps built on our SDK, training, a marketplace for content, and talent search and acquisition. This focus will expand the Creative Cloud market opportunity and revenue potential beyond our current subscription offerings. MAX has become the community\u2019s showcase for creative inspiration and innovation, and we are excited about what we will be able to announce and deliver in October, particularly in the area of mobile, which represents a big opportunity for our customers and for Adobe. In Document Services, we achieved strong revenue of $208 million in Q3. Our Document Services business spans Acrobat ETLAs, cloud-based Acrobat services and Echosign. Document Services ARR grew to $217 million exiting Q3. PDF and Acrobat are de facto standards for document collaboration and workflows, and mobile represents huge potential to increase usage of our document creation, sharing, and signing services. We have permission to expand our footprint and brand in these areas, and are excited about the product roadmap which will position our document solutions as must haves now and in the future. Across our Creative and Document Services businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $1.62 billion at the end of Q3.  Digital marketing is an explosive category that is fundamentally transforming every business. In order to enable the personalized experience that every consumer expects, companies need to invest significantly in a modern technology platform. This revolution is beginning in marketing, but is extending to include the entire real-time enterprise. We are the leader in this category. We achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings in Q3, and have a healthy pipeline heading into Q4. The volume and size of engagements with our customers is growing. In Q3, the number of customers with annual contract value of greater than $500,000 grew by more than 40% year-over-year. Examples of marketing-cloud customers wins in the quarter included Adidas, Biogen, British Sky, Ford Motor, H&M, Lloyds Bank, Nestle, The State of Illinois, The State of Utah, Tiffany, Travelocity, The U.S. Department of Treasury, The U.S. Marine Corp, DSV in Germany and Motorola in the UK. Our value proposition is clearly resonating with marketers, driven by the market share and thought leadership that we have built in the category. Interest in our solutions is high, as evidenced by sold-out conferences across the globe. In addition, we are earning strong industry analyst recognition for our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. Forrester recognized Adobe as a Strong Performer and best positioned in their Digital Experience Delivery Platforms report. Gartner named Adobe a Leader in their 2014 Magic Quadrant for Mobile App Development Platforms, highlighting the capabilities of Adobe Experience Manager, PhoneGap and Digital Publishing Suite. And Forrester named Adobe Campaign a Leader in their Cross Channel Campaign Management 2014 Wave report. This recognition and our leadership in the Digital Marketing industry is helping to build an even stronger partner ecosystem with software companies, agencies and systems integrators. Recent partnerships include : A global reseller agreement where SAP will resell Adobe Marketing Cloud with their HANA platform and hybris Commerce Suite. The relationship has progressed well since the announcement in March. A strategic partnership with The Publicis Groupe to deliver the first end-to-end marketing management platform automating all components of a client\u2019s marketing efforts. All Publicis agencies will standardize on Adobe Marketing Cloud, making this our most comprehensive agency partnership to date and a partnership with Wipro, a leader in global IT, consulting and business process services, which is creating a new business unit to deliver integrated marketing, commerce, analytics and customer experience solutions. In summary, Adobe demonstrated strong execution across our business in Q3. Our Creative Cloud user base continues to grow as we offer an ever-expanding stream of new Creative solutions and tailored customer offerings. Adobe Marketing Cloud had another strong quarter, and is outpacing the market from a solution, partner and customer perspective. Content and data have never been more important. And Adobe is the leader in both. We have become the trusted content and data partner for the world\u2019s biggest brands, media companies, governments and educational institutions. We have a strong tailwind moving into Q4 and are excited about the opportunities ahead. We hope to see many of you at our MAX conference. Mark. Mark Garrett : In the third quarter of FY2014, Adobe achieved revenue of $1 billion 5 million dollars (1.005 billion), within our targeted range. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.09 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28. Looking at highlights in our third quarter, those that stand out include : Driving strong adoption of Creative Cloud; growing Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings well ahead of our target, managing expenses to deliver up-side on earnings per share, achieving record deferred revenue, and generating a substantial increase in recurring revenue; we exited Q3 with 63% of our revenue as recurring.  In Digital Media we achieved revenue of $621 million. This segment has two major components of revenue : our Creative family of products and our Document Services products. In our Creative business, adoption of Creative Cloud accelerated quarter-over-quarter while reported revenue declined sequentially as expected due to Q2 being the last quarter of any meaningful perpetual CS6 revenue. We exited Q3 with 2 million 810 thousand Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions. Retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions, including renewals after promotional pricing expiration, continues to track ahead of our initial projections. Across all active subscriptions, average revenue per user, or ARPU, in each Creative Cloud offering was consistent with Q2. Given continued adoption of the Photography offering and seasonal Educational strength which are adding new customers, total Creative Cloud ARPU exiting Q3 decreased slightly. Our success with subscriptions, Enterprise Term License Agreements or ETLAs, and Digital Publishing Suite adoption helped to drive Creative ARR to a total of $1.4 billion exiting Q3 at constant currency from December of 2013, an increase of $209 million quarter-over-quarter. Our strategy with segmented Creative Cloud offerings is to target existing customers across all user categories as well as attract new customers to the platform. Overall, we are seeing strength in migrating the installed base, as well as expanding our market with new user adoption. Adobe\u2019s direct sales force continues to migrate enterprise customers with new ETLAs, and we have a strong pipeline going into the end of the year. Creative Cloud for Team units grew sequentially on both Adobe.com and through the channel. Subscriptions through the channel were below our expectations in Q3 as resellers came off a strong final push with CS6 in Q2. We expect subscriptions and the associated ARR will gain momentum as the channel now focuses exclusively on Creative Cloud. Q3 adoption of the full Creative Cloud offering in the Creative Professional segment was consistent with our performance in Q2. Our Photoshop/Lightroom offering, which was re-branded as the Creative Cloud Photography Program in June, continues to drive new customer adoption as well as migrate those who historically licensed Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom. In Document Services, we achieved revenue of $208 million in Q3. Our momentum in this category is being driven by continued adoption of Acrobat \u2013 including several large contracts which closed during the quarter. Adoption of Acrobat ETLAs, Acrobat cloud services and EchoSign grew Document Services ARR to $217 million exiting Q3. In our Digital Marketing segment, there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering, and our momentum as the leader in this market continued. We achieved revenue of $290 million in Q3. More importantly, we continued to drive strong year-over-year bookings growth that puts us ahead of our goal for the year. Our success is being driven by an increase in size of transactions, number of solutions per customer, international expansion and growth in partner-driven business. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $47 million in Q3 revenue and was consistent with our expectations. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $47 million in Q3. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. Asia as a percent of total revenue was low given Creative Cloud adoption in Japan has been slower than other geographies. With the removal of perpetual licensing from the channel in Japan, we are confident the transition towards Creative Cloud will begin to accelerate. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX had no meaningful impact on revenue. We had $1.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY2014, versus $2.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY2014; thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue was $1.5 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $7.1 million. Comparing the $1.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY2014 to the $10.5 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY2013, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million. In Q3, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 29% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher than targeted primarily due to stronger-than-forecasted profits in the U.S. Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 12,368 versus 12,026 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 48 days, which compares to 48 days in the year-ago quarter, and 45 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $269 million in the quarter. And our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.52 billion, compared to $3.33 billion at the end of Q2. In Q3, 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at a cost of $133 million. Now, I would like to go over our financial outlook. We are targeting a revenue range of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. In Q4 we expect Digital Media segment revenue to grow sequentially \u2013 with Document Services revenue relatively consistent with the strong revenue we achieved in Q3. We expect Creative ARR and Document Services ARR to grow sequentially. We expect net new Creative Cloud subscriptions to grow on a sequential basis and slightly exceed the approximately 1 million net new subscriptions we targeted in the second half of FY2014. We continue to expect we will achieve total Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.925 billion exiting the year. We are targeting Q4 Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue to grow slightly on a year-over-year basis. As you think about Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue, it is important to understand we are seeing increased customer adoption of our term-based Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Campaign solutions. This is resulting in larger customer engagements, more predictable revenue as well as higher long-term revenue growth. In FY2013, approximately 45% of these Marketing Cloud bookings were term-based. Entering FY2014, we anticipated a move towards a mix of approximately 60% term-based bookings in FY2014 for AEM and Campaign. With the acceleration of term-based adoption in FY2014, we anticipate achieving approximately 75% term-based bookings this year. As a result of the faster transition, we estimate approximately $60 million of revenue that would have been recognized in FY2014 will have shifted from perpetual AEM and Campaign licensing to term-based contracts during the year. Adding the Q3 portion back to our results this quarter would have driven total Adobe revenue to the high-end of our targeted revenue range, and Adobe Marketing Cloud would have achieved greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. Adding back the estimated Q4 impact, the high-end of our targeted Q4 revenue range would have been $1.1 billion. And adding back the $60 million full-year impact, Adobe Marketing Cloud FY2014 year-over-year revenue growth would have been greater than our annual target of 20%. We highlighted at the outset of the year our goal of driving at least 25% revenue CAGR for Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue between FY2014 and FY2016 \u2013 and we\u2019re on pace to achieve this. We expect combined revenue with LiveCycle and Connect to decline sequentially; and we are targeting Print and Publishing segment revenue to be relatively flat. We are targeting our Q4 share count to be 508 million to 510 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $12 million and $14 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of 28% to 29% on a GAAP and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.05 to $0.11 per share, and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.26 to $0.32. Mike.

We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator. Operator : (Operator Instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Ross Macmillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross Macmillan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thanks very much. Mark, the question on the mix between the full Creative Cloud and the point products this quarter I think maybe some of us thought we might see that return to a higher mix of full Creative Cloud because of the rundown of inventory of the Creative Suite from the channel. Obviously, there was some mix difference there perhaps it\u2019s explained by education strength and so forth. What is your expectation for that mix going forward and also for the blended ARPU as we think about Q4 and beyond? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Yes, Hi Ross, like we said on the prepared remarks we feel really good about the quarter, we drove 500,000 units this a Q3 for us which is a seasonally more difficult quarter and we felt very good about how we did. We do believe there is tremendous upside in the channel. In the second quarter you saw the channel was primarily focused on kind of the last hurrah of perpetual revenue with CS6 if you will, this is the first quarter they had to sell exclusively the subscription product and we think there is a tremendous ramp that we are going to see from them contributing to that mix moving forward. Education as you know is strong in Q3 as well we had a good education quarter. And the bundle continues to attract new customers. So we are really happy with how it\u2019s progressing. We do think that the channel will be able to contribute more moving forward and that\u2019s going to help that mix and it\u2019s also going to add to ARPU over time. Shantanu Narayen :  And Ross maybe if I were to add two other quick things when we think about excluding the PSLR bundle as well as education units, ARPU across the individual team single application as well as the complete CC in all the markets was relatively consistent in fact it increased slightly again. So we feel good about how that performance is happening. And in general you have to also go back to the Creative Suite mix that we had, single application was even in that particular business about 40%. We realize that\u2019s an on ramp that\u2019s accretive to overall ARR as Mark also mentioned with photography bundle. So pleased with how the quarter performed. Ross Macmillan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  That\u2019s great. Maybe just one quick follow-up I know that you\u2019re seeing better retention rates than your initial 80% assumption. Will we get to a point in the near future where we might actually talk about what sort of percentage retention you\u2019re seeing? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen :  Well, Ross, we told you approximately 80% we\u2019re ahead of that as we talk about in our retention rate. So we think that gives you the right color to understand that the business is very healthy. I mean other way we look at it is when you think about the number of units that we\u2019ve transacted with 2.8 million subscriptions as well as what we\u2019re doing with the enterprise ETLA that\u2019s already ahead of what we were doing steady state with Creative Suite. And we continue to think there is headroom both in terms of migrating existing customers as well as attracting new customers. So that should also give you a good sense of how healthy the business is. Ross Macmillan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much for taking my question. Mark Garrett :  Let\u2019s take the next question, and let\u2019s try to limit to one just so we can fit everybody in. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Thanks, good afternoon. Mark just on the Q4 guidance, you are guiding below the Street, I just want to be clear that\u2019s largely a transition to the term versus perpetual? Mark Garrett : Yes, Brent. So as I pointed out upfront. In the Adobe Marketing Cloud we\u2019re seeing a much faster move to term based managed services solutions for AM and Campaign. We went into the year assuming about 60% term based mix. And we\u2019re going to end more around 75% and that delta that $60 million delta for the year is what\u2019s really driving the difference. If you look at the fourth quarter as I said we would have been closer to $1.1 billion at the high-end of our range had we not gone through a faster shift of this AM and Campaign from perpetual to term based. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Okay, just a quick follow-on. And as you mentioned the Marketing Cloud bookings were well ahead of target I know you don\u2019t give out a booking number. But can you perhaps just give us some color as it relates to what you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters relative to your booking target if you significantly seen or any other color you could help us to frame that that would be helpful. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen :  Brent, maybe I can jump in there I mean we had talked about getting 30% bookings which would drive 25% CAGR over three years. And as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks we\u2019re seeing significant strength above that particular target and maybe big picture is better to explain that. It\u2019s really in our best interest to manage and deliver the entire customer marketing platform. And what that is resulting in is we\u2019re seeing multi-year deployments. It\u2019s increasing the revenue per customer, we gave you some color on what we are seeing of deals greater than 500,000 that grew over 40%. What we\u2019re also seeing is more solutions within existing customers, which is driving stickiness. And so I think this transition to the platform the multi-solution, multi-year sale has really gone faster than expected, which hopefully is good news if you want better and more predictable revenue. And that\u2019s why we also provided you with some way to model it with what happen with AEM and Campaign for 2014. Mark Garrett :  And then just to add on to that one more time, what that does Brent as you know, is it helps drive deferred revenue, we had a record deferred revenue quarter. It also helps drive the unbilled backlog, which we disclosed at the end of the year. And between the two of them now we\u2019ve got roughly $2 billion of contracted business waiting to be recognized in the form of revenue. So it just makes for a much healthier business over all. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities : Thanks you so much. Shantanu, I was interested in where you might be seeing some of the cross sell around both the Creative Cloud and the Marketing Cloud. And you\u2019ve highlighted that at some of the conferences. Can you give us any more color on where we are in that migration and maybe a sense of \u2013 maybe what percent of the installed base is even looking at using both of those and leveraging both of each other. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen :  Sure. I mean I think when we look at what\u2019s happening with our enterprise sales force and the sales force that is selling both the Creative Cloud as well as the Marketing Cloud into enterprises through either ETLAs, the Document Services ETLAs as well as Marketing Cloud bookings. That\u2019s where Matt and his team are driving multiple billions of dollars in terms of what we have been able to sell. Some customer examples there include publishing, they want to single asset repository and workflow to create content once and repurpose that across web and mobile applications and video, which is fast becoming one of the key things for every publisher to do online, so publishing is a good industry. In retail, you\u2019re seeing more and more of the innovative customers want to completely accelerate their time to market by having the design for these goods directly delivered through this workflow all the way out to manufacturing as well as for the consumer to have the ability to actually create personalized goods directly on a retail website. And video, I think when you talk about creation, delivery and add insertion. So hopefully that gives you some examples, but it\u2019s driving more strategic relationships with customers across all of these industries. Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citibank. Your line is open. Walter H. Pritchard \u2013 Citibank: Just one question Mark around pricing, you\u2019ve been in the market now for quite a while with the individual addition and you haven\u2019t talked about what percentage of your customers have gone past the one year anniversary and have had pricing go up. But can you talk about maybe an ARPU on that segment or something that would give us an idea of how many of those customers or what progress you\u2019re seeing in terms of this exploration of the promo and the uplift in ARPU that that would drive? Mark Garrett : Well, I mean, generally speaking like Shantanu mentioned and I think I mentioned across each of the offerings, the ARPU has either remain constant or actually increased. And from the retention perspective, we\u2019re seeing very good retention with people renewing even after the promo expires. So, as that happens of course it does drive ARPU up. Shantanu Narayen : And Walter if you go to the website and you look at the pricing for the various offerings, I think you would recognize that the individual complete is about 49.99 and you\u2019ve been look at the promotional pricing at about 29 and for team you know the complete pricing is 69.99 and promotional pricing could be 39 or 49. So, I think that gives you some sense of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of as people migrate off the promotional pricing what kind of ARPUs we are getting from those customers. Walter H. Pritchard \u2013 Citibank: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open. Kirk Materne \u2013 Evercore Partners : Yes, thanks very much. Mark you mentioned that the channel had a little bit of a slower start to the third quarter given that they shifted away from the license based product. I guess in your guidance for the fourth quarter. I guess how much will you counting on that bounce back to meet your subscription as well as your ARR targets for the quarter? Or do you expect it to sort of maintain itself the way it was in 2Q that\u2019s up side if you get lift on that? Mark Garrett : We\u2019re expecting it to move up, I mean, we\u2019re not expecting a huge ramp, but we are expecting it to a move up from here given that they are done with the perpetual and frankly there solely focused on selling subscription now. Shantanu Narayen : The other thing I might add, is if you look at the traditional Q3 to Q4 transition and you go back and look at what happened last year. The two things that drive it, first is seasonal strength, the second is enterprise ETLAs, Q4 tends to be the strong quarter for that. And so you should factor that and also as you think about how we go from Q3 ARR to adding Q4 ARR. Kirk Materne \u2013 Evercore Partners : Thanks. If I can just add really quick follow-up to Mark\u2019s comment on the deferred being just around this quarter. Obviously, I am sure that the transition of term deals and Marketing Cloud played a part in that. Was there anything else in terms of billing, how you are billing some of your customers that quite a part that you expect to continue to go forward? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Yes, I mean there is two big pieces really at Digital Marketing Cloud and then it\u2019s the Creative Cloud as well as, it\u2019s the ETLAs around Creative Cloud as well. ETLAs are build and advanced for the first year and that goes into deferred and then years two and three would show up in that unbilled backlog number that are referenced. So it\u2019s really both businesses that are driving the deferred revenue as well as the unbilled backlog. Kirk Materne \u2013 Evercore Partners : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about the percentage of business from term based bookings and Marketing Cloud that has obviously caught you by surprise. Why would you not just take the step of making all the business completely right about and if you were do it I am wondering what might be a rough way to think about impact your revenue maybe if you could talk about a 10 percentage point shift in term based bookings might be X million of dollars from revenue, so we will not be at all and absolutely surprised by any development in the future. And also curious we can comment on at the time I think Shantanu likes to mention reiterate that the goal of the company is to do out to the entire installed base. At this base that which we add something looks like you could transition entire large installed base about four years to five year or so. Question is we anticipate that adding more capacity so you could even add more units than what you are doing now to enable this transition to happening with book? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : So Kash there were multiple questions in that let me address sort of that question associated with the term based as well as the perpetual from an offering point of view. There is certainly still a number of customer and we think it\u2019s a competitive advantage for us that want to have the AEM solution the experience managers as well as the campaign solution On-Premise. I mean you can think about government agencies and other agencies who want to actually managed themselves, which is why we can\u2019t completely transition from the perpetual offering to the Managed Services, which we definitely think is the right long-term solution. If you look at the trend as Mark pointed out it\u2019s moved from 45% to close to 75%. So I think it\u2019s now becoming less and less and as Digital Marketing revenue grows the impact of this is certainly going to be muted. So, I think that should give you comfort as it relates to the marketing cloud, bookings and revenue on that transition. Mark Garrett : Yes, Shantanu said exactly what I was going to say the 75%, this is the reason we wanted to tell you the 75%, because it shows that we are pretty much through this is a very quick transition the good news is it really happened much faster in the back half of the year, then we\u2019ve got with only 25% left to go and the business in total growing, as Shantanu said it\u2019s not going to have a material impact next year. Shantanu Narayen :  With respect to a second question cash Q3 was first $500,000 subscription quarter for Creative Cloud it was a couple of half million Q3, it was a strong quarter. And so I mean as we look at what\u2019s happening in the business we have both migrating existing customers, but we continue to add a healthy dose of new customers to the platform. So the strategy that we outline namely getting new customers to the platform as well as migrating continues with CS6 perpetual being strong in the last couple of quarters all of them represent available opportunity or headroom for us to move over to the cloud. As do some of the countries, where we outlined that the adoption has been slightly slower. So, we\u2019re going to be focused on driving that MAX is going to be another catalyst in terms of how far to the Creative Cloud offering distances itself from the Creative Suite offering. So, we have to continue to innovate, we\u2019re focused only on the Creative Cloud as an offering in; there is still significant headroom opportunity. Mark Garrett :  Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great, thank you. Shantanu in your remarks, you mentioned that there was thought of having more targeted offerings against the photography SKUs fees especially given success you had this I guess two questions related to that. One as you think about how those targeted SKUs fit into the traditional point versus suite, strategy, what in terms of breakpoints around packaging and pricing to go after specific use cases versus maintaining the premium ASP traditionally associated with suite is it a situation where we can see a whole spectrum of offerings or are you still working along the lines of point versus suite with a relatively big gap in between. And then related to that in terms of the time horizon that we should think about for intakes of targeted offerings is that something that will give more about next month at MAX or is that something that's going to be more of a multiyear strategy for you? Shantanu Narayen :  Jennifer, when I think that overall the Creative Cloud offerings in the fact that the complete offering as still we think the best solution for a Creative professional, who wants to create content for multiple kinds of media. We still believe that that\u2019s are really the right offering. Photography has always been even with the traditional Creative Suite, such a large opportunity that having the photography bundle was the right way to go target that. Part of what we are alluding to is new ARPU enhancing services that we will start to introduced and that could be to the entire Creative Cloud customer base and you will start to see some of that starting at MAX. And some of them might be even more market expansion opportunities as it relates to what consumers are trying to do and you\u2019ve seen us introduce mobile offering. So I think for the core Creative professional, I think we have it right and I think we have to continue to innovative and migrating existing customers, but I think you\u2019re going to start to see us implement against the things we\u2019ve talked about the mobile SDK leading to new ARPU enhancing services for the entire base. Jennifer Lowe \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Okay. Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. I was wondering just if you could walk us through we\u2019ve heard a lot about how agencies are evolving their Digital Marketing strategies and trying to figure out how to build or whether to buy some of the ad tech that they think they need to serve their clients better, I\u2019m just wondering how you see kind of the landscape evolving on that front and how you feel Adobe, how you position Adobe in that context? Mark Garrett : For Heather, first I think it\u2019s a good opportunity to reiterate that global agreement that we announced with Publicis Groupe. From my point of view Digital Marketing agencies have always been working with their key clients, Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Revenue Officers, Chief Digital Officers to demonstrate a digital strategy for media buying as well as a Creative strategy. I think the Creative strategy need continuous unawaited and I think all digital agencies have to continue to provide that Creative strategy and now augmented with what they\u2019re doing on the technology side to enable people to truly understand the return of investment. And move the marketing spend from just being analog to more digital. And I think again if you saw the announcement around what Publicis announced today, Digital certainly becomes a more important part of any agency\u2019s strategy. I think what they are also seeing honestly is that systems integrators are seeing the marketing automation is a huge untapped market and so I think they\u2019re going to see competition as it relates to the traditional systems integrators, companies like Deloitte or PWC also enter that market. And from our point of view is a technology provider none of these relationships are competitive they\u2019re all using our technology to go implement and automate marketing flows within all traditional industries. To give you some color, relationship with Publicis allows them to use our technology to do automated search spin or social spin or display using our technology it allows the company like Razorfish that\u2019s part of the Publicis Groupe to go ahead and implement re-platforming associated with websites, it also allows them honestly to now with our audience manager solution have a way to segment both the online and offline customers, which is a big part of how they want to target their offering. So, we\u2019re excited about that and where its agencies or SIs expect to see more people want to partner with Adobe. Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Thank you very much. I would like to have Mark fill a little more on the $16 million. Should we be thinking of this move to 75% being term agreements does it simply mean that we get the license revenue is ratably recognized over the contract term where is there a revenue lift during the first contractor. So, obviously that\u2019s a lift after the first contract. And then a quick follow-up on that? Mark Garrett : Hey, Mark, yes, its $60 million just to make sure everybody heard that right 60, and it\u2019s recognized ratably over the contract term for the most part. So, it is spread out typically their multiyear deals and its spread out over that multiyear period. Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: But this is not \u2013 it\u2019s not a move in the first contract term it\u2019s not more revenue and just ratably recognized and then potentially is more revenue for second contract? Mark Garrett : Correct. Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Okay. And then the quick follow-up to that keep you online. Are you now selling still selling the same mix of term versus perpetual in this space are you now basically the predominantly selling the term and agreements? Mark Garrett : Yes, by far we\u2019re now predominately selling the term agreement. So the 75% that will end the year at, like I said, only reads 25% of perpetual. So it\u2019s not going to be material shift in any given quarter moving forward now. Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derric Wood from Susquehanna. Your line is open. J.Derric Wood, CFA \u2013: You guys talked about Japan being a little weaker than expected, I guess how do you weigh the impact potentially coming from the macro versus the impact coming from kind of the shifting channel focus around Creative Cloud. And then how does that kind of baked into your expectations for Japan next quarter and looking your pipeline and sub add contribution? Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP: You guys talked about Japan being a little weaker than expected, I guess how do you weigh the impact potentially coming from the macro versus the impact coming from kind of the shifting channel focus around Creative Cloud. And then how does that kind of baked into your expectations for Japan next quarter and looking your pipeline and sub add contribution? Shantanu Narayen : For my point of view I think Japan continues to be large untapped opportunity for Creative Cloud. It\u2019s been a traditional strength for us with the Creative products when we had the Creative Suite offering. I think was a little bit about that geography is the large dependency on our retail in that and we had the retail product in Q2, we see early adapters and we think there is untapped opportunity associated with the Japanese market. So nothing changes our long term view and it\u2019s not a demand issue. Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Breza from Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Robert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.:  Hi and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch back onto the $6 million market, So if you think about the remaining 25% do you think that\u2019s a \u2013 how should we think about that transition, I know you are saying it shouldn\u2019t be a big part, but do you think that moves to 80% by the end of FY2015 or how do you think that this trends longer term? Mark Garrett : I think that the 75 continue to group up a little bit I think we will get a point where it stops frankly and we are getting close to that. It\u2019s a little hard to say exactly where, but yes I could see it going up to 80, 20 or something like that over the course of next year. it going to depend in any given quarter on how the booking come in and who the customer are, Shantanu said certain customers want the perpetual version, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get the point where it moves the needle in term of our total company revenue like it has back half of this year. Robert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.:  Okay maybe as a quick follow, given the strong deferred revenue number that you guys did put up. I mean it\u2019s hard to quantify certainly what growth that - part of that being more of this $60 million to a term based fees or overall strength of the demanded, just qualitative commentary would be helpful? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Yes, that the $60 million represents multi-year contraction, so a big chunk of the \u2013 well the $60 million is the impact to this year, but the bookings that that drove will get recognized over time under a term based model and that would show up in next year\u2019s revenue on a ratable basis, the first years would be in differed and years two and three of those booking would be in unbilled. Robert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.:  Great thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.: Shantanu you marked other than highlighting the momentum you are seeing for EM and for campaign, could you talk otherwise in term of what you are seeing for the other components of marketing class specifically to a example maybe optimizer which you have highlighted in the past as particularly strong new product for you and perhaps update us as well on the number of solution that customer are thinking on the average. I believe the last time you updated that was six months ago at Salt Lake where it was 1.4 solutions to the customer, an update in that respect and then I could follow-up? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Sure Jay I mean in term of the solutions what we were trying to do was highlight the key differentiation that we had. And the differentiation is still very much the combination of experience manager plus analytics. Campaign has been doing really well, after the acquisition of Campaign it\u2019s got really good analyst reviews as well as customer adoption. So Campaign is off to a solid start. Media Optimizer the amount of marketing spend on the management continues to grow, I would say target has been doing really well, we\u2019ve seen significant growth year-over-year as the ability to offer personalized solutions really increases. And so when I look at it \u2013 the way we look at that business as both new sales which are largely multi-solution sales as well as existing installed customer base and how we can continue to sell existing customers on more and more of our solutions. And when you think about the number of large deals again as we said that grew 40% year-over-year. So, overall I think people are standardizing on our platform, the usage starts always pretty much with AEM plus analytics and now Campaign as a third leg of that. Robert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay. And lastly for Mark, just a clarification from the earlier questions on retention or renewal rates, now that we\u2019ve had 10 quarters at Creative Cloud behind those. Could you talk a little bit more about the cohort turn of the original class from 2012, let\u2019s say or early 2013 in terms of their retention rates to go back eight, nine, ten quarters. How does that retention look? Mark Garrett :  Yes, so Jay, we can\u2019t kind of get into that level of detail here, but the bottom line is like I said from a retention perspective people are renewing after the promotion along the lines of what we would had expected it\u2019s not even better than we had expected. All I\u2019m chatting here, one thing I try to be very clear about the impact of the Digital Marketing shift from perpetual to term. I think we laid it out at the end of my prepared remarks really well. So if you any questions please refer back to that paragraph and then we can do some more follow-up phone calls, because we try to lay it out exactly as we had in the past under the Creative transition. Shantanu Narayen :  Next question. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Samad Samana \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, & Co., Inc.: Hi thanks for taking my question, I wanted to ask you about ELA that you kind of after a little bit over a year now. What has existed in upselling that in the installed base and how is the integration we put there, rest of the Marketing Cloud going for that, that\u2019s sort of products? Shantanu Narayen :  Really well. That\u2019s the solution that we now call Adobe Campaign. Adobe Campaign had another strong quarter in Q3 pipeline looks great for Q4. And the ability to orchestrate these multiple Campaigns across the web, e-mail, SMS outside the U.S. which is pretty strong, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of Campaign so far. Samad Samana \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, & Co., Inc.:  And have you seen any change in the competitive environment? ExactTarget with Salesforce for a while now and their customers acquire it for renewals. Has there been any change in the competitive environment in the marketing space for you guys? Mark Garrett :  Well, I think from a competitive point of view as this market continues to explode, you\u2019re seeing everybody participating that we still think we\u2019re the leader in the category and our solutions are most differentiated. And we continue to grow that by both expanding our footprint, so specifically as it relates to ExactTarget versus Campaign. A lot of the Campaign solutions for us right now are Greenfield opportunities as people are continuing to implement and automate their marketing processes. So we\u2019ve been focused a lot of that. Samad Samana \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. Mark Garrett :  Operator we\u2019re coming up on the hour, so maybe we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert Baird. Your line is open. Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird.: Hi, thanks very much for speaking again. Hey, I just wanted to swing back to the Digital Marketing business. Again you talked about the nice increase at the number of larger deals that\u2019s happening there since you introduced platform and I was hoping to get more color over how you\u2019re driving that is that coming from you going back to the installed base and cross-selling multiple solutions into existing customers. Or is that also coming from new customers buying more solutions when they initially buy and where you're getting kind of traction of bundles expect? Shantanu Narayen :  Steve, the short answer is actually its both, its both and its happening both through our direct salesforce and honestly its happening through partners who are increasingly recommending us as the solution of choice as they going to all of these digital transformation products. Again, I would say till two quarters ago it was largely driven by the combination of AEM and analytics. And then the cross-sell was media optimizer and social and target. Today I would say the initial sale is much more AEM plus analytics plus Campaign because that\u2019s being very well received. And then the upsells continue to be those other solutions. In terms of industries retail continues to be really strong, automotive is strong, financial services is doing well. Government as government does digital government we\u2019ve had a really strong presence with AEM and analytics and government as well as document security there. So, we\u2019re seeing trend good positive trend across every industry. There isn\u2019t a CMO in the world that I go to who is and talking about digital transformation and trying to understand how technology helps them. So I think it\u2019s that tremendous tailwind, Steve. Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird.: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you, Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Well, thanks for joining us, I mean, I think as I think about all of the questions I do want to reiterate what\u2019s traditionally being a weak quarter for Adobe Q3, we really have strong performance both with subscriber additions over $0.5 million, Digital Marketing bookings that was strong as well as Document Services revenue in Q3. And as a result we\u2019re on track to deliver the key financial commitments that we outline for the second half of the year. On the Creative Cloud it still is how do we drive customer adoption and migration to Creative Cloud. Adobe.com has been focused on this for a couple of years and now the entire channel ecosystem as well ELTAs through the enterprise we\u2019re focused on this. In Digital Marketing I would say awareness has being growing, we continue to drive leadership with successful product launches of our marketing products. The fact that we\u2019re seeing this shift from perpetual to term, we view that as a real positive, because people are shining these large multiyear agreements with us. On the internal side, the innovation engine is humming. We\u2019re delivering new value with Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud as well as Document Services. And I think the earnings upside continues to demonstrate the leverage of our financial model. We are excited about MAX and we look forward to seeing you there. Thank you for joining us. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call. Thanks for joining us.",

Shantanu Narayen : FY '14 was an outstanding year. Our achievements included better-than-expected Digital Media ARR and subscriptions, strong bookings growth for Adobe Marketing Cloud, broad industry recognition of our product leadership, and great progress in growing and deepening our customer relationships.  In Q4, we delivered revenue of $1.07 billion, contributing to total revenue of $4.15 billion in FY '14. In Digital Media, Creative Cloud continued its strong performance. As of the end of Q4, Creative Cloud adoption grew by more than 644,000 to over 3.45 million subscriptions, significantly exceeding our annual target. Subscription growth was fueled by continued movement of the Creative Suite installed base to Creative Cloud as well as the addition of customers that are new to Adobe creative products. We saw strength across all our offerings : Creative Cloud Complete, Creative Cloud for teams in the channel and on Adobe.com, Creative Cloud Single App and the Creative Cloud Photography bundle.  Creative Cloud innovation continues to accelerate. At MAX, we unveiled another major update to Creative Cloud, which includes significant new versions of CC desktop tools, a new family of complementary mobile apps, touch support for Microsoft Windows 8 and Surface Pro 3, and the new Creative Profile, which connects creatives to their work, assets and communities. We made significant strides in realizing our vision for Creative Cloud as much more than desktop tools. The Behance creative community continues to thrive, growing to over 4 million members.  We launched a public beta of a Creative SDK that enables the delivery of third-party mobile apps that connect to Creative Cloud. This move comes on the heels of our September announcement when we acquired Aviary, a developer of mobile SDKs for the delivery of creative apps.  At MAX, we launched Creative Talent Search, a service that connects creatives around the world with job opportunities. This was the first step in making Creative Cloud a true marketplace for the creative community.  Today, we took another major step in expanding the marketplace with the announcement of our intention to acquire privately held Fotolia, a leading service for creatives to buy and sell photos, graphics and video. Stock content is critical for creatives and is a large and fast-growing multibillion-dollar market. Once closed, we intend to integrate Fotolia into Creative Cloud, resulting in higher ARPU and increased revenue. We also plan to continue to operate Fotolia as a standalone stock content service. Creative Cloud has become the preeminent destination for creatives, transforming how they find inspiration and deliver their best work. The Document Services business continues to grow. PDF and Acrobat remain the de facto standards for document creation and collaboration. In fact, we have more than 1 billion cumulative downloads of Reader on desktop and mobile. In FY '14, we drove strong year-over-year and sequential growth in Document Services ARR, primarily due to strength in the adoption of Acrobat ETLAs and subscriptions. We have introduced new mobile and cloud capabilities to increase usage of our document creation, sharing and EchoSign electronic signature services. We have permission to expand our footprint and extend our brand in these areas, and are excited about a major update in the first half of FY '15.  Across our Creative and Document Services businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $1.95 billion at the end of FY '14.  In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings in Q4 and we were well ahead of our 30% annual growth target. Reported revenue for Adobe Marketing Cloud in Q4 was $330 million. We continued to deliver significant innovation in Adobe Marketing Cloud during Q4. Mobile is a key focus area for us, and we launched new mobile functionality across Adobe Marketing Cloud in 2014. Last month, we introduced new intelligent location marketing features, allowing companies to reach their customers with targeted content based on a user's proximity to iBeacons. In October, we released cross-device targeting and personalization capabilities via Adobe AudienceManager. With these capabilities, marketers now have the tools to profile which individuals in a household are consuming content on a connected device at any given moment. In the video space, we announced the availability of Adobe Primetime Digital Rights Management across mobile apps on connected devices and via HTML5 on major web browsers. We continue to drive large-scale engagements with Adobe Marketing Cloud customers. Big deals in Q4 included Ford, FedEx, MasterCard, Morgan Stanley, QVC, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Analytics are our unique differentiators and continue to be the foundation of our growth. Adobe Target and Adobe Media Optimizer solutions had strong results in Q4. One of the best performing solutions in Q4 was Adobe Campaign, which came from our acquisition of Neolane last year. This is another proof point of our success in integrating acquisitions to effectively expand our offerings to customers.  Adobe Primetime, which brings TV to every IP-connected screen, is gaining traction among both programmers and operators in the fast-growing online video market. In October, we announced an alliance with Nielsen to deliver the industry's first comprehensive, cross-platform system for measuring online TV, video and other digital content across the web and apps. Both companies will jointly market Nielsen's Digital Content Ratings, Powered by Adobe, which will give customers comparable metrics to measure audiences accurately and consistently across every major IP device, including desktops, smartphones, tablets, game consoles and over-the-top boxes. The Nielsen alliance builds on other Adobe Marketing Cloud strategic partnerships announced earlier this year, including our relationship with advertising giant Publicis.  With over 30 trillion data transactions measured annually by Adobe Marketing Cloud, we're in a unique position to predict and report on major retail and consumer trends. Through our Adobe Digital Index report, we recently tracked Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales. Our prediction came within 1% of the nearly $6.4 billion spent online, and 22% year-over-year growth versus 2013. Another interesting statistic was that over 1/4 of Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday online sales were transacted on a mobile device. Press coverage of our holiday reports was extensive across online, print and broadcast channels.  Adobe Marketing Cloud continued to be recognized as the leader in numerous industry analyst reports. This quarter, new recognition includes : we were named the leader in the first-ever Forrester Wave report, evaluating the most significant marketing cloud vendors. Adobe Marketing Cloud was positioned highest in current offering, strategy and market presence; and Adobe Experience Manager was recognized as a leader in the 2014 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Web Content Management report. Adobe was positioned highest in ability to execute and placed strongly in completeness of vision.  Our strong results in 2014 represent the collective efforts of our employees around the world. Creative Cloud has become the preeminent destination for millions of creatives, and we are delivering more value every day. The Fotolia acquisition gives us yet another opportunity to grow Creative Cloud revenue and tighten our bond with the creative community. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to lead in the fast-growing digital marketing category and we're seeing strong partner and customer momentum. And we're shaping new opportunities for our Document Services business. All of this positions us well for another strong year in 2015.  Mark? Mark Garrett : Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2014 results. In FY '14, Adobe achieved annual revenue of $4,147,000,000. GAAP EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.29. All of these results were well ahead of the annual targets we provided entering the year. These numbers are a result of strong execution against our strategy, and from some noteworthy achievements during the year.  In FY '14, we reported Digital Media segment revenue of $2.6 billion, ahead of our target of $2.5 billion that we communicated last December. More importantly, we built Digital Media ARR to a total of $1.95 billion exiting the year, which was nearly $100 million higher than the annual target we provided last year. Helping to drive this was 3.45 million Creative Cloud subscriptions exiting the year, more than 400,000 higher than the target we provided a year ago. In Digital Marketing, we drove record Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings well above our target of 30% growth for the year. As we outlined in September, reported revenue for Adobe Marketing Cloud was impacted by the faster-than-anticipated transition of Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Campaign to a subscription-based revenue model this year. Were it not for the quicker shift to ratable revenue, Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue would have grown 21%, above our original target of 20% annual revenue growth in the year.  Other financial highlights during the year include growing deferred revenue to a record $1.16 billion and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $1.74 billion exiting the year; together, this represents nearly $3 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time; and returning nearly $700 million in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of FY '14, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,073,000,000, at the high end of our targeted range. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 were $0.14, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.36.  Highlights in our fourth quarter include driving strong adoption of Creative Cloud across all offerings : individual, team and enterprise; growing Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings well ahead of our target; managing expenses to deliver upside on earnings per share; achieving $400 million in operating cash flow; and exiting Q4 with 66% recurring revenue. In Q4 of last year, the percentage was 44% and in Q4 of fiscal 2012 it was 27%.  In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $649 million. This segment has 2 major components of revenue : our Creative family of products and our Document Services products. In our Creative business, adoption of Creative Cloud accelerated significantly quarter-over-quarter. We exited Q4 with 3,454,000 Creative Cloud subscriptions. Adoption across all Creative Cloud offerings grew quarter-on-quarter. Retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions, including renewals after promotional pricing expiration, continues to track ahead of our initial projections.  Average revenue per user, or ARPU, within each of our Creative Cloud offerings maintained steady levels consistent with results over the past year. Blended ARPU across all Creative Cloud offerings declined slightly as a result of the significant increase in new Single App subscriptions.  It is important to note that the unit mix between Creative Suites and individual point products in our perpetual offering was approximately 50-50. We are excited that adoption of Single Apps and the Creative Cloud Photography plan is expanding our market opportunity. During this growth phase, we fully anticipate the percentage of Single App subscriptions will continue to grow. This strategy is driving higher ARR and revenue, and creates the opportunity to drive even higher revenue through ARPU-enhancing services. Adoption of Creative Cloud for teams accelerated in Q4, with momentum in both the channel as well as on Adobe.com. Our success with individual and team subscriptions, and enterprise term license agreements, or ETLAs, helped to drive Creative ARR to a total of $1.68 billion exiting Q4 at constant currency from December of 2013, an increase of $272 million quarter-over-quarter.  In Document Services, we achieved revenue of $197 million in Q4. Revenue declined slightly quarter-over-quarter, offset by strong growth in ARR. Strong adoption of Acrobat ETLAs, subscriptions, and cloud services including EchoSign helped to grow Document Services ARR to $271 million exiting Q4 at constant currency rates, a $54 million sequential increase over Q3. In our Digital Marketing segment, there are 2 components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering, and our momentum as the leader in this market continued. We achieved revenue of $330 million in Q4. More importantly, we drove record bookings that put us ahead of our goal of 30% bookings growth for the year.  Our Adobe Marketing Cloud success is being driven by an increase in the size of transactions, number of solutions per customer, international expansion and growth in partner-driven business. Adobe Analytics, Experience Manager, Campaign, Target and Media Optimizer all had strong bookings which sets us up nicely for FY '15.  The mix of Adobe Experience Manager and Campaign that was ratable versus perpetual revenue grew to approximately 75% for the year. As you recall, we explained in September, our target for that mix entering the year was approximately 60%. Were it not for this incremental shift of approximately $60 million of revenue to ratable with these 2 solutions, we would have achieved 21% Marketing Cloud revenue growth for the year. The growth rate would have been greater than 25% for the year if no shift at all had occurred, and we are reiterating our 25% Marketing Cloud revenue CAGR. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $44 million in Q4 revenue, consistent with our expectations. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $50 million in Q4.  Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies, and we saw increased adoption of Creative Cloud subscriptions in Japan. Asia as a percent of total revenue remains lower given Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud adoption trails other geographies. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $11.7 million. We had $12.2 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '14 versus $1.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '14, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.6 million.  From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $8.8 million. We had $12.2 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '14 versus $3.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '13, thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.3 million.  In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 21% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted primarily due to stronger-than-forecasted profits outside the U.S. Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 12,499 versus 12,368 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 50 days, which compares to 52 days in the year-ago quarter and 48 days last quarter.  Cash flow from operations was $400 million in the quarter. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.74 billion compared to $3.52 billion at the end of Q3.  In Q4 FY '14, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares at a total cost of $127 million. For the year, we repurchased 10.9 million shares at a total cost of $689 million.  Now I would like to go over the acquisition announcement we made today, as well as provide our financial outlook.  Today, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Fotolia in an all-cash transaction of $800 million. We expect it to close in the second half of Q1 and add approximately $75 million in FY '15 revenue, net of purchase accounting adjustments. We believe this transaction will be neutral to non-GAAP earnings in FY '15 and accretive in FY '16. At this time, we cannot estimate the impact to earnings on a GAAP basis.  Fotolia is a U.S.-based company, so we're primarily using onshore cash for the transaction. The bulk of their operations and business are in Europe, and we intend to invest in the business during the year to drive broader global adoption of their services, particularly in the U.S. We see significant synergies over time with Fotolia and our Creative Cloud offering, in what is a large and fast-growing market.  Turning to our financial outlook. The targets we are providing today reflect current currency rates and exclude any benefit or impact from the announced acquisition of Fotolia.  We are happy to report we are either on track or are ahead of key long-term goals we set a year ago. Consistent with our target of approximately 20% compound annual revenue growth between FY '14 and FY '16, we are targeting total revenue of approximately $4.85 billion in FY '15. We expect GAAP earnings per share of $1.20 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.05, which is ahead of the target we provided a year ago.  As we've mentioned before, we will adjust ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material FX changes. Our FY '14 exiting Digital Media ARR of $1.947 billion was based on December 2013 FX rates. We've revalued that ARR amount based on December 2014 FX rates, and this has led to an updated ARR of $1.875 billion, which is approximately $72 million lower entering FY '15.  In Digital Media, we remain on track to drive a revenue CAGR of 20% between FY '14 and FY '16, supported by strong growth in ARR and the subscription adoption we've driven. In FY '15, we expect to grow ARR by greater than 50% from $1.875 billion to approximately $2.9 billion by year end. We expect to grow total subscriptions by approximately 70% year-over-year and exit the year with approximately 5.9 million subscriptions. We also expect continued ETLA adoption during the year.  In Digital Marketing, we have strong momentum with Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings. We expect to continue to drive annual bookings growth of 30%, with annual reported revenue growth of approximately 25% in FY '15. Both are consistent with our long-term targets.  During FY '15, we anticipate revenue and earnings will grow sequentially every quarter during the year. Given strong adoption in Q4 and normal seasonality in Q1, we expect net new Creative Cloud subscriptions will decline in Q1 when compared to the 644,000 we added in Q4, and then grow sequentially in the second, third and fourth quarters. We expect Digital Media ARR to follow the same trend.  In Digital Media, we expect creative revenue to grow significantly year-over-year. We are targeting Document Services revenue to grow slightly year-over-year. We also expect annual revenue for LiveCycle and Connect, and for Print and Publishing, to decline slightly year-over-year. Quarterly Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings and reported revenue should also follow normal seasonality during the year.  In Q1 of FY '15, we are targeting a revenue range of $1,050,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. Again, this excludes the expected benefit of adding Fotolia during the quarter.  We expect Digital Media segment revenue to grow sequentially in Q1. Within Digital Media, we expect Creative revenue to grow sequentially, with Document Services revenue declining slightly. In Digital Marketing, we are targeting Q1 Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue to decline on a sequential basis and grow on a year-over-year basis.  We expect combined revenue with LiveCycle and Connect to decline sequentially. We also expect Print and Publishing segment revenue to decline.  We are targeting our Q1 share count to be 508 million to 510 million shares. We are targeting net nonoperating expense to be between $12 million and $14 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of 25% to 27% on a GAAP and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.14 to $0.20 per share, and a Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.34 to $0.40.  In summary, 2014 was a great year. With multiple growth opportunities and category-leading products, we are poised to see strong revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. Mike?

Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Jefferies. Brad Zelnick : Can you please just talk a bit about the evidence that you're seeing Digital Marketing and Digital Media categories driving demand for one another? And maybe if you could share trends in the percentage of enterprise deals that include solutions from both sides of Adobe. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Thanks, Brad, first, on your comment on the quarter. We were certainly pleased with what we accomplished in Q4. With respect to joint deals that we are seeing that's primarily with the ETLAs as well as the Digital Marketing bookings that we are seeing, and it actually is across most segments, Brad. In the publishing space for sure, people are using our digital creation tools as well as our infrastructure tools. We're seeing a fair amount in retail as people are trying to create campaigns. We've talked about companies like Under Armour who are using all of our products. We're seeing that in video, as people are using both Primetime, as well as Creative Cloud, Premiere, as well as our digital marketing products like Primetime. And so I think across the board, while we might lead with CC ETLA and then go in with Digital Marketing or might go in with Digital Marketing and then come back to a CC ETLA. And at the end of the day, I mean, more marketing is moving online. And I think our sales force goes in with a one Adobe [ph] story. Clearly, DPS is another area where we're seeing synergy between the 2 businesses, and now what we have with PhoneGap Enterprise. Brad Zelnick : It's definitely working. Just one more follow-up, if I may. Last quarter, you noted about 20% of CC users were new to the franchise. Are there any directional updates on this? I know it's only one quarter since when we think about the mix. And can you maybe comment on any thoughts you might have on where this can go as you penetrate into new geographies and perhaps capture some of the opportunity on piracy? Shantanu Narayen : Well, 2 thoughts there, Brad. The first is, while we don't do the surveys every quarter, certainly given the strength that we saw in Q4, we are confident that we are continuing to attract new customers to the platform. What was really nice about Q4 was we actually saw strength across every single offering in all the geographies. You correctly point out that we are still focused primarily on developed markets and we continue to think that emerging markets is an opportunity over time with differential pricing and products. But at this point, I would say, we are still just combating casual piracy in developed markets and really attracting new customers. One thing I will mention also is that one of the offerings that we added in Q4 was the team offering on Adobe.com did not have the Single App option. And so allowing that just enables teams to be more collaborative, and so team had a good showing in Q4 as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Brent Thill : Shantanu, just on the acquisition. I'm just curious if you could walk through the revenue model. Just casually going through the site, looks like you can pick up stock photos for single dollars or videos for high single digits. How does the revenue model work for Fotolia? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. So, Brent, I mean the big picture is that with Creative Cloud continuing to become the preeminent destination for creatives, all our surveys show that our customers of our creative tools are the primary purchasers of stock content, creative assets that exist. I would look at Fotolia today and really their presence is more in Europe. In the U.S., they have attempted to come in with an offering that is aimed at beyond the creative professionals. The sweet spot for us is with the creative professional community, we think all the millions of creative professionals will be people who will acquire these products. And I think the offerings will look like an on-demand offering where people who have need for a specific content can go online and find and search it. We will have subscription offerings which exist as a standalone service, which allow people to just subscribe and get a certain number of stock content on the frequency that they want. And as you can imagine, once we are closed, I think we have opportunities to also offer our desktop products in conjunction with the subscription offering of our stock content. So I think we see a lot of options. And what that should result in is, first, more stickiness with our creative community because they have a one-stop shop for talent search, buying stock as well as the creative tools. And that should hopefully result in increased revenue and increased ARPU. Brent Thill : Okay. And real quickly, on the Marketing Cloud, you highlighted a handful of big deals in that campaign. It was one of the best performers inside this suite. Can you maybe just bring us up to speed in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the deal sizes? Are you seeing a nice improvement as, back to your original comments, they're taking more of the suite? Any color to help us understand the direction of the Marketing Cloud on pricing would be really helpful. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, we didn't update this time, Brent, the number of large deals, million-dollar deals. I know we've updated that in the past. But when you drive record bookings, you're certainly driving it at a more strategic level with adoption of multiple solutions. We highlighted Campaign because we've always believed that campaign orchestration was important. We are winning a number of deals of what was traditionally e-mail service provider accounts with Campaign, so I wanted to make sure that we highlighted that in the quarter. But it's a spectrum. I mean, we have really large deals that we are seeing from customers at the CMO, CEO level. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Walter Pritchard : I'm wondering if you could, Mark, just give us a little bit more detail on the mix of versions -- or not versions, but point versus suite. You talked about, in your perpetual business, a 50-50 mix. Did you throw that out there to sort of point us to that's where it is today? Or is that where you think it'll be in '15? Or just trying to get a sense of how we should be thinking about where it is right now. Because you've provided that the last -- I guess since you've started undergoing the transition, and then, how we should think about that in the future. Mark Garrett : Yes, I think the most important thing to remember is that this is right on strategy. The idea of selling more single apps, especially as it relates to driving a higher market opportunity and attracting new users, and that's working really, really well. So what you see in subs, what you see in ARR is a result of driving new users to the platform, which we would not have been able to do without these single apps. The mix was really just to show you that what's happening is not terribly different from what you saw under the suite model with the Perpetual offering. We're not saying that it's ultimately going to settle in at 50-50, but it's certainly going that direction. And you can see that in the mix this quarter. If you do the math on the mix this quarter, you'll see that it's roughly 50-50 in terms of the net new adds this quarter. So we had really good uptick in the full units this quarter, but we also had a nice increase in the single app. And that's right on strategy. Shantanu Narayen : And also, overall, we are convinced that it is increasing the total available market, and we continue to see, as people adopt the individual app and they get familiar with our products, it represents an opportunity for them to migrate up to Creative Cloud Complete. Walter Pritchard : Got it. So just actually, that was, Shantanu, the follow-up I had for you. We did some survey work just a little bit ago, and one thing we noted is there was a high intention from point product customers to upgrade to suite. Some short term, some over time. Can you talk about -- it hasn't been that long that you've had the point product out, but it's been -- some of those folks are -- were renewing in the quarter. Can you talk about sort of any color on how many of those renewed to the full suite from the point? Shantanu Narayen : Well, what we said, I think, in the prepared remarks was that retention continues to be ahead of our internal expectations. And while we continue to have pricing that's promotional in nature to get customers to migrate from CS to Creative Cloud when they, then, continue to stay on the platform, they are actually -- the retention is at the higher price points. So we're happy about that. We have become really good by using our own digital marketing products, Walter, in terms of the pipeline. So while I have numbers, everything, from new trial users, how many are overlapping with Behance, how we are seeing them going through the funnel in terms of usage. It was such a strong quarter across all elements : new customer acquisitions, upgrades, retention and team. We were really pleased. And I think, if we take a step back, it just reflects. First, we're continuing to deliver significant product value for the customers. They're seeing that innovation, things like Touch that we delivered in the quarter; second, the sole focus on all routes-to-market on the Creative Cloud is certainly helping. There isn't perpetual anymore in the channel. And I think, third is we're just getting better at dealing with this consumer marketing funnel in the business unit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : So I got 2 quick questions. The first one is you have subs increasing next year from 3.5 million to 5.9 million, which is a 71% increase in subs year-over-year, but you have ARR in Digital Media increasing over 50%. Can you give us some color maybe, Mark, on the -- what the disconnect is? Is it ETLAs growing slower or Document Services ARR growing slower? What -- how should we think about that? Mark Garrett : Yes, I don't you should think about it as ETLA growing slower. I think you should think about 2 things, Mark. One is the $1 billion increase reflects new FX rates, right? So there is a fairly significant, as you know, from every company, change in FX, and that has a chunk of it in there. Plus, as we were just talking about with Walter's question, we are seeing more single app to acquire new customers and expand the market. And I think it's primarily those 2 things. I don't think you should read anything into that in respect of anything slowing down. Mark Moerdler : Okay. And then as a second question, can you give us a sense in terms of digital marketing, whether -- and you talked a little bit about it, but in terms of how much of the mix of the growth is coming from expansion into the existing customers versus sales to new customers. Shantanu Narayen : It's across the board, honestly. I mean, we're seeing new logos coming into the platform. I think we highlighted some of the key customers. But without a doubt, within existing customers as well. If they were an analytics customer, they are continuously looking at the Experience Manager. If they're using both of those. Campaign, which was such a strong showing in the quarter, is certainly seeing more adoption within Analytics and Experience Manager. And I think what we said at our prior call is we're seeing something like 74% growth in customers with 3-plus solution products. This was the data that we had provided at MAX. So I mean, that continues to be the case, and we're seeing the ARR of customers with 3-plus solution products in the millions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : It looks like you're well on track to hit about 6 million subs by the end of next year, which relative to the TAM that you laid out, I think, in the spring of last year, Mark or Shantanu, is roughly about 50%, a little bit less than 50%. The question for you, Shantanu, is are we in the second innings of a cricket game or second innings of a baseball game? And depending upon how you're going to answer the question, I'd like to also find out, if it is indeed a baseball game, how much larger can the TAM be? Especially because when I look at the upside of this quarter, even if you didn't have a positive deviations in the point solutions, you would have still had a very good quarter, just with the full suite lot. It looks like you're expanding the TAM but I don't want to get too ahead of myself. If you can just put it in context, that will be very appreciated. Shantanu Narayen : Well, first, for the sports fans on the call. Baseball, having 9 innings, we certainly believe that we're definitely in the second innings of a 9-inning game rather than a 2-inning game, Kash. So we continue to think there's significant upside. I think we provided the numbers on the number of Creative Suite perpetual products and licenses that we've delivered. As you can see from our numbers, there's significant headroom. I think you are continuing to see, as we have said, new customers being attracted to the platform. And if I take a step back, we're actually executing against everything we laid out 3 or 4 years ago. We're continuing to migrate customers and demonstrate value and drive customer satisfaction to be higher. We are adding new customers, the Individual apps are certainly attracting new customers to the platform. And the ARPU-enhancing services, things like Fotolia, I think, we're really excited about how that also, not only keeps the current customers on the Creative Cloud, but that it also brings people who may be laggards onto the Creative Cloud, because it just demonstrates more value that we're going to be providing. So I think Mark's numbers reflect why we continue to be really enthusiastic about this business in '15 and beyond. Kash Rangan : Wonderful. And on the Fotolia side, to the extent that you know this information, how many subscribers do they have? How many of them are CC or CS users already? And what is the rough potential for cross-selling the core Creative Cloud family to the Fotolia user base, and vice versa? Anything, any color commentary. Qualitative would be fine. I understand that you may not be able to share numbers, because the deal's not closed yet. Shantanu Narayen : Well, Kash, we did surveys of our creative professionals. And I would say, the vast majority of creative professionals that exist globally are customers of stock content. So I first want to -- in terms of the available market opportunity, it's important to remember that we believe that every single creative professional is a customer of Fotolia. The other thing we actually find is that a number of marketers are the people who actually buy this stock content to use in campaigns or put on websites. So the customer base for Fotolia actually extends beyond the creative professional as well as the marketer to, also, consumer hobbyists. As we look at the numbers right now, and it's really early with Fotolia, we certainly think that getting access to Fotolia content to every one of our creative professionals is the opportunity that we have. There's a high overlap, clearly, of the Fotolia customers who are already Creative Suite or Creative Cloud customers, but we can package it and provide a lot more value as we move down this path. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan : Two questions, if I could. Just first on operating expense growth. That's been really impressive this year in the sense that it's been very low. I think 3% for the year, 1% in the quarter. And if I look on a sort of trailing 3-year [ph] basis, I think OpEx grew something more like 8%, on average, over the last 3 [ph] years. So I'm just curious, either Shantanu or Mark, is this sort of lower trajectory of operating growth sustainable? Could you maybe just provide some color? Mark Garrett : Hey, Ross. It's Mark. Yes. I mean, I think the bottom line is we really felt it was important to drive earnings leverage back into the model as revenue starts to come back, since we're through this transition now. And that's what you're seeing both in FY '14 and especially in FY '15 as we move from $1.29 to $2.05 and then, to over $3. So earning starts to come back into the model in a big way. OpEx will increase, probably a little bit more than what you've seen recently, and that's obvious for you guys to figure out as you do your revenue model and figure out what the OpEx is that'll drive that EPS. So the short answer is we've done a great job this year of containing costs and still hitting all of our targets. As we build out more and more of an enterprise sales force, you're going to see us invest more and more in sales and marketing. But it's all embedded in that $2.05 and over $3 in '16. Ross MacMillan : That's great. And then just a clarification for me. Mark, you commented that the unit mix between Suites and Point products in your perpetual offering was 50-50. I think my reference was going back to the Analyst Day in '13 when you described that installed base of Suites versus Point products of $12.8 million. And I think it was more like 2/3 Suites versus 1/3 Point products. Is there some kind of bridge there that I'm not seeing to connect the 50-50 with that sort of 2/3-1/3 mix? Shantanu Narayen : Again, we'll go back and look at those numbers, Ross. I think, from a revenue point of view versus units point of view, there's a difference, clearly. And revenue was more towards Suites than it was towards Point products. But we'll get back to you on that one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. S. Kirk Materne : I guess, maybe just first, Shantanu, you mentioned that when customers have come back to renew, they're renewing at a higher price than the promotional price they might have signed up on. I guess I just want to clarify that, that's correct. And I guess have you had any pushback from clients that maybe signed up on promotional? And I guess, how are you dealing with that in terms of making sure that they obviously still feel like they're getting the value? I guess, could you just give us some color on how that's been going? Because you obviously have a much bigger cohort renewing at this point this year versus, say, last year. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Well, just to clarify, the promotional pricing tends to be more on the CC Complete than it is the CC Photography. So the CC Photography, the pricing is now the permanent pricing. And what we were trying to do it was reflect that long-term customers of CS, if they had just bought CS6, they were entitled to promotional pricing for a year. And yes, I was saying that as they, then, retain or renew after a year, they are renewing. And I think the big reason for the renewal is they're seeing the amount of innovation that we're delivering. I mean, we've delivered over 1,000 features; we now have mobile apps that we've delivered, they're looking at the services like share and sync, what we're delivering with points. So again, continues to be incumbent on us to demonstrate the value of our Cloud Service by constantly providing new value to them. S. Kirk Materne : Great. And then, just one for Mark. Mark, on the Digital Marketing side, obviously, in the back half of the year, you had a lot of sort of mix of Experience Manager and Campaign going more ratable. I guess, will that cause the actual revenue growth of digital marketing in 2015 to be a little bit more back-end loaded? Meaning, you'll still be going up against the sort of headwinds in the first half of the year? Or am I sort of overthinking that? Is the growth in bookings going to overcome that so it's -- you're perhaps not so much of a step function in the back half of the year than I might be assuming? Mark Garrett : Yes, you're right. It isn't going to be a little bit more back-end loaded. You also have seasonality going from Q4 to Q1, as I said, in Digital Marketing. So you're going to have a lower Q1 than you did in Q4 but up year-over-year. But you're right. It's going to be a little bit more back-end loaded because of that mix shift that you saw from '14. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Brendon Barnicle : Shantanu, I wanted to follow up on the Marketing Cloud. Some of our industry contacts have been suggesting that customers are starting to want to see more commerce apps and functionality tied more directly into their marketing platforms. Are you seeing that trend? And how do you see tying more commerce into the Marketing Cloud, potentially? Shantanu Narayen : I think at the end of the day, Brendan, when people are re-platforming their website, commerce is definitely one of the key reasons why they're doing that. We have partnerships with virtually all of the key commerce providers, including hybris, that's available through SAP. And so I think what we find is, whether it's an Adobe installation or whether it's one of the numerous partners that we have that's built digital transformation practices on our solution. They have all the tools that are required to take Adobe Experience Manager and tie into whatever commerce engine exists. So we view that as a partnership opportunity. Brendon Barnicle : So you haven't seen it as a disadvantage that you don't have it natively? Shantanu Narayen : No, we don't. I think the big thing that CMOs, really, are focused on is how do they deliver really great, rich, interactive experience on mobile devices and tablets. And I think every report that you read out there demonstrates that we have the best technology in that space. Brendon Barnicle : Terrific. And just a quick one, Mark. You mentioned in your prepared comments the slight dip in overall ARPU because of the single app subscriptions. I was also wondering if there's any seasonality that you ever see in ARPU. I just didn't recall. Mark Garrett : I don't think you should think about ARPU as seasonal. It's really driven by that blended rate, which I would encourage you guys not to focus on. It's really driven by mix. Like we said, ARPU across each offering through the year has either been consistent or, frankly, up throughout the entire year. Shantanu Narayen : The 2 things you might think of in that particular space, the first is education. And when there's an education season, there's a high potential for a lot more edu [ph] units during that season. The second thing I would say is that as we are seeing former Premiere Elements or Photoshop Elements customers think about what a holiday purchase might be, the Creative Cloud Photography bundle is certainly, hopefully, high on their list of things that they want to get their kids and family. And so I would say, you'll see that a little bit of seasonally in the holiday season. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Steven Ashley : Great. I'd just like to start and ask about ETLA activity. Maybe you could give us a little bit more color around how that performed in the period -- and if there are any renewing ETLA agreements from a year ago, how that might have gone [ph]. Shantanu Narayen : So Steve, when you think about enterprise agreements in the ETLAs for the Creative business or the Acrobat business, they tend to be 3-year agreements. The vast majority tends to be 3-year agreements. And so they're not up for renewal, really, yet. Clearly, in the Digital Marketing business, we have renewals happening all the time. And that continues to perform well. In fact, I would say that the organization has done a really good job this year of making sure that we drive new bookings growth over and above renewals at the existing level. So I think the team has done a good job there. And with respect to color, overall, in that business, the enterprise business did really well in Q4. And I think that's why you see the strength. It's become a traditional Q4 seasonally strong quarter, and I think that's just true of all enterprise companies. Europe did well. North America did well. Australia continues to be a strong performance for us as well, from a geo perspective. Steven Ashley : Great. And just my follow-up. I'd like to ask about the single app business, which has really been strong here and, I think, aided by the Photoshop Lightroom, which really helped you tap into a whole new vein of customers. Are there other opportunities similar to that to introduce single apps that might be more segmented to tap other new user groups? Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think that our mobile apps, Steve, we certainly believe that everybody is -- want to be creative. And our job is to continue to make the power of our creative tools available to everybody. So as our mobile apps, we've seen millions of downloads of the mobile apps that we deployed at MAX. I think we definitely have opportunities to provide a different kind of a subscription service for the vast non-photographer, creative community. But at this point, we're still pretty ruthlessly focused on the creative and the photography segments, because those are the largest and those are the ones that are really where we need to focus. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Shateel Alam : This is Shateel Alam, filling in for Heather. So you said your blended ARPU declined again for the quarter. I understand how single app subs are bringing this down, but you should also have some positive factors offsetting this like promo pricing from Creative Cloud anniversary-ing. I just want to know, when should we expect your blended ARPU to trough and begin increasing again? Should we expect that sometime in fiscal '15? Mark Garrett : Well, again, we pointed out that 50-50 mix because we want you to understand that there's a good chance that single app will just keep growing and may grow faster than full for the reasons we mentioned, and it does expand the market opportunity for us. So we view that as strategic and very positive. I don't think you should expect that ARPU number. Even though, again, I encourage you not to look at a blended ARPU number, I don't think you should expect that blended ARPU number to go up soon. We also have, down the road, other opportunities like Fotolia to help bring ARPU up. Shantanu Narayen : Hey, Walter, I just wanted to go back to your question as well because I just looked at the data. And what we said was right. The unit mix in the historical perpetual business was 50-50, which was inclusive of commercial enterprise, education, upgrades, et cetera. And as I mentioned, the revenue mix was closer to 70-30. And I think the data that we presented in May 2013 was showing the installed base and not the annual unit mix of perpetual users and point product users. And so if customers in multiple point products, and as they migrate to suites, we de-duped [ph] and normalized that for -- in our installed base data. So hopefully, that provides that -- or Ross. Shateel Alam : Just one follow-up. On Adobe Marketing Cloud, that grew 15% this year. What drives that to 25% growth for '15? And is there any assumption of acquisitions in there? Shantanu Narayen : There's no assumptions of acquisitions. Mark Garrett : Yes, I was just going to say that. We don't assume acquisitions in our guidance. The growth really comes from the fact that, obviously, you're bringing more and more revenue in from bookings, and you also don't have the big shift from perpetual to hosted like we had in '14. The shift is, for the most part, going to stabilize now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Breza from Sterne Agee. Robert Breza : I was wondering if you could comment geographically whether you're seeing the single app uptake, are you seeing it more here in North America? Or geographically, just curious to understand kind of the geographical mix. Shantanu Narayen : I think it's fairly consistent across all geographies. I won't point to any real difference in adoption right now between geographies. Robert Breza : As you look at bringing in Fotolia into the group, I think in your prepared comments you said it was -- mostly dominated in Europe today. How do you think or how do you plan to bring that more back towards the North American market? Just curious to understand the geographics. Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think the first thing that we hopefully have is affinity with our customers, and the brand that Adobe has in the U.S. market continues to be strong. I think they have a really good technology. And that, coupled with our brand and our ability to deliver that to our customers, we're confident. The surveys that we've done, again, as we said earlier, was that the creative professionals continue to look for stock photography as a mechanism to start a particular creation. And over time, we can also provide value-adds by helping integrate that within our products as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Shantanu, I'd like to ask, first for you, about the product and services game plan for 2015 and beyond, based on some of the strategies that you and David laid out, for example, and Brad, at the Summit back in March and at MAX just a couple of months ago. So the Digital Marketing Summit, for example, you spoke very broadly about enabling what you called the real-time enterprise and then spoke specifically about some core services that you would need to deliver to enable that and also alluded to the possibility of Marketing Cloud turnkey solutions for the SMB market. So I'd like to ask if that's something that you're still looking to do. And similarly, at MAX, you talked about increasingly tiering or segmenting the Creative Cloud. And so is that still [ph] something that you're expecting to roll out in '15 and beyond? And then, I've got a follow-up for Mark. Shantanu Narayen : So Jay, first, with respect to the announcements that we made about the Marketing Cloud, and as you pointed out, for services, clearly, we're hearing from our customers, as they adopt multiple solutions, that they want to continue to see things work more consistently across our solutions and the value-add that we can provide. So for example, the product that we have, Adobe AudienceManager, that's perceived to be a really key enabling glue between all of our products in order to enable people to use the same segmentation of users across media optimization or across targeting or across analytics. That's a great example of a core service. The visualization, the ability to, again, run a campaign across all of these different products is another one of the core service that, I think, the team continues to perform. And we've also always talked about the fact that we have all of these data transactions and the ability to derive insight from what's happening on those for our customers continues to be an area of value add. And in SaaS-based businesses, unlike the perpetual product, we're constantly delivering that value add to our customers right through the year. So yes, in 2015, we will continue to deliver more core services, and I would highlight AudienceManager as one of the key areas. The other one, I think, we've talked about also is media mix. All CMOs are trying to understand how they do media mix across each of their different channels. And I think that's another area that we have some unique technology. With respect to the Creative Cloud and the creative business, we're excited about Fotolia. I think it represents a great opportunity in the sharing economy. And the entire community can now participate, whether it's finding talent or whether it's being able to acquire stock. And so yes, expect to continue to see new services that are being added, and Talent Search and Fotolia are just the 2 most recent ones. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay. And for Mark, in your prepared remarks, you suggested that in fiscal '15, Doc Services revenue would be up only slightly. And that would be so in spite of your expectation of -- I assume it's still your expectation, of an Acrobat release next year? Mark Garrett : Yes, yes. Shantanu talked about a release in the first half of the year. And the only reason I'd say it's up slightly, Jay, is because we are driving more and more towards ETLAs in the enterprise. And you'll -- you're seeing that in the ARR. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Samad Samana : I would like to ask you on Fotolia. So Shutterstock would be a natural competitor, and it looks like they're growing around a 40% level. I was wondering if you could just give us an idea of how fast Fotolia was growing, and how you're sizing that market. Shantanu Narayen : Well, in terms of the sizing of the market, I think we definitely view it as a multibillion-dollar market. You're right, in that the other players in that space are growing very rapidly. We're not providing historical information on Fotolia today. But we certainly have high aspirations for the growth in that market for Adobe as well as for the entire market. Samad Samana : And then one follow-up to that. So they offer both annual and monthly subscription plans. And I know you're not disclosing the size of their subscriber base, but could you give us an idea of the mix between annual and monthly subscribers? To see what their pricing model looks like. Shantanu Narayen : I think it's all a little early. We haven't even closed the deal. We just announced the definitive. And I think, as the business gets integrated into Adobe, we'll definitely, as we do with all of our other businesses, provide more color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Congrats on the continued growth here. I wanted to focus in on part of the Digital Marketing business. Mark, automation [ph] obviously, over the past couple of years, we've seen a lot of consolidation in the space, including you guys. Just wondering if we can get an update of what you're seeing. Sort of post the acquisition, any change in sort of the competitive [ph] dynamics or how you're positioning the product, et cetera? Shantanu Narayen : Well, first, thanks on your comments on the quarter. I think, with respect to Digital Marketing, there's no question that everybody views this as the most explosive enterprise category that exists. I think our unique differentiation continues to be the fact that we've targeted marketers. And when we talk about the fact that it's becoming the real-time enterprise, I think the tentacles of the Marketing Cloud are certainly spreading into the rest of the organization and needs to be integrated with that. I think in that context, we continue to see real great traction for our particular solutions. But the standard players, whether it's Oracle or IBM or Salesforce. I think they also see the opportunities that exist. We continue to do really well against each one of those competitors in the marketplace.  Given that's the last question, I just wanted to say that I'm really proud of what Adobe and our employees accomplished in both Q4 as well as FY '14. We really continue to focus on delivering value and innovating in these large, growing markets where we both have a license to play as well as, we believe, we have tremendous customer affinity and a strong brand. We executed against our goals of adding ARR, migrating existing CS customers as well as attracting new customers. And we continue to be really excited about the opportunity that we see ahead of us in Digital Marketing. More importantly, with initiatives that we just announced delivering our Marketplace, integrating our Marketing Solutions and reimagining our Document Services, we believe we are positioning the company for even better things in the future. So thank you for joining us today, and happy holidays. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call. Thank you.",

Shantanu Narayen : FY15 is off to a strong start. In Q1, we reported revenue of $1.109 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44. We achieved solid growth across our Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud businesses, and delivered a new wave of product innovation. In Digital Media, Creative Cloud continues to be the preeminent destination for creatives around the world, enabling them to work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. While the desktop applications continue to be the foundation of Creative Cloud, 50% of Creatives are using mobile devices in their creative process. Over 30 million mobile apps have been downloaded, including capture apps like Adobe Brush and Shape, as well as desktop companion apps for Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC. Over 5 million new free subscribers were acquired through our Creative Cloud mobile apps since MAX in October. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of Photoshop last month and were blown away by the tremendous response from customers, partners and the press. Photoshop is one of the world's most iconic brands and has had a profound impact on every form of design and media, from animation to photography to film to web design. Through consistent innovation over the span of two and a half decades, Photoshop has stayed fresh and relevant and is now attracting a new generation of fans. We continue to successfully migrate the Creative Suite installed base, as well as bring new customers into the community. In Q1, Individual and Team adoption grew by 517,000 to over 3.9 million subscriptions. This represents 28% year-over-year growth in net new subscriptions. Creative Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR grew to $1.79 billion exiting Q1. Delivering on our promise to make Creative Cloud the one-stop shop for creatives, we closed the acquisition of Fotolia in January. Stock content is a part of an incremental $4 billion of addressable market for Adobe. 93% of stock content sellers and 85% of stock content buyers use our tools. Work is underway to integrate Fotolia into Creative Cloud, providing current and future Creative Cloud members with the ability to access and purchase over 35 million images and videos within the Creative Cloud experience. We will also continue to operate Fotolia as a standalone stock service, accessible to anyone. With seamless integration, we believe we can increase Creative Cloud ARPU over time, as well as grow Adobe\u2019s share of the stock content market. In Document Services, today we announced the Adobe Document Cloud, a modern way to manage documents at home, in the office and across devices. Adobe Document Cloud will include an all new version of Acrobat called Acrobat DC, which has an intuitive, touch-enabled interface and features revolutionary new mobile capabilities. For the first time, eSign Services, formerly Adobe EchoSign, will be included with every Adobe Document Cloud subscription to enable sending and signing from any device. Adobe Document Cloud will integrate analytics and capabilities to manage, track and control documents. Adobe invented PDF and it is the de facto standard in the documents category. We see a sizable opportunity ahead of us in the documents space to monetize the millions of existing Acrobat customers and hundreds of millions of Reader and PDF users. We plan to make Document Cloud available to our customers as both a perpetual and subscription offering within the next 30 days. It will also be available to our Creative Cloud subscribers as part of the full Creative Cloud offering. In Q1, we reported Document Services revenue of $193 million and exited the quarter with $297 million of ARR. Across our Creative and Document Services businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $2.09 billion as of the end of Q1. In Digital Marketing, reported revenue for Adobe Marketing Cloud in Q1 was $311 million, representing 17% year-over-year revenue growth. Last week, we held our Digital Marketing Summit in Salt Lake City, which has become the premier marketing industry event for marketing, media, and publishing professionals around the world. With over 7,000 attendees, Summit has become the biggest pipeline building event of the year. We introduced two new Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, Adobe Primetime, the industry\u2019s leading multi-screen TV platform; and Audience Manager, our fast-growing data management platform as well as new capabilities in Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics. We highlighted advancements in mobile marketing and app development, the extension of marketing intelligence into product design and Internet-of-Things, and the fusion of ad-tech and marketing technologies. Customers from some of the world\u2019s top brands joined us on the keynote stage, including executives from Under Armour, Time Warner Cable, Girl Scouts of America, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and National Australia Bank. Partners play a significant role in our go-to-market strategy and the ecosystem of companies who recommend, sell, and deliver Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions continues to grow. We announced a new partnership with IBM, which will provide specialized enterprise consulting capabilities for Adobe Marketing Cloud. We announced an expansion of the alliance with Accenture through the launch of Accenture Customer Engagements, a cloud-based managed service that simplifies the development, execution, and measurement of digital marketing.  We have built two fast-growing cloud businesses and are well on our way to building a third. All three share a common goal of enabling our customers to make, manage, measure and monetize virtually every type of content. We are driving the future of digital media and marketing in a way that no other company can, and we are excited about our roadmap for the year. Mark? Mark Garrett : In the first quarter of FY \u201815, Adobe achieved revenue of $1.109 billion above the high end of our targeted range. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.17 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.44. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Fotolia which contributed $7 million in revenue in Q1 and was not material to non-GAAP earnings per share. Highlights in our first quarter include, delivering revenue above the high end of our targeted revenue range; achieving 28% year-over-year growth in net new subscriptions to Creative Cloud; closing the acquisition of Fotolia, which when combined with other creative marketplace services we offer, increases our creative addressable market by $4 billion, Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $311 million and exiting Q1 with a record 70% recurring revenue. In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $703 million. This segment has two major components of revenue, our creative family of products and our Adobe Document Cloud products. In our creative business, we exited Q1 with 3,971 million Creative Cloud subscriptions. Net new Creative Cloud subscriptions increased by 517,000 in Q1, consistent with our expectations given Q1 seasonality. Retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions, including renewals after promotional pricing expiration, continues to track ahead of our initial projections. Q1 adoption of Creative Cloud for teams grew substantially on a year-over-year basis, and we are building a healthy Enterprise Term License Agreement or ETLA pipeline. Average revenue per user, or ARPU, within each of our Creative Cloud offerings maintained steady levels, consistent with results over the past year. Blended ARPU across all Creative Cloud offerings declined slightly as a result of mix. As we discussed last week at the Financial Analyst Briefing at Summit, Creative Cloud Single Apps and the Creative Cloud Photography Plan are expanding our market opportunity through the addition of new customers, and create the potential for higher ARR in the future via ARPU-enhancing services such as Fotolia, and upsell to higher-tiered Creative Cloud offerings. Consistent with our expectations, creative ARR grew to $1.79 billion, an increase of $180 million quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, we revalued ARR exiting FY2014 based on December 2014 currency rates. With Document Services, in advance of the Adobe Document Cloud launch, we achieved revenue of $193 million. Document Services ARR grew to $297 million exiting Q1. This ARR growth was driven by adoption of Acrobat ETLAs, subscriptions and Document Services including EchoSign. In our Digital Marketing segment, there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering, and our momentum as the leader in this market continued. Last week at Summit, we discussed growth with large customer engagements and multi-solution selling. Our announcements and the pipeline that gets built at our conference should continue this success in 2015. In Q1, we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $311 million, up 17% year-over-year and consistent with our expectations. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $46 million in Q1 revenue, consistent with our expectations. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $49 million in Q1. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $17 million. We had $24 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY15, versus $12 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY14. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $5 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $26 million. Considering the $24 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY15, versus $3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY14, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $5 million. In Q1, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 48% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe\u2019s trading companies. These one-time costs were partially offset by tax benefits related to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D credit in December 2014. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 12,698 versus 12,499 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 44 days, which compares to 46 days in the year go quarter, and 50 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $183 million in the quarter. The sequential decline from Q4 is consistent with previous first quarters since prior year annual bonuses and commissions are paid in Q1, as well as prepayments of certain employee fringe benefits for the current year. Deferred revenue grew to $1.18 billion, up 34% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.18 billion, compared to $3.74 billion at the end of Q4. The primary driver of this decline was the acquisition of Fotolia which closed during the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares at a cost of $174 million. In January, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us the authority to repurchase an additional $2 billion of common stock through the end of FY 2017. Now, I would like to provide our financial outlook. In Q2 of FY'15, we are targeting a revenue range of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion. Assuming the midpoint of our Q2 revenue range, we are targeting total Digital Media and Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue to grow sequentially. We also expect LiveCycle and Connect revenue, and Print and Publishing revenue to be relatively flat. During the quarter, we expect to add more net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and Digital Media ARR than what was achieved in Q1, and we continue to expect both to grow sequentially in the third and fourth quarters. We are targeting our Q2 share count to be 508 million to 510 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $15 million and $17 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share, and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.41 to $0.47. We\u2019re pleased with our performance in Q1, and we\u2019re off to a great start for the year. Mike?

We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick at Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Thank you very much for taking my questions. Mark, you said the 517,000 Creative sub adds was consistent with your expectations, given Q1 seasonality. So this is very different than last year\u2019s Q1 seasonality if we just look at subs. But can you maybe frame it for us in the context of total Creative units since obviously there is a lot less Creative perpetual revenue this year? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. So let me also jump in a little bit on color for the quarter and then Mark can add to that. I think we\u2019ve been telling you for a while that Digital Media ARR is really the best health for the business, and as you saw that grew to $2.09 billion. One of the things that I think we should also reflect is that, we offer customers multiple ways to acquire Acrobat subscriptions. And depending on the type of customer, this can get reflected in either the Creative subs and ARR Brad or the document ARR. So when you acquire Acrobat as part of CC offering whether it\u2019s single app or complete, that\u2019s reflected in the Creative ARR. And when you get it as part of the Document Cloud offering, the ARR is then reflected in the Document Cloud. And this is actually very similar to the way in which we offer the perpetual software when we had Acrobat as well as Creative Suite. So one of the things in the quarter was that as we contemplated the Acrobat mix changing, we experimented we\u2019re driving more Acrobat in conjunction with the Document Cloud launch. So if you look at the Acrobat subs ratio in Q1, if they were reflected in CC subs similar to prior quarters, the Creative reported subs would have been significantly higher. And so I think a number of you probably had the mix different in terms of being over-weighted in CC subs and ARR since you guys were unaware of the experimentation we were doing in conjunction with the Doc Cloud launch. So when we look at the results that we had in Q1 overall, as it relates to Digital Media ARR and adoption of the Creative Cloud and Acrobat, that\u2019s why we said it was very much in line with our targets. Mark Garrett : I think the only thing I would add to that\u2026 Brad Zelnick : Thank you. That\u2019s actually helped. Mark Garrett : The only thing I would add to that Brad is in Q4, we did have holiday promos, especially around photography to drive adoption in advance of the holidays. And in Q1, we really did not have any of that. So we didn\u2019t have much from a promo perspective in Q1 driving units. Brad Zelnick : That\u2019s helpful. And if I can just slip in one quick follow-up. Mark, I think, you see it in the release or in your comments, but especially in light of Fotolia closing and the volatility in FX translation and the impact that that has, can you just remind us of your full year targets? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Yes. Let me ask you since you brought up FX, let me talk about FX for a couple minutes because it is important. And there\u2019s three considerations that you should consider as it relates to FX, right. One is revenue. Two is the balance sheet and specifically deferred revenue. And then the third is ARR, as it does impact ARR as well. So let me just walk through each of those. I think I have explained this over the years. We have a hedging program to hedge a portion of our revenue through a cash flow hedging program. So we have revenue and expense in euro, pounds, and yen, as you know and we hedge a large portion of that net position of revenue versus expense in each of those currencies by buying put options. And we hedge a few quarters out at any point in time and we have been doing that for years and you saw it worked very well in Q1 and Q2 -- in Q1 I should say. Because we hedge a few quarters out in a rate dropping environment, it was minimal impact to our revenue after hedging in Q1 and you saw that in the results. At current rates, I would also expect minimal impact to revenue after hedging in Q2, and that\u2019s factored into the Q2 guidance that I provided. And as we learn more about rates going forward for Q3 and Q4, we will let you know about any potential impact at that time. And as is customary for us, we are not going to update our annual targets at this time. The second piece is the balance sheet. The deferred revenue balances, the balance on the balance sheet is protected. However, again, in a rate declining environment since deferred revenue balances are made up of activity from as much as a year ago, the deferred revenue that comes off the balance sheet is at a higher rate than the new deferred revenue going onto the balance sheet. So the rate drop does have an impact to net new increases to deferred revenue. And then the last piece is ARR. So as you know, we report ARR in constant currency from the rate at the start of the year. And as you know, we revalued our year ending \u201814 ARR based on December '14 rates. But when you compare Q1 of '15 net new ARR to Q1 of '14 net new ARR, it\u2019s a similar situation to deferred where in the '14 net new ARR, you would be building that up at a higher rate and that lowers the reported year-over-year growth. So it\u2019s likely had a mid-single-digit impact on year-over-year net new ARR growth in Digital Media. So that\u2019s kind of a mouthful, but I know there\u2019s going to be a lot of questions on FX and hopefully that clears it up. Brad Zelnick : No. That\u2019s very helpful. And just on the full year targets and I\u2019ll leave it here after this. The 5.9 million Creative subs and I know that\u2019s only one piece of a much bigger story, but everybody seems to focus on it, that still stands and you still feel confident in that for the year? MarkGarrett: So again, Brad, we customarily do not update annual guidance after Q1 and we\u2019re not doing that today. But as Shantanu said, we\u2019re happy with how we did in Q1 and it\u2019s consistent with our expectations. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Next question please. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Hi. Good afternoon. On the marketing side, number continues to do very well. I\u2019m just curious when you look at the percentage of the revenue that is perpetual now versus recurring. Can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing going forward in that line? And I know it was seasonal in Q1 when you called for that and anything else we should think about as we\u2019re modeling that up for the year. MarkGarrett: Yes. Brent, as we said, towards the end of last year, we\u2019ve kind of gotten to the point where the perpetual number is pretty small. I mean, it\u2019s going to bounce around a little bit based on customer preference, but it's not. It's not a material number anymore and it's not going to swing the revenue that much anymore. So we feel good about the fact that that has transitions into a more ratable model now. Brent Thill : Okay. And the follow-up for Shantanu on Document Cloud, I know there is pieces of this that you had and somewhat of a re-brand. Can you just give us a sense of maybe what\u2019s new at a high level and what opportunity you think this can unlock? Now, it seems that you\u2019re a more focused on this than perhaps in the past. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Brent. I mean, I think the fundamental issue is that the need to manage documents and document workflows is actually increasing rather than decreasing. And we have this incredible franchise when we think about both the reader, distribution that we have across virtually every device, the fact that we've distributed over a billion of them. And the fact that PDF has been accepted as the de facto standard for documents. So when you put that together and you consider the massive shift that's happening from paper to digital, we just think we have a really unique opportunity to convert paper documents to this high-quality PDF that you can edit, you can auto populate, you can fill forms, you can send for signatures and more. And so what we announced today was as part of the Document Cloud Acrobat DC, which is a completely re-imagined user experience far more simple, far more intuitive, we've aligned all of the product offerings from Acrobat to reader to standard, all associated with Acrobat DC. And then the other thing we've done is a huge focus on mobility, so we\u2019ve designed Acrobat DC to be touch enabled and work seamlessly across devices. These signatures are now part of every subscription of Acrobat DC and we think that integrating documents across other systems like Office 365 as well as other storage providers we've added significant more value. And so we just feel like this is a large opportunity, it\u2019s ours to win. And I think when you think about both, what's being used within the Document Cloud, as well as I mentioned earlier, Acrobat within the Creative Cloud, it just continues to be an opportunity that we focus on. So as we think about the year for Acrobat, we think we will keep revenue relatively consistent with last year, but we will grow ARR quite a bit. And so I think we're excited about that. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley for Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Steve Ashley : Great. I just had maybe my first question on the Marketing Cloud. Just wondering if you had any color around bookings growth you\u2019re seeing there? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. Steve, I think, the bookings growth again were in line with targets that we have. As you know, you were there at Summit. Summit was an incredibly successful event for us. It\u2019s -- as we said in the prepared remarks, the largest pipeline growing event for us. I think, we continue to grow our lead in that particular category and our recognized does that. So we\u2019re pleased with what we did in Q1 and continue to be really bullish about the opportunity that Adobe has in the marketing space. Steve Ashley : Yeah. One other things you guys talked about at the Marketing Event was some of the core services in the Marketing Cloud included assets. And I\u2019m just wondering in terms of the long-term strategy, is there a plan or hope to maybe link that to the Creative Cloud and if there is maybe you could talk about that a little bit? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. I think the core services that you\u2019re alluding to Steve, for the benefit of others on the call, I mean, there are things like what we've introduced with audience manager, the ability to run both campaigns and to have them specific to customer segments, whether you're doing that for your media span, whether you're doing that associated with understanding analytics or targeted campaigns and converting them to paying customers. With respect to the integration of the Clouds and today I\u2019ll say, three Clouds. One of the things that we continue to view is Asset Management is the core of what you can do between Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud. You saw number of customers talk about how the velocity of content creation is increasing and how the fact that we have integrated, the Clouds help them with that. So the core service I would say are the Asset Management service that's part of the Marketing Cloud, the ability to run campaigns and overtime you can also look at the audience segmentation. The other thing, I think, we showed at Summit was the ability to look at an asset as part of the sneak and understand how effective the usage of that asset was creative asset across all campaign. So I think that also give some indication of the innovation that we\u2019re doing in this space. Steve Ashley : Great. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research. Your line is now open. Brian Wieser : Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I was wondering if you can update us on the backlog for the overall business and separately, I was wondering if there\u2019s any characterizations you can offer on the numbers of customers you have in the Marketing Cloud alone? MarkGarrett: Hi. It\u2019s Mark. So on unbilled, we only disclose that number with the K at the end of each fiscal year. So, obviously, we would expect that to keep growing, but we don't disclose the number other than at the K. Shantanu Narayen : And Brian, with respect to the number of Marketing Clouds customers, they are in the thousands. I think the focus on those customers as you know is both with new logo addition, as well as with increased upsell of our existing solutions, but we don't have an update to that number. It is clearly in the thousands and growing well. Brian Wieser : Okay. Great. And for me just one brief question around Nielsen and your relationship there, just wondering if you could update us on when you expect to see product in the market and any current commentary on relationships, evolution of that product? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. Brian, the rational for the partnership that we announced was that, every single advertiser and publisher would like to see consistent cross domain understanding of customers. And since we are clearly the leaders of what\u2019s happening in web analytics and Nielsen is a leader of what\u2019s happening on TV, providing a consistent demographic of who\u2019s viewing what content across what device is something that the two of us can uniquely provide. We are working together. We don\u2019t have an update on exactly when that\u2019s going to be in market. But it\u2019s been received well by publishers and advertisers because they do want that currency to cut across multiple TV screens, multiple screens. Brian Wieser : Great. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Brendan Barnicle : Thanks so much Mark. In your prepared remarks you mentioned that blend in AR -- blended ARPU across Creative Cloud offerings declines slightly as a result of mix. We\u2019ve seen that for a while now as you\u2019ve had individual product sales. When do you think that starts to bottom out? Are you guys modeling a point where that bottoms out? Mark Garrett : Yeah. Actually it\u2019s come down this quarter less than it has in recent quarters. So it was a much smaller decline this quarter. So it is conceivable that we are starting to see that now actually. Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. When we look at it, maybe I\u2019ll just add to that. We found the ARPU very healthy in the quarter. The thing to remember again is the steady state of the creative business for sure what we had was both a mix between the full units as well as individual point units. And I think we\u2019ve stated in the past that if you consider it from a revenue point of view, it was approximately a 70-30 towards the suites. And if you consider it from a units\u2019 point of view is 50-50. And when we rolled out the Creative Cloud, as you know we rolled out the Creative Cloud complete first and then added offerings such as the individual lap offering for team as well as the CCPP offering. And so all of this is happening in line with our expectations. We are increasing the market for both of those, but the revenue that we see today for Creative Cloud complete as a percentage of the total revenue is higher than what it was with the creative suite offerings. So things are playing out in line with our expectations. Brendan Barnicle : And Shantanu, at the marketing companies, is it clear you are seeing bigger deals and bigger RFEs. Do you have any commentary of what you seeing on a sort of ARPU over Marketing Cloud side of business? Shantanu Narayen : Well we don't use the word ARPU there. But in terms of the large deals and the number of transactions greater than $500,000 or $1 million we don't have an update right now. Actually Brad had some data that he put in that datasheet so that does reflect the progress that we are making in multi-solution selling. We are not updating that today over and above what Brad described at the marketing summit, Brendan. Mark Garrett : And just for reference those are in the slides on our IR site, there's a reference to the summit slides from last week that you can access that information at. Brendan Barnicle : And then just one last product question Shantanu on the document cloud, I was wondering what you guys are seeing with EchoSign and changes in the competitive landscape there? Thanks. That\u2019s it for me. Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think with respect to signatures, the demand for signatures the organic demand for signatures and making that paper based workflow move digital. I think we are seeing tremendous demand for that. I think there are a couple of players in that market. I think today's announcement allows us to enable every reader on every device to start to participate in the electronic signature workflow, which we think will be a jumpstart both for us as well as other players in that market. It's going to be a big market and it's going to take years by the time we get all of the approval. So I think everybody is going to see a significant amount of growth. And there are other competitors as you point out. But we really like what footprint we have right now and the offering that we have in the market. Brendan Barnicle : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler at Bernstein. Your line is now open. Mark Moerdler : Thanks. This is Mark Moerdler. So quick questions, do you believe the FX has had any impact on subscriber\u2019s adoption in any of these regions. Do you think you\u2019ve seen anything slower in terms of the mix of subscribers? And was the FX itself a larger impact on creative than other divisions? Then I have got a quick follow-up. Mark Garrett : I mean the net to both of those questions is no. I don't think it has any impact on customer adoption and the FX is going to be skewed towards where revenue is by currency and that's not going to be much different for creative versus other pieces of the business really. Shantanu Narayen : Mark, just to, again clarify, both all of the individual offerings, team continued to do well in the quarter. We had a strong quarter for team, as it related to Creative Cloud subscriptions. And again, I do want to repeat that the Acrobat subscriptions in the quarter, virtually every one of them went against the Document Cloud ARR as opposed to the Creative ARR but it is reflected in the Digital Media ARR. Mark Moerdler : So is that going to then -- is that a long-term impact? In other words, are we going to see more of those subscribers float over? I know you\u2019ve guided to a number in terms of subscribers for the year, but overall should we see that as a long-term gain that those pick ups are going to occur on the document side? Shantanu Narayen : No, I think we were experimenting this time, as it related to the Document Cloud launch. I think we continue to think that there's a tremendous headroom in the Creative Cloud install base that we will continue to drive towards. And we remain confident about the long-term subscriber numbers as well, that we will continue to drive in Creative. But I think, this time we wanted to reflect that you see that strength more on the Document ARR than the creative ARR. Mark Garrett : And that mix -- that mix, Mark, would\u2019ve been factored into the 5.9 when we guided. Mark Moerdler : Okay. And one another quick one, does the Document Cloud drive any change in revenue recognition license versus subscription? Shantanu Narayen : Well, we certainly have subscription as an offering right now. That subscription offering for Acrobat has been there for a while. We continue to believe that as you -- the migration will not happen the way the Creative Cloud migration happened. So, we've said that revenue we expect to be in the Document Cloud business relatively flat for the year but ARR to grow well. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks. Good evening. Mark, question for you first. Regarding the revenue profile in parts of your business, particularly marketing cloud because that is -- you have a mix in some cases of platform access revenues and then you have a large mix of course of usage based or transactional based revenue. Could you talk about how you think that mix might evolve both in the marketing cloud side of the business and perhaps in the other sides of the business, Creative Cloud or doc services in terms of platform and usage based revenue and then a follow-up? Thanks. Mark Garrett : If I understand you correctly, Jay, I mean for the most part, it\u2019s all usage based. I mean, some of it is specifically tied to usage numbers every single quarter. Some of it is based on an annual usage number. But for the most part, it is usage-based revenue kind of oriented. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay. Okay. On the Creative Cloud subs add number, two things you mentioned last week at Summit that you have 5 million trial users signed up from your player downloads. How are you thinking about converting those to paying subscribers? And in terms of another potentially very long source of subscriber add, particularly for DSLR. How are you thinking about converting the old element space to subscription? I would think that the package full of elements would have over the years generated several millions at least of nominal users, so how are you thinking about converting them? Shantanu Narayen : It\u2019s a good question, Jay. I think both the millions of elements customers that we have, as well as the over 30 million Acrobat units that are out there, both represent an install base that we will consider moving to the appropriate subscription offering. So more specifically to your question about elements, the elements base, certainly we believe a better migration path for them moving forward is the Creative Cloud Photography. Both the elements base, as well as the trial users, we have a very carefully constructed campaign to continue to your target them and have them move over from being trial users to being paid subscribers of the Creative Cloud and we will continue to execute against that opportunity. Jay Vleeschhouwer : All right. Just one more if I may, Mark, your Q1 cash flow was relatively low or lower than Q1 last year anyway? In spite of that just given the revenue staffing of various subscription businesses and margin expansion that you will likely see this year, were there the reason that your operating cash flow should probably meet or beat $2 billion for fiscal \u201915? Mark Garrett : So I am not going to guide to a total number for the year, Jay. But suffice it to say that this is a low quarter coming off of Q4 with all the payments that we make in Q1 and it\u2019s going to back very nicely through the rest of the year. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks a lot. Operator : And your next question comes from line of Jennifer Lowe at Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. I wanted to touch quickly on the reseller channel and in particularly in Q3 there was little bit of air pocket there given the pulling out of perpetual but seemed like that came back pretty strongly in Q4? Do you think the reseller channel is now kind of stable where you like to see it at this point? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. I feel good, Jennifer, about how the reseller channel is also focused on the Creative Cloud opportunity and how they're executing against it. They are certainly targeting the installed base and helping them migrate from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud. So we feel good about it around the world. Jennifer Lowe : Great. And then just one for, Mark, this is the second quarter in a row, where expense growth -- operating expense growth has been less than a percent, which is pretty impressive given, especially how you are investing in the Marketing Cloud? I guess, two questions, one is, how much of that, or maybe really just one question, how much of that is upward figure proactively making trading costs versus something more tactical like FX? Mark Garrett : It\u2019s not FX. We manage the cost structure the company very, very carefully. We've always been very good at that frankly. We've got the money we need to invest in the business. We\u2019ve got the sales capacity we need to invest in the Digital Marketing business. That OpEx number, you are going to see it start to grow. Now as we go through the year, don't forget when you come off of Q4, there's a lot of additional comp expense for sales commissions and things that you have in Q4 that you don't have in Q1. So that's a big reason for what you see between Q4, Q1. But it will ramp as we go through the rest of the year and you'll see that based on the guidance for the year that we had provided. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Samad Samana : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to touch base on Fotolia with the acquisition that closed? Could you remind us how many subscribers they have and could you share any data on the overlap between their subscriber base and who is using the Creative Cloud already? Shantanu Narayen : We have not provided their subscriber base numbers. What we have provided is the overall market available opportunities. So, we've said, when you consider all of services, it\u2019s approximately a $4 billion. We have also shared everything over 90% of the people who contribute stock content, use our tools and over 80% of those who buy that stock content use various tools. And strategically, what you should think about it is that the integration is on track. We will continue to offer as a standalone service the two models that Fotolia had namely on-demand model as well as a subscription model for stock photos as well as we will introduce new offerings, which includes Creative Cloud and stock offering. So that's conceptually how you should think about it. When it's introduced into the market, we\u2019ll certainly provide more details. Samad Samana : Okay. And if I could ask one more on the Creative Cloud side of the business. Historically, you provided a mix between point products and full suite numbers. You didn\u2019t break that mix out this quarter. Could you give us an idea if there is any type of meaningful change directionally between the mix that you\u2019d seen over the last few quarters and this quarter and that\u2019s my last question? Mark Garrett : It\u2019s Mark. It\u2019s 59% full. Samad Samana : Okay. Great. Thanks for that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard at Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. Mark, I\u2019m just wondering as we think about seasonality this year on the subscriber side. You put the line in the mark that you would expect subscribers to grow each quarter. It seem like did you step up a meaningful year -- more meaningfully during some of these quarter at $5.9 million and I\u2019m wondering with this experimentation in Q1 that it sounds like it\u2019s about to continue in Q2. Should we expect that there is sort of step back up from Q1 and Q2 with some of the Acrobat stuff coming back into the Creative Cloud market? Mark Garrett : So yes, there will be a step-up from Q1 to Q2. It wouldn\u2019t just be from Acrobat. It would be a natural step-up as we march towards that $5.9 million that we had guided to but definitely a step-up from Q1 and Q2. Shantanu Narayen : And Walter, the other thing as you are aware is as we continue to rollout the innovation roadmap that also continues to get people who are on CS6 of prior versions moved over to the Creative Cloud. So that will continue as well. Walter Pritchard : And I have just one follow-up. Last year, you had a sort of discrete events with the major launch midyear and then in Q3, you saw basically cleared lot of the point products, the package products and they started selling. That seemed like that was a bit of a shocking arm for the subscribers\u2019 growth numbers during the year. As we looks at this year, is there anything like that we should be aware of that would impact our seasonality other than from the fact that you addressed there? Mark Garrett : We\u2019re not announcing products but, Walter, I think to the question that you asked you can expect that we\u2019re going to be coming out with a fair amount of innovation. And if you look at our historical delivery, delivering something again in a few months would be consistent with what we've done last year, yes. Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thanks very much. Mike Saviage : Operator, while we take -- operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt Williams at Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Matt Williams : Hi guys, sitting in for Kirk Materne. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe if you could provide a little bit of color on sort of how you are thinking about the reacceleration of Marketing Cloud revenues throughout the remainder of the year given that you are lapping the anniversary of deferring more of the experienced manager campaign revenue? Mark Garrett : Yeah. I mean, we had -- as you know, we had guided to 25% revenue growth for the year. We start out the year here with 17%. It definitely ramps the growth from a year-over-year perspective. We will ramp pretty much every quarter as we get up to Q4 to get to that 25%. Matt Williams : Okay, great. And I mean this but did you guys give up booking growth rate for the Marketing Cloud for quarter? Mark Garrett : Now we did not. We don't disclose the bookings growth rates every quarter. We just said -- Shantanu had mentioned that we had a good quarter. Matt Williams : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Derrick Wood at Susquehanna International Group. Your line is now open. Derrick Wood : Thanks. Last week, you guys talked about the TAM for the photography market being significantly higher than the traditional creative products and now you\u2019ve got a more strategic cloud focus on document side. So have you guys done the work to kind of update the total user TAM and the Digital Media segment? Shantanu Narayen : We certainly have a lot of data on what's happened with the Acrobat segment as well. And I think to Jay\u2019s question earlier, as well in terms of what the available opportunity is for us to attract customers who previously brought elements that is -- I think at max, you can expect us to continue to give you an update on what's available as a total available market. We are not certainly providing that level of detail on our earnings call, Derrick. Mark Garrett : And Derrick, you could also watch the slides from the past that have also disclosed some of that, so I\u2019ll be happy to follow-up later on where we will discuss sort of the Document Services TAM and related addressable markets. Derrick Wood : Okay. And then on the -- you guys mentioned that ETLA pipelines are building nicely and I suspect ETLAs were seasonally softer in Q1, as is typical. Can you just remind us as what kind of seasonality you typically see throughout the year and then, whether do you think the Document Cloud will help drive some kind of incremental strength in the size of ETLA? Shantanu Narayen : So, ETLA is typically, as you\u2019ve seen historically, Q4 tends to be a seasonally very strong quarter. Q1 does, as you point out, tend to be a weak quarter and then it starts to build up and so we expect to -- as Mark also said in the prepared remarks see a sequential increase. And to your other question, there is no doubt in our mind that what we're seeing is, as we have multiple offerings that are targeting an enterprise, our ability to sell higher into the organization and sell more complete solutions is increasing. And from that point of view, the availability of the document offerings will only help the fact that we have creative offerings, as well as we have marketing offering. So, I think all of those with the announcement of the Document Cloud should be positive. Derrick Wood : All right. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Since that's a last question, maybe I will just recap and say, we're proud of what we accomplished in Q1 and the strong start that we had to fiscal \u201815. It was a strong revenue, as well as EPS quarter. We drove strong Digital Media ARR and had a very successful Summit that we organized in Utah. We announced the new Document Cloud this morning and the reception to that has also been extremely positive. Fotolia integration is on track. We will make available the Document Cloud to our customers also this quarter. And so we feel like we're in great shape and we remain focused on driving both product innovation, as well as strong financial results for the rest of fiscal \u201815 as well as beyond. Thank you for joining us today. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call.",

I would like to welcome you to Adobe Systems Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ian and I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Saviage : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe's President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO; and David Wadhwani, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Digital Media.  In the call today, we will discuss Adobe's second quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results. We will also review announcements made earlier today regarding our latest Creative Cloud release, and our new Adobe Stock offering. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago. We've also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, our financial targets and an updated investor datasheet on www.adobe.com. If you would like a copy of these documents, you can go to the Investor Relations page and find them listed under Quick Links.  Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue and operating model targets, and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, June 16th, 2015, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure in the earnings press release and financial targets document we issued today as well as Adobe's SEC filings.  During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is available in our financial targets document and in our updated investor datasheet on Adobe's Investor Relations website. Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live in Adobe Connect, and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe's Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days and is the property of Adobe. The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.  I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Adobe delivered strong results in Q2 with revenue of $1.162 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48. Momentum across our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Marketing Cloud businesses drove these results.  As digital continues to disrupt industries, Adobe is uniquely positioned to help brands, media companies, government agencies and educational institutions create digital experiences that are unique, relevant, and effective across every touch point. We are the only company with the vision and assets to address the entire content lifecycle \u2013 from creation and delivery to optimization and monetization. We are accelerating the pace of innovation in each of our Cloud offerings and customers are looking to us to provide a complete, integrated platform for their digital transformation.  Adobe Marketing Cloud is the industry's most comprehensive offering. We had strong bookings in Q2 and reported revenue of $327 million, representing 15% year-over-year growth.  We continued to drive Adobe Marketing Cloud adoption across all eight solutions in Q2 and saw a significant uptick in customers acquiring multiple solutions. In fact, two thirds of our top customers this quarter licensed multiple solutions. Key customer wins included Saks & Co, The Gap, DirecTV, Fox Entertainment and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The breadth of Adobe Marketing Cloud has been extended with two new solutions, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Primetime. Adobe Audience Manager is a data management platform that integrates online and offline data enabling marketers to create and target audience segments in their multi-channel campaigns. Adobe Primetime is a multiscreen TV platform that helps broadcasters, cable networks and service providers create and monetize engaging and personalized TV and film experiences. Primetime has emerged as the global leader in powering TV content across screens, including over-the-top devices such as Apple TV and Roku, and we're partnering with content owners, programmers and pay-TV providers such as Major League Baseball Advanced Media to offer innovative programming across all screens.  The integration of the creative and marketing workflow is a unique differentiator for Adobe Marketing Cloud. In Q2, we announced a common asset management foundation across Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud, which will make it easier and more efficient for creative and marketing teams to work together. In Q2, we acquired Tumri's advertising technology to add dynamic creative optimization to Adobe Media Optimizer, extending Adobe's lead in the programmatic advertising space. We continue to build a vibrant ecosystem of industry partners for Adobe Marketing Cloud. In Q2, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to integrate Adobe Marketing Cloud into Microsoft's Dynamics CRM to help enterprises better engage with customers. Our Digital Marketing events around the world provide inspiration, education and networking opportunities for leading brands and marketers around the world. In Q2, the Digital Marketing Summits in Salt Lake City, London, and New Delhi were all sold out, and this summer, we will host thousands more at our Digital Marketing Symposia in Sydney and Singapore.  Industry analysts continue to recognize our solutions as market-leading in their categories. In April, Gartner recognized Adobe's leadership in its 2015 Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management. In Digital Media, we launched the Document Cloud in March and early response has been positive. We saw strong Acrobat DC subscription uptake during the quarter. As the paper-to-digital transition continues, Adobe has a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on our leadership with the PDF and Acrobat franchise. Document Cloud features new mobile and touch capabilities and has built-in electronic signature tools for all users. We reported Document Cloud revenue of $197 million in Q2, and exited the quarter with $329 million of Document Cloud Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR. Creative Cloud continues to be the preeminent destination for creatives. We are migrating customers from our Creative Suite installed base as well as attracting new users. In Q2, Creative ARR surpassed the $2 billion mark, driven by strong adoption across our Individual, Team and Enterprise offerings. Net new Creative Cloud subscriptions grew by 639,000 in the quarter to over 4.6 million and represent 38% year-over-year growth.  Across our Creative and Document Cloud businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $2.35 billion as of the end of Q2. Today, we launched our 2015 release of Creative Cloud, featuring innovation in desktop and mobile apps, and Creative Sync technology to enable seamless integration between the two. We unveiled Adobe Stock, a new service that enables creatives to buy and sell stock content as part of the Creative Cloud experience. Now I would like to turn it over to David to provide an update on our Creative Cloud strategy and more details on today's announcements. David? David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu. Our Creative Cloud strategy focuses on three growth drivers : The continued migration of Creative Suite customers to Creative Cloud; the expansion of our market through tiered offerings that attract new customers; and the introduction of value-added services that increase ARPU. We are executing well in each of these areas.  Our strategy to migrate Creative Suite customers to Creative Cloud is working. We are delivering constant innovation in our Creative Cloud desktop apps, we are expanding our family of connected mobile apps, and we are delivering powerful, integrated asset management capabilities that connect our mobile and desktop app workflows. These cross device workflows are resonating with our customers and have been improving both trial conversion and customer retention.  In addition to migration, we are successfully attracting new customers to Creative Cloud through our family of mobile apps and the Creative Cloud Photography Plan. In Q2, we delivered a milestone release of CCP featuring a simplified user experience and new mobile features. CCP is ideal for all photographers and a large percentage of the subscribers are first time Adobe customers.  Finally, we remain focused on expanding the value of Creative Cloud through services that drive stickiness, conversion and increased ARPU. Today's introduction of Adobe Stock builds on our Creative Marketplace and represents an estimated $3 billion of incremental addressable market. Now, I'm happy to share a bit about today's 2015 release of Creative Cloud. The release includes major updates to all our flagship desktop apps including significant breakthroughs in productivity, performance and new features. We also updated our family of mobile apps across iPhone, iPad and now for the first time, Android. And we announced significant updates to CreativeSync, the technology that enables our mobile and desktop apps to work together seamlessly. The combination of these capabilities unlocks new creative workflows that will motivate CS customers to upgrade, and drive active use and retention of existing members.  Enterprise customers will benefit from all the new Creative Cloud features. In addition, they will get expanded security options and deeper connections between Creative Cloud and our Digital Publishing and Marketing Cloud offerings. Finally, we're introducing Adobe Stock, a brand new service based on our acquisition of Fotolia. We estimate that 85% of Creatives who buy stock content use Adobe tools, and more than 90% of stock content sellers use Adobe software in the preparation of their photos and images. Adobe Stock is the first stock marketplace embedded into the way creatives work. Deep integration with our Creative Cloud desktop apps including Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign makes buying and using stock photos, images and illustrations incredibly easy. The global launch of Adobe Stock shakes up the multi-billion dollar stock content market. Customers can buy images on demand or as part of a subscription plan. Most importantly, existing and new Creative Cloud members are also able to add Adobe Stock to their subscription plan at a special rate driving increased ARPU over time. Adobe Stock extends the value of Creative Cloud to subscribers who want to monetize their assets and participate in a large, global Creative Marketplace. In just a few short years, we have successfully re-imagined the entire creative process driving over $2 billion of ARR. Today's announcements significantly advance all three of our growth objectives. We're excited this innovation is now available to all our subscribers and we can't wait to see what they do with it. Mark? Mark Garrett : In the second quarter of FY15, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.162 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.29 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.48. Highlights in our second quarter include, growing Creative ARR to $2.02 billion exiting Q2. ARR has now grown to the point where it has exceeded the peak annual revenue achieved from our legacy Creative Suite perpetual offering. Achieving total Digital Media ARR of $2.35 billion which is the sum of Creative ARR plus another strong quarter of Document Cloud ARR growth; delivering Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $327 million; showing leverage in our model, with strong year-over-year growth in operating and net income; growing deferred revenue to a record $1.23 billion; achieving strong cash flow from operations of $471 million, and exiting Q2 with a record 72% recurring revenue.  In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $748 million. This segment has two major components of revenue, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. The best overall measure of the health of our creative business is Creative ARR, and we grew ARR by $230 million during Q2. Net new Creative Cloud subscriptions increased by 639,000 thousand, and we exited Q2 with 4,610,000 Creative Cloud subscriptions. Retention rates remain strong. With our Document Cloud products, we achieved revenue of $197 million. The benefits of subscription and Enterprise Term Licensing Agreements, or ETLAs, which is a core go-to-market focus with our new Document Cloud offering that shipped during the quarter, helped to grow Document Cloud ARR to a record $329 million exiting Q2.  In our Digital Marketing segment there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $327 million, up 15% year-over-year. Bookings accelerated in Q2, driven by strong pipeline creation at our Digital Marketing Summit user conferences across the world during the quarter. Multi-solution adoption is growing the size of customer engagements. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $40 million in Q2 revenue consistent with our expectations.  Print and Publishing segment revenue was $48 million in Q2. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $16 million. We had $22 million in hedge gains in Q2, FY15, versus $24 million in hedge gains in Q1, FY15, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $18 million.  From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $48 million. Considering the $22 million in hedge gains in Q2, FY15, versus roughly $2 million in hedge gains in Q2, FY14, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $28 million. In Q1, Adobe's effective tax rate was 18.5% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain tax examinations. Employees at the end of Q2, including summer interns, totaled 13,266 versus 12,698 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 39 days which compares to 45 days in the year-ago quarter and 44 days last quarter.  Cash flow from operations was $471 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.23 billion, up 32% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.41 billion compared to $3.18 billion at the end of Q1. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $200 million, of which $133 million was done under the new $2 billion authorization approved by our Board of Directors in January, 2015.  Now, I would like to provide our financial outlook, covering both Q3 as well as the rest of FY15.  We have executed well in the first half of FY15 meeting or exceeding key targets that we set at the outset of the year and we expect our momentum to continue in the second half of this year and into FY16. Adobe has a global business, where currently more than 40% of our revenue comes from outside the U.S. As we've explained, our hedging efforts focus on three quarters out and that strategy has served us well over time. Based on the rolling approach of our hedging program, our hedges maturing in the second half of FY15 and early FY16 were struck at current rates. Therefore moving forward our hedges will not mitigate the FX impact against our FY15 and FY16 revenue targets provided in December 2014. With the strengthening US dollar on a revenue weighted average basis, FX rates have moved approximately 9% from December of 2014 until today. We expect approximately $900 million of foreign currency denominated revenue in the second half of FY15. Applying the 9% rate change to the expected $900 million of revenue yields an estimated $80 million of impact due to FX that we expect will not be offset by hedging. We estimate $30 million of this impact will occur in our third quarter. Our FY15 annual revenue target was $4.925 billion. This revenue target was the sum of our original guidance of $4.85 billion in December plus the additional $75 million of expected FY15 revenue from our acquisition of Fotolia in January. We are now targeting FY15 annual revenue of $4.845 billion, solely due to the estimated $80 million impact of FX in the second half of FY15. We also expect second half year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud reported revenue growth of approximately 24%. Given our business momentum, we are increasing our Digital Media ARR target to approximately $2.925 billion exiting FY15, which as a reminder is measured on a constant currency basis. This updated ARR target does not include any benefit from our newly launched Adobe Stock service.  Despite the impact of currency, we continue to expect Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings growth of approximately 30% for the year and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.05.Taking into account the negative impact of $30 million from FX, in Q3 of FY15 we are targeting a revenue range of $1.175 billion to $1.225 billion. In Q3, we expect the sequential increase in Digital Media ARR to be similar to what we achieved in Q2; we expect Digital Media segment revenue to grow sequentially and we expect approximately 21% year-over-year reported revenue growth for Adobe Marketing Cloud. We are targeting our Q3 share count to be 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 tax rate of approximately 25% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.23 to $0.29 per share, and Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.45 to $0.51. In summary, our strong execution continued in Q2 and Adobe's P&L now reflects the positive impact from the growth of our Cloud-enabled solutions.  Mike? Mike Saviage : Thanks Mark.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Walter Pritchard at Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. We might prefer David talked about the Fotolia opportunity for ARPU and that makes lot of sense. I am wondering if you could just talk a bit about ARPU trends during the quarter and we noticed from a promotional perspective you've added some stuff at the end of the quarter which we've seen and haven't resumed that, could you put that in the context of how should we think about ARPU here as we move through the second half of the year? Mark Garrett : Hey, Walter. It's Mark. Sure, so as it relates to promotions, I think we told you on the last quarter call in Q1 we did not have a lot of promotions in the quarter, very, very little. This also was a quarter where we had very little promotional activities. So we are really pleased with the amount of net new subscribers we are driving without a lot of promotional activity. That doesn't suggest that we won't do them in the future but the fact that we are driving a lot of net new subscribers without it right now is a very good sign. As it relates to ARPU, we had the smallest sequential decline we had in quite a long time. So we are very happy with ARPU as we've continued to say ARPU by offering continues to remain stable or increase and the average of all of the ARPUs this quarter dropped very, very slightly and again it was the smallest decline we had in several quarters. Shantanu Narayen : Also, Walter, with respect to Adobe Stock just to clarify, as David said in his prepared remarks, you can if you are a Creative Cloud subscriber add a subscription for Adobe Stock and you can also as a new subscriber subscribe to both Creative Cloud applications as well as Adobe Stock. Both of those will be reflected in the ARR numbers that we report on a going quarterly basis. I wanted to clarify for everybody listening on the call that the standalone subscription for just Adobe Stock is not reported at this point in the Creative Cloud numbers. Mark Garrett : And we would likely not add that until 2016, FY16. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks, Shantanu, C6 just past, it is three year birthday and I am curious that basis is fairly large and what you've seen so far in the CS6 base now converting over to Creative Cloud and I had a quick follow up with Mark just it relates to Japan. What you saw in the quarter? And any trends there would be helpful. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. So, Brent, as you point out CS6 is definitely long in the -- with today's CC2015 release, the innovation that we are providing as well as the integration with the services makes it even older. We still have a fairly large CS6 base which clearly represents upside opportunity for us to convert to the Creative Cloud. As you are aware in Japan that was the market where we were selling CS6 till even late last year. And so we continue to target CS5 and CS6 as the most likely installed base to convert to CC. They are converting; the innovation is definitely resonating with them. And that continues to be the focus for David and his group. Mark Garrett : I think Shantanu touched upon Japan so I don't have anything to add. Brent Thill : And Mark just a quick follow up maybe on the DSO, it was 39 days, we had to go back six years in the model, was that just a subscription model kind or was there -- is there something about lean area in the quarter that surprised you. Mark Garrett : There is nothing that really surprises us. It is definitely related to the subscription model. Team does a great job on a collection front as well. It is going to move around as you go through quarters and you have various linearity and deal sizes but we've always been, as you know historically very good at driving a low DSO. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Thanks for taking my question. On Creative Cloud, can you give us an update on the mix of point products versus full suite subscription and particularly with the strength in the home products the past several quarters which seemed to be accretive to the model? Can you update us with even a directional sense of how many users you are attracting that are net new and where are they coming from? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. So, Brad, I'll go ahead and take that. I think the mix in the second quarter of 2015 was 56% was complete as well as 44% was single app. We are certainly -- we saw strength across the board. The momentum of subscriptions if you look at 630,000 plus subscriptions that we had, 38% growth we are seeing, good momentum across each one of them as we've mentioned in the past the Creative Cloud photography is certainly attracting a significant number of new customers and the overall new customer adds continues to be greater than 20%. So we are continued to be pleased with what we are seeing on Creative Cloud adoption. Brad Zelnick : Thanks. If I could just sneak in a quick one for Mark, OpEx looks like it is guided up 5% sequentially in Q3. Other than the seasonal hires of the summer interns which look like headcount is also up similar percentage sequentially. Is there anything else that we should be thinking about seasonally and where do you expect headcount for the full year? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Yes. I mean the bulk of the increase in OpEx as you look out from here is really going to be driven by sales and marketing. Interns don't drive it that much. The regular hires in the quarter were about 350 and there were couple hundred interns in this quarter. But the OpEx moving forward is really going to be driven continued investment in sales and marketing to drive that 30% bookings growth that we need to do in digital marketing and obviously the ETLAs in digital media as well. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merril Lynch. Your line is now open. Kash Rangan : Hi, guys. Thank you. You made an observation that the creative business is finally at the point where it was roughly comparable to the size of the creative business the licensed model, yet you have only 4.6 million subscribers in your base. It feels like the overall opportunity is at least only one third penetrated, maybe -- and maybe even less so. So what are the opportunities to be able to triple the size of your creative business given that you got about one third penetration off your old base, opportunities and challenges consequentially as well as you try to triple the size of the business, is that to say a possibility, and also wanted to ascertain from you what realistic attach rate should we expect for the stock business given your base of creative pros is about 6 million - 6.7 million, I think that's the data that I have from your analyst day a couple of years back. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. So, Kash, I think you are alluding to the numbers that we've given in terms of the Creative Suites installed base being over 12 million and clearly the innovation that David and his group are driving and I'll then ask him to add color on the specific features. We'll certainly continue to help drive new, migrate the existing CS customers into the Creative Cloud option. The addition of the new services are certainly continuing to attract a brand new set of customers that's expanding the overall installed base as we continue to target creatives both in the imaging space and with a number of the mobile applications, what we are doing to increase the size of the funnel which again is adding to the available opportunity that we have in that particular market. And I think Stock is a little bit early in terms of the rollout, but again I think David has talked about what percentage of people both buy and sell using Adobe tools and that represent an opportunity. David Wadhwani : Sure. Let me add a couple of things to that. First of all, the announcements that we had with the 2015 release were very broad based. We had major enhancements to our desktop applications and their mobile applications on IOS and we also for the first time introduced the mobile applications on Android. So we feel that that's going to have a broader play as well. Additionally, we made some significant updates to the Creative Sync Technology that moves assets across the desktop and mobile application to enable them to work as a single family. And of course we introduced the Adobe Stock in addition to some very visible changes that we made to the desktop applications around touch which is one of the big drivers that we believe in terms of CS4, CS5 and CS6 customers coming to the platform. A couple of things to call out in terms of what we are seeing in terms of the new capabilities and how that's driving existing customer behavior. A lot of the existing enhancements we've made to mobile applications are having significant driving on both the migration and also on new customers coming into the family. So as you noted and as we've talked about in the past, the mobile applications have been around for about a year and what we are seeing is that they are driving increased conversion of people filing the products. We see that they are increasing retention of paid numbers that are using -- that have been using the products. And we see that they are driving additional creation of Adobe ID, so we are seeing more Adobe IDs created as a result of mobile first interaction with Creative Cloud than ever before and I\u2019d characterize the conversion of those mobile IDs to paid customers as generally strong. So we are very happy with how all of that has been playing out in the ecosystem. Kash Rangan : So conceptually I want to make sure I am not making a mistake here. The ARPU is going to lift and the TAM is actually larger than the old base which means in the new world you only have to give revenue guidance but it feels like your creative business could be multiples of what it was in the prior to this model transition. But I just add up your comments. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Kash. I mean the whole strategy around the Creative Cloud was to reimagine the creative process, make it far more predictable and we definitely thought to increase significantly the size of the market opportunity. I think one measure that you can see even today of how successful we\u2019ve already been is the fact that we've talked about how we used to sell approximately 3 million units in the past and now if you look at what we are doing with this 4.6 million subscribers and in addition to that all of the enterprise deals that we have, we've already dramatically I think increased the size of the available opportunity. One last thing I might add in addition to what David and I said, the enterprise also represents an opportunity with this particular release. We've some very significant functionality that will enable enterprises to store all of their assets from behind the firewall and so continuing to focus on ETLAs and migrating enterprise customers with this new product I think represents an untapped opportunity. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Wondering in terms tell us around the Marketing Cloud in terms of the revenue growth in particular how much of the new target this year is impacted just by the FX versus anything else is going on. And just as a quick follow up, Mark, any sense of what's EPS on a third quarter for FX looks like? Mark Garrett : Sure, Sterling. So on the Marketing Cloud as we said booking remains very strong. In fact, I am sure you caught that we are not changing that 30% bookings outlook despite the impact to currency which obviously suggest that we would have done better than 30% without the change in FX rate. So FX is clearly impacting bookings, it is clearly impacting the marketing revenue growth. We've always felt that the marketing revenue growth would accelerate in the back half of the year. And that's why I mentioned that the second half would grow 24% year-over-year. So we are still seeing really strong growth in marketing despite currency, but there is no doubt that currency has an impact on that revenue growth rate just like the rest of the business. And then as it relates to EPS, Sterling, I mean it is pretty straight forward. We said that FX was impacting Q3 by about $30 million. So if you do the rough math, you are going to get to around $0.04 to $0.06 of earnings impact in the third quarter as a result of that $30 million but like we said we are still confident in the in the $2.05 again despite the impact of $80 million worth of currency in the back half of the year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Market. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Yes, thanks a lot. Hey, Mark, just wanted to ask you on the subs. I know you are focused on ARR but earlier in the year you talked about sequential and pieces in the sub add -- to this year, so just curious whether you still expect sequential increases in 3Q, 4Q and the $5.9 million target for the year and then just on -- I had one specific one for David on Fotolia regarding the contributor payout, it looks like you said 33% payout and I just want to get a sense of whether that was new-- whether that was an increase of the payout to the contributors still we have -- Thanks. Mark Garrett : Hey, Ross, Yes, so as you know we've always said for a four years now that ARR is really the best measure of the health of the business. And the sub number is an incomplete number because it doesn't include enterprise and as we add future offerings like Adobe Stock, looking at that sub number gets I think less and less meaningful over time. But everything is encompassed in that ARR number. That's obviously going very well, that's why we've raised our guidance on the ARR number and we had a great sub quarter. We are thrilled with the sub quarter and we continue to report sub actuals. But we are not going to guide on the sub number moving forward. That said our annual expectations really have not changed. We need that $5.9 million sub number to hit the increased ARR target, and clearly with the performance we've had today we are on the path to meet or exceed that $5.9 million target. But we really do want you guys as we do to focus more and more on ARR. David Wadhwani : Great. And on the question about the contributor payouts. The way we look at this opportunity is that, it is obviously a large growing opportunity where we have strong relationships with both the buying side and the selling side. And as we looked at the market make up, we saw the opportunity to grow this -- grow the TAM of this opportunity by doing two fundamental things. First was to move the friction in terms of how sellers and buyers come together. And that's what we've done to integrate both the selling and the buying directly within the tools. And we believe that's going to be a really big opportunity to increase the velocity of content flowing through the system. But the second thing we wanted to do is streamline the economics around these businesses. There we believe that the marketplace today is priced with too much complexity. So we wanted to streamline the opportunity for pricing for the buyers and we wanted to create a very simple price model for the contributors as well. So instead of doing a complex tiered approach Adobe Stock we are doing a simple 33% for sales that we have. Shantanu Narayen : In terms of thinking of Q3 and Q4, Ross, just too maybe add a little bit more color. I would look at ARR being slightly up in Q3 and then sequentially up in Q4. And that's reasonable proxy for sub, sub. David Wadhwani : Right, exactly. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Shantanu, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the digital marketing business just with two thirds of your customers now taking on more than one product. Could you just talk about some of the -- I guess the solution that are doing particularly well within sort of more of bundle framework and you start to sell more solution, I guess the competitive environment change at all or you just placing more point core products, is it so much mean the greenfield opportunity, I was wondering if you just provide a little bit more color on that front. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Kirk. With respect to where the bulk of the booking are right now and the revenue, I would say it is the combination of the Adobe experience manager which is helping people create the online web infrastructure for the future. It continues to be Adobe Analytics so people can get insight on what's exactly happening on their website. And Adobe Campaign continues to do very well which enables you to have multi-channel orchestration of communication with your customers. Having said that, the breadth of the offerings right now is starting to make all of the sticky and that's resulting in the increased booking and the most strategic relationships. And I can say that some of the smaller or newer solutions, when you look at what's happening with media optimizer as well as the other solutions like target. You are actually seeing that business double year-over-year. So we are seeing some really good traction in the new solutions as people look at the benefit of that. Primetime had a great quarter. Again, slightly smaller numbers in the scheme of things but the good news from our point of view is the new solutions like Audience Manager, Primetime, Target as well as media optimizer are doing really very well on a year-over-year basis. And makes the entire platform far more comprehensive and sticky. Kirk Materne : If I get just have really quick follow up, you guys had some nice partnership announcement added to summit this year with Accenture, IBM. Can you just talk a little bit -- just about how your broader chain on this digital marketing is going in terms of the kind of leverage, you are potentially getting at if this type of partnership, if you want to talk about any of them specifically. Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think the great news is every single analyst who covers the digital marketing space has clearly identified Adobe as the leader. That continues to be the case, and what that means is that the inbound request for systems integrators, for digital agencies to want to partner with Adobe is only increasing. The way we look at the revenue as we look at what are partner source, partner influence and partner driven. And that as a percentage of the booking is certainly going up. And without highlighting anyone partner on this call, the number of significant partnership is only increasing. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Mark Moerdler : Thank you, I appreciate. Two questions. First on the Digital Marketing side. Bookings were bit slowly this quarter. Was this timing of billing, FX, deal closure, what else was impacting that number? Then on the Adobe Stock. Should we think this has been purchased by Digital Marketing Cloud customers or will the sale be through the Creative Cloud, their additional market? Shantanu Narayen : So, Mark, I do want to clarify. We had a very strong bookings quarter in Q2. So as it related to bookings, our revenue Mark and maybe add more color on that but in terms of booking we had a very strong quarter with Digital Marketing. And as it relates to Adobe Stock very quickly, you can both as an individual get it through adobe.com as well as we have enterprise offering that we will sell. I think you are very perceptive in that the number of marketing professionals who will also use Stock and the integration of Adobe Stock with our Marketing Cloud also definitely represents on tapped opportunity. And as David said, we are really increasing the total available market for this because making pictures more accessible to people and allowing more people to contribute, I think that's a unique advantage that Adobe has. Mark Garrett : Yes, and Shantanu said Mark on the Digital Marketing side bookings were very strong. We are reiterating the 30% growth for the year despite the impact of currency. Revenue grew 15%, so if you looking at revenue, revenue growth were maybe a little less you would have thought. But as I said we expected that to ramp over the course of the year and in the second half of the year again despite currency, we are anticipating 24% growth in the second half of the year. Second half over second half. So there is some currency impact in there without a doubt but still strong growth in the back half of the year. Mark Moerdler : Perfect. And one quick and the follow up I apologize. How should we think about the impact of Document Cloud or document services revenue? We see a dip as quite tradition or is it just going to be revenue growth? Shantanu Narayen : We talked about Document Cloud is that the revenue will continue to be relatively consistent or flat. But way we are seeing the adoption is in the annualized recurring revenue or ARR so we are seeing good growth in the ARR. I think we highlighted that in the prepared remarks as well. And we did see a good healthy subscription adoption of the new Acrobat DC product. Operator : And our next question comes from the line Phil Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Philip Winslow : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just have a question on the Marketing Cloud. Obviously a lot of companies have made acquisitions here in different categories so just the broad marketing space of that couple of years. Wondering if you could just comment on the competitive environment. What you are seeing out there? I just kind of look at your portfolio sort of versus the competition, what really sort of standout is why you continue to win business but also what areas do you think you could see yourself looking to fill in either organically or inorganically? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think to your point, everybody recognizes that addressing the chief revenue officer, the chief digital officer or chief marketing officer is the most explosive software category that exist. I think our sweet spot has always been how do we target this marketer publisher with the customer experience solutions that we have. In the offerings that we have I will continue to say, it is the combination of content plus data that represents the unique advantage that Adobe has. And that's the combination of the Adobe Experience Manager as well as Adobe Analytics. But the product that's doing really very well right now is Audience Manager. And what Audience Manager allows people to do is have absolutely the same segmentation across their marketing spend if they are trying to attract customers across any personalized offers that they want to make as well as conversion. And so I think it is the combination of all of our products. And honestly it is also the tieback with the creative products that content velocity in terms of people trying to run campaigns. The fact that Creative Cloud works with the Adobe Experience Manager asset management solution that enables us whether you are a retailer, whether you are a financial servicers, whether you are government, whether you are a publisher, that content velocity that we can provide is just so much faster than anybody else. And I think across the marketing platform, we don't really don't see one single competitor. We do have a number of point product competitors for each of the individual solutions but I think as the comprehensiveness of our offering that enables us to win those deals. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks, good afternoon. Now the question first on the components of growth in the doc services or Document Cloud. ARR then a cash flow question. So this was touched on couple of questions back but when we think about the components of doc services in terms of new business you must be shipping at least couple million new licenses a year of acrobat. And you made very clear that you are not going to pull the plug on perpetual at least not any time soon but how are you thinking about regarding those or having signed as subscription versus perpetual and then on the ETLA side of doc services, win an extends that ETLA there is a proportion of doc services, it should be substantially higher for historically based reasons than ETLA on the creative side. Another words looks like ETLA are about tenth of creative ARR. But given the old volume license in part of Acrobat shouldn't ETLA be much, much higher percentage of doc services. Shantanu Narayen : So, Jay, with respect to the Document Cloud you are right that the ETLA portion of document services is higher than the ETLA portion of the Creative Cloud due to the historical adoption of Acrobat within the enterprise. And then moving to three year ETLAs. With respect to individual, Acrobat shrink used to continue to be a part of the offering and now on adobe.com the main offering that we provide is the subscription offering and the subscription offering uptake within individuals and teams is actually very healthy. I think what's happen honestly in the marketplace is that when you look at after Creative Cloud even Office 365 has now been offered through subscription is just become the most standardized way of happening. And so you are right that the perpetual mix of Acrobat is higher than other products in our category. But what we continue to be pleased with is that when people come to adobe.com, the individual adoption which is important to create that viral impact within enterprises, the subscription offering uptake is very healthy. Jay Vleeschhouwer : All right, thanks. On cash flow for Mark, through the first half your GAAP operating cash flow is about 650, you gave your guidance for the second half of the year, into taking into account currency plus the stocking effect to the model doesn't extend to reason that your second half cash flow should be at least much and probably substantially higher than the first half, so that total fiscal 2015 cash flow should be at least couple hundred million higher than the amount of fiscal 2014. Mark Garrett : Yes, Jay, so we don't guide obviously on cash flow. I can't tell you there is quarterly seasonality to cash flow. If you look at Q4 to Q1 it is typically down coming off of Q4 due to all the yearend payments that you make and debt interest and then you get to Q2 and there is none of those payments so it goes back up which is what you saw this quarter. In Q3, you typically see a dip relative to last quarter again because of tax payments and ESPP and debt interest and then you got a spike back up in Q4. So there is seasonality quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, the net income and the business starts to get better and better as we start to drive more and more earnings, cash flow is going to follow that. So without a doubt cash flow is going to get better and better. Operator : And our next question comes from the line Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys for taking the question and good quarter. You talked about earlier on there is quite much decline in ARPU dollar was small you have seen in quite some time. And it seems like we have a couple of financial -- and several potential ARPU sort of benefit on the horizon. I was wondering if you could talk just little bit about what our expectations should be with the timing of that particularly on when we think that the Adobe Stock is fair than getting ARPU and when this sort of the renewal of commercial pricing or the expiration promotional pricing could start to get benefit ARPUs so just we get better understanding to following that ARPU. Mark Garrett : Keith, I'll start and then Shantanu or David can add on. I have to sound like a broken record but focus on ARR right I mean that's really the metric that's going to incorporate everything. Subs, ARR, any kind of churn so that is where we are focused and we obviously feel good about that because just we just raised the number on the year for ARR. Shantanu Narayen : And I think in terms of the mix when you think about what's happening with the mix just continue to recognize as we've said that within each band ARPU has been very stable and as the mix continues to drive new offerings what the ARPU will reflect is the blended mix and so I'll also end with what Mark said. I think continuing to focus on ARR and if you look at the second half of the year it shows that ARR will continue to increase over Q1 and Q2 which I think shows the momentum in the business. Keith Weiss : Got it, and I take rather different type of question then, I think you mentioned earlier about that the conversion of trial customers to the end users are improving. Wondering if you could just give little bit color in terms of -- is that an inflection going on or is just an improvement, is there anything that this kind of cap rising that a transition from residue. David Wadhwani : Yes. I can take that. From a perspective of the improvements we've been seeing to conversion and retention associated with mobile application I believe is what you are referring to the statement you made. This is really just an ongoing evolution that we started a year and half ago. As we started to move more and more of our business online, we have the added advantage of having access to the world's best Marketing Cloud. So in the context of using all of the technology from that side of the business, it has been an ongoing set of activities to improve conversion that we see as traffic comes to adobe.com. More recently we've had an increase in terms of traffic and utilization of our mobile applications. So we understand what's driving that, what are the predictive indicators of use in those applications that are driving conversion to paid customers. And we are increasingly seeing the use of data and content flows with creative sync as another material driver of conversions and retention. So what we are doing is that we are building the products and updating the products with new capabilities and features, but we are also making sure that as we do that the user experience, the on boarding workflows and the communication that we have with them through email and other forms through training are all driving people to use these features that drive higher conversion and retention. So it is not one magic bullet but it has been a series of actions that we've taken. And we see a lot more we can do in the years to come. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Steve Ashley : Thanks. A couple of questions. I think on the last call you said that Japan had been really lagging in terms of just where it was in Creative Cloud adoption but we had started to see some improvement there. Is that improvement or ramping of Creative Cloud adoption in Japan continuing? Then my second question is just on the Marketing Cloud business and partner or channel leverage. Are you seeing improved partner contribution in that business? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. So, Steve, Japan continues to as the distance from CS6 gets longer and longer improve, we have a special event also that we are doing in Japan to ensure that the awareness of the CC2015 as well as all of the other additional services and mobile apps is strong right now. And so we continue to expect that would lead to increased adoption of Creative Cloud in Japan. And the second question was with respect to Marketing Cloud and partner leverage. I mentioned earlier that the amount of partner influence across sourced as well as influenced, revenue and the Marketing Cloud is fairly high and that's happening across both digital agencies as well as system integrators. And all of the large deals that we are doing because consulting is something that we would like partners to provide, there is a partner involved in most of the larger deals. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Stephens. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about what you are seeing with respect to overall users that are realizing some of the synergies throughout content creation and distribution and maybe which combination are currently the most popular? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. I think we've talked in the past about how the publishing segment for sure as publishers are trying to provide the content creation once and then delivery across multiple forms of devices. That's clearly the vertical that has led the integration of Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud. Retail tends to be another large vertical where we are seeing a lot of adoption of the Creative Cloud and the Marketing Cloud because the velocity of the products that they are offering tends to be fairly high. And everything to do with consumers, whether it is travel or entertainment is an area where I think we've talked about companies like Under Armour and others who are certainly using that particular technology as well. So we are seeing it across all industries, financial services, honestly we are getting better at also painting the entire Adobe story with the CC Enterprise release that's coming out now. And the fact that it synchronizes with the Adobe Marketing Cloud, that's going to make it even more natural. So while I would say the publishing and retail led the charge in terms of seeing the benefits of the creative cloud and marketing cloud integration, now that's spreading to honestly every single vertical in every geography. Alex Zukin : Got it. In fact if I could just squeeze in one more about the recent partnership announcement with Microsoft and what that could means strategically for Marketing Cloud? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think with Marketing Cloud, our vision really is that as every single enterprise moves to become more of a real time enterprise where the need to in the last millisecond deliver the right piece of content based on the consumer profile or the consumer demographic, it becomes even more apparent to us that enabling us integration with people who have CRM solution is something that will add value of our Marketing Cloud. So Microsoft with dynamic CRM has a great offering in that and that was the reason for the integration. The other reason for our partnership with Microsoft continues to be how we can leverage Azure in terms of having technology that enables us to create all of these compelling offerings in real time. So that's the benefit on the digital marketing side. On the Creative Cloud side I think we've shown that as touch becomes more natural way for people to do content creation with what we've done on the Surface Pro and in products like Illustrator and Photoshop, I think we've demonstrated significant value associated with touch which both Microsoft and Adobe are excited about. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Samad Samana : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about the profitability side, margin expanded, nice swing continue to say year-over-year, operating expenses were actually down year-over-year, I was curious how you think about the ramp in expenses, whether there is some cash that will happen in the back, how we should expect expenses to ramp going forward? Mark Garrett : Hi, it is Mark. Yes, we've obviously been very focused on driving earnings back into the model as revenue comes back into the model. And as we get back to where we before we started this transition which is going to happen relatively soon. Moving forward from here you will see OpEx increase and I touched on this earlier, we are driving 30% bookings growth in digital marketing that requires a lot of sales and marketing capacity. And obviously we are driving ETLAs in the enterprise for the document services business the Document Cloud business as well as the creative business. So you will see more OpEx investment but with that we are going to continue to drive more and more margin moving forward. Operator : And finally our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Shateel Alam : Hi, this is Shateel Alam filling in for Heather. I just want to ask a quick one on seasonality of single app subs. in the past you said that mix was about 50 :50; little lower this quarter at 44%. Should we expect that to swing around a lot from quarter-to-quarter and what do you expect that to fall out at for the year? Shantanu Narayen : I think what we've said in the past is if you look steady state or what's happen in the Creatives suite, the mix was approximately 50 :50, I think as we continue to attract new customers to the platform through the Creative Cloud photography offering, we are certainly seeing the single app adoption increase. We've also said in the past that when we first offered team, team was only offered in the complete option and the single app is definitely an on ramp to the Creative Cloud. And so I think as it relates to the creative segment part of Creative Cloud, steady state on the Creatives suite is probably a good metric. Certainly as we are expanding the entire available market through the introduction of these new single app offerings that was skew it a little bit more towards the single app as well.  Given that was the last question, sort of in summary what I would like to say is it is clear that all around the world companies are focusing on how they use technology as an enablers to accomplish this customer centric transformation. And I think delivering these great online experiences across mobile devices which is key to the transformation is driving Adobe's business because we have this unique set of technology assets to help customers solve this across various industries. And the business momentum we are experiencing, we believe is a result of both having a great strategy as well as excellent execution. We are pleased with Creative Cloud momentum. This week was a really important milestone as we release CC2015 and introduced Adobe Stock which is both an ARPU as well as TAM enhancing service. And it is really more proof of how we are making Creative Cloud a one stop destination for creators. Document Cloud continues to go after the large paper to digital opportunity and Marketing Cloud continues to be the leader and delivering great value in an explosive software category. I think in this quarter you also saw the earnings upside which is the leverage of our financial model. And in summary we think Adobe is in great shape and we remain focused on driving both product innovation as well as strong financial results for the rest of 2015 and beyond. Thank you for joining us today. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call.",

Shantanu Narayen : Adobe delivered strong results in Q3 with revenue of $1.218 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54. Strong Creative Cloud Adoption and record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue drove these results. In digital media, Creative Cloud has become the de facto platform for all creatives, providing the tools and services to fulfill every creative need. We are migrating customers from our Creative suite installed base as well as attracting new users with strong adoption across our individual team and enterprise offerings. Net new Creative Cloud subscriptions grew by 684,000 during Q3 and we exited the quarter with over 5.3 million subscriptions. Combining this adoption with the annual value of enterprise agreements in success with Adobe Stock, Creative Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR achieved sequential growth of $262 million. We exited the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of Creative ARR. Continuous innovation is the hallmark of Creative Cloud and the catalyst for our retention and growth. In the video space Adobe continues to trail blaze. Last week at IBC 2015, Europe\u2019s largest professional broadcast conference, we announced the next wave of Creative Cloud innovation coming soon to Adobe Premier Pro. Featuring groundbreaking support for Ultra HD, brilliant color technology improvements, a new touch work flows, Premier Pro is the leader in professional video. We see a large growth opportunity in enabling film and broadcast customers to transition to an entirely Adobe based workflow. Marquee customers continue to make the switch to Premier Pro. 20th Century Fox is using Adobe\u2019s Video Solution for its upcoming movie Deadpool which opens in February. Creative Cloud innovation is forging ahead in the mobile space where our mission is to help Creatives bridge their desktop and mobile design processes into a seamless Creative workflow. One of our most anticipated mobile apps Photoshop Fix debuted last week on stage at Apple\u2019s launch event. Photoshop Fix will deliver incredible retouching capabilities to a mainstream mobile first audience while providing pros with a handy tool for quick edits. Our plan to deliver new values with services such as Adobe Stock to augment our desktop and mobile applications is off to a strong start. Customers appreciate the deep integration of Adobe Stock in our Creative applications and are adopting Creative Cloud subscription offerings that include Adobe Stock. We will continue to deliver new services and partner with a broader ecosystem to make Creative Cloud the one stop shop for Creative inspiration. In July we announced our next generation digital publishing solution. Already the leader in the publishing segment, our new DPS offering will enable brands to easily repurpose their existing marketing content into immersive mobile apps without writing code. Next month we will hold our Max Creativity Conference in Los Angeles. Max has become the annual meeting place for the Creative community and we expect this to be our biggest event ever. We are excited to showcase how customers are changing the world with their creativity and we will unveil our newest Creative Cloud technology. In our documents business, reception to our new Adobe Document Cloud and Acrobat DC has been positive. Success with the new launch helps to drive Document Cloud revenue of $194 million in Q3. We grew Document Cloud ARR to $357 million exiting the quarter. Document Cloud ARR is increasing based on Enterprise Adoption as well as the growth of individual subscriptions with new users. We continue to expand our offering in e-signatures through integrations with a vibrant and growing enterprise partner ecosystem including Ariba, Salesforce and Workday. Across our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses, total digital media ARR grew to $2.65 billion as of the end of Q3. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the leader in the exploding digital marketing category offering the most complete set of solutions and a robust partner network with strong bookings in Q3 and record marketing cloud revenue of $368 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. In July, we held sold out Digital Marketing events in Sydney and Singapore where we hosted thousands of marketers for a day of inspiration, education, and networking. Customers on stage included Starwood Hotels and Resorts Unilever, Nestl\u00e9, Rakuten, and Tourism Australia. Next week we will host nearly 2,000 customers at our symposia in Tokyo and San Francisco. Partners continue to be a critical part of our digital marketing strategy. Last week we announced the WPP Adobe Alliance and expanded partnership with WPP, one of the world\u2019s largest agency networks. WPP agencies will become certified Adobe Marketing Cloud experts with the skills required to design and develop, sell, deploy and operate our solutions throughout their network. Adobe announced a major advancement in our programmatic ad platform for advertisers and media publishers leveraging fully integrated solutions in Adobe Marketing Cloud. Powered by Adobe media optimizer, the new self-service technology allows advertisers to take direct control of automated ad buying for search, display, and social media across ad exchanges and media networks like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo!. Tight integration with Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager, ensures that advertisers can tap into data to refine and target granular audience segments. Dynamic creative capabilities enable advertisers to use images, videos, and other assets from Creative Cloud to deliver the right content to the right user at the right time. In addition to making this programmatic platform available to advertisers, Adobe also announced its programmatic offering for media publishers. Adobe Primetime, Adobe's TV platform, now supports over the top and direct to consumer offerings with audience acquisition, engagement, monetization, and measurement capabilities. Recently launched services benefiting from Adobe Primetime include HBO Now, Showtime, MLB and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Industry analysts continue to recognize our solutions as market leading in their categories. Last month Gartner named Adobe as a leader in two Magic Quadrant reports. Web content management where we were ranked highest in completeness of vision and mobile application development. Earlier today we announced some changes to our executive team. David Wadhwani has decided to leave Adobe, to pursue a CEO opportunity and we\u2019ve named Brian Lampkin to head up the combined digital media business. Brian, who currently leads the Document Cloud business is no stranger to the Creative business having being one of the architects of both Photoshop and Creative Suite. Under Brian's leadership we have the opportunity to further align Creative Cloud and Document Cloud product development and go to market efforts. I want to thank David for his numerous contributions and wish him well. In July we announced Abhay Parasnis, as our new CTO. Abhay has 20 years of experience in enterprise software industry and his charter is to drive Adobe's overall technology strategy, architecture and innovation roadmap for cloud services. Human resources are our capital at Adobe. In Q3 we announced a new employee leave policy. Progressive benefits such as this help us be recognized as one of the best places to work and enable us to attract and retain incredible talent including a record number of new college hires. Great software comes from great people. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Financial Analyst meeting at MAX in October. Mark? Mark Garrett : In the third quarter of FY15, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.218 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.34 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.54. Highlights in our third quarter include, accelerating adoption of Creative Cloud which helps to grow Creative ARR to almost $2.03 billion exiting Q3. Building total Digital Media ARR to $2.65 billion which is the sum of Creative ARR plus another strong quarter of Document Cloud ARR growth. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $368 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth, delivering strong year-over-year growth in operating and net income; growing deferred revenue to a record $1.3 billion; achieving strong cash flow from operations of $360 million, and exiting Q3 with a record 73% recurring revenue. In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $770 million. This segment has two major components of revenue, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. As we have said, the best overall measure of the health of our creative business is Creative ARR, and in Q3 growth of Creative ARR was strong. We added $262 million of Creative ARR during the quarter, driven by strong net new Creative Cloud subscription ads of 684,000. Te exited the quarter with 5,334,000 Creative Cloud subscriptions. Our investor data sheet on adobe.com reflects a favorable adjustment of Creative Cloud subscriptions. We slightly underreported Creative Cloud subscriptions due to how retail point of sale or POSA units were reported. The adjustment added approximately 40,000 net new subscriptions over the prior three quarters. Across all routes to market, we continue to see strong demand for Creative Cloud. We are migrating existing customers to Creative Cloud and are attracting large numbers of first-time customers. In addition, we are now migrating significant numbers of hobbyist customers who previously used Photoshop Elements and Lightroom on a perpetual basis to the Creative Cloud photography subscription offering. Adobe Stock is contributing to both ARR and ARPU. Creative Cloud ARPU was consistent with Q2 and Creative Cloud Retention remains strong. With our Document Cloud products, we achieved Q3 revenue of $194 million. Adoption of our new Document Cloud offering that shipped during Q2 has been solid, helping to grow Document Cloud ARR to $357 million exiting Q3. Document Cloud reported revenue remains relatively flat as we continue to drive towards our goal of more acrobat subscriptions, which is reflected in the Document Cloud ARR growth. In our Digital Marketing segment there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $368 million, up 27% year-over-year. Despite currency impact, based on our strong Q3 bookings, we remain on track to achieve 30% or greater Marketing Cloud bookings growth for the year. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $34 million in Q3 revenue. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $46 million in Q3. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $6 million. We had $9 million in hedge gains in Q3, FY15, versus $22 million in hedge gains in Q2, FY15, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $19 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $58 million. Considering the $9 million in hedge gains in Q3, FY15, versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q3, FY14, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $50 million. In Q3, Adobe's effective tax rate was 25% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis, consistent with our targets for the quarter. Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 13,665 versus 13,266 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 44 days which compares to 48 days in the year-ago quarter and 39 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $360 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.31 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.67 billion compared to $3.41 billion at the end of Q2. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a cost of $132 million. Now, I\u2019d like to provide our financial outlook. Our overall business remains strong across our key product segments and geographies. We continue to drive large portions of our legacy perpetual businesses to a recurring model and this shift has improved the overall long-term health of our business. ARR deferred revenue and unbilled backlog have all grown faster than expected with some short-term impact to revenue. In Digital Media, we have discussed how the transition to subscriptions is happening faster in Creative. We're now seeing a similar trend with Acrobat Lightroom and Photoshop Elements. As a result, we\u2019ve consistently raised our Digital Media ARR targets and we\u2019re doing so again for Q4 FY15. Our new Digital Media ARR target existing this year is 2.95 billion with slightly lower revenue in Q4 than previously expected. In Digital Marketing, we are driving larger, multi-year and multi-solution customer contracts. As a result of larger engagements and longer implementation cycles, we are seeing strong growth in deferred revenue and unbilled backlog. We are targeting a Q4 revenue range for Adobe Marketing Cloud of $365 million to $400 million based on the potential variability of contracts that closes perpetual versus ratable licensing. We are therefore targeting an overall Adobe Q4 revenue range of $1,275,000,000 to $1,325,000,000. We expect our Q4 share account to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We're targeting net non-operating expense to be between $40 million and $60 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of approximately 25% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.32 to $0.38 per share and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.56 to $0.62. In summary, we delivered record results once again and are focused on a strong finish in Q4. We remain excited about our long-term growth prospects and look forward to sharing a financial roadmap with you at MAX in a few weeks. Mike? Mike Saviage : Thanks Mark.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Steven Ashley : Great. Thanks so much. Mark, I\u2019d just like to drill down, you talked about the fourth quarter, the revenue guidance being slightly lower than you had originally expected. You laid out the fact that there has been a conversion outside of Creative Cloud with some of the single products. Wonder if you could just talk about which of those products might be seeing the most aggressive transition, and maybe the magnitude of the impact of that dynamic? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Steve, let me again maybe just touch on what we're seeing happening across the industry and then I think we can have Mark answer that specific question, because the industry shift to the subscription business model which clearly is helping drive both customer intimacy as well as productivity in the -- predictability in the business we clearly see that accelerating. As you know we were the pioneer in moving desktop software to the cloud and now we see actually all major software vendors on the desktop adopt similar strategies. And from a color point of view while the Creative business has mostly transitioned, what we are seeing is the same trends and increased adoption of subscription in both our imaging hobbyists business where Photoshop Elements customers are now subscribing instead to the Creative Cloud photography program and Acrobat users especially on adobe.com are moving increasingly to the subscription offering much like what I think Microsoft is also seeing with Office 365. So that's just a big trend that we are seeing across. On the Enterprise side, Steve, it's slightly different because the trend has a little more variability based on industry verticals as to their preference of whether they want to go with the subscription or ratable versus perpetual. And so the overall mix may be a little harder to predict, but the strength of our overall business during the transition is not being impacted. So maybe with that as a big picture of what we are seeing Mark can address your question. Mark Garrett : Yes, so Steve on the Digital Media side, Shantanu just touched on and it\u2019s Hobbyist, it\u2019s Lightroom, and it\u2019s Acrobat. And if you look at ARR, because as you know for the past four years we\u2019ve been talking about this transition, if you look at ARR over the course of this year, we raised it twice. We started at 2.9 billion. In Q2 we raised it to 2.925, now in Q3 we are raising it another 25 million to 2.5 billion. That $50 million increase in ARR if you use that old rule of thumb that we used to have of each dollar of ARR is roughly $3 of revenue that\u2019s a lot of revenue. It\u2019s moved over during the course of this year. So from a Digital Media perspective you clearly see it in ARR. On the Digital Marketing side, it\u2019s a similar story, but slightly different metrics. So we had some perpetual in the fourth quarter that closed early in Q3, that\u2019s why you saw 27% year over growth instead of 21% year over growth. We are seeing larger multi-year deals and those deals are great to locking customers but they have as we said longer implementation cycles. What you\u2019re going to see though is on the Digital Marketing side reflected in deferred revenue and unbilled backlog, really nice increases. And so by the end of this year, I\u2019d anticipate that the two of those together deferred and unbilled backlog will be over $3.5 billion. That\u2019s $3.5 billion of closed business that will get recognized to revenue over time. So that\u2019s really healthy both in Digital Media on the ARR side and Digital Marketing on the deferred and unbilled backlog side. Steven Ashley : Perfect. Really helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Great. Thanks a lot and congrats on a great quarter. Just two questions from me. Just on the sub adds, Mark, you have the mix between full Creative Cloud and single app, do you have that? Mark Garrett : I do. Its 54% fall 46 -- and 46% point. Yes, 54%, 46%. Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s interesting. I guess, along those lines are you starting to see -- I know you will talk about this at MAX, but are you starting to see a better sort of shift, if you will, from that Creative Suite base excluding the CS6 base to the Creative Cloud now that we\u2019re three years after the launch of CS6. I\u2019m just curious to get a sense for what we\u2019re seeing there? Shantanu Narayen : Ross, I will take that. And yes we\u2019re definitely seeing a good mix. I think we\u2019ve characterized the CS6 base as a healthy base for us to migrate to the Creative Cloud. And to give you an example of that one of the things that we had been talking about is how international adoption in the past was lagging the adoption of Creative Cloud within the U.S. In the quarter that just finished, we saw some great progress with respect to migrating the CS6 base in Japan. So Japan had a good quarter and as you know the perpetual business was healthier there later in the cycle relative to the U.S. And so clearly the CS6 base continues to be a base that we think is ripe for migration to the Creative Cloud and we\u2019re clearly seeing signs of success in transitioning them from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud. Ross MacMillan : That's great. Maybe one if I could squeeze it. Just on Digital Marketing, Mark last year we\u2019ve the shift where I think you went to 75% term ratable. If we get to low end of the Q4 revenues, where we\u2019re going to stand in that sort of ratable mix within Digital Marketing Cloud? Thanks. Mark Garrett : If we were at the lower end that would mean most of the perpetual in Q4 would have moved over to subscription, because the pull in of that perpetual into Q3 was a piece of what we were anticipating in Q4 and then the range that you see is basically a mix of perpetual moving to subscription depending on whether you\u2019re at the high end or the low end. There would be very little left at the low end. Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s great. Congrats again. Thank you. Mark Garrett : Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Ross. Operator : And our next call comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. A question just on Digital Marketing. Mark, you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing larger deals, you\u2019re seeing longer deals, I\u2019m just curious if you can just give us a little more color around perhaps what you\u2019re seeing in the overall lift of ASPs and when you look at the contract duration, is there been a change in terms of what you\u2019re seeing, maybe you could comment on what the duration is and I had a quick follow-up just as it relates to Digital Marketing. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Brent, why don\u2019t I give you a little bit of color on what\u2019s happening with Digital Marketing. As you know when we first started the business and we had these different solutions, we would be selling primarily to practitioners who continue to be important buyer within the companies. And when we were selling into the practitioners, the practitioners would implement the product of virtually instantly and we recognize revenue and it\u2019s up and running. As more and more customers are adopting the entire Creative Cloud and multiple solutions, what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re standardizing on the Adobe Solution, but the sequence with which they implement each of the solutions is still they implement one then they may implement others. And so what Mark was alluding to was these deals if they are in the million dollar plus range, it has to do with more solutions being acquired and then them implementing it sequentially, which is why you see it in unbilled backlog and you see it in deferred revenue, but you don\u2019t see it translate to revenue as quickly. From our point of view that\u2019s all great, because they\u2019re standardizing on our platform, the value proposition of the entire marketing cloud is working with them Brent and we recognize that in the large -- in the bigger picture, it\u2019s actually a more predictable and healthy business for us. The other thing that\u2019s also seeing good traction is the managed services, which again is in our best interest, because those deal sizes are larger and we\u2019ve tremendous visibility into how they\u2019re using our solutions. Brent Thill : Okay. And just -- so I\u2019m clear, you\u2019ve been talking about 30% backlog growth for quite sometime yet. The revenue has been understated and it feels like that the milestone to hit that keeps getting pushed out, is there anything else that we should consider or is this just naturally because of the issues that you just brought up I think there is a lot of questions around that that\u2019s been off for quite sometime? Mark Garrett : Yes, I understand Brent. It\u2019s Mark. I think you meant 30% bookings growth, you said backlog \u2026 Brent Thill : That\u2019s right. Mark Garrett : \u2026but yes 30% bookings growth, no there nothing else going on. I mean, that\u2019s really what it is. A lot of it is just moment of perpetual; a lot of it is as Shantanu just said this larger multiyear transactions as well. And like I said, you do see it in unbilled and deferred. Brent Thill : Great. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much. And I will also echo my congratulations on a nice Q3. I want to revisit the first question that was asked, maybe to ask a little bit differently. Trying to resolve the Digital Media ARR outlook for next quarter going up with revenue coming down and logically there is only two ways that make sense to me to get there either your linearity assumptions changed and you thought you could achieve greater ARR in Q3 or at more earlier within Q4 or the mix of subscription versus product change which you already spoke to. And if that\u2019s the case, how can you forecast that or maybe ask differently what\u2019s changed in a way that you\u2019re offering those three products in Q4 that gives you the visibility to know that the take rate will be more subscription versus product? Shantanu Narayen : That\u2019s a good question Brad and what is really happening in the imaging business in particular is as you know that traditional Q4 cycle when we had predicted what the revenue would be viewed have a version of Photoshop Elements that was released in every Q4, which was always perpetual revenue. We have also had Lightroom that is offered in both perpetual and now as part of the Creative Cloud photography offer, a subscription offering. And as we see both of those migrate through the Creative Cloud photography offer that is giving us visibility into the fact that our customers are increasingly choosing the subscription offering rather than the perpetual offering. So think of it as Photoshop Elements not having the normal change or increment that we normally see in Q4 and continue to see Lightroom move towards the subscription rather than the perpetual is resulting in that revenue. And again as Mark said, if you think about it as every $10 million is leading to -- in ARR is leading to $30 million or so in revenue. And if you look at what we had given as our Q4 targets, at the high end of the range approximately half of that is probably in Digital Media and it's clearly shown as a greater portion of that going through ARR. So hopefully that helps. Brad Zelnick : Thanks for taking my question Shantanu. It\u2019s helpful. And I will save my others for a couple of weeks when I see you all at MAX. Mark Garrett : Okay. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks guys. I apologize I got kicked off the call, so it may have been asked, but what\u2019s causing the longer implementation time that you mentioned in your prepared remarks and also geographically where are you seeing the best strength in terms of the Creative Cloud net adds? Shantanu Narayen : The Creative Cloud Net adds, Sterling continue to be strong everywhere. One of the things I talked about earlier was that Japan which we\u2019ve had a lag relative to the adoption of Creative Cloud in the U.S is now showing good strength. We had the CS6 sold in Japan later than we had in any another country and now that\u2019s CS6 base, whether it's in Japan or Germany, other countries, we\u2019re certainly seeing migration of that into the Creative Cloud, which all goes well for continued strength of Creative Cloud across the globe. And with respect to the implementation cycles, what I had mentioned was that as we move from selling to practitioners single solutions to selling entire Marketing Cloud and multiple solutions higher up in the chain, what\u2019s still happening is the implementation of the solutions happen sequentially and therefore as soon as the solution goes live we start to recognize it. So they standardize on the Adobe product which results in the bookings and the unbilled backlog, but the implementation because it is multiple solutions takes a little longer than single solution. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. Shantanu, I look at the full suite adds and its coming a little to your growth is continuing to slowdown there a bit. And we also noticed that you\u2019re being a lot less aggressive with promotion in -- especially this year overall, but even into the August quarter where we\u2019re tracking it. And I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the mechanisms to continue to convert full suite customers over. I mean it would feel like you\u2019re feeling pretty good about it, because you\u2019re not being as promotional, but we\u2019re seeing the gross add as we calculate it on the full suite adds decelerating a bit more from where they were in the first half of your fiscal year? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I think Walter we had a good Creative Cloud subs add across virtually every single offering that we had. Team had actually a very strong quarter and globally we continue to feel strong about the migration capabilities of moving Creative Cloud -- Creative Suite customers to Creative Cloud. You\u2019re also right in that, we had fewer promotions in the quarter which again I think reflects both the distinction now that we\u2019ve drawn between Creative Cloud and the old Creative Suite products, and the fact that in Q4 we continue to expect to see strength. And we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about this at MAX as well Walter relative to all of the new stuff that\u2019s coming and how we see the business unfold in 2016 and beyond. Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merril Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I apologize for the background noise here. Mark, if you could just parse for us the new guidance maybe take the mid-point of your revenue versus where Wall Street had been and break it down into how much of the delta is coming from the Digital Marketing business rev rec changes vis-\u00e0-vis the Digital Media that will be helpful. And also as it pertains to Digital Marketing are we completely done with this, because I remember you\u2019re saying that about 70% of the business was booked at subscription not too long ago, but basically you commented that you expect that number could be higher, and so effectively are you going to be completely done and devoid of surprises in the Digital Marketing subscriptions? Thank you. Mark Garrett : Hi, Kash, it\u2019s about half and half in terms of the new guidance to the old guidance from a revenue perspective. So about half of it is Digital Media driven which is now showing up in ARR and about half of it is Digital Marketing driven which is showing up in deferred and un-built backlog. So it\u2019s roughly half and half. On the mix, yes you\u2019re right, we said it was moving towards 70-30 or even 80-20 but if you do the math that\u2019s, its still a lot of dollars of perpetual revenue in any given quarter. And so, there is going to be some variability based on customer preference as we said and we closed some of it in Q3 instead of Q4 but there\u2019s still going to be some variability in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s why we gave you a range. At the high end of that range right at that $400 million which is the high end of the range, we would still hit the 24% year-over-year growth that we said we would go in Digital Marketing for the second half. Kash Rangan : Got it. I think its actually a good thing and I completely agree with you guys that you\u2019re designing the solutions such way to assume the [indiscernible] of revenue ratably, but as a quick [indiscernible] just so investments are offered that the data, is there a way which we can say that you expected your off balance sheet, on balance sheet backlog that for revenue to be X, but as a result of the shift you expect it to be Y at the end of this year so we can see that as supposed to the Digital Media business where you clearly pointed out that ARR increase can be match fit with a corresponding 150 million [ph] or whatever, is there something like that that we can offer to investors as to what to look for if you report the end year results as far as backlog for digital markets is concerned? Thank you. Mark Garrett : Yes. On the Digital Media side there is, because we originally guided to $2.9 billion and ARR is now going to be $2.95 billion. So there is a lot of increase to ARR in the Digital Media side, so you can clearly show that. On the Digital Marketing side granted it\u2019s a little bit harder. We don\u2019t guide on deferred revenue, we don\u2019t guide on build backlog. I will tell you though, its growing faster, both of those are growing faster than our own expectation, that\u2019s about all I could give you right now. Shantanu Narayen : And Kash, maybe I\u2019ll just repeat again what Mark said, which was in Q3 we definitely saw strength in the perpetual licensing which was reflected in the 21%. We had strong bookings in Q3, we continue to see the pipeline is really strong for Q4 and so we expect a strong finish. And for Q4 the high end of the range, it\u2019s really identical to, the targets that we provided at the end of the Q2 call with respect to what kind of revenue achievement we expect for the second half of fiscal \u201815. So I think the fact that we continue to reiterate 30% bookings and now this is in, even despite the change in currency. So I think those are some of the factors which give us continued confidence in the momentum of the Digital Marketing business. Kash Rangan : Nice work gentlemen. Thank you. Mark Garrett : Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much. So drilling a little more on the, Adobe has moved to the Cloud, what's driving that adoption now, is it pricing, is it functionality or how should we think about what the key drivers, and then I have a quick follow-up? Shantanu Narayen : Mark, I think in the highest sense it\u2019s the Photoshop brand and the Photoshop name and the fact that the Creative Cloud innovation pace is happening at a much faster pace than it is with traditional 12 month Photoshop element cycle, Photoshop elements cycles. The other thing that I think we are starting to see, maybe I can touch on this a little bit more, is that the mobile apps. What we\u2019re seeing with usage of mobile across imaging, this is light-room mobile as well as what you can do on smartphones. I mean we have 10s of millions of downloads of our mobile applications. And in the imaging when we look at usage data, the usage data and imaging across multiple devices which we would argue will lead to much higher retention is also fairly high. So I think the elements move is largely due to the attractiveness of the element -- the offer of both light-room and Photoshop as well as the fact that it\u2019s mobile enabled. Mark Moerdler : Okay. And a quick follow-up, how should we think about, I know you said that Adobe stock is strong in terms of adoption. Can you give us a little more color of how that is going? Were you expecting it to, how we should think about stock having an impact? Shantanu Narayen : Well it\u2019s early. I think you when Mark had given us targets for how much revenue we expect to see added when we had talked about the revenue addition for Fotolia versus the revenue reduction at that point for currency. I would say we\u2019re on track with that business, it\u2019s early. We\u2019re seeing people both add to and existing Creative Cloud subscription with stock and we are starting to see people adopt the new subscription offers that have the Creative Cloud complete plus stock. So I realize that\u2019s not quantifying it yet for you, but relative to any of the targets that we\u2019ve provided earlier we\u2019re on track. Mark Moerdler : Okay. One other quick question, what's the percentage of subs with annual contracts, do we know that? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, we do Mark. Its about 97% annual and 3% month-to-month. Mark Moerdler : Perfect. Thank you, and it was a nice quarter. Thank you very much. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much, and I\u2019ll eco my congrats on the quarter. One of the things that had been talked a whole lot since you guys have been switching over to some of the element of [indiscernible] some of the software that was perhaps not obtained legally historically, and I\u2019m kind of curios just that you, I see a little bit more traction especially in our sort of international markets with the suite. If you feel like you\u2019re recapturing maybe [indiscernible] casual pirating Cloud especially around that Hobbyist level. I was just kind of curious on your thoughts there. And then just a really quick one in certain, all that related on the marketing side, just the difference in competition as you get into these multi-year deals, multi-product multi-year deals? That\u2019s it. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, to answer both your questions, the first thing I would say is relative to the new seat adoption that we\u2019re seeing, the new seat adoption is definitely being driven both by creators who are entering the market as well as casual pirates who existed for whom the lower price of entry is far more attractive way to have legal software than not. There\u2019s no question about that, we hear that anecdotally all the time that people are pleased with the fact that they can have legitimate software. As we\u2019re delivering more Cloud based services, as you know the only way to use the mobile apps and share content between the mobile apps as well as our Creative Cloud, is by having a subscription. So I think that\u2019s also as we see more creative sync and creative profile being used, that\u2019s certainly, driving that. So I think we feel good about that. With respect to your second question on completion. I think our differentiator continues to be honestly the content and data part, and there\u2019s nobody that comes at it with respect to having the kind of content infrastructure that we have to enable them to re-platform their websites which is a massive trend as well as the fact that we have the analytics. We had this announcement recently also about what we\u2019re doing with respect to a programmatic advertising platform that also leverages the fact that we have analytics. So I think the unique differentiation was analytics in the past. It continues to be audience manager right now, because for the first time people can have the same audience, the same segment, the same campaign, the same content, the same assets used across all of our marketing solutions. With respect to external competition, I think we still see a number of point product vendors that are in that market place and I think you\u2019re seeing the larger ISVs as well start to identify marketing as one of the large growth opportunities for them and Oracle is the company that\u2019s probably done a lot of acquisitions in that space. But we like our differentiation and we continue to execute on it. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : I just want to thank you guys for taking the question and congrats on a very nice quarter. Maybe just to carry on the theme of the marketing environment, the competitive environment, one of the things a lot of us have been looking for in this space for quite sometime is that sort of consolidation of what has been a very fragmented market. Where do you think we are in that progress of the marketing cost ever being more willing to consolidate multiple solutions into one suite just from a prior market perspective? And then how do you sort of help to push that along? Shantanu Narayen : I think Keith, the thing that I hear a lot when I talk to customers and I spend a lot of time with customers is, this notion of digital transformation and digital disruption at the C-suite is front and center across every single industry. Without a doubt that is leading to people looking at larger systems and saying, how do we transform our business to drive more direct relationship with customers and build a customer centric company. So I think every C-suite that I\u2019m talking whether you\u2019re in retail, whether you\u2019re in financial services that\u2019s a thing that\u2019s leading to understanding which companies, which vendors have a larger offering in that particular space. I think as they think through that, they\u2019re also having to reorganize the marketing function, because search versus commerce, versus revenue has traditionally been in different places. So I think you\u2019re see that play out over the next year, couple of years, but I think you are seeing more of them recognize that having a unified platform is the way to go. So we still sell to practitioners and we still have to make sure we\u2019re best of breed in each of the individual solutions, but I would say increasingly our deals especially the new customer acquisition is a larger deal that\u2019s being sold higher in the chain. Keith Weiss : Okay. And can I just stick one last one, just on the broader environment there\u2019s been a lot of obviously market turmoil particularly around emerging markets. How have you seen overall demand trends particularly internationally sustain throughout the quarter? Shantanu Narayen : Well maybe this is one of the benefits of not having too much of emerging markets, business or presence in the creative space that it\u2019s not really impacting us. So we continue to see strength across most international markets. And as you know in Digital Marketing that\u2019s primarily the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia where we have significant presence and some presence in other places. But I think as we said on the prepared remarks, the interest in the solutions when we were in Singapore or when you\u2019re in Sydney or now in Tokyo, all of these symposia being held to sold out audiences. So the awareness and the understanding of this as one of those important technologies is only growing. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Thanks. Mark, given the accelerated mix shift and the model on the revenue side, does that impact the framework you\u2019ve given for 2016 expectations on revenue and EPS or maybe do we need to think about trends in gross margins in any different way? Mark Garrett : I don\u2019t know if they need to think about trends in gross margins in any different way. As it relates to \u201916, we don\u2019t typically comment on next year until we get to the Q4 call. So I can't really given you any insights into \u201916, but it shouldn\u2019t have any significant movement in gross margins. Because on the creative side, it\u2019s not a fully hosted offering, it\u2019s got Cloud componentry to it, but it\u2019s not a huge Cloud component. Derrick Wood : Okay. And then Shantanu, I\u2019d be curious to hear how you ranked the impact for some of your ARPU enhancing services on the creative platform. You\u2019ve got [indiscernible] with social, a talent search, you\u2019ve got Fotolio with stock content, you\u2019ve got things like video and mobile apps. Anyway you could just couch the relative impact on driving additional ARR and how you see that ramping in the upcoming quarters? Shantanu Narayen : I think with respect to new services that have the largest potential upside, we continue to think that Adobe stock is what drives upside in terms of ARR. Usage of Behance is driving higher retention. So the way we look at what's happening with Behance is being part of the community because, that\u2019s included for the most part. There are some value added services as you point out, but for the most part Behance is driving greater retention. And video is driving more usage from single app to the CC complete. So I think we look at each of the different ones as driving either an increase in ARPU as you pointed out or as driving greater retention both of which from our point of view are useful, because as you know as people move off of any promotional pricing retention is something that\u2019s key to us and adding increased value is important in that respect. Derrick Wood : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Brendan Barnicle : Thanks so much. Shantanu, I wanted to follow-up on Keith\u2019s question about the Marketing Cloud and you alluded to uncertainty that C-suite tab and they\u2019re figuring what to do with their marketing strategy. Is that the biggest obstacle that you run into in terms of closing Marketing Clouds, that folks are still trying to figure out what tools to work with or is this something else that\u2019s holding up deals? Shantanu Narayen : No, I actually continue to feel like the awareness and the importance of that deal is actually playing to our favor rather than the other way around and that\u2019s why we continue to see strong bookings and it\u2019s leading to larger deal sizes rather than then other way around. So from our point of view, we have the most comprehensive offering. We\u2019re the leader in that particular category and so those deals actually play to Adobe\u2019s favor. Brendan Barnicle : Great. And then, Mark do you have a percentage number for us in terms of total end customers to in subscription not net news but folks who are brand new to you. Do you have that kind of breakdown? Mark Garrett : We\u2019ve been consistently saying that it\u2019s over 20% and that\u2019s still holding true. Brendan Barnicle : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask first about the transition you\u2019re seeing now in Document Cloud and then just follow-up on adobe.com. So perhaps, Shantanu you could talk about the Document Cloud transition within volume terms. Two quarters ago, you updated us by noting that the active base, you calculated for Acrobat was something more than $30 million. We know historically that the average new unit volume for Acrobat were somewhere in that mid-single digit unit [indiscernible] when it was packaged software. So if we look out over the next number of years, how you\u2019re thinking about converting that large phase, most of which was done on the LA's over to subscription. And given what you\u2019re seeing now are anymore client [indiscernible] on perpetuals that you\u2019ve been doing or collecting to do for Acrobat? Shantanu Narayen : I think we\u2019ve always stated Jay that we think that the Document Cloud transition will be different from the Creative Cloud transition, in that it will be important for us to continue to offer the same perpetual version for a while. What we are seeing is on adobe.com the vast, vast majority of people who are buying Acrobat DC right now are buying the subscription option. And so I think as we have previously indicated, I think with respect to the Acrobat transition, we expect to continue to see revenue relatively stable but you will see an acceleration in the Document Cloud ARR that\u2019s reflected, that\u2019s showing how the transitioning is happening. And with respect to the $30 million number that you said, that was the number that we eluded to in terms of what number of Acrobat seats we have sold in the history of Acrobat. And so, again I think we\u2019re pleased with what we see on the Document Cloud but it has slightly different characteristics than what we\u2019re seeing with the Creative Cloud. Jay Vleeschhouwer : All right. As a follow-up on adobe.com, I would have to think that at this point the business flowing through adobe.com is larger that your revenues than was the case prior to the model change if you go back a number of years, adobe.com was probably doing roughly lets say about $0.5 billion give or take, it depends on the year of course, but now I would think given the scale of Creative Cloud and the other businesses that its substantially larger that it might have been historically; so the question is, could you relate Mark, do you presume scaling up significantly adobe.com for the profitability of the company, is there a substantial effect on your operating income by having so much more business going through adobe.com now than historically most case. Mark Garrett : Yes, without a doubt Jay, we\u2019re doing more and more business on adobe.com much, much more than we did before the transition by far more than we did before the transition and yes, it is going to be more profitable than going through even our own direct sales force or the channel. So to the extent that we can drive more and more business there, it does improve us from a profitability perspective. I can't give you a number, but it definitely is more profitable for us. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Mike Saviage : Operator, we\u2019re coming up in the top of the hour. Lets do two more questions, please. Operator : Thank you. Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open for questions. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on Adobe stop for a second. I was just wondering if you can share with us, where you seen the best opportunity for cross sell and also, if you have a sense of when you look out for the potential of the attachment here in install base, kind of how are you framing that opportunity? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Heather, I think what we\u2019ve said in the past is approximately 85% and greater of that is of the buyers as well as the sellers are using Adobe products. And when you think about the size of that market which is in the multiple billion that represents an opportunity for us to add value to the customers. In terms of what we\u2019ve done Heather for the integration, as you know within Photoshop and all of our products, you now have the ability to both put something up on the market place to sell as well as you have the ability to search for something when you\u2019re starting with a blank canvas and you want to get a creative idea or inspiration to get something going. So integrating it into the workflow makes a lot of sense. And what we\u2019re also offering right now is new subscriptions which say if you are getting a subscription where you know what kind of demand you have for stock, you can buy all of the complete applications in addition to the stock. So I think the value within the workflow is well understood, both the supply and demand participate with us. I think two things maybe underappreciated as we are building this business. The first is the number of people who are running campaigns and when you\u2019re running a campaign using our Marketing Cloud technology being able to use this stock to also stock your campaign progress and time that in we showed brief sneak of that. We think that, that\u2019s an opportunity for us to drive it and second is, within the enterprise. So as we\u2019re selling enterprise ETLAs, there isn\u2019t an enterprise in the world that doesn\u2019t have a marketing department that\u2019s procuring stock. And so if we can demonstrate the value of how an enterprise ETLA for the creative products can include stock as part of that, we think that has value as well. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Philip Winslow : Hi, guys. Thanks guys for taking my question. Most of my questions have been answered. But I wanted to actually double click on something you talked about earlier, the TAM expansion on the creative side. Obviously you had great user count growth in particular the past couple of quarters and you\u2019ve done a great job of framing the Cloud, the Creative Cloud transition looking to call it your core users, but if you think about net TAM expansion in incremental users, what if you could just help us kind of with the math about how you think about these new sort of lower price products expanding the TAM, just any sort of guide post there would be really helpful? Mark Garrett : Yes, Phil I think we\u2019ll definitely share more of that at MAX and so that\u2019s a good segue to match because sharing the numbers for example of how many people have bought our consumer photography offerings in the past that we did not include as part of the TAM or the market, that\u2019s certainly expansion capabilities that are now available for us. As we\u2019re getting more information on piracy and understanding what kind of activations we may have seen, giving you a little bit more color on that with respect to the TAM I think is another way for us to expand. So we\u2019re looking forward to MAX, we will share with you more information on TAMs at MAX and hopefully give you insight into in addition to the core migration of the Creative Suite customer to create a Cloud. How this market expansion with respect to targeting new users as well as users who traditionally may have used other products or value expansion which is how we can sell new services like talent or like Adobe stock into that existing base help us expand our TAM. So I think we\u2019ll be certainly sharing more information with you on that. MAX is coming up in a few weeks, so we look forward to seeing you as well as others at MAX. And let me just end by thanking you for joining us again on the call today. From my point of view, we had a strong quarter, the underlying trends in our business in both Digital Media and Digital Marketing continue to be strong. And I look at it and say, whether it\u2019s a student retouching a photo on their tablet, a director making a latest block buster film or what you see as consumer brand publishing their marketing content across the web and mobile. It\u2019s clear that Adobe technology is at the heart of the world\u2019s best experiences and we look forward to increasing that. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : And this concludes our call. Thank you.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. FY15 was a record year. Adobe is driving digital experiences that are fundamental to the transformation of every global brand, government and educational institution. We delivered strong performance across each of our three cloud businesses. We exceeded our targets in Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue and subscriptions, launched and ramped our Adobe Document Cloud business, and drove strong revenue and bookings growth for Adobe Marketing Cloud. In Q4, we delivered revenue of $1.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.62. For the year, we grew total revenue to $4.8 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $2.08. In Digital Media, Creative ARR grew to $2.6 billion exiting the year, an increase in Q4 of $310 million. This strong performance was driven by enterprise adoption and the addition of 833,000 net new individual and team Creative Cloud subscriptions. Ending Q4 Creative Cloud subscriptions were 6.17 million. Subscription growth was fueled by continued migration of the Creative Suite installed base, as well as the addition of customers that are new to Adobe\u2019s creative products. We achieved strength across our Complete and Single App offerings, including Creative Cloud for individuals, Creative Cloud for teams, Creative Cloud for education and the Creative Cloud Photography Plan. The value of the Creative Cloud service grew significantly in 2015, with innovation in many areas including, hundreds of new features across Creative Cloud desktop apps, with innovation across our imaging, illustration, web design and video tools. New Photoshop features like Dehaze, which eliminates fog and haze from photos and Illustrator\u2019s Shaper tool, which lets you draw with natural gestures that magically transform into perfect geometric shapes, drew rave reviews from our customers. Innovation in our Creative Cloud video apps continues to entice the Hollywood community to switch to Adobe Premiere Pro, which is now the leader in its category. The upcoming Coen Brothers movie, Hail Caesar and 20th Century Fox\u2019s much-anticipated Deadpool are the latest to be edited in Premiere Pro. New mobile apps like Photoshop Fix, which revolutionizes photo retouching, Premiere Clip, which lets users create and edit videos, Comp CC, which helps users lay out designs and Capture CC, which simplifies the capture of creative assets on the go, have all received high app store ratings from customers. These millions of downloads are bringing new customers into the Adobe franchise, almost half of new Adobe IDs are created in one of our mobile apps. Our goal is to make the mobile-to-desktop workflow for creatives as seamless as possible so that they can be creative and productive wherever they are. We\u2019re looking to expand further, with new mobile apps, like Adobe Voice and Slate, which bring Adobe technology to storytellers of every age and ability. The power of our mobile and desktop apps is significantly enhanced by the introduction of our CreativeSync technology, which enables Creatives the freedom to create and collaborate in an increasingly connected world. The Adobe Marketplace which includes Adobe Stock, is the industry\u2019s first stock content service to be integrated directly into the content creation process. Adobe Stock is a fast growing marketplace with over 1 million high-definition video files and 45 million photo and graphics assets integrated directly within CC desktop apps, and is driving attach to existing and new Creative Cloud subscriptions. Four years into our Creative Cloud journey, we have deeper insight into the needs of the Creative community, more satisfied customers and a significantly larger total addressable market. Growth will continue to be fueled by three initiatives, migrating the Creative Suite installed base, attracting new customers and driving higher ARPU through cloud services such as Adobe Stock. In March we introduced Adobe Document Cloud, an innovative solution to manage documents across devices. Building on our strong PDF and Acrobat franchise, Document Cloud is a complete portfolio of secure digital document solutions that streamline business processes. It includes Acrobat DC, Adobe eSign electronic signature services, plus web and mobile apps. In October, we launched our first file sync and share partnership with Dropbox, integrating Acrobat, Acrobat Reader and Dropbox across mobile, desktop and web. This quarter we delivered a milestone release of Adobe eSign services with innovative mobile app functionality and a focus on enterprise mobility and control. Adobe eSign services have attracted a strong stable of partners, including integrations with Workday, Ariba, Microsoft and Salesforce. Q4 Document Cloud revenue was $209 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $397 million exiting the year. In Digital Marketing, we achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings in Q4 and revenue of $352 million. We continue to drive large-scale engagements with Marketing Cloud customers. Significant transactions in Q4 included Home Depot, Etihad Airlines, McDonald\u2019s, Comcast Cable and Kaiser. Last month, we announced the availability of Audience Marketplace, a new data exchange in our Adobe Audience Manager platform that connects advertisers and content publishers. Through our integrations with leading data providers, Audience Marketplace can access large volumes of high-value audience data for more accurate and valuable insights. The platform also allows advertisers and content publishers to create more accurate audience segments and have greater insights into real-time performance. An ecosystem of global partners allows us to scale Adobe Marketing Cloud to better engage with customers at every touchpoint. Eight of the 10 largest agencies and eight of the 12 largest system integrators have built digital marketing practices around Adobe Marketing Cloud. Today, we announced the expansion of our global alliance relationship with Accenture to create and deliver digital marketing solutions utilizing Adobe Marketing Cloud for life science, healthcare, and financial services organizations in North America and Europe. Adobe manages over 40 trillion customer data transactions through Adobe Marketing Cloud every year. And we are viewed as the expert in reporting and predicting major retail and consumer trends. Adobe Marketing Cloud measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers, and over $7.50 out of every $10 spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers. Our widely covered Adobe Digital Index holiday shopping report measured $11 billion in sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday and revealed that a third of sales came from mobile devices. Adobe Marketing Cloud continued to be recognized as the leader in industry analyst reports. In Q4, Forrester Research recognized Adobe as the industry leader in two Wave reports : Data Management Platforms and Digital Experience Platforms.

Mark? Mark Garrett : Thanks, Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2015 results. In FY \u201815, Adobe achieved annual revenue of $4.796 billion dollars, which represents 16% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $1.24, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.08. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy, and from some noteworthy achievements during the year. Growing Digital Media ARR by approximately $1.1 billion during the year to exit fiscal 2015 with just under $3 billion, well ahead of our original and upwardly revised targets. Exiting the year with approximately $2.6 billion of Creative ARR, driven by strong adoption of Creative Cloud across individual, team and enterprise offerings. Total individual and team Creative Cloud subscriptions ending the year were 6.17 million, also well ahead of our projections. Delivering Document Cloud revenue of $796 million and growing Document Cloud ARR to $397 million. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.36 billion and our goal of approximately 30% annual bookings growth. Generating $1.47 billion in operating cash flow during the year. Growing deferred revenue to a record $1.49 billion, and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $2.9 billion exiting the year together, this represents nearly $4.4 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time. And returning nearly $627 million in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of FY \u201815, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.306 million, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.44 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.62. Highlights in our fourth quarter include driving Creative Cloud adoption that resulted in record sequential Creative Cloud ARR growth and record Creative product family quarterly revenue. Posting record net new Digital Media ARR of $350 million. Delivering Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $352 million. Reporting strong year-over-year growth in operating and net income. Achieving strong cash flow from operations of $455 million. And exiting Q4 with a record 74% recurring revenue. In Digital Media, we added $310 million of Creative ARR during Q4, which is the highest ever quarterly growth of Creative ARR. Contributing to this strong growth was record net new Creative Cloud subscriptions of 833,000. Across all routes to market, we are seeing strong demand for Creative Cloud. We continue to migrate existing customers to Creative Cloud, and are attracting large numbers of first-time customers. Overall, Creative Cloud retention remains strong. Commercial Creative Cloud ARPU, including individual and team subscriptions, grew in Q4, while Education and Photography Plan ARPU remained relatively consistent with prior quarters. Adoption of Adobe Stock continues to increase ARPU. Across all offerings, blended ARPU remains relatively consistent with last quarter. We are excited about the progress we\u2019ve made with Adobe Stock. We achieved our revenue target for the year and are focused on driving attachment of Stock subscriptions with existing and new Creative Cloud subscribers. With Document Cloud, we had a strong Q4 to finish a solid year. We\u2019ve delivered on our goal of maintaining consistent revenue while shifting more of the business to be recurring. In Q4, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $209 million, while growing Document Cloud ARR to $397 million exiting the year. To give some context, only 16% of this business was recurring revenue in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2015, 48% of the business was ratable-based revenue. We delivered Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $352 million, with record bookings in Q4 that contributed to achieving our annual bookings growth goal of approximately 30%. During Q4, we migrated even more Experience Manager and Campaign perpetual business to a ratable managed services offering than we had targeted. In fact, we achieved higher bookings for Experience Manager as a managed services offering in Q4 than we achieved in all of fiscal 2014. This performance is reflected in deferred revenue and unbilled backlog. Entering fiscal 2016, it is expected that there is no material perpetual revenue remaining. Other marketing Cloud highlights in Q4 include, continued growth in multi-solution adoption by our biggest customers, improved customer retention rates on a larger book of business, strong performance with our two newest solutions, Audience Manager and Primetime, and benefits to our business from mobile device use and the beginning of the online holiday shopping season, in Q4 mobile data transactions grew to 47% of total data transactions with products such as Adobe Analytics. Our Digital Marketing segment revenue also includes LiveCycle and Connect revenue, which continues to decline as expected. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $8.4 million. We had $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY15 versus $9.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY15, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $16.2 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $59.6 million. We had $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY15 versus $12.2 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY14, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $70.5 million. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 25% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis, consistent with our targets for the quarter. Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 13,893 versus 13,665 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 50 days in the year ago quarter and 44 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $455 million in the quarter. Unbilled backlog at the end of FY15 grew to a record $2.89 billion, which now includes the value of individual annual Creative Cloud subscriptions. This compares to unbilled backlog at the end of FY14 of $2.19 billion, which we have also updated to include the value of individual annual Creative Cloud subscriptions. Deferred revenue grew to a record $1.49 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.99 billion, compared to $3.67 billion at the end of Q3. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at a cost of $122 million. For the full fiscal year we repurchased 8.1 million shares at a total cost of $627 million. We currently have $1.6 billion remaining under our latest repurchase authority granted in January, 2015. Now I will provide our financial outlook. As a result of the continued momentum in our business, we are reaffirming all of the long-term financial targets that we provided at our Analyst Meeting in October, highlighted by a 20% total Adobe revenue CAGR through fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2016, our targets include, total Adobe revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, approximately 20% year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth, exiting Digital Media ARR of approximately $3.875 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion during fiscal 2016, approximately 20% year-over-year Marketing Cloud revenue growth, with approximately 30% annual bookings growth, and GAAP EPS of approximately $1.80, with non-GAAP EPS of approximately $2.70. These fiscal 2016 targets are consistent with the preliminary targets we provided in October at our Analyst Meeting, with the exception of an increase to our Digital Media ARR target. In October, we provided a FY16 Digital Media ARR growth target of approximately 25%, based on a targeted exit of $2.95 billion in FY15. This implied net new Digital Media ARR growth of $738 million in FY16. We exited FY15 with $2.99 billion of actual Digital Media ARR, above our target of $2.95 billion. We adjust ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material FX changes. Our fiscal 2015 actual exiting Digital Media ARR of $2.99 billion was based on December 2014 FX rates. We\u2019ve revalued that ARR amount based on December 2015 FX rates and this has led to an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY15 of $2.88 billion. As a result of the momentum in Q4 that we expect to continue in FY16, we are raising our net new Digital Media ARR growth target to approximately $1 billion from the original implied target of $738 million. This results in a new target of $3.875 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY16. In addition, we are providing quarterly color on FY16. We expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially during the year. We expect net new Digital Media ARR to ramp sequentially similar to what was achieved in FY15. We expect Marketing Cloud revenue to grow sequentially during the year. However, quarterly year-over-year revenue growth will fluctuate below and above our annual target of 20% based on the amount of perpetual revenue achieved in the prior year ago quarters. In Q1 fiscal 2016 we are targeting a revenue range of $1,300 billion to $1,350 billion. We expect sequential growth from Q4 to Q1 in Creative and Marketing Cloud. We expect our Q1 share count to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 25% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.33 to $0.39 per share and a Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.56 to $0.62. All of our targets are summarized in the Financial Targets document on our Investor Relations website. In summary, fiscal 2015 was a watershed year for Adobe. Strong growth across key financial metrics reflect our amazing performance. Our long-term financial targets, including a 20% revenue CAGR through fiscal 2018, show that the benefits of our move to the cloud are just beginning. Mike? Mike Saviage : Thanks Mark.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Steve Rogers : Good day. It\u2019s Steve Rogers on for Walter. Just wanted to ask you about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the subscribers moving from point to full and just kind of the impact there that, that would have on ARPU? And then I got a quick follow-up if you could allow me second question. Shantanu Narayen : I think overall in terms of the subscriptions, we saw strength across all of the offerings. Certainly, I think as we innovate, we\u2019re distancing our Creative Cloud offering from the Creative Suite offering. So we\u2019re seeing good migration of existing customers. I would say Q4 was also characterized by international adoption accelerating in countries like Japan and Germany. Hobbyist and consumer customers are adopting the photography plan and education also continues to grow. And I think all of those contributed to a seasonally strong Q4. I think as you look at the individual versus complete, we've always maintained that individual is a good new way to attract customers to our platform and whether we move them from individual to compete or to we add stock, those are ways in which we are increasing the ARPU. And so across all of them we continue to execute well. Steve Rogers : Great. And just to follow-up, just on Fotolia, if you just sandbox that business and look at kind of expectations for next year. Can you talk about what you're kind of expecting there and maybe give some color in terms of just standalone Adobe Stock customers versus people attaching on Creative Cloud? Shantanu Narayen : From how we present that to our customers, the two real opportunities for us is to both take existing Creative Cloud subscribers and offer them an upsell to the Creative Cloud plus the stock subscription and in addition to that for new customers to have opportunity to both get that applications, as well as stock. And we offer both of those today, both of them are doing well. I think Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks that we accomplish the goals that we set for Adobe Stock for ourselves in fiscal \u201815 and certainly we expect to see it accelerated in \u201816. We\u2019re not breaking it out because it's part of the annualized recurring revenue as well as the revenue that we report in Creative but so far so good. We've also added on the product side, two things we've added, video files right now which I think is going to be important and with the November release of the Creative Suite products we\u2019ve added integration so that the workflow for the content creative professionals is now improved and enhanced. Steve Rogers : Good. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thank you. One follow-up on the line of question, the 833,000 subscriber additions, were there anything that you did in terms of incentives in the quarter. You matched with some of the international geographies. Is there anything that you did different to drive conversions in those international markets? How should we think about the sustainability of that impact? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Sterling, as it relates to what we did specifically in Q4, I won\u2019t highlight anything that was unusual or different from what we've been doing since the introduction of the Creative Cloud. We\u2019re constantly finding ways to incent people to move from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud or new customers. And as you know, we look very closely at retention, as well as how they migrate off any promotional pricing that we might do as they finished the first year. So I would say nothing unusual and I think just executing on all cylinders. Sterling Auty : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Will you be reporting net new subs going forward and if you have any thoughts on where you're shooting for fiscal \u201818, I know you gave us a framework or ARR revenue EPS but where would you likely be targeting subs as you exit your long-term framework and also on an annual quarterly basis? Thank you. Mark Garrett : Well, first, thanks Kash for you comments. Clearly, our long-term goal is to attract tens of millions of customers to the vision of Creative Cloud and drive both higher ARR and revenue. It's been important to us through this entire transition to make sure we give you metrics to understand the health of the business. And as we keep stating, we believe that as we are going to introduce new subscriptions whether it's mobile only subscriptions or education subscriptions to attract new customers to the platform, ARR continues to be the most important metric of the health of the business, as well as revenue. And so certainly, if you look at our goals of tens of millions of subscribers, we continue to expect to see acceleration and subscription growth. But I think the more important metric and maybe to answer Sterling\u2019s question as well in terms of how you think about 2016, I would look at the $1 billion of ARR that we\u2019ve provided and look at the seasonal way in which it was added in FY \u201815. And I think that should be a good proxy for how you model FY \u201816. Kash Rangan : Got it. Also, secondly, Shantanu, thank you for taking the question. What is your goal for Fotolia attached within the Creative installed base? Shantanu Narayen : Kash, I'm not sure we have a specific goal that we outline. We certainly think that as we\u2019ve said over 85% of both the buyers and sellers are Creative customers. And so you know, we would like to see all of them when they have inspiration and want to use stock for photography or videos, to use our stock service. And conversely it's a great marketplace for them to monetize their creative assets. So we continue to think there is significant upside there. Kash Rangan : Happy holidays gentlemen. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks Kash. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competition in the marketing cloud as you guys get into more multiproduct, multi-year deals. Is the competition so changing, are you seeing or imagine bigger competitors there. Are you still seeing some point products or solutions in the market. And I guess when you talk about lot of these big deals, obviously you guys expand your relationship with Accenture this morning. Could you talk about how many of those big deals have big SI partner or advertising partner going in there with you and the importance of those partnerships? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. So multiple questions there Kirk. Let me address the last one first, which is partners are playing increasingly important role in large number of the implementations. I think what we are certainly seeing as it relates to the multi-solutions is digital disruption as this conversation that's happening in every single boardroom and the awareness and the recognition that the customer journey and digital experience is fundamental to making that transformation, we hear that everywhere we go. And so I think marketing departments, CIOs, Chief Revenue Officers are recognizing that a platform is essential to helping with this particular transformation. So I think what's fueling our business is that the importance of digital transformation is now a Board level discussion rather than just a practitioner. With respect to the systems integrators and the digital agencies, up all of them have been great partners to us. I think today's announcement with Accenture just highlights how we can even further accelerate in the U.S. what we're doing in healthcare, as well as in financial services with them. To your other question about competitive dynamics that are happening in the marketplace, we clearly have the most comprehensive integrated offering. I don't think that's in question. There are a number of players who are offering point solutions and we recognize much like we did on the creative business that we have to deliver best-of-breed but we have to integrate it better than ever before. Products like audience manager are starting to really take traction and I think that reflects the growing importance of how customer segmentation is important across our solutions. So we have a number of point product competitors. We have a number of the large enterprise vendors who also look at marketing as an opportunity. I would say for the most part our offering is clearly differentiated and the distinction between us and others as we keep innovating should continue to increase. So it's been a healthy and positive. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and congrats on the fiscal year. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Mark Moerdler : Thank you and congrats on the quarter. So I want to drill a little bit on deferred revenue which continues to grow much faster than revenue itself and you would expect that to some extent. I just want to confirm that there are no other factors that are affecting or impacting it, there is no change in contract terms or anything else or payment terms et cetera that would be affecting that. Mark Garrett : Hey, Mark, it\u2019s Mark. No. there is no change there at all. Deferred really is just growing as a result of ETLAs on the creative side and bookings on the digital marketing side, just as you would expect. Mark Moerdler : And one quick follow-up and deferred is not include the hobbyists, correct? Deferred does not include the hobbyists, correct? Mark Garrett : Yeah. Because the hobbyists are being billed monthly. Mark Garrett : Yeah. Anyone that\u2019s billed monthly wouldn't show up in deferred, right. So deferred is just things that have been billed but not yet recognized to revenue. And you also see this effect in the unbilled backlog that I talked about in the script as well. Mark Moerdler : Perfect. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Mark Garrett : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much and congratulations for me as well. I just was curious this quarter on the mix of Creative Cloud subscribers between single app and complete, do you have that number, Mark or Shantanu? Mark Garrett : Yeah. Give me one second Ross. If you have another question, [indiscernible] Ross MacMillan : Yeah. My second question was on the marketing side, it sounded like you had a very strong booking this quarter. But I think the marketing cloud revenue was a tad lower than the low end of that guidance range you had provided. And I was just curious as to what that puts and takes there were? Was it really just even less perpetual than you thought or any other factors on that line that would be helpful? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Yeah. Sure. I'll answer both of those, Ross. So the mix was 52 complete and 48 point on Creative Cloud. And as it relates to digital marketing, what we would say is that as Shantanu mentioned, we're the leader in this category, we've had record revenue and record bookings in that space, AM and Analytics of the largest pieces of the business. And as you know, AM for a little while now has been going through this migration from perpetual to one of the Managed Services offering. In Q4, to put some numbers around it, in Q4 we had roughly $20 million of perpetual revenue. That was well below what we thought in that $365 million to $400 million range we\u2019ve provided. So even though we were anticipating perpetual being less than it was a year ago, it came in well below the range that we had provided you. In \u201916, the FY16 targets have less than $45 million in perpetual for the entire year. So we basically taken almost all of the perpetual revenue risk out of the targets for this very reason. So it should not be an issue going into next year. It\u2019s out of the guidance for the most part and it's really the only reason we came in below that range we had provided for Q4. Shantanu Narayen : And just to clarify, Ross, when Mark says that, perpetual was low, it did change to ratable rather than\u2026 Mark Garrett : Yeah. Yeah. Shantanu Narayen : \u2026 dropping out and so as it related to bookings\u2026 Mark Garrett : Yeah. Shantanu Narayen : \u2026 especially when you consider it FX adjusted for constant, we saw both quarterly and annual growth rates greater than 35%, so stronger bookings. Mark Garrett : And the last thing I'd add to that is, the quarterly growth, when you look at the quarterly growth next year on a quarter year-over-year basis, its going to vary under the 20%, over the 20% slightly each quarter based on how much perpetual was in the FY15 related quarter. Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. Mark Garrett : But we still believe we\u2019re going to hit the 20% on a year. Ross MacMillan : Yeah. That\u2019s very clear. That\u2019s great. And maybe just one very quick last follow-up. Just somewhat like cash\u2019s question, but I know you\u2019re not guiding to subs. But you added $1.1 billion of Creative ARR this year? You're targeting $1 billion next year. That delta if we think about that of $100 million and then we think about your sub adds this past year, is that a good proxy? So call it just under 10% less, is that a good proxy for the way we should think about sub adds give or take or do you think there is an ARPU delta that we should also take into account? Shantanu Narayen : It\u2019s the later, Ross, and it\u2019s not the former. Again, as we introduced new subscriptions that will target mobile or education as we said and as we are looking to attract tens of millions of subscribers, we don't necessarily foresee decline in year-over-year growth in subscriptions. Ross MacMillan : Great. Shantanu Narayen : To put another way there is more growth there. Mark Garrett : Yeah. Ross MacMillan : Yeah. Understood. Mark Garrett : Subscription is to go up. Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s great. Well, congratulation again. Thanks so much. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Mark Garrett : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Shantanu, the Marketing Cloud, you\u2019ve continued to highlight really strong bookings. I\u2019m curious if you could just walk through what you're seeing in terms of some of the deal sizes, I think in the past you talked about deal sizes are getting bigger, they\u2019re taking more components of the large suite. Anything else stand out to you this quarter or maybe perhaps sort of the last couple of quarters that seems to be a trend that you're seeing now that you haven't seen in the past? Shantanu Narayen : I think the two things I\u2019d highlight Brent is first, adoption of the entire Marketing Cloud, as well as some of the Core Services. So, I would say, Audience Manager is seeing good strength. Audience Manager, again, just to clarify like a Data Management Platforms, as well as the ability for people to use the same customer segments across each of our products. So we are seeing good growth in Audience Manager. The two are large components of the Marketing Cloud analytics, as well as Experience Manager continue to power along. Made some good progress with Campaign, Campaign growth has been really good to see. And last but certainly not least, I would say Primetime. I think with video being explosive category. We haven\u2019t touched on that as much. But TV Everywhere and digital consumptions of videos increasing and so I think we\u2019re continuing to see some good progress in video. But there is a clear requirement on the part of our customers to say, does all this stuff work together and I think that is only playing to our strength as well our brand. So across the Board we continue to see good strength. Brent Thill : Okay. And just real quick on the Marketing Cloud, Mark, as a follow-up. The question from investors, obviously, the doubling of the backlog versus the revenue growth for the last two years and at some point that has to converge in your -- your client for that conversions next year? Has there been anything else that\u2019s been surprising on implementation duration or have been some of these transactions has there been any churn on some of the original contracts that have been signed? That is a question that\u2019s come up, but I wanted to, it didn\u2019t sound like it, but I wanted to make sure we ask? Mark Garrett : Yeah. That\u2019s a fair question, Brent. No, churn has not been a problem, retention remains really high. We've done really well from that perspective. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that as customers do larger deployments. It does take a little bit longer to get them up and running and that delays the revenue clock a little bit. It's not a huge material problem. In fact it\u2019s a good thing, because they are doing larger deals with us. But nothing has changed from that perspective. It\u2019s really\u2026 Brent Thill : Thanks for the color. Mark Garrett : It\u2019s mainly been this perpetual shift. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to touch on the geographic side. It looks like there is a nice acceleration in Asia-Pacific? I was curious if there is something specific that drove that. And then conversely with EMEA, it seemed like there is a slowdown, despite you guys calling out fairly healthy booking, especially on the Marketing Cloud side? I was wondering if you guys give us some color on what\u2019s going on in Asia-Pacific and EMEA? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Samad, I mean, when we look at what's happening with the business in Asia-Pacific. Certainly both Japan, we continue to see good adoption of the Creative Cloud and the rest of Asia-Pacific had a very strong Digital Marketing growth as well. I mean, we see more adoption of that. In Financial Services, Australia continues to perform well. And as it relates to Europe as well, I mean we are seeing good growth in Digital Marketing in both regions. We focused our Digital Marketing on a few geographies, so the U.K., Germany, Australia and Japan, I would highlight as the areas where we are focusing a lot of our Digital Marketing. But nothing stands out in terms of what's happening in those regions. All of them continued to show promise for both Creative Cloud, as well as Digital Marketing. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is open. Brian Wieser : Thanks for taking the question. Just building more on the Marketing Cloud and Data Management platforms in particular. We\u2019re seeing lot of really interesting suites from some of your competitors out there, integrating more of a focus on attributions from some and then more focus on actual data from others, of course, Google launching theirs. I'm just curious, what sort of vision you have in terms of, how you see Data Management evolving in terms of product offering? Obviously, you're integrated with your overall other product suite. I\u2019m just curious, if you think you need to push further into attribution, for example, push further into display buying that loan, other direction or if the segments that of marketers are focused on are those for whom your currency is most appropriate? Shantanu Narayen : From our point of view, I think the focus that we have for the digital marketing business in the Marketing Cloud, in particular, is how can we enable people to have a great experience across mobile devices, tablets, and create that compelling web experience that people want. From our point of view, everything starts with the content platform and the data intelligence. The Data Management platform itself for us, it's a means to both how are you spending your advertising dollars and ensuring that you get the return of investment on that. And the advertising part is just a small portion of our overall marketing cloud revenue as well as our offering. So it's an important strategic part to enable people to understand who their customers are, the demographics, the profiles, so that they can effectively give them the offering that they need. But it should not be construed as a further increase into the advertising ecosystem even though that's a healthy business for us. Brian Wieser : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. I would just wonder just watching everything that\u2019s going on with TV dollars shifting and mobile advertising really starting to take up with bigger form factors in the market especially the likes of 6 plus. Just wondering, if you can share with us that kind of how you see this is potentially even accelerating some of the growth that you\u2019ve been seeing. Now that you\u2019ve got kind of what looks like accelerating shift of offline go into online. It seems like you have some attribution technology that really, might out of the competition there. So, I was just wondering, if you could share that with us. And then the other question was just related to OpEx for Mark. Obviously you guys did a great job in fiscal \u201815 and only grew it by about 2% and your guidance for this year implies a pretty good wrap. I\u2019m just wondering which line items should we see the strongest growth from in fiscal \u201816 from an OpEx perspective? Thank you. Mark Garrett : Hi, Heather, it\u2018s Mark, I'll start. On the OpEx side, the bulk of the increase will show up in sales and marketing. I mean COGS is going to go up because it's variable with revenue especially in the digital marketing business. But across both businesses, if you want to go after these large new TAMs that we out line at Analyst Day, we\u2019re going to need the sales and marketing dollars to do that. So that that's what's baked into the model for the next three years frankly and that's included in the guidance that we provided. Shantanu Narayen : And Heather on your first question, first with respect to attribution clearly the versions of the Marketing Cloud have attribution. We\u2019re continuing to enhance the attribution, so that we can not just do attribution at a individual spend level but we can also do it across both the entire Marketing Cloud as well as what's happening between online spend, display spend, service spend, social spend, and off-line spend. So we've been spending more of our research efforts to better enable marketers to understand the efficacy of their dollar spend. I think with respect to mobile, it\u2019s actually driving everyone of our individual solution components. I think Mark alluded to something like 40 plus percent of the transactions that people now have are on mobile. And so if you think about it from the point of view of the content that\u2019s being delivered to mobile devices, the video that's being consumed on mobile devices, the campaigns that require SMS or messaging, mobile is being just a huge tailwind for us across each of our solutions, in terms of the important for people to have new solutions. The advertising component again for us is represented in the media optimizer that business is showing growth. But it's not just the advertising part of mobile that's fueling our business. It's the consumption just as much. Heather Bellini : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Thanks. Thank you for taking the question guys and very nice quarter. Two questions, sort of -- one on sort of the [topline segregation] [ph] and the other on expenses. In terms of sort of the -- sort of international adoption of Creative Cloud, you talked about international market is picking up for you guys. How should we think about the lag between sort of where the U.S. is, where that lead us at the spaces versus where international market is and how far back is sort of the rest of world to be beyond -- behind the U.S.? And then on the OpEx side of the equation, just looking for little bit more color. It looks like you guys said headcount growth around 11% and so that\u2019s picking up a little bit, just wondering where you guys are making those investments and how we should think about that headcount growth into the forward fiscal year? Shantanu Narayen : I will take the first questions and the first question as it related to sort of the lag between U.S. markets and international markets. The way I would describe it is, Australia was the first place that we introduced it and so we've got tremendous experience through what we did in Australia and certainly, a lot of the focus that we have had has been in the U.S. The other non-speaking international markets, we consider them a year behind or year and half behind in some cases and catching up, because we put as -- we put a significant amount of our attention in the U.S. So nothing in those markets would lead us to believe that we won't see the same kind of success, but that may give you some sort of measure of where we are in the U.S. versus the rest of the world. We haven't yet really targeted and we've always talked about this being an opportunity, the emerging markets and having completely different pricing available there, because we continue to believe that there's so much opportunity and what we would say our markets where the propensity to both take subscriptions, as well as the network bandwidth is higher than in some of the other markets. So that continues to be on the roadmap. Mark Garrett : And if you look at the headcount, it\u2019s pretty consistent with what I told Heather. The headcount adds in Q4 were primarily in sales and marketing. The headcount adds frankly across the entire year were primarily in sales and marketing, and it's really just to drive sales capacity in the sales organization quarter carrying sales capacity and to do marketing activities to address these larger TAMs that we talked about. Keith Weiss : Thank you. Mike Saviage : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Hi. Thanks. Good evening. Two things, first, with respect to the ongoing momentum in subscriber apps for Creative Cloud, I understand you are not guiding specifically? But, how are you thinking about the importance or contribution from net new customers, I\u2019ll just say, due to Adobe as you define them as compared to upgrading the base? But first couple of years at least if Creative Cloud looked as new, new customers were something over 20% of the count and that number seem to have move closer to 30% more recently? If you look at over the next couple of years, what sort of contribution of, again, new, new to Adobe kind of Creative Cloud subscribers are thinking of or that you might need to have? And secondly, for Mark, with respect to the profitability of the digital marketing business, how are you thinking about that in terms of the role of cost of services, which is a large part of that revenue stream, when you look at your cost of revenues sequentially year-over-year, it\u2019s obvious that Digital Marketing is a significant part of the sequential and year-over-year increases in your cost of revenue and that seems to be very heavily driven by services, specifically? So, how are you thinking of the progression overtime of the dependency on services and perhaps, the ability to improve the profitability of the Digital Marketing business? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. Sure, Jay. And certainly sub adds we would expect that we will continue to drive net new subscribers to Adobe. You're right it's been more like 30%. We would expect that to continue. That's how we are going to address these large new TAM opportunities that we outlined at Analyst Day. And in Digital Marketing, the margin on that business continues to improve, from a gross margin perspective. We fully expect that we can do better and better from a hosted gross margin perspective, as well as from a professional services perspective and I would expect that to continue. Jay Vleeschhouwer : All right. Thanks. And if I could maybe squeeze one more. Are you have such visibility in model but unusually you don\u2019t will be guide to cash flow and I was wondering if you might give a comment on that for \u201916? Mark Garrett : Well, we did for the first time give a cash flow guide from a CAGR perspective over \u201815 through \u201818 at Analyst Day. So as we get more and more predictable, I\u2019ll look at whether we bring that in a bit tighter, but we did give a 25% cash flow CAGR through \u201918. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Mark Garrett : Sure. Operator, we\u2019re coming up in the top of the hour, why don\u2019t we take two more questions. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Derrick Wood from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Thanks. A question on guidance on the Digital Media side, it looks like you\u2019re guiding to 35% growth in ARR and 20% growth in revenue. And I think that these numbers overtime start to converge, but there's obviously still a bit of a delta out there with some slower growth or maybe shrinking perpetual license components. So can you give us some context about what those moving parts are the way on revenue growth as we think about that as in \u201916? Mark Garrett : Hey, Derrick. It\u2019s Mark. Yeah. You're right. It's a big ARR guide and smaller revenue guide if you will. They do converge overtime and there are pieces in that segment that are perpetual that are telling off that we\u2019ve talked about things like Lightroom, things like the hobbyist products, things like the interactive development, the monetization of our website. Those pieces of the business have been perpetually oriented and are definitely tailing off, and that's causing a little bit of a short-term slowdown on the revenue growth. But overtime they definitely converge ARR in revenue. Derrick Wood : And I could squeeze in other one in on the digital marketing side and it was mentioned earlier that longer time to go live because projects are getting more complex that's weighed on time to revenue recognition. Is there anything you can do with the, I guess, engaging with the SI community to lower those cycles or kind of do we expect that to be constant really at these levels going forward? Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think another way that you should be thinking about it is the customer in question may have the most immediate need of completely replacing their website. But what they decide to do because of the breadth of our offering, say, not only are we going to take the experience manager and analytics solution which is natural, but because all of the solutions work together, we\u2019re actually going to go ahead and engage Adobe in the entire solution. But in terms of how they implement them, then they may implement them sequentially in order to make sure that they get the most benefit out of it and that it goes smoothly. So some of these are just their large complete replacements of the web infrastructure and the entire online presence. And from our point of view, they\u2019re making a very strategic decision to go with Adobe for the entire platform and so we think that's good. And as Mark pointed out, the revenue starts to flow starting fiscal \u201816. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Brendan Barnicle : Thanks so much. Shantanu, I just wanted to follow-up on your answer to Ross MacMillan\u2019s question and when you think about the guidance for next year, are you contemplating any ARPU improvement? Shantanu Narayen : I think as it related to ARPU even this year, we did see in the commercial segment actually an ARPU increase. So certainly, the ARPU as it related to commercial increase, the ARPU as it related to the other services were relatively consistent and then when you look at it from a blended point of view, it was also relatively consistent. We definitely expect to see stock getting uptick in terms of the existing install base. At the same time, there are opportunities for us to attract a completely new set of customers whether they be in education, whether they be mobile only customers. And we would be crazy not to get them to our platform and drive future ARR and revenues. And so that\u2019s the way we are looking at the business. I realize it\u2019s easier to just do a p-time SKU but the truth is we don\u2019t have just one single offering that allows you to take it. It\u2019s the breadth of our offering that will actually enable us to be a more predictable and honestly drive future growth more than sticking to only the Creative Cloud enter single offering. So we\u2019re pleased with way that\u2019s going but hopefully that gives you some color into where we\u2019re headed. Well, given that was the last question, I just wanted to say we feel like we had a fantastic finish to a great year. And more importantly, we enter fiscal \u201816 with significant momentum as well as an incredible opportunity for us to continue to innovate on behalf of our customers and grow. As I think about it for individuals, good design in Creative have never been more important. And I think with Creative Cloud, we\u2019ve delivered a one-stop destination that delivers everything from inspiration all the way up to monetization. And for businesses, the digital disruption topic is absolutely dominating boardroom conversations. And we realized that a direct compelling digital experience is so critical to enabling this transformation and our lead in digital marketing solutions enables all of these customers to make the transition happen. And from our point of view when you combine these two opportunities, the power of creative content as well as data intelligence, we feel that\u2019s going to continue to fuel our business and excellent execution by our employees helps us deliver the results that you saw. So thank you for joining us today and we look forward to the next call. Mike Saviage : This concludes our call. Thank you.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks Mike and good afternoon. Adobe\u2019s year is off to a strong start, with first quarter revenue of $1.38 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66. Adobe\u2019s opportunity has never been greater. Every brand, government agency, and educational institution is undergoing large-scale digital transformation. Creating a compelling experience for their customers and constituents across every touch point is paramount to their success, and they are turning to Adobe for help. In Digital Media, Creative Cloud momentum continued in Q1 with strong adoption across all segments. There have never been more people creating content. Whether it\u2019s creative professionals, photographers, students or hobbyists creating compelling images, videos, websites, or mobile applications, our opportunity is to provide them with a one-stop shop for all their creative needs. There are three primary growth drivers for Creative Cloud as we target a $17 billion addressable market : continuing to migrate our core base of Creative users, market expansion into new segments, and value expansion through new services. Our migration strategy focuses on driving Creative Suite users to our core offerings, Creative Cloud for individuals, teams and enterprises. In Q1 we executed well against this opportunity driving adoption across all routes to market, including Adobe.com, our channel partners, and Adobe direct sales. Our market expansion strategy is to bring in new users, including photo enthusiasts and hobbyists with our Creative Cloud Photography plan. Over 30% of Creative Cloud subscribers are new to Adobe, and many are coming to us through our mobile apps. Over 23 million new Adobe IDs have been created through our mobile apps to date. In terms of value expansion, we have begun to see the positive effect of Adobe Stock, our stock content marketplace, on our Creative revenue and ARR. Millions of Creatives use stock content and we believe Adobe has a tremendous opportunity to deliver additional value by seamlessly integrating Adobe Stock directly into the Creative Cloud service. We intend to become the leader in this space through further product integration and new offerings, including stock video. In February, we added more than 100,000 native 4K video assets to Adobe Stock, which already includes more than 1 million video assets and more than 45 million images and graphics. The primary benefit of a Creative Cloud subscription is access to Adobe\u2019s continuous innovation. Earlier this week, we announced the preview release of a brand new product, Adobe Experience Design CC, a design and prototyping product that empowers user experience designers to deliver new mobile apps and web sites quickly and easily. User experience design is one of the fastest growing creative disciplines. According to data from our Behance Creative Community of over 6.6 million Creatives, interaction design projects grew by 52% in 2015, more than any other creative field. We look forward to hearing feedback from our community as we work toward launching the product later this year. Adobe\u2019s momentum continues in the video space, where we are now the leader in video production and editing. Over 175 films debuting at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival used Adobe Premiere Pro CC and other Creative Cloud tools. \u201cDeadpool\u201d is the latest blockbuster film to be edited exclusively with Adobe Premiere Pro. Our footprint is extending beyond Creative pros to Creative consumers. In February, we introduced Adobe Post, a free mobile app that allows consumers to quickly and easily turn photos and text into beautifully designed graphics and share them on social media. It joins our other consumer mobile apps, Adobe Voice and Adobe Slate, in bringing fast and fun storytelling capabilities to a broad audience, including students and small businesses. Adobe Document Cloud is becoming critical to the paper-to-digital transformation of document processes. More than 6 billion digital and electronic signature transactions are now processed through Document Cloud each year. Global businesses like The Royal Bank of Scotland, Scottrade, and NetApp rely on Document Cloud and Adobe Sign for fast, secure and mobile e-signatures. In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $199 million and we exited the quarter with $393 million in ARR. Across our Creative and Document Cloud businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $3.13 billion as of the end of Q1. We are the leader in the exploding digital marketing category. In Q1 we achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings, with revenue of $377 million which represents a 21% year-over-year increase. We continue to drive large-scale, multi-solution engagements with Marketing Cloud customers. Significant customer engagements in Q1 included RR Donnelly, Samsung Electronics, MGM Resorts International, Nissan, Workday, and Goldman Sachs. At Adobe, we are focused on product innovation and Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions continue to garner accolades from industry analysts. Earlier this month, we were recognized by IDC as a Leader in its Worldwide Marketing Cloud Platforms vendor assessment, and Forrester Research recognized Adobe Analytics, the data and analytics backbone of Adobe Marketing Cloud, as a leader in its Customer Analytics Solutions Wave report. In January Gartner named Adobe as a leader in the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs. Adobe managed over 51 trillion customer data transactions through the Marketing Cloud over the past four quarters, and our Adobe Digital Index reports are increasingly being viewed as the source for reporting and predicting major retail and consumer trends. Yesterday, we launched our new Digital Economy Project, which includes three digital indicators of the U.S. economy \u2013 a digital price index, a housing index and a job seeking index. Next week we will hold our Adobe Summit event in Las Vegas and we\u2019re expecting record-breaking attendance, including hundreds of our partners and main stage speakers from top brands including Cirque de Soleil, McDonald\u2019s, Comedy Central, Mattel, and Royal Bank of Scotland. Adobe Summit is the industry\u2019s leading digital marketing conference and the venue to learn where the industry is headed and see Adobe\u2019s latest technical advancements in mobile, video and data science. For over 30 years, Adobe employees have demonstrated a sense of purpose and commitment to our communities and we\u2019re proud of the recognition we received in Q1 as both an employer and a good corporate citizen. We were included as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations and were recognized as Fortune\u2019s Most Admired Company within the software category. While Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud, and Adobe Marketing Cloud are all leaders in their respective categories, our true opportunity is in bringing these solutions together. We have been unwavering in our mission to use content and data to deliver world-class experiences to our customers, whether they're on the web, in an app, in a retail store, or in a car. Adobe is the only software company with deep history in content and vast data capabilities to deliver consistent, continuous, and compelling experiences. We have a robust technology platform, a thriving ecosystem of partners and developers, and a strong brand that has affinity worldwide with the world's largest enterprises, agencies, governments and educational institutions. Our Q1 results demonstrate strong execution against this vast opportunity. Our market leadership, product differentiation, and continued momentum give us confidence to raise our fiscal 2016 revenue and earnings targets. Mark. Mark Garrett : Thanks, Shantanu. Before I comment on Q1 results, as a reminder, 2016 is a 53 week fiscal year with a 14 week first quarter. This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December. In the first quarter of FY16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.383 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. We estimate the extra week added approximately $75 million of revenue to the quarter, but this was mainly offset by a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue of approximately $69 million.  GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.50 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. These strong results reflect the continued momentum across our Cloud businesses. Highlights in our first quarter include : better-than-expected growth in Digital Media ARR, exiting the quarter with $3.13 billion, record Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents 44% year-over-year growth, record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth, strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $498 million, and exiting Q1 with a record 81% of Q1 revenue as recurring. In Digital Media, we grew Q1 segment revenue by 33% year-over-year, and exited the quarter with Digital Media ARR of $3.13 billion. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $733 million which represents year-over-year growth of 44%. We increased Creative ARR by $238 million during Q1. Driving this strong performance was demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market, including the addition of 798,000 net-new Creative Cloud subscriptions during the quarter. Migration continues to represent a large opportunity. Creative Cloud continues to distance itself from Creative Suite, and Creatives are migrating as well as renewing at non-promotional pricing. New customer adoption continues to increase our installed base. Creative Cloud mobile apps are driving new top-of-funnel traffic and first-time customer adoption. Market expansion is being driven by offerings such as the Creative Cloud Photography Plan which targets photo enthusiasts. Value expansion with new services like Adobe Stock are increasing ARPU and ARR. Our performance across all of these offerings and the health of the business is best reflected in ARR. Because of this, moving forward we have decided to provide forward-looking quarterly ARR targets to help you better model the total business. With respect to subscriptions, it has been our stated goal to attract tens of millions of customers at widely-varying price points. We reviewed this strategy with you back in October at our analyst meeting. Creative Cloud Photography Plan was our first market expansion offering, and has resulted in well over a million subscribers. New SKUs such as the recently announced K-through-12 education offering will make Creative Cloud available to millions of students. And as we said at the analyst meeting, we are also considering a mobile-only offering. All of this further dilutes the relevance of the number of subscribers as a measure of the health of the business. In addition, with respect to Acrobat, customers have been able to choose to subscribe to Acrobat either through Creative Cloud, which has been reflected as Creative Cloud subscriptions and Creative ARR or via Document Cloud, which has been reflected in Document Cloud ARR. For all these reasons, while we might choose to periodically report subscriptions, we no longer intend to provide actuals on a quarterly basis.  With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $199 million with Document Cloud ARR exiting the quarter of $393 million. Adoption of our new Acrobat DC offering was strong in Q1 both through the perpetual offering as well as in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings on Adobe.com, all of which is captured in Digital Media ARR. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million. We delivered strong bookings during the quarter, and both the revenue and bookings in Q1 put us on pace to achieve our annual targets of approximately 20% revenue growth and 30% bookings growth.  Other Marketing Cloud highlights in Q1 include : Strong year-over-year revenue growth across all Marketing Cloud solutions, continued growth in multi-solution adoption by our biggest customers, and mobile data transactions grew to 49% of total Adobe Analytics transactions. Our Digital Marketing segment revenue also includes LiveCycle and Connect, which declined as expected. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY16, versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY15; thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $7.6 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $48.1 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY16, versus $23.7 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY15; thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $68.6 million. In Q1, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 13% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 R&D tax credit. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 14,154 versus 13,893 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 42 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter, and 47 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $498 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.61 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.10 billion, compared to $3.99 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of $133 million. We currently have $1.48 billion remaining under our latest repurchase authority granted in January, 2015. Now I will provide our financial outlook. When considering our targets for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, it is important to remember that the first quarter had an extra week of revenue which we estimate had an approximate benefit of $75 million. Based on Q2 being a standard 13 week quarter, we are targeting a second quarter revenue range of $1.365 billion to $1.415 billion dollars. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $275 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q2, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth. In Digital Marketing, as we said in December, we expect Marketing Cloud quarterly year-over-year revenue growth will fluctuate below and above our annual FY16 target of approximately 20% growth based on the amount of perpetual revenue achieved in the prior year-ago quarter. Given this, we are targeting approximately 17% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q2, with continued momentum in bookings. We expect our Q2 share count to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 23% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.42 to $0.48 per share, and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.64 to $0.70. Based on Q1 upside and the benefit of strong Digital Media ARR momentum, we are raising certain full year financial targets. In Digital Media, we are increasing our Digital Media ARR exiting FY16 to approximately $4 billion, which is above our prior target of approximately $3.875 billion. We are increasing our targeted revenue for the year to approximately $5.8 billion, up from our prior target of approximately $5.7 billion.  FY16 targeted EPS is now approximately $2 on a GAAP basis, and approximately $2.80 on a non-GAAP basis. Our prior FY16 EPS targets were approximately $1.80 on a GAAP-basis and approximately $2.70 on a non-GAAP basis. In terms of color for the rest of the year, in Q3 we expect a slight sequential increase in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. We also expect Q3 Marketing Cloud revenue growth of less than 20% year-over-year due to the large amount of perpetual revenue in the year-ago quarter. In Q4 we expect seasonally strong sequential growth in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. And we expect Q4 Marketing Cloud revenue growth greater than 20% year-over-year. In summary, Q1 was a great start to what will be another strong year for Adobe. Mike. Mike Saviage : Thanks Mark.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks and Mark on operating expenditures, you were running flat to low single-digit growth, this quarter you were up 15% year-over-year. Can you just give us a sense of where these incremental investments are going and maybe talk a little bit about the build out of the direct distribution team around the Marketing Cloud and your aspirations there? Mark Garrett : Sure Brent, first off keep in mind we did have the extra week which impacts expense just like it impacts revenue. So a large chunk of that is based on just having the extra week. In addition we have merit increases that happened in the beginning of the year and you have got the full quarter effect of hires that you did in the fourth quarter. As you look out over the rest of the year, OPEX it won't be up sequentially just because of that extra week that you had in the first quarter and then you will see some growth in Q3 and Q4. And to your point that is more around driving sales and marketing capacity for the growth that we are seeing in all three clouds and the need to have that sales capacity on board as we get closer and closer to FY17. Brent Thill : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks very much and congratulations on a strong start. Shantanu on Mobile, our recent survey work suggest that mobile apps are actually driving some new subscribers to the Creative Cloud and I would love if you can maybe cast some light on how mobile was influencing the business going forward and especially around maybe monetization of mobile-only users? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yeah Ross, and I saw your survey as well, that was good work. I mean clearly what we are finding is that the over 20 million people who are first coming to us on Mobile. It is serving as a great top of the funnel in terms of the new creators getting interest in Adobe and they experience our mobile apps and then they both subscribe to as well as download all of our desktop applications. And part of it is because they all recognize that the content that they are creating is going to be consumed in Mobile and in terms of working in groups that\u2019s the other thing that\u2019s driving both tablet, mobile, as well as PC usage. The new experience design project as well initial feedback has been very positive. People have been asking about how they can get that also as well on Mobile and Touch. And so we just look at the explosion of mobile devices and where both content is created and consumed and it\u2019s clearly being a tailwind, not just in the digital media business but also in the digital marketing business. And things like being able to take a picture and move that from camera into Photoshop, people just love the fact that they now have independence of where they can create content when inspiration strikes. Ross MacMillan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. I was wondering Shantanu if you could talk a little about the educational SKUs that you guys have announced recently. If I recall correctly I think education was about with 25% of the units before you guys started this transition, can you just talk a little bit about where perhaps we are in that transition within education and some of the opportunities still see in front of us on that front? Thanks very much. Shantanu Narayen : Sure Kirk. I mean as you correctly pointed out, education has always been one of the largest verticals in terms of the Creative products and we have multiple offerings. We certainly offer site licenses for both K-through-12 institutions as well as higher Ed. I mean the student and teacher addition and then there is lab usage of our products. So, big picture what we are trying to do is make sure that in any setting that exists that we have the right Creative products. Creative in the education season tends to be Q3. We certainly believe that there is tens of millions of Creatives as they come into the market as part of the education segment, that\u2019s a growth for us and that\u2019s part of the reason why in Mark's prepared remarks also he talked about as we continue to offer our Creative products as a site license that we don\u2019t talk about sub. So, it\u2019s going well. More and more people are using our Creative products. Internationally also we are starting to have education be adopted. But big picture we look at it and say whether it\u2019s a student teacher single edition, whether it\u2019s an institution, or whether it\u2019s a lab usage. We want to make sure that our offering is applicable in all of those settings. Kirk Materne : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you guys. I am curious if you can give us some feel for the momentum for stock in this particular quarter, can you roughly quantify how many in terms of subscribers you added for stock? And Shantanu maybe a quick refresher on what are your longer term attached rate targets for stock perhaps netting three to four years within the Creative family? And if you have the time what was that Marketing Cloud bookings in this quarter, bookings growth rate in this quarter? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : So multiple questions there Kash, let me try and pass them one by one. The first is as it relates to revenue for stock during the quarter it was in line with our expectations so it\u2019s doing well. Again just to refresh folks, we offer on demand stock as a way for people to buy particular stock assets. We certainly offer a stock only subscription and we then offer a combined subscription which allows people to both access stock as well as our desktop products. And so across all of them we are continuing to see accelerated usage of the stock subscriptions. We don\u2019t break that out Kash in terms of what it is and that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re focused on just continuing to make sure we gain market share in the stock and deliver value. I think big picture as we\u2019ve always said over 80% of the people who are buying or selling stock are using our products and that\u2019s the opportunity.  From a roadmap point of view we look at integrating the stock service more directly within our applications as a way to both increase awareness for our customers and to improve their workflow. So as the year progresses we continue to expect to do better in stock moving forward. So off to a good start and it's only in the entire marketplace strategy for Adobe. And with respect to bookings I think Mark also alluded to the fact that they were strong. We did not see any seasonal slowdown from Q4 to Q1 in terms of how we look at the business. And one of the things I should probably state is when you look at the Digital Marketing revenue for Q1. It is actually being driven primarily by the bookings that we had last year, now translating into things getting live. There really wasn\u2019t much perpetual revenue in the quarter. So, the good news is that marketing is all as a result of the strong bookings we experienced last year. Mark Garrett : In fact to add on to that when you see the Q you will see the Digital Marketing segment, the whole segment subscription revenue is up 25% year-over-year for the whole Digital Marketing segment which is great. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Just want to follow up on the Adobe Stock portfolio items, so specifically it sounds like you are gaining traction. Wondering what that\u2019s going to do to the ARPU in the Creative side versus the offset that you still have because of the expanding \u2013 with photography bundle and things like that so what's that tug of war look like and what should we be thinking around ARPU trends from here? Mark Garrett : Hi Sterling, it's Mark. You know that\u2019s why frankly this average ARPU number gets very difficult to use as a gauge for the business. If you look at just Creative, we certainly expect that Stock will raise the ARPU for the Creative Professional, the people that are going to buy Stock. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to look at the average any more especially for all the reasons we articulated around subs with millions of people potentially buying this K-through-12 education bundle or as you said millions of people buying CCPP. But Stock will add to ARPU for the Creative Professional. Shantanu Narayen : And as it relates to the overall ARPU in the quarter again Sterling we continue to see for the core creative product an increase in ARPU very much in line as people renew at non-promotional pricing. Sterling Auty : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you. I just had a couple of questions. I was wondering now that you have a multiple years under your belt if you\u2019ve seen with the change to subscription if you\u2019d seen any change in the level of piracy and have you been able to combat that in any way with the new way of subscribing to the software? And then secondarily I might have missed this but did you give out the percentage of subs that were suite subscriptions versus single app? Shantanu Narayen : So Heather let me take both. The first is when you look at the number of new users that we\u2019ve stated who are part of the Creative platform which is 30% of the people who are doing business with us, there is no question that our surveys and anecdotal evidence speak to the fact that people who may have formally pirated or used our products casually are paying for the service because its far more affordable. As you know we are seeing increased growth in international markets where there was more piracy. The reality is we still haven't offered the Creative Cloud product in China as Creative Cloud. So all of that is upside for us in terms of combating piracy, there is so much opportunity in the developed markets that\u2019s where we focus. So, making progress and we continue to think as we roll it out in other markets around the world it's going to impact it. With respect to the single app versus the complete, as we said it's going to gravitate towards 50 :50 in the quarter. I think it was 52% CC Complete. Mark Garrett : Right. Heather Bellini : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Dan calling in for Mark, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the opportunity for ARPU expansion outside of Stock. Obviously Stock is a homerun in terms of driving up ARPU and I know you mentioned the average ARPU in subs numbers becoming less meaningful as the mix becomes more complex but if you can just talk about what you see as opportunity for ARPU expansion outside of stock that will be really helpful? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Well the opportunity for ARPU expansion around Stock is as we are attracting people to the platform we\u2019re certainly attracting them at what we would call promotional pricing. So that\u2019s one big opportunity and we\u2019re clearly seeing as people come onto the Creative Cloud platform they typically come from CS6 and prior versions where we give them a promotional pricing and then convert it into the full pricing. The other opportunity for ARPU expansion is moving from single app to the entire product. The third opportunity for ARPU expansion is Acrobat. We\u2019re certainly seeing a lot of people and that\u2019s why we\u2019re moving them more through the Creative Cloud funnel as opposed to the Document Cloud funnel, up selling them into the entire product. And last but certainly not least while it is not called ARPU within the enterprise as well as we move from selling what used to be custom like solutions of Creative Suite into the entire Creative Cloud Complete.  So, even on the core desktop products there is ARPU expansion against all of those four. Then in addition to that it\u2019s the new services that we\u2019ve introduced and will continue to introduce that represents ARPU expansion. And as you know in our Analyst Meeting we provided therefore the entire TAM available for us on both the Creative Cloud as well as the Document Cloud as part of Digital Media. Unidentified Analyst : Fantastic, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Excellent, thank you guys and again congratulations on a great quarter. Shantanu I want to follow on something that -- the comment that you made about the lack of seasonality in the quarter going from a Q4 to Q1 which is a lot different than what we saw last year at the time particular when it came to a subscriber add. Anything in particularly you could point to for why that happened or what was different this year than last year and the efforts you guys do to sort of sustain that level of any subscriber so much better? Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think there are a couple of things. I think at the macro level Keith firstly the solutions that we are providing I think are playing to what is a very key need in the marketplace which is everybody is dealing with digital transformation, everybody is trying to bring their businesses online. So there is no question in the marketing side as it relates to the kinds of solutions we offer. But the demand is only getting greater in organizations around the world. So I think that\u2019s one issue. Certainly the fact that we are doing less perpetual also factors into this and so as you think about the traditional Q4 to Q1, they would be big perpetual pushes and then it would sort of fall off. The third thing I would give is our marketing group is doing a much better job of having consistent demand and growing demand so we\u2019re looking at it not just as fiscal boundaries but as a continuous process of driving demand for our particular solution. So I think there are a number of things and then on the Creative side, I think it just continues to be opportunity to migrate customers and attract new customers. So I think for all of those four reasons we feel good about our business and we feel like they are in the sweet spot of what customers need right now. Keith Weiss : Excellent, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Brendan Barnicle : Good afternoon and Happy St. Patrick's Day. Thanks for taking my questions. Shantanu there is a lot of concerns about the macro economy particularly in the most recent quarter I was interested what you saw in the quarter in the U.S. and globally, particularly given your new Adobe Digital economy project? And just a quick one for Mark, can you remind us of the distribution breakdown between Adobe.com, the Channel, and Adobe direct sales right now? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Well clearly we saw a strong demand and we did not see any issues from the macro economy and that\u2019s the reason for both the strong quarter as well as the strong outlook not just for Q2 but for the rest of the year. So if there is macro economic conditions that are impacting other peoples businesses, we haven't seen that yet. I think even should that happen as you know we are far more near to that as a result of the recurring business, but we didn\u2019t see any demand weakness anywhere in the world. Mark Garrett : As it relates to route to market there is no doubt that we want Adobe.com to be the premier place people come to do business with us and it's becoming a much bigger piece of the business than it has overtime. As well our business from a direct sales perspective would come in right behind that. And then channel while its always going to be important to us it has just been shrinking consistently. I think at some point of levels off its not going to go away. But we really want to go direct and we want to go through adobe.com. Brendan Barnicle : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you, good evening, couple questions for Mark. I noticed that in your prepared remarks you didn\u2019t make any mention of ETLAs and could you comment on how those performed within the context of the increase in Creative ARRs sequentially. Your total subject were substantially ahead of our forecast but your Creative ARR was right in line, so I am wondering if perhaps you had somewhat flatter performance relatively in ETLAs? And then secondly you had quite substantial growth margin improvement sequentially in both businesses both Digital Media and Digital Marketing, if you could comment on what's driving the improvement in Digital Media gross margin including a sequential decline of your cost revenue there? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure Jay, you\u2019re right. As it relates to ETLAs there is some seasonality and you\u2019ll see that reflected in the ARR numbers for Creative and for doc services. So there is some seasonality in the ETLAs. On the gross margin side, a lot of that just has to do with the stacking effect frankly of having these subscribers build up overtime and not needing to add as much cost structure to support them because you\u2019ve got critical mass. So, it\u2019s a benefit of the stacking effect on the Creative side. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Steve Ashley : Alright, terrific, thanks so much. I'd like to talk about the Adobe Experience Design products that have been previewed now, seems have gotten a very nice response in the market and I am just wondering the users of that product, I am assuming as current customers do you foresee this as being an incremental purchase for these people or is it something that you would use in place of other Adobe products they\u2019ve used in the past? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Steve I think what we\u2019re seeing as big phenomenon in the Creative market is more people doing design and prototyping. It certainly is the traditional Creatives who\u2019ve been doing design and prototyping and they may have used products like Photoshop or Illustrate or Fireworks from Adobe in the past. But I actually think that there is a new community of people, product managers all around the world, the way we are designing products right now is they are doing a prototyping of what that product looks like, whether that\u2019s on mobile or on the web. And so I think this inherent need for people to have designed far more as a part of product creation I think will lead the experienced design product to be used not just by our existing customers but also by a whole new set of customers who are thinking about how do they use design to create a new generation of Experience product. So I am very excited about it, the feedback has been really good, but I do think product managers, the new breed of product managers that exist in startups they will all need to use a product such as the Experience Design product. Steve Ashley : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is open. Brian Wieser : Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about Marketing Cloud and the competitive environment as you\u2019re seeing it attach rate of different products and if what you think your customers are taking full suite versus individual products and maybe at the same time if you might be able to comment about how your recent issues of data, the data marketplace might be impact from the business at this point? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, with respect to the marketing cloud I think we continue to be the most both unified as well as comprehensive offering that\u2019s out there in the market. The results are driven not just by new logos and the new logos are increasingly using multiple solutions when they start off but also with certainly up selling existing customers to new solutions. So I think we\u2019re seeing that across the space. In terms of competition as we said even at the analyst meeting when you have a $27 billion opportunity you are going to attract other customers but I think we\u2019re so far ahead of them, we continue to be rated and we continue to innovate. On the data market stuff, stay tuned. Next week is our Summit and we\u2019re going to be talking a lot more about some of the exciting areas that we have on data. And so hopefully you are going to be at Summit and we\u2019ll share more at that time. Brian Wieser : I will be there, curious so maybe to your point as new entrants and obviously I was thinking of Google but try to push harder into this space, do you see that they are -- whether it's them or others that they are really tapping into other marketers and maybe you are not and that its helping contribute to growth is totally consistent? Shantanu Narayen : Well I think with respect to what's happening we used to target the Chief Revenue Officer, the Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Marketing Officer within the enterprise and I think that has now expanded to being a C level issue all the way up to the CEO in terms of the customer journey. I think there are companies who are certainly providing the ad stack for this customer journey. There would be people who provide the experience for the customer journey and the analytics. So in that sense you are right, I mean it is -- the opportunity is dramatically expanding because this is becoming front end and center not just for the marketing function but also at the C level function. Brian Wieser : Great, thank you. Mike Saviage : Carl we\u2019re approaching the end of the hour, why don\u2019t we take two more questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Rogers from Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hey guys, I am Walter, just wanted to see if you can get some more color on net adds and just the strength there, is that more internationally or is that kind of the net new to the franchise ads or potentially kind of Acrobat stuffs that are coming through the Creative Cloud funnel, just some color there would be great? Shantanu Narayen : I think it\u2019s all of the above in terms of where the net ads were. You\u2019re right, it was strong net ads. We certainly as it relates to the document businesses or Acrobat there was a fair amount. We definitely have a clear preference for customers to adopt Acrobat DC through the Creative funnel so that shows up as net adds in the Creative funnel because that gives us permission to up sell them to the Photography plan. But team did well, team continues to do well and so we\u2019re seeing strength. International, Japan and Germany that we\u2019ve identified as areas for growth are growing nicely. There still is a significant opportunity there to migrate existing customers and attract new customers. So I would say those markets are a couple of years behind but we haven't seen any slowdown in the U.S. yet. Walter Pritchard : Thanks. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Nandan Amladi from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nandan Amladi : Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. So Mark question for you on metrics, since you are no longer going to be providing the Creative Cloud subscriber count historically we\u2019ve sort of used your commentary on ARPU and the units to back into LA number or ETLA number. Going forward as you provide just the ARR number would you be providing any finer segmentation of that? Mark Garrett : Not right now. The best way to do the model from my perspective would be to take ARR which we\u2019re now going to guide to quarterly, so we did say we will add some additional guidance by giving you ARR every quarter. And you can take that ARR and do a waterfall flowing that into revenue to get a sense of what revenue is. To be honest with you, using what you were using which was a sub number that was incomplete and an average ARPU number, it really doesn\u2019t work anyway. We\u2019ll periodically give you more insight into what's going on like we do at analyst days and things like that. But the best way to do it is to take that ARR number and flow it through into revenue. Shantanu Narayen : And Nandan I think as Mark said, the goal is to continue to help you model the business and provide more color on ARR so that you get a sense not just for the overall health of the business but the various components. And since that was the last question, I mean just a couple of comments, as I am travelling around the world meeting both customers and partners, it is really clear that consumer expectations and what's happening with technology is causing every business to rethink how they interact with customers. And I think that\u2019s a digital first strategy right now for every one of them. From our point of view that great experience starts with great content. We\u2019re clearly the company that\u2019s helping bringing their concepts to life for Creatives and Creative Cloud is clearly the one stop shop for these customers providing everything from inspiration to monetization. I think the other thing we see is delivering that experience to the right person at the right time requires a technology platform that deals with large volumes of content and data but more importantly with the right intelligence and that\u2019s the goal of the Adobe Marketing Cloud.  All of these tailwinds we see now benefiting our businesses and I think in Q1 we saw a strength across Creative Cloud adoption and ARR growth, DC and Acrobat adoption as well as strong bookings and revenue, and implementations that are going live with the Adobe Marketing Cloud. And that\u2019s the reason why our Q1 upside and Q2 outlook gave us confidence to raise the revenue as well as earnings target. We think we are in great shape, we remain focused on driving innovation, and strong financial results and I want to thank our customers and partners worldwide for their ongoing commitment and to our employees for continuing to drive innovation in our industry. We hope to see you folks next week at Summit and otherwise we will look forward to our next call. Thank you for joining us today. Mike Saviage : And this call concludes our call, thank you.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. In Q2, Adobe delivered another record quarter, reporting revenue of $1.4 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71. Our momentum is a result of the continuous delivery of breakthrough product innovation across each of our three cloud offerings. We advanced our strategy of enabling the world\u2019s biggest brands, governments and educational institutions to develop well-designed, data-led and personalized digital experiences to their customers across every channel. In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q2 with $3.41 billion of annualized recurring revenue, a net increase of $285 million. We exceeded our ARR target as a result of continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creators from inspiration to monetization. Q2 ARR performance was driven by strong demand across all offerings, routes to market and geographies. We continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments and adding value by introducing new services. In addition to continued strength on Adobe.com, we were particularly pleased with the strength of renewals of enterprise term license agreements, which drove an increase in enterprise ARPU. Creative Cloud innovation continues at a torrid pace. Our goal is to make the creative process more fun, seamless and efficient for creatives, enabling them to go from a blank page to a brilliant composition in record time. We announced a major Creative Cloud update today that includes new features in flagship applications like Content-Aware Crop in Photoshop, performance enhancements in cross-product capabilities like CreativeSync and a significant update to Adobe Stock, which now includes a premium collection of stock content and deeper integration within the CC desktop and mobile applications. We believe this innovation will promote migration and enhance retention. We continue to introduce new applications to target new design categories. Adobe XD, our solution for user interface design, has already garnered more than 200,000 downloads as a preview release. In addition to delivering cutting-edge innovation for use by professionals, we are excited about the broader opportunity to enable anybody with an idea to create and share high-impact visual stories. Adobe Spark was introduced in May to address this need, and enables students and consumers to create professional quality, social posts, web stories and animated video in minutes. Adobe Document Cloud, the leading digital document service, enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes into 100% digital workflows. Net new Document Cloud ARR grew quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the continued momentum of this business. Document Cloud revenue was $188 million in Q2, and we exited the quarter with $415 million of Document Cloud ARR. Cross-cloud integration remains a high priority for Adobe. In April, we announced the first integration between Adobe Sign and Adobe Experience Manager, eliminating the cost and frustration of manual paper-based processes for enrollment, on-boarding and servicing across the customer journey. We announced new Document Cloud storage integrations with Box and Microsoft OneDrive to seamlessly and securely connect workflows across enterprise content collaboration platforms. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud remains the leader in the emerging high growth customer experience category. Through our unique combination of content and data, Adobe Marketing Cloud enables businesses to deliver highly personalized digital experiences across devices and digital channels. Adobe Marketing Cloud customer retention remains high and we continue to drive adoption of multiple solutions by our customers. Q2 customer wins include Southwest Airlines, eBay, the NFL, FedEx, American Red Cross, Logitech and Singapore Workforce Development Agency. In Q2, we had record attendance at Adobe Summit events in Las Vegas and London as well as Symposia in Mumbai and New York. We unveiled the next generation Adobe Marketing Cloud, shared our Adobe Cloud platform roadmap and announced the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, a network that will enable the world\u2019s biggest brands to work together to better identify consumers across digital devices. A key takeaway from these customer events was the strong growth of partners and developers who are building vertical applications on our platform. In March, we announced Adobe Primetime over-the-top capabilities that make it easy for TV networks and pay-TV providers to bring more personalized TV and ad experiences directly to consumers via Apple TV, Microsoft Xbox, Roku and other connected devices. In May, we introduced expanded virtual reality and augmented reality capabilities within Adobe Primetime, with ad insertion, digital rights management and playback. In May, we acquired Livefyre, a social content curation company. Livefyre will continue to be available as a standalone service and will be integrated within Adobe Experience Manager. With this integration, customers will be able to collect, curate and publish user-generated content from major social networks into digital experiences across their own marketing channels. Based on these announcements, innovation and momentum, industry analysts continue to recognize Adobe\u2019s Marketing Cloud solutions as market leaders in their respective categories. In Q2, Adobe\u2019s Campaign solution was named the leader by both Gartner and Forrester Research in their 2016 Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management and the 2016 Cross-Channel Campaign Management Wave reports, respectively. Last week, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms report. Finally, Forrester Research recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Enterprise Marketing Software Suites Wave report, where we once again received the highest scores for our overall Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and strategy. In Q2, Adobe Marketing Cloud managed nearly 19 trillion customer data transactions for our customers, reinforcing Adobe as the leading big data company in digital marketing. With unique insights from this data, we launched our new Digital Economy Project in March, which has quickly garnered broad attention as a critical indicator for the U.S. digital economy. The monthly report includes a digital price index, a housing index and a job seeking index. Dealing with digital disruption is the main concern we hear about in every meeting we have with business, education and government leaders the world over. A key strategy for dealing with this disruption is to deliver a compelling digital experience, which is the new basis for customer satisfaction, loyalty and growth. This business imperative creates great opportunity for Adobe. We are the only company that helps with every stage of a digital experience from creation through monetization. With another strong quarter behind us, we continue to be bullish about our growth prospects. Mark? Mark Garrett : Thanks Shantanu. In the second quarter of FY \u201816, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.399 billion, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.48 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our targeted range, GAAP earnings were at the high end of our targeted range and non-GAAP earnings were above our targeted range. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our business. Highlights in our second quarter include; strong growth in Digital Media ARR, which reflects the overall health of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses, record Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth, record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, which represents 18% year-over-year growth, strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $489 million and 81% of Q2 revenue was from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 26% year-over-year. More importantly, we exceeded our Q2 target for Digital Media ARR. We added $285 million during the quarter and exited Q2 with $3.41 billion. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 37%. We increased Creative ARR by $263 million during Q2. Driving this momentum was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions. Retention rates remain consistent with prior periods. We continue to execute well against our key Creative Cloud opportunities growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users and growing our installed base in the education market, driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to drive new member adoption and achieving higher ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue has grown sequentially over each of the past three quarters. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $188 million, which was in line with our expectations. In addition, Document Cloud ARR exiting Q2 grew to $415 million, which represents higher quarter-over-quarter growth when compared to Q1. We continued to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, which is benefiting ARR and building a foundation for growth in the future. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, driven by multi-solution adoption. We achieved another strong quarter with Adobe Campaign and Adobe Audience Manager is becoming a strategic asset as our customers are increasingly utilizing data to enhance their Digital Marketing programs to deliver personalized, engaging experiences. In Q2, for the first time, mobile transactions grew to 50% of total Adobe Analytics transactions. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $5.2 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201816 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201816, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains was $5.6 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $21.7 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201816 versus $22.2 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201815, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains was $40.3 million. In Q2, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 26% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP tax rate was higher than expected primarily due to the acquisition of Livefyre. Our trade DSO was 43 days, which compares to 39 days in the year ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $489 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.68 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.32 billion compared to $4.1 billion at the end of Q1. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $205 million. We currently have $1.2 billion remaining under our current authority granted January 2015. I will now provide our financial outlook. Based on our strong first half performance and business momentum, we expect to meet or exceed our FY \u201816 annual targets, which we raised in March. We expect the second half of the year to play out as we outlined in our Q1 call. We are targeting a third quarter revenue range of $1.420 billion to $1.470 billion. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $285 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q3, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth. In Digital Marketing, we expect continued momentum in bookings and approximately 7% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q3, factoring in the strong perpetual revenue in the year ago quarter. We are targeting our Q3 share count to be between 504 million to 506 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be between $11 million and $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.46 to $0.52 per share and a Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.69 to $0.75. In summary, Q2 was another solid quarter for Adobe and we look forward to our momentum continuing in the second half of fiscal 2016. Mike? Mike Saviage : Thanks Mark.

We would now be happy to take your questions and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Hi, thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Mark, I had a question just on the guidance around the Digital Marketing business. I realized that there has been some, I guess, changes in sort of how the rev rec has been going given the shift from perpetual to more subscription-based rev rec. But this next quarter, even when you adjust for some of that deal that fell into 3Q last year, which I understand is quite a little bit of a tougher comp. It seems like that gap between bookings in that segment and sort of revenue growth still isn\u2019t closing perhaps as fast as one might be thinking. So, can you just walk through that if there is changes in terms of implementation times are taking longer so there is some issue there or if you have longer deals that are \u2013 can span over say six quarters versus four. I was just kind of getting \u2013 I just want to get a sense on when do we start to see the inflection in the revenue growth in that business come back in the line a little bit closer with the bookings trends? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Hey, Kirk. Yes, thanks. So, as you pointed out in Q3 of last year, we did have an unusual amount of perpetual revenue. In fact, if you normalized last year for that perpetual revenue that was kind of above and beyond, the growth this year would have been somewhere in the 20% area. So, that is the reason why you are seeing 7% instead of what would have normally been something like 20%. We are still on a path to do 20% for the year, which is what we guided to quite a while ago. So, there is no change. There is no change in implementations or any of the other factors that you mentioned. It\u2019s really just how the quarters play out relative to perpetual last year. Kirk Materne : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Mark, just following up on Kirk\u2019s question. Can you just confirm that you are still, on the bookings side, I think catch what you did in Q2 in the Marketing Cloud? Can you give us a sense of what the gross booking number was in Q2? Mark Garrett : Yes. So, we don\u2019t disclose the booking number, Brent, every single quarter. But what we have said is that we are driving towards 30%. We are driving both long-term total contract value and we are focusing more and more now on annual contract value and we expect that to grow 30% this year, which is consistent with what we have been saying. Brent Thill : Okay. So, no change in the background other than the [OpEx] [ph], the perpetual... Mark Garrett : Yes, that\u2019s right. And as we are pointing out, we are still saying we are going to grow 20% revenue this year. It just doesn\u2019t make for a bigger Q4, but you are also getting now the stacking effect of those bookings that will start to play out in Q4. Shantanu Narayen : And two things both Brent and Kirk, if you look at our numbers for last year it actually does have traditional and seasonal expectation to it, so Q3 and Q4. And when we gave our updated targets at the end of Q2, this was very much part of the plan. So, it\u2019s playing out exactly as we had expected. Brent Thill : Shantanu, just a quick follow-up on the Creative Cloud. Where do you see the biggest next lever of growth? Is this coming to international? Is it a new user type? [Indiscernible], it seems like it\u2019s doing well. What\u2019s the next big wave you see that you have yet to hit? Shantanu Narayen : Well Brent, firstly with respect to Q2, we exceeded our ARR target that we had specified. We had expected $275 million. We came in at $285 million. And if you normalize for the 14-week quarter in Q1, you will actually see it was extremely strong performance. From the point of view of color, we said that we actually saw strength across all of the offerings as well as all of the geographies. And I think I highlighted in particular, as the 3-year ETLAs are now all coming up for renewal, the first time around, we had actually done a lot of the ETLAs as sort of custom deals. Now, we are seeing services as part of it. So, the enterprise continues to be an opportunity. International, to your point, also continues to be an opportunity. We have always highlighted Japan and Germany, which are continuing to show progress against the migration goals that we have as well as new customer acquisition. Education also continues to be an area where we are seeing interest in the Creative Suite. And I think if you see some of the announcements we made today, whether it was the new product in XD, adding virtual reality to premiere, things that we are doing with touch, there is just so much innovation possible. I think the core elements of migrating existing customers, adding new customers and adding new services, we continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead of us. And it\u2019s actually pretty interesting that 3 years into the transition, we expect record net ARR add in 2016. I think by all accounts, that\u2019s great performance. Brent Thill : Thanks, Shantanu. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I know that you are no longer disclosing the sub numbers around Creative Cloud, but triangulating some of the commentary on ETLA renewals, increase in ARPU might have some people wondering qualitatively, was there any softness in terms of the net increase in Creative Cloud subs in the quarter? Shantanu Narayen : Sterling, we were expecting multiple people would ask us that. We had a great quarter in subs, but ARR continues to be where we are focusing. No issues there whatsoever. Great quarter. Sterling Auty : Alright, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks a lot. Hey, Mark. Just wanted to drill in on Digital Marketing. In Q1, the Digital Marketing subscription revenue grew 25% and we get that in the filing. I wondered if you had that subscription revenue growth in 2Q. And in context of that, when you talk about 20% overall growth, what will that subscription revenue kind of grow at ballpark for the year do you think? Thanks. Mark Garrett : So, let me answer that a slightly different way and I may have to get a little bit more detail for you later, Ross. But in Q1, the subscription revenue that you see that was reported had an extra week. And that week, we said on our Q1 earnings call was worth $75 million in total revenue, but the bulk of that is subscription-oriented. So, again in Q1, we had that extra week, we talked about of revenue which was worth $75 million. The bulk of that is going to be subscription-oriented revenue. So, when you look at sequentially the subscription revenue that we report from Q1 to Q2, it\u2019s definitely muted by the fact that you had an extra week in Q1. So, there is really strong growth in subscription revenue in Q2. Shantanu Narayen : The other thing, Ross, I would just add is as expected, the amount of perpetual revenue that we are seeing in the Digital Marketing business is decreasing and becoming immaterial. So, I think the health of the business is driven by bookings and converting the bookings to revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hey, thanks and congratulations on still continuing to be the gold standard for these model transitions. One clarification for you, Mark is so when you look at the Creative revenue number, Q1 was significantly better than expected. How much of the Creative revenue performance itself this quarter is more so than normalization, because you do not have that extra week and therefore you are forecasting a number that \u2013 or guiding to a number that\u2019s closer to where you landed vis-\u00e0-vis any changes in the linearity or trends of the business itself this quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the previous quarter? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you. Mark Garrett : Yes, Kash, it\u2019s really driven by the extra week. Like I said, $75 million in Q1 came from that extra week. That $75 million is driven by subscription revenue, which would be both Digital Media and Digital Marketing. There is no change to the core underlying businesses. It\u2019s really just driven by that extra week. Kash Rangan : Got it. So, with respect to Street numbers, which may have \u2013 your guidance certainly is a little \u2013 at the lower end of your range is a little bit below, considering that you are very conservative, it\u2019s a little bit below the Street expectations, is that primarily due to the Digital Marketing Cloud site, where you correctly pointed out that you have a tough comparison to the perpetual induced Q3, is that all there is to it with respect to how your guidance shakes out relative to the rest of the Street or are there other pieces to the guidance that explains the discrepancy versus at least where our models were? And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you again. Mark Garrett : As Shantanu and I have both said, we expect to meet or exceed all of our FY \u201816 targets, and these are targets that we have raised after Q1. We didn\u2019t give specific Q3 and Q4 targets. But what we are laying out now for the rest of the year is very consistent with the quarterly color we provided. And it\u2019s also very similar to what you saw last year in terms of seasonality. There is still seasonality as it relates to revenue in Q3, Q4. So I think what you are seeing from us is exactly what we would have expected, exactly consistent with what we have been saying all year long. And it\u2019s probably just driven by the fact that we didn\u2019t give specific targets in Q3 and Q4. Shantanu Narayen : The other thing, Kash\u2026 Kash Rangan : Actually, you did point a deceleration on the March quarter call in Digital Marketing upcoming in Q3, so you did give us a bit of a heads-up? Mark Garrett : Yes. Shantanu Narayen : Kash, the other thing that\u2019s really happening is from our point of view, Mark and mine, I mean and the quarters are playing out exactly as expected. And when you see the percentage of revenue right now that\u2019s recurring, when you look at it relative to the midpoint of what we specified in Q2, it was an outstanding quarter from our point of view. And our ability to predict the revenue is actually getting better and better. And so I think when you look at some of the ranges that used to be the traditional part of our business when the amount of perpetual was different, the good news from our point of view is the business is actually becoming more predictable and we have more visibility. So it\u2019s playing out like we have thought. Kash Rangan : Congrats. Mark Garrett : Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. Shantanu, I am wondering if you can talk about larger M&A and how that sort of bolsters [ph] your strategy here as you are looking at growth in the Digital Marketing space and how willing you are to step up to do a large deal and what that deal might look like if you were looking to step up and do something more than $1 billion? Shantanu Narayen : Walter I mean I think from our point of view, when we look at the overall opportunity, we have estimated it as approximately $27 billion. And we don\u2019t think any single adjacency is going to impact our ability to either differentiate or continue to lead the market. I mean we have very established criteria. We look at strategic expansion, we look at cultural fit and we look at healthy financial returns. And if something meets those criteria, we will engage. If something doesn\u2019t, we will continue to focus on our organic growth opportunities, which are outstanding. The second thing I would say is that specifically as it relates to our focus, as we are delivering the platform more and more of this actually represents a partner ecosystem. And I would suspect that commerce is on some people\u2019s minds relative to what our strategy is. And we continue to partner with multiple companies, whether it\u2019s IBM, SAP or Demandware, because we control the entire digital experience. And we partner with them, with Demandware, on the specific retail vertical as well as physical goods. And if you think about the much larger opportunity that exists there, it\u2019s around non-physical commerce and we have partnerships there as well. So net, I would say we feel really good about our organic growth prospects and we will continue to be disciplined about looking at potential adjacencies. Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thank you, Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys for taking the question and nice quarter. I guess in terms of the overall macro, one of the things that we picked up today and our test was a potential for some pause in spending, particularly in the UK, I mean more broadly in Western Europe ahead of the Brexit vote, did you see any of that in your quarter at all, any indication that guys are just maybe pausing ahead of that that a period of uncertainty and was there any of that reflected in your guidance, any of that uncertainty? Shantanu Narayen : No Keith, we neither saw any weakness nor do we think that there is any impact to the macroeconomic opportunity that we have in those countries. As I said, there isn\u2019t a customer on the planet that we go visit where digital disruption is not top of mind, it\u2019s a line item in everybody\u2019s budget and they are all talking about how they are going to aggressively transition to digital experiences. So our conversation with them is front and center. Keith Weiss : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. I actually had two questions, the first one was related to Adobe Stock and now that that deal has been closed for about a year and a half, just wondering if you could share with us how your strategy with that has been evolving and any stats if you can share with us about that driving incremental ARR. And then the second question Mark, is you guys have been exceptional in terms of your operating expense control and if we do however, look at the \u2013 look at what you are forecasting or what\u2019s implied in your forecast for the back half of the year, there is a pretty material ramp that you are baking in, I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what those incremental investments might be? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I will take the first Heather, with respect to Adobe Stock. I think the big picture opportunity has always been that the people who both contribute to the Stock ecosystem and the people who use Stock in order to create their compositions both are Adobe customers. I think when you look at the number of people who are using Adobe Stock, the percentage of them who represent \u2013 who are CC subscribers is a very high percentage. So clearly, we are targeting folks who are already have a strong affinity towards our products strategically and view this as a value added service. With respect to how we are going to market Heather, we have offerings that allow people who have a CC subscription to add a Stock subscription to that. And we also offer a complete offering, which includes both access to CC desktop applications as well as Stock. And we are seeing uptake in both of those categories in addition to the traditional on-demand business that existed in Stock. And when I look at the revenue numbers over the last three quarters, we have been seeing good growth in the Adobe Stock line item across all three quarters. So it\u2019s leading to both revenue as well as ARPU and ARR. Mark Garrett : And Heather, as it relates to OpEx, I know this has been a question on analysts\u2019 minds for a while. We do have enough OpEx in our model, whether it\u2019s this year\u2019s model or the 3-year model that we have provided to make sure that we can grow the business the way we want to grow the business. And that growth is going to require sales capacity in Digital Marketing and it\u2019s going to require marketing activities in Digital Media. And of course, we are going to constantly invest in R&D. That\u2019s where it goes. To the extent that in any given quarter, we don\u2019t need it and we don\u2019t have a responsible place to put it, we are going to give it back to shareholders. And that\u2019s what you have seen from us in the last couple of quarters. And you know over many, many years that when we control costs and don\u2019t have a short-term need to make those investments, we will provide it back to you in the form of upside to EPS. Heather Bellini : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much. Can you give us some more color on the Document Cloud transition to subscription, how that\u2019s progressing, when and if we could see a bigger inflection, how we should think about the whole process going forward? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Mark, we had a strong quarter in the Document Cloud. And as you know, a significant portion of what we are seeing even with the Creative customers is adoption of the new Acrobat. Adobe Sign also continues to do well, that\u2019s represented in the Document Cloud business. So if I look at it quarter-over-quarter, that business continues to show momentum. We think there is a significant opportunity ahead of us. We have stated in the past that we have over 30 million people who have bought the perpetual or traditional version of Acrobat that represents opportunities and that the migration to subscription will be more muted overall than the Creative business. But on Adobe.com, we are actually seeing mostly adoption of the subscription version of the Document Cloud. So pleased with the business and continue to think that, that\u2019s a growth opportunity for us. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Steve Ashley : Well, I was going to ask a Document Cloud question as well and specifically Document Cloud has allowed you to augment and change your go-to-market strategy? And are you trying to also push adoption within larger Creative accounts with the Document Cloud? Shantanu Narayen : Steve, you broke up a little bit. But if the question was around what we are doing with respect to cross-selling each of our clouds into enterprise customers, yes, we are seeing significant progress with that, specifically, I would say in three areas. The first area is in what we have done with mobile and combining the DPS offering with AEM mobile and now providing a one-stop shop for whether they were Creative customers or Digital Marketing customers with our mobile publishing suite. The second area is in the cross-integration between Adobe Sign as well as AEM forms thereby allowing people to automate their inefficient paper-based processes. And the third area of cross-cloud integration and selling that we are doing is in the Creative Cloud enterprise offering, where people both have access to all of the Creative Cloud desktop applications as well as asset management through our Digital Marketing solutions to improve their content velocity. So, those are the three areas where we are continuing to both see traction from our customers, cross-sell into those specific accounts and continue with innovation on an integration. Steve Ashley : Perfect. Thank you, Shant. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Got it. Thanks. Good evening. Shantanu, at Summit 3 months ago and again today on the call, you highlighted AudienceManager among your Marketing Cloud solutions. And I am wondering if you are anticipating a significant re-ranking, let\u2019s say, of the various solutions that comprise total Marketing Cloud revenues. Could AudienceManager in effect become the next AEM as a major driver to growth of total Marketing Cloud? Also at Summit, you have said almost in passing during the investor meeting that you were experimenting with a new kind of licensing or usage model. If you have any update on that? And just a quick follow-up for Mark. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Jay. I think both of those relate to the big picture question of how are we making progress of migrating from individual solutions to customers adopting our entire Digital Marketing platform. I think the big three as it relates to solution revenue continue to be the Adobe Analytics, the Adobe Experience Manager as well as the Adobe Campaign solutions. But I think what\u2019s really exciting about Adobe AudienceManager is that it\u2019s one of the core services that\u2019s helping integrate all of these other three products into a more meaningful offering to marketers and Chief Revenue and Chief Digital Officers. And the traction that we are seeing with that I think reflects the growing trend in the industry, where people don\u2019t want to buy individual solutions, but they want to buy an entire platform that they can deploy and see the benefit of it easily. So, I think that\u2019s the reason to highlight the success that we are seeing with AudienceManager as a core service. And with respect to your second question, I mean, we are continuing to clearly see that the multi-product solutions are being adopted and that will continue to be our focus and delivery. Jay Vleeschhouwer : So Mark, you say you don\u2019t have the record revenue for services. We have talked about this subject in the last couple of quarters. On the other hand, your margins improved in services sequentially and year-over-year. So, the question is do you think you can keep the services margin stable or perhaps on some upward path as we saw in Q2? And is the services growth driven by both Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud or one more than the other? Mark Garrett : No, the services growth is really driven by Marketing Cloud. As we do larger engagements with customers, as we deploy multiple solutions within customers, they want us to help them get the ROI out of that purchase and they are coming to us for implementation help. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the marketing consulting. And yes, Jay, I mean, obviously, I am focused on the margin in that business. It\u2019s going to be deal specific from time-to-time. But overall, I would like to see the margins in that business continue to get better. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff : Hi, thanks. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I am curious if maybe you could help us with how many more customers there are left to convert to the Creative Cloud from the Creative Suite and maybe just a sense of what inning we are in? And then also, if you could maybe comment a little further on the ETLA strength in the quarter. Shantanu, I think you had mentioned that you were starting to see some contracts from a couple of years ago start to come up for renewal. Should investors and should we expect that the strength in ETLA renewals is going to be similar to what we saw this quarter? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I think with respect to your first question on installed base migration, as you know, we don\u2019t update those on every quarter, but I would encourage you to look at the last numbers that we had at our MAX event. And you will see there is still very significant opportunity in both migration as well as market and value expansion. And I think those numbers still show significant headroom relative to where we are today. So, I think that\u2019s a good metric for you to look at. I think with enterprise ETLAs, 3 years ago, when we started this move of having enterprise customers license our software rather than buy it outright, we were just starting on this journey and it was nice as those 3-year terms are coming up to see that there is actually a fairly nice up-sell associated with that. People are now adopting the entire Creative Cloud. They may have only had single applications there and are adopting services. So, we certainly will continue to focus on that trend of driving significant up-sell as people come up for retention and demonstrating the value. So, we are pleased with it. And certainly from an execution point of view, we are going to focus on continuing to drive that over the next few years. Michael Nemeroff : And could you talk about the pricing dynamics on those renewals? Shantanu Narayen : I think the pricing dynamic has such a different range associated with it. I mean, we are certainly \u2013 it\u2019s very large range as a result of the size of the installed base. But I mean, as we look at it, we would like that to be greater than either the individual or the team for a number of our customers. And so it\u2019s driving overall sort of ARR and ARPU up from what other customers might pay. Michael Nemeroff : Thanks for taking my questions. Mike Saviage : Stephanie, we are coming up in an hour. Maybe we will do one more question, please. Operator : Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thank you. I just had one follow-up. Mark, obviously, on operating expense, your growth rates here have been running at around headcount growth levels. And I just wondered, as we think about going forward, should that still continue to be the case or could it be any sort of material diversion from headcount growth and OpEx growth in the future? Thanks so much. Mark Garrett : No. As a software company, we are going to be tied pretty tightly to headcount. OpEx is going to be tied pretty tightly to headcount. So, I think you would see them track pretty closely together. Shantanu Narayen : So, Ross thanks for asking that question. I think from my point of view as well as the management team, \u201816 is shaping up to be a great year. As you know, we raised our annual revenue target at the end of Q1 as well as our Digital Media annualized recurring revenue target. And it was good to confirm that we are on track to meet or exceed these financial targets. I am particularly pleased with the Digital Media ARR. We are 3 years into the transition. We continue to expect to add record bookings that exceed the $1 billion that we added last year. And in Digital Marketing, we continue to be the leader in this explosive customer experience category. I think most important though for me we continue to innovate in our major businesses. If you saw the announcements we have made both at Digital Marketing Summit in terms of the additions to the marketing platform roadmap as well as what we have announced both for Document Cloud and today for Creative Cloud, I think that positions us incredibly well for FY \u201817 and beyond. And from all of the questions that were asked, I mean we certainly believe that we have leverage in our model and we continue to demonstrate tremendous financial discipline on the expense \u2013 expense front and we will continue to do that. So, thank you for joining us today. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. In Q3, Adobe delivered another record quarter, with revenue of $1.46 billion; GAAP earnings per share of $0.54; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75. These strong results are a reflection of our market leadership and momentum we have with Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud, and Adobe Marketing Cloud. We are enabling the world\u2019s leading brands to develop design and data-driven digital experiences for their customers across every channel. Our unique value proposition continues to distance Adobe from our competitors. In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q3 with $3.7 billion of annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, which represents an increase of $285 million quarter-over-quarter. The increase was a result of the continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is a one-stop shop for creativity and design, offering the world\u2019s best creative apps, services and training, as well as a vibrant marketplace and community. We achieved record Creative revenue of $803 million in Q3, which represents 39% year-over-year growth. Creative ARR grew in line with our expectations and was driven by continued migration of Creative Suite users, the addition of new value to existing subscribers with services such as Adobe Stock, new customer acquisition in the education and hobbyist photography markets, and retention of existing subscribers. Creative Cloud continues to deliver powerful new innovations across our segments at a rapid pace. As the leader in digital photography, Adobe has set the standard for professional grade photography across cameras and mobile devices with Adobe DNG, a raw file format we created. As of last week\u2019s iOS 10 release, Adobe DNG is now supported natively by iOS and Android, and Lightroom is the first cross platform app to empower users with an end-to-end raw mobile photography workflow for high quality image capture and editing. New Creative Cloud innovation enables subscribers to design for emerging categories like Experience Design. Adobe XD, our solution for designing and prototyping websites and mobile apps, continues to gain momentum among users and industry watchers. Although still only available as a preview release, last week it was selected as one of 15 winners in the Fast Company Innovation by Design Awards, a distinct honor given the 1,700 entries. Earlier this month, we showcased Adobe\u2019s leadership in the video category, unveiling advancements in virtual reality, character animation, and 3D at the IBC Conference in Amsterdam. These new capabilities are enabling video creators of all kinds from YouTubers to Hollywood studios to create, deliver, monetize, and measure innovative and immersive media across multiple screens. This morning, we announced the beta release of our new Adobe Stock Contributor Site, which reduces the friction for Creative Cloud users to promote and sell their work. The new site is integrated with Creative Cloud apps and introduces auto-keywording, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and tag content, streamlining the submission process, and increasing the discoverability of Adobe Stock content. In November, we will hold our annual MAX Creativity Conference in San Diego. We expect this year\u2019s MAX to be the largest gathering ever of designers, photographers, film makers, and other creative professionals from around the world. As always, we look forward to unveiling new technology at MAX, including whole new categories of cloud-first creative solutions. The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Document Cloud, leverages PDF and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital, using Acrobat desktop and mobile apps as well as integrated cloud services like Adobe Sign. In Q3, Individual Acrobat subscription units exceeded perpetual units for the first time. And on Adobe.com, over 90% of Acrobat customers chose the subscription offering. Document Cloud revenue was $187 million in Q3. Combined with Acrobat adoption reflected in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud continues to be an important growth business for Adobe. In June, we announced the Cloud Signature Consortium, a group comprised of leading industry and academic organizations committed to building a new open standard for cloud-based digital signatures across mobile and web, so anyone can digitally sign documents from anywhere. Adobe led the way in establishing PDF as a digital document standard and is now raising the awareness of electronic signatures as a key to any business\u2019 digital transformation. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies, and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it\u2019s financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment, or automotive, entire industries are experiencing disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger loyalty and growth. Success hinges on a strong foundation of content and data, which enable a deep understanding of customer needs, development, and delivery of consistent, personalized experiences, and the ability to monitor business performance in real time. In Q3, Adobe managed a record 23 trillion data transactions. Our customers in every major category of business are utilizing our machine learning algorithms to predict customer behavior and drive their business. Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, including Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Media Optimizer are achieving strong growth as our customers invest more in data-driven solutions. In August, Adobe Marketing Cloud once again played a key role in the digital broadcast of the Olympic Games. NBC Sports used Adobe Primetime to power the digital delivery of the 2016 Rio Olympics, the largest digital Olympic Games in history. In addition to being listed earlier this year as the Marketing Cloud platform category leader, Adobe Marketing Cloud was recognized by industry analysts during the quarter as a leader in categories such as Mobile Application Development, Cross Channel Campaign Management, and Enterprise Marketing Software. We continue to drive new logo wins and expand our business across geographies and vertical markets. Some Q3 customer wins include T-Mobile, Nordstrom, Subaru, SunTrust Bank, AstraZeneca and the state of Tennessee. At the core of our business are the people that make it happen. As a software business, we know that employees are our most strategic asset and we are committed to increasing diversity. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including coding initiatives focusing on young women. We were recently recognized as one of Forbes\u2019 Most Innovative Companies and we continue to garner best place to work honors around the world, most recently in Australia and India. In addition, our focus as a company on the environment and sustainability is important to our employees and to many investors. We were pleased to learn Adobe has been selected as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time. Today, every company is under pressure to be more connected and in tune with its customers, to know their history, their preferences and to create and deliver powerful, personalized experiences to them anywhere they go. Content and data are at the core of these exceptional experiences and Adobe is the only company that brings these critical capabilities together in our market leading cloud solutions. The market opportunity is significant. Our strategy is sound. And our results demonstrate the leverage in our model. All of these are what make us excited about the opportunities ahead. Mark? Mark Garrett : Thanks Shantanu. In the third quarter of FY \u201816, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.464 billion which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.54 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75. Strong performance across our three cloud offerings helped to deliver revenue towards the high end of our targeted range. Our cost discipline helped to deliver earnings upside while we continued to invest in the business to drive future growth. Highlights in our third quarter include; Solid growth with Digital Media ARR, We achieved our target of $285 million net new ARR during what is typically a seasonally soft quarter and keeps us on pace to achieve our annual target that we increased earlier this year, Record Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents 39% year-over-year growth, Record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $404 million, which represents 10% year-over-year growth and was above our target for the quarter, Strong growth in operating and net income, Record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue And 83% of Q3 revenue from recurring sources, an all-time high. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $285 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $3.7 billion exiting Q3. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 39%. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $258 million during Q3 and exited the quarter with $3.26 billion of Creative ARR. Our Creative ARR is more than $1 billion higher than the peak annual Creative revenue we achieved when it was just perpetual licensing of Creative Suite. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals. Retention rates for subscriptions overall remained ahead of our original targeted projections. Creative Cloud ARPU across each of our commercial offerings continues to grow quarter-on-quarter as new users on promotion pricing renew at full price after their promotions expire. We also drove strong subscription growth in the education market during the back-to-school season in Q3. Our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in three key areas; growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market, driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue grew by over 40% year-over-year in Q3. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $187 million, which was in line with our expectations as we gradually migrate this business to be more recurring. Document Cloud ARR exiting Q3 grew to $442 million, which represents the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Helping this growth is our effort to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. In Digital Marketing, we drove strong year-over-year growth in annual Adobe Marketing Cloud subscription bookings and greater than 25% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. Reported Marketing Cloud revenue was a record $404 million, ahead of our Q3 target as a result of accelerated second half pipeline conversion and resulted in year-over-year growth of 10%. Marketing Cloud retention, bookings in Q3 and our pipeline set us up for a strong Q4. Our increased focus on first year annual subscription value will help us more quickly convert our bookings into reported revenue as we look to FY \u201817 and beyond. Mobile remains a key market trend for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 52% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $0.9 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY \u201816 versus $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201816, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains was $1.2 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.2 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY \u201816 versus $9.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY \u201815. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains was $19.4 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. Although there was a short-term impact on demand following the Brexit announcement in the UK, it did not affect our ability to achieve our Q3 goals and we do not anticipate any significant impact through the rest of FY \u201816. In Q3, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 45 days, which compares to 44 days in the year ago quarter and 43 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion, up 38% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.45 billion compared to $4.32 billion at the end of Q2. Cash flow from operations was a record $518 million in the quarter. During this year we have been using excess domestic cash to buyback stock and drive our share count down. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at a cost of $344 million. We currently have $800 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015. Now I will provide our financial outlook. We are targeting a fourth quarter revenue range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion. In Digital Media, we expect to add slightly more than $300 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q4 to achieve our full year target of approximately $4 billion of ARR exiting the year. In Digital Marketing, we expect our business momentum to enable us to achieve Q4 Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 30%, which puts us on pace to achieve our annual growth target of approximately 20% for the year. We are targeting our Q4 share count to be between 503 million to 505 million shares. We expect net non-operating expenses to be between $8 million and $10 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.60 to $0.66 per share and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.83 to $0.89. For the year, our updated annual targets reflect our year-to-date results and our Q4 targets. We expect FY \u201816 annual revenue between $5.8 billion and $5.85 billion, GAAP EPS between $2.12 and $2.18 and non-GAAP EPS between $2.94 and $3. In summary, Q3 was yet another strong quarter for Adobe, with the leverage in our model continuing to be reflected in our bottom line performance. Our year-to-date results and targets for Q4 keep us on track to meet or exceed all of the financial targets we provided at the outset of the year. We look forward to finishing the year strong and hope to see you at MAX and our upcoming financial analyst meeting in San Diego. Mike? Mike Saviage : Thanks Mark.

We would now be happy to take your questions and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much, and congratulations from me. Shantanu, I think Mark commented that the Creative ARR is now about $1 billion higher than the peak in the Creative revenue versus \u2013 or under the Creative Suite licensing model, so you clearly cleared that barrier and you are growing that rapidly. But I actually wondered if you could look at the \u2013 compare and contrast that with the Acrobat and Document Cloud given that, that\u2019s earlier in its cycle of conversion. And I wondered if you could maybe frame for us what the opportunities are there in terms of driving expansion in that opportunity over time and maybe how much larger that could be? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Well, thanks Ross. And while I won\u2019t be updating our TAMs at this point, we are pleased with our performance and I will be happy to give you some color on how we see the opportunity ahead of us in terms of what the Creative Cloud as well as the Document Cloud. The Creative Cloud business is certainly being driven both by customer migration as well as by new customer adoption and we certainly think that\u2019s going to be true for the document business as well. As you know, we have tens of millions of people who have bought Acrobat over the lifetime of the Acrobat product. And for the first time as we mentioned again in our prepared remarks, the number of subscription units of Acrobat actually exceeded the perpetual units. So, we are pleased with how that transition is going. The playbook is exactly the same. It\u2019s about how do we migrate Acrobat customers to Acrobat DC. It\u2019s about adding new services like Sign. It\u2019s about enhancing new services that we can add to the business. But the thing I would also caution folks listening is to recognize that part of the Creative ARR that\u2019s being driven is also already being driven by the document business. And so while we report the document segment separately, let\u2019s already reflect that it\u2019s actually helping not just the document business, but also the creative business. So, we are pleased with that on mobile. PDF has continued to be adopted as a wide standard, which I think also augurs well for its continued growth. Ross MacMillan : Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up if I could. Mark, great to see the operating leverage coming through, OpEx is growing in the mid-teens, which you think is ahead of headcount growth. So, I wondered if you could just maybe just bridge that for us as we see OpEx growing a little bit ahead of headcount this quarter and probably next quarter? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Yes. I mean, in terms \u2013 thanks, Ross. In terms of OpEx growing faster than headcount, I would say a couple of things. Number one, when you hire people during the quarter you don\u2019t get the full effect of their expense in the quarter. They are averaged out over the course of the quarter, so you don\u2019t get the full impact until the following quarter. And as you saw, we did add 500 heads this quarter. There is also a lot of spending that we do that\u2019s non-headcount related, particularly in marketing, and that can come and go despite what we do from a headcount perspective. But let me comment briefly on EPS overall, because I know this will be a follow-on question. We have consistently shown that we have leverage in our model. I think Adobe has been a poster child of that for a number of years now. And with good revenue execution and good cost discipline, I think you have come to expect that from us. When we don\u2019t have very specific short-term investment needs, you are going to see earnings upside like you saw in the back half of this year, both in Q3 and our guidance in Q4. In the longer term, we see a lot of tremendous opportunity that\u2019s going to continue to require investment in sales and marketing. I mean, you saw that in the 500 heads that I mentioned we hired this quarter. So for the longer term, \u201817, \u201818, I would encourage you not to raise your EPS models right now. I would encourage you to recognize that we are going to continue to invest in sales and marketing and wait as we provide \u201817 revenue and earnings guidance later this year. Ross MacMillan : Understood. Thanks so much and congrats again. Mark Garrett : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Shantanu, the Marketing Cloud is set to accelerate into the fourth quarter, and I would assume given the perpetual falloff and more moving to the new model that should continue accelerating into fiscal \u201817. Can you just talk a little bit about your confidence underpinning what\u2019s happening in Marketing Cloud as some of your competitors have shown a pretty material slowdown in their growth rates in their cloud, are you taking share? What\u2019s happening here that\u2019s giving you this confidence? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Brent, I think we continue to be the undisputed leader of the Marketing Cloud. It\u2019s a category that we created. And I think from a unique differentiation, what we provide in terms of both the core content and analytics and all of the personalization software that we are delivering, I just \u2013 we continue to execute against that opportunity. I mean, the macro environment, Brent \u2013 I mean, people are still talking about digital disruption and how do they help create more personalized experiences for customers, and we are right in the center of that particular tailwind. With respect to the second half of the year, again, it\u2019s playing out as we expected. We told you at the end of Q2 that we had a strong pipeline, which gave us confidence to grow approximately 20% for the year. We were actually able to close deals on an accelerated basis in Q3, which is why you saw upside to our Q3 numbers relative to the target. And we just have to keep executing the way we are, Brent. It\u2019s not for lack of market opportunity in the marketing space and we just have to keep innovating as well. So, that\u2019s what gives us confidence, the market leadership that we have and continued focus on execution. International expansion, I will again continue to say, is a large opportunity for us in marketing and cross-selling existing customers with new solutions. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Thanks. Shantanu, I am wondering if you could talk about on the creative side, maybe you will update this at MAX, so I will ask another one if you do. But the Creative users that you have talked about in the past that were still to convert, any update on sort of what is left that you have visibility into conversions of the prior CS users still to go on to CC? Shantanu Narayen : I think big picture Walter, we continue to do a good job of migrating them. As you know, there was a fairly healthy cohort of CS6 customers that continues to be an opportunity for us in the U.S. And we talked about international expansion also as an opportunity. Both Japan and Germany had a good quarter. Now, when we looked at Q3, Japan and Germany grew \u2013 run rate units grew greater than the overall units, so that\u2019s continuing to please us in terms of now seeing CS customers in those geographies migrate. Education had another great subscription units quarter, which means we are attracting that next generation of customers. When you look at overall subs in the quarter, it was a very healthy number, so we are attracting new customers to the platform, but even the migration opportunity continues to be one. I think one of the areas where we are executing well is whether you are an existing customer or whether you are a new customer, the work we are doing in terms of delivering new innovative products, what they are seeing with XD, you will see some new announcements as well at MAX that I am not going to preview here today. What we are doing with VR and video, I think that also gives a lot of people the confidence that by adopting the Creative Cloud, it is the one stop shop for all of their Creative needs. So I think that gives us continued confidence that those who haven\u2019t migrated, they will continue to see additional value as we continue to deliver new innovation. Walter Pritchard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter guys. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could just talk a little about where you think we are on the Digital Marketing side in terms of customers moving away from buying sort of point products or best of breed products towards buying more Digital Marketing solutions where you guys obviously I think have an advantage just given the breadth of the product portfolio, can you just talk where we are in that transition in your view and how much of an advantage is that today for you all versus some of the competitors, especially some of the smaller ones out there? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Kirk. I think we mentioned that when we think about big picture what\u2019s happening in the enterprise space, if the first era was all about back office automation and the second era was about what happened with productivity or front office, we really are motivated by this notion that it\u2019s going to be the experience business. And if you are trying to create the experience business, the only way to transform your company is by adopting an entire platform rather than piece-meal trying to buy individual products and trying to fit that together. Virtually every new logo that we get is a multi-solution deal because what they want is a complete offering that enables them to do that transformation. Given the breadth of existing customer base, certainly we are up selling all of them to multiple solutions. But whether it\u2019s a new logo acquisition or whether it\u2019s renewals, most of the deals are now multi-solution deals and much larger revenue to Adobe and value to the customer. So hopefully that gives you some color in terms of the number of solutions that they are all adopting and how that\u2019s certainly migrating. To your point, it is a competitive advantage for us most definitely. Kirk Materne : If I can just ask a really quick follow-up for Mark around that topic Mark, deferred revenue growth has obviously been looking really, really strong, I assume that\u2019s primarily being driven by the strength you have seen in bookings around Digital Marketing, I guess do ETLAs play into that as well I guess from the Creative Cloud side? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Yes. It\u2019s actually both. It\u2019s been driven by Digital Marketing bookings, but it\u2019s also very heavily driven by ETLAs on the Creative side and on the Acrobat side. So it\u2019s really across the board, Kirk. Kirk Materne : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. But I was wondering, Shantanu or Mark, if you could talk a little bit about \u2013 you mentioned piracy reduction earlier in your prepared remarks and I am wondering if you could share with us how much of a tailwind do you see that giving you, is there kind of a framework that we could think about in terms of the impact on top line growth that you can get from piracy reduction and are there things that you are doing that you are changing even more than you were kind of a couple of years ago to stay ahead of the pirates? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Heather. I mean if you look at the macro level and we used to sell approximately 3 million units of Creative Suite a year and if you look at the numbers right now of where we are with Creative Cloud, it\u2019s clear that we have seen significant acceleration. Without a doubt, a large part of that acceleration is people who want Creative Cloud and are no longer pirating Creative products, but are actually as a result of the low price and the value that we are delivering using the entire subscription based offerings. So what we have done from a technical perspective already we have actually ensured that people who download the trials that once the trial expires that they don\u2019t have access to the products. And as you know, we have also shutdown places, online websites where people could buy a repackaged box. So there is no question that we have already addressed piracy in a meaningful way. In terms of the installed base of pirates, I think the numbers for that are all over the map. But I think you can go back and look at the last numbers that we gave in terms of the addressable market and you would see that there is still significant headroom. And the last thing I will mention is I think later this year, we will also make some announcements. There are still a number of countries where we actually only sell CS6 and we are going to start to offer CC in all of those markets. And for the first time we have the ability to offer differential pricing. So this is playing out exactly as we expected. Let\u2019s get the markets that are most developed, let\u2019s address casual pirates, let\u2019s hit the enterprise and then let\u2019s now expand that into emerging markets where there was more piracy and now we have the ability to counter that, both through pricing as well as through technology. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. What are the things that we were picking up when we were talking to let\u2019s say channel partners was increasing benefit from the roll-off of promotional pricing and good renewal rates on those \u2013 as your promotions roll-off and your comments seem to support that, so I was wondering if you could help us think about that in terms the magnitude of the impact, how much are we seeing that in the numbers today and how much we think about that\u2019s occurring on a go-forward basis and how well is that going to sustain into FY \u201817? Shantanu Narayen : Certainly some part of that, Keith is reflected in the ARR. When you think about it, Mark may have mentioned in his prepared remarks that when we think about all of the commercial offerings, the ARPU of all of the commercial offerings are increasing. And that, as you point out is a reflection of high retention rates of people who are moving off of promotions. And again, the strategy very much is let\u2019s have promotions to bring people onto our platform. And once we deliver the value as they retain at the annual boundaries, then we get the additional revenue. So it certainly has had an impact on ARR. The same thing is also true in the enterprise. When we first introduced the enterprise offerings, we had what we would call sort of custom enterprise offering, which was more of a mirror of what they were accustomed to buying with the Creative Suite. As they all move off the 3-year cycle and they are renewing, we are definitely marketing to them the value of the entire Creative Cloud offering. And we have seen adoption of that is fairly high again, which again leads to increased revenue per customer. Keith Weiss : Got it. And if I could perhaps follow-up on that latter comment in terms of the ETLAs to the enterprise market, is there any change in terms of who is able to sell those ETLAs, any expansion of that into the partner channel that we should be aware of? Shantanu Narayen : For the most part, I would say the large enterprise offerings it\u2019s a direct sales force in our sales force. I think if I look at that also moving forward, we are going to be providing more and more of those as self-serve on adobe.com moving forward. I mean the trend in the industry is clear whether it\u2019s us directly or whether it\u2019s through channel partners in addition to very motivated direct sales force. We want to reduce the friction of procuring, of expanding, of administering the Creative Cloud within enterprises. And we will continue to make that easy for people who just come to our website to start small and then grow as their organization grows. That\u2019s very much of the vision of how we look at adobe.com. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. Mark, question for you as it relates to the longer term operating leverage in the business. And clearly you have gotten to a point where I think you mentioned 80% plus of revenues are recurring. And as you have you this recurring revenue business that renews at very high margins, the secondary derivative starts to slow down, although the overall growth still looks pretty good. You don\u2019t have to grow your new subscription revenues quite at the pace that you have been growing before. So therefore that has some positive consequences for acquisition cost and sales and marketing or perhaps are we missing some other consideration in relation to your statement that you continue to see investment opportunities? So, just trying to measure or square off the merits of the subscription model vis-\u00e0-vis your comments that we should be more muted as far as how much margin expansion we should be expecting? Thank you. Mark Garrett : Yes. Hey, thanks, Kash. I am not saying you should be more muted. I am saying just don\u2019t get a little carried away based on what we are delivering in the second half of this year at all. Yes, we gave you guys a 3-year model a year ago that shows some pretty significant margin expansion over the next several years and we are ahead of that pace in the back half of this year. As I said because when we don\u2019t have some short-term investment needs we can deliver that to you in the form of upside to EPS and deliver that to shareholders. You are right in 83% recurring revenue model, particularly on the creative side, you are going to over time have less cost of acquisition and you can drive more margin. On the Digital Marketing side as we have discussed, that business is a very different business. We have got a lot of variable cost that comes with that business in the form of hosted infrastructure. It\u2019s going to be a very different margin profile. So, we have got two different businesses with two different margin profiles both growing very fast right now. But nothing has changed from our perspective about our ability to continue to drive more margin in the out years. Shantanu Narayen : And Kash, maybe the one thing I will add is we are clearly seeing the benefits of the stacking effect. When you look at the results for just Q3, I think digital media grew approximately 29%. The Creative grew approximately 39% and certainly the core Creative is growing even faster than that. So very pleased with both new customer acquisition as well as seeing the benefits of the stacking effect in the core subscription revenue stream. Kash Rangan : Congrats guys. Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks guys. Actually looking for the intersection of two questions that I think were asked earlier was just I think Shantanu, you talked about Creative Suite 6 is still \u2013 the migration path is still there. Later I think you have talked about Germany and Japan having good quarters. But I want to put those two together and try to understand where are you still seeing the most momentum in the Creative Suite conversion by geography? Shantanu Narayen : I think we continue to see strength across all geographies, Sterling. I think in terms of trying to give some color, Japan and Germany had a good quarter. It was very interesting as Australia where as you know we started the entire process for the Creative Cloud. They had a great new unit growth and run rate and so new customer acquisition is also clearly powering the business. And hopefully those three data points give you \u2013 and Rest of World is growing. It\u2019s just \u2013 we are seeing nice growth across all of the geographies in the run rate business. Clearly, there is more untapped opportunity in terms of international markets than they are in the U.S., no question, because in the U.S., we have seen tremendous progress. But I don\u2019t want to give anybody the impression that in the U.S., we are not both growing new customers as well as migrating existing customers. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you, guys. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks. For Mark, would it be fair to say that your pace of hiring could very well accelerate in terms of total heads even as compared \u2013 or especially as compared with Q3 adds? When looking, for example, at the number of open positions, right now on in your website we detected a pretty sharp increase year-over-year and sequentially over the past few months in all major regions, Americas, Asia, EMEA, sales and R&D spiking up pretty considerably. And interestingly, Japan is picking up in terms of opening U.K. post-Brexit, picking up in terms of openings. So, again, would it be fair to say that do you think you might even drive the headcount additions, particularly in non-U.S. markets more rapidly? Mark Garrett : Hey, Jay. Yes, without a doubt, the 500 people we added roughly this quarter is the most we have added in a quarter in my recent memory and it\u2019s all being driven by what we have been seeing for quite a while, which is our need to drive sales capacity for both Digital Media and Digital Marketing, drive more marketing and R&D as well for that matter. So, I would expect that to continue and that\u2019s why I made the comment I did about our investment for the next couple of years. We are going to need to make sure we have got the right available funds to invest in that and drive the growth that we are trying to driving these businesses. We are driving 20% revenue growth on the Digital Media side of the business and 30% bookings growth on the Digital Marketing side. Those are pretty significant growth numbers and you have got to have the investment to drive that growth. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Right. For Shantanu, you have spoken at Summit and on other occasions Mark has as well, about your future technology infrastructure meaning you have referred on a number of occasions to defining a common data model, common cloud architecture, investments in data science and so forth. Could you talk about that a little bit in terms of ultimately where do you see the platform going? Is that part of what you were referring to earlier in terms of a frictionless self-service capability that you could offer customers? What do those really mean in terms of functionality and deliverables to the customer? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Jay, I think in terms of how we as a product company continue to innovate for our customers, there is no question that Creative Cloud has been as successful as it is, because not only is it best-of-breed individual products for specific users, but the integration across all of those is unparalleled in the industry in terms of how colors or types of fonts work. Our vision for the Marketing Cloud is exactly the same, which is we are building a data platform that enables all of our products to work seamlessly together. We have made a lot of progress in that space. And the benefit for customers is certainly as they think about a campaign, as they think about customer segments it naturally flows from the analytics product to the target product to the campaign product. And in the enterprise space, we certainly see that our Marketing Cloud, while it\u2019s a leader, we have aspirations for that not to be an island unto itself, but really to be the hub that interconnects all of the enterprise software. And so investing as you point out in these core data platforms to enable our customers to derive value and for us to continue to build a technology moat that will serve us well for many years is very much part of the strategy. And last but not least, customer expectations right now across the globe are that content flows seamlessly from our Creative Cloud into our Marketing Cloud and so we do that. The one other comment I will make you are right, there is a lot of conversation right now about machine learning and AI. It\u2019s something that we have invested in for years. I mean, we wouldn\u2019t be building the magic that we build in Creative Cloud or Creative Suite without very deep technology in terms of machine learning. And the reality is when we think about Marketing Cloud, it\u2019s not about data collection, it\u2019s all about how we are driving insight and predictive, which is another form of machine learning and that\u2019s what\u2019s really fueled our Marketing Cloud business. So continue to invest in deep technology across the company. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Thanks for taking my question guys. Shantanu, you mentioned some accelerated deal signings in the quarter. And I guess maybe you can comment on the macro backdrop as you are seeing this year versus last year as some of the other vendors in the space saw some deal pushes and you clearly aren\u2019t seeing that. So maybe just give a comment there and then I have got a quick follow-up. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Alex, I think when, after Q2, we said as we looked at the pipeline for the second half of the year, it was a healthy pipeline. And we look at it and we have our internal expectations of what\u2019s going to close in Q3 and what\u2019s going to close in Q4. As you know, enterprise software Q4 is the traditionally strong quarter, which again to the question that Brent also asked earlier gives us confidence the strength of the pipeline for the numbers that we said. But I think we executed well against it. And I think it also reflects the importance of our solutions for the customers that we are serving. I mean if you are trying to move your business online, if you are trying to create a more personalized relationship with your customers sure, you can defer the decision. You are only deferring the inevitable in terms of having to invest in technology that helps you automate that process. And so I would say part of it is the offering that we have, part of it is execution that we have. And we have to just continue to be focused on it. Mike Saviage : Operator \u2013 sorry Alex, go ahead. Alex Zukin : Yes. I was going to ask a question, you mentioned machine learning and predictive analytics and Shantanu I guess \u2013 and kind of in the context of AI, do you see \u2013 when you think about the application of data within your product suite, are you thinking more in terms of automation context or insights context, just in general how do you see that playing out in the marketing landscape over the next few years? Shantanu Narayen : I think Alex, for years we have been talking about our platform unique advantage being the combination of data and content. And as we are enabling our customers to have these Marketing Clouds deliver more personalized experience, I think table stakes a few years ago was being to actually just collect that data to the core Web Analytics. Our business is being fueled by not just collecting the data. Our business is certainly being fueled by across campaign and across target. How are we providing a unique insight into our customers, so we have been doing this for years and I think to your point, there are a lot of people talking about it. It\u2019s going to become something that becomes the industry buzz. We have partly been executed against that for quite a while now. Mike Saviage : Operator, we are coming up at the top of the hour, why don\u2019t we take one more question? Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Shantanu, on the Marketing Cloud, based on our conversations, at least within the enterprise B2C base, it seems like we are moving a bit past the website re-platforming cycle and a bit more towards adding modules on top of AEM and better monetizing the content in the platform, would you agree with this and if so, what does that mean to the kind of the velocity of transaction activity and the type of deal sizes you are seeing. And then maybe correlated but Mark, I think I heard you say you want to increase both more focused on first year contract value and shorten time to go live, could you just flush out a bit more about what you guys are doing and what you hope to yield from it? Mark Garrett : Yes. I will start and then Shantanu can add on. So as it relates to that. I think we have discussed this with you. I know we have discussed this with you in the past, but we want to more closely align revenue to bookings. And as a result to that, our focus has shifted more towards annual subscription value. So the field \u2013 our sales force is now compensated more towards annual subscription value. We continue to believe that we are going to hit our 30% ASP bookings growth for the year. And by doing so, that puts revenue more closely aligned to bookings. Shantanu Narayen : And Derrick, as to your question, you are absolutely right. I mean the single point of interaction in the digital world for most customers used to be the website with AEM as you pointed out. What\u2019s becoming table stakes increasingly is having that same kind of personalized experience across all digital channels, whether you are in airlines and that\u2019s the experience in the kiosk or a terminal, whether it\u2019s in retail and that\u2019s the particular experience when you walk into a retail store, whether it\u2019s in food and functionality, whether it you are coming to a drive-in. And so what\u2019s fueling our business is the ability to actually deliver that same experience across each of those different channels. And more specifically, what that means is as people are creating new mobile applications and using our AEM mobile solutions or as people are corresponding more with people and addressing our campaign solutions. And it\u2019s certainly our goal to provide that single stop shop for all communication and all experience across all different channels. It\u2019s very definitely driving it. The one product that I will again single out is Audience Manager really just continues to do extremely well in the enterprise. And I think the reason for that is all enterprises are starting off with this question who are my customers, what are the demographics and how do I set up that up. And Audience Manager is so much more than just DMV. It actually allows enterprise to start off in a business strategy and say, let me get as real clear understanding of my customers and what I am trying to deliver to them across all different touch points. So our vision of the Marketing Cloud and continuing to be the one stop shop, I think it\u2019s paying off and you are seeing that in the results. And big picture, since that was the last question, I think we continue to focus on the large opportunities ahead of us as a company. And we are helping create the world\u2019s content. We are helping enterprises use technology to deliver better customer value. I know Mark and I are pleased with our Q3 results. Our Q4 targets reflect the continued momentum in the business. It\u2019s going to be able to enlist macro environment, continue to reiterate our financial targets. And as you saw, increase our EPS target for the year. And so we think we are in great shape. We remain focused on driving innovation for our customers. I again want to thank customers, partners worldwide for their commitment and to our employers \u2013 employees for continuing to drive innovation in this industry. We look forward to seeing you all at MAX. There are going to be some exciting announcements and we will have an update for you, but thank you for joining us today. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call. Thank you.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. FY \u201816 was another great year for Adobe. Our record growth and net income were driven by strong performance in Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue, continued growth of Adobe Document Cloud subscriptions and strong revenue and bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud. In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4, was $0.80 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.90. For the year, we grew total revenue to $5.85 billion, which represents 22% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY \u201816, was $2.32 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.01. In Digital Media, we are advancing the state-of-the-art for content and setting the standard for creativity and digital documents. We exited the year with over $4 billion of annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was $316 million and was driven by continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and design. And in FY \u201816, we expanded our customer base while continuing to deliver a rapid stream of product innovations. We achieved record Creative revenue of $886 million in Q4. For the year, we achieved Creative revenue of $3.2 billion, which represents 38% year-over-year growth. At the heart of the Creative Cloud is the promise of continuous innovation and the pace at which we are delivering new technology is accelerating. Last month at our MAX Creativity Conference, we unveiled next-generation desktop, mobile and cloud services for designers, photographers and filmmakers as well as sneak previews of creative technologies in the areas of virtual reality, image matching and digital painting. Our Creative customers have always counted on us to turn the future into reality. Creative Cloud is the place designers expect to get the best tools and services in emerging categories like Experience Design and 3D. Earlier this week, we released two public betas, Adobe XD for Windows, the first all-in-one tool for designing, prototyping and sharing user experiences for web and mobile apps; and Project Felix, a new application that enables designers to create photorealistic composites with 2D images and 3D assets. Adobe Stock continues to gain momentum in the multibillion dollar stock image category. In Q4, we launched the Adobe Stock contributor site, a new platform that allows users to upload and sell photos, illustrations, videos and vectors to the world\u2019s largest creative community. We also announced a partnership with Reuters that will bring their expansive video and photography library, across news, sports, business and entertainment to the Adobe Stock service. With creativity exploding across the globe, geographic expansion represents a significant growth opportunity. In November, we launched Adobe Creative Cloud for teens in China. China is one of the world\u2019s largest digital economies and we can now address its extensive community of designers and creatives. We believe everyone is creative and should have the opportunity to express themselves. Adobe Spark, our consumer-friendly web and mobile solution for creating and sharing professional quality animated videos, web stories and social graphics, is gaining traction with small businesses, social marketers and students. We will continue to invest in Adobe Spark, which we see as a key way to reach broader consumer audience as part of Creative Cloud. The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, leverages the PDF standard we pioneered and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was $191 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $475 million. Document Cloud represents the modern way for managing digital documents. Core cloud capabilities like mobile and collaboration as well as services like electronic signatures have become a requirement for our customers. As a result, Document Cloud subscriptions now eclipse licensing of perpetual Acrobat software on adobe.com and we expect to see stronger migration among our enterprise customers in the coming year. As part of the ongoing innovation delivered through Document Cloud, this quarter, we rolled out critical new scan functionality in our Adobe Reader mobile apps. In October, we expanded the global footprint for Adobe Document Cloud with the launch of the Adobe Sign service in Japan. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels, whether its financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment or automotive, entire industries are experiencing digital disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger brand loyalty and growth. Adobe\u2019s winning formula is built on a unique foundation of content and data, which enables deep customer insights; development and delivery of consistent personalized experiences; and the ability to monitor and optimize business performance in real time. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the most comprehensive offering in the exploding Digital Marketing category with best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaigns and data management as well as media optimization. We are seeing strong demand for the Adobe Marketing Cloud across the globe as evidenced by the sold-out crowds at events this quarter in London, Paris, Munich and Tokyo. Major customer wins this quarter included Lufthansa, Pandora, UnitedHealthcare, UPS, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency and Verizon. In Q4, Adobe managed record 33.5 trillion data transactions, providing us with an unparalleled view into real-time business and cultural trends. Debuting in 2016, the Adobe Digital Price Index has redefined how inflation and consumer goods prices are tracked and measured and has received broad support from the world\u2019s leading economists. Leveraging over 20 billion visits to retail websites, Adobe Digital Insights\u2019 Holiday Shopping Report accurately predicted online sales for this holiday season within a margin of error of less than 0.5%. Adobe measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers and $7.50 out of every $10 spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers go through Adobe Marketing Cloud. This tremendous volume of data puts Adobe in the unique position to deliver highly accurate, census based online sales totals, pricing and product availability trends each holiday season. Last month, we announced our intention to acquire TubeMogul, a leading demand side video advertising platform, further strengthening our leadership in digital marketing and ad tech. Adobe is currently a leader in search, display and social advertising, planning and delivery with our Adobe Media Optimizer solution. The addition of TubeMogul to our ad tech capabilities will enable Adobe\u2019s customers to maximize their video advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Together, Adobe and TubeMogul will enable our customers to identify the right audience segments and plan, execute and measure paid media performance across any device. We expect the transaction to close in December. In September, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to help enterprises embrace digital transformation. Adobe announced it will make Microsoft Azure, the preferred platform for our cloud services, providing customers with a trusted, enterprise grade global platform and that we will integrate our Adobe Marketing Cloud technology with Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics 365 Enterprise and Power BI. Microsoft announced it will make Adobe Marketing Cloud the preferred marketing service for its enterprise customers and its extensive partner and developer ecosystem. Adobe\u2019s success has been a result of our ability to predict the future. While others are jumping on the machine learning and AI bandwagon, these capabilities have been the foundation of our innovation for decades. Our engineers and scientists are squarely focused on harnessing the massive volume of content and data assets captured in our cloud solutions to tackle today\u2019s complex experience challenges. Last month, we announced Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei\u2019s services address the critical demands of our creative document and marketing customers from image matching across millions of images to understanding the meaning and sentiment of digital documents to finally targeting important audience segments. Dozens of these intelligent services have been deployed in our products to-date and we are increasingly significant our investment. We also intend to make Adobe Sensei available to our ecosystem of partners, ISVs and developers. Adobe\u2019s success over the decades is in no small part due to the unique culture we have created. In October, we were named a Best Multinational Workplace by the Great Places to Work Institute and this month, we were among the top 10 employers on Glassdoor\u2019s 2017 List of 50 Best Places to Work. We know that a strong workforce is a diverse workforce and we are committed to increasing diversity among our employee base. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including youth coding and media making initiatives to inspire future female technologists. Being a good global citizen is important to our employees, customers and investors. For the first time, Adobe has been selected as a component of the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. For the third year in a row, we received a perfect score on the 2017 Corporate Equality Index report from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In light of these accomplishments, Adobe\u2019s brand momentum has never been stronger and we were honored to be one of the five fastest growing brands on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking. FY \u201816 was a great year for Adobe. We are driving growth in each of the large categories we have created. With a $64 billion total addressable market by 2019, our opportunity has never been greater. Our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant and our strategy, our technology and our people set us up for continued success. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and innovation over the past year. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. Mark? Mark Garrett : Thanks Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2016 results. In FY \u201816, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $5.85 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $2.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.01. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy and noteworthy achievements including growing Digital Media ARR by $1.13 billion during the year to exit fiscal 2016 with $4.01 billion, well ahead of our original target of $3.875 billion. Achieving 38% year-over-year revenue growth in our creative business and exiting the year with $3.54 billion of ARR. Delivering Document Cloud revenue of $765 million and growing ARR to $475 million, both of which reflect progress against our goal of migrating this to a subscription business. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion and 20% annual year-over-year growth. Generating $2.2 billion in operating cash flow during the year, which represents 50% year-over-year growth. Growing deferred revenue to $2 billion and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.4 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $5.4 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time and returning over $1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of FY \u201816, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. Highlights in the quarter included achieving $316 million of net new Digital Media ARR, record Creative revenue of $886 million, which represent 33% year-over-year growth, record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth, strong growth in operating and net income, record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue and 82% of Q4 revenue from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of 316 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.01 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $283 million during Q4 and exited the quarter with $3.54 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals and up-sells. Creative Cloud ARPU grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q4. As we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in November, our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in three key areas growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market, driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock. Some highlights against these goals during the year include 53% year-over-year subscription growth outside the U.S., broadly expanding our base of users by adding more than 1 million Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscribers during the year and growing Adobe Stock revenue by more than 40% year-over-year. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $191 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $475 million, the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Driving this growth was adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record quarterly and annual Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue. Entering the year, we targeted approximately 20% Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth and approximately 30% annual subscription value, or ASV bookings growth. Included in these targets in FY \u201816 was an expectation of approximately $45 million of perpetual revenue. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, we experienced increased demand for on-premise, perpetual licensed solutions by some customers. When we combine ASV bookings for the year with an overachievement in first year value of perpetual contracts, we achieved 30% bookings growth. In Q4, we achieved Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth. With this Q4 performance in FY \u201816, we achieved 20% annual revenue growth. Mobile remains a key driver for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 55% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $4.5 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY \u201816 versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY \u201816. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.3 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.1 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY \u201816 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY \u201815. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 12.5% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted due to tax benefits recognized as the result of the completion of certain income tax audits. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 47 days in the year ago quarter and 45 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.76 billion compared to $4.45 billion at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations was a record $696 million in the quarter. During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buyback stock and reduce our share count. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $331 million. We currently have $500 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015. Now, I will provide our financial outlook. Entering FY \u201817, we have great momentum and continue to see strength across our three cloud businesses. We are excited about our large addressable markets and are uniquely positioned to drive strong top line and bottom line growth. At our November 2 Financial Analyst Meeting, we outlined our long-term strategy and provided long-term growth rates and preliminary FY \u201817 financial targets. We remain confident in our ability to operationally execute against those targets and we are reaffirming our long-term FY \u201815 to FY \u201818 financial targets today. Since the Analyst Meeting, the U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably. Were it not for this currency fluctuation, we will be reaffirming all of the preliminary FY \u201817 targets we provided on November 2. Based on today\u2019s FX rates, we believe our hedging programs will effectively mitigate the impact of these rate changes in Q1 and Q2. But if they persist, current FX rates will affect our ability to achieve the preliminary annual targets due to the impact in the second half of FY \u201817. As a result, we are providing the following FY \u201817 targets. We expect total revenue of approximately $6.95 billion, which factoring in the extra week in FY \u201816, represents approximately 21% year-over-year growth. We continue to target Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year end for the current currency rates. FX rate changes have resulted in a $27 million reduction and an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY \u201816 of $3.99 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated investor datasheet and we continue to expect approximately 25% Digital Media ARR growth, which equates to approximately $1 billion of net new ARR in the year leading to approximately $5 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY \u201817. By quarter, we expect to add approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1, followed by sequential growth of net new ARR in Q2. Then in Q3, we anticipate a seasonally driven sequential decline followed by strong seasonal growth in the fourth quarter to achieve the target for the year. In Digital Marketing, we continue to target Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth of approximately 20% and Adobe Marketing Cloud ASV bookings growth of approximately 30%. Despite the currency impact, we expect to achieve the same FY \u201817 EPS targets we provided on November 2, which are a GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.85 and non-GAAP earnings per share targeted at approximately $3.75. During the year, we expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially each quarter with the largest sequential increase in Q4. Starting with FY \u201817, we are providing quarterly estimates for our most likely results rather than providing targeted ranges due to the increased predictability in our business. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.625 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1. We expect Digital Media Q1 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%. When comparing Q1 FY \u201817 targets, it is helpful to remember that Q1 FY \u201816 had an extra week due to our 52/53-week fiscal year calendar. Factoring the extra week in Q1 FY \u201816, all Q1 FY \u201817 revenue targets represent greater than 20% year-over-year growth. We are targeting our Q1 share count to be approximately 501 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be approximately $13 million on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 15% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.71 and Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.87. Finally, the targets we are providing today do not reflect our planned acquisition of TubeMogul, which we expect to close in December. We plan to issue updated Q1 and annual FY \u201817 financial targets after the acquisition closes. We strongly believe analysts and investors should wait for the close of the acquisition to combine expected results of both companies into an updated model for the coming year. We plan to host a brief call to discuss our strategy and targets that factor in items such as a stub quarter period and accounting implications. In summary, 2016 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader with all three of our cloud solutions and we are executing well against a large and growing addressable market. We are excited about what lies ahead for Adobe and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming year. Mike? Mike Saviage : Thanks Mark.

And we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Ashley : Thanks so much for taking my question. I was going to look at the Creative Media business, you are hitting on all cylinders, I mean the Creative business is strong, you have strengthened education, Document is coming up the curve, I was going to ask about the consumer opportunity there, can you remind us what you have today in consumer and if there is an opportunity to maybe push out and expand how far you are pushing the consumer market in the future? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : I am happy to take that, Steve. You are right and thank you for the acknowledgment of how we are executing against the Creative business. From our point of view, Creative Cloud is very much about not just migrating the core customer segment, but significantly through market expansion, making sure that we are targeting new customers. I would point out two or three different initiatives in that space. The first one clearly is Creative Cloud Photography Plan. As you know, we used to have Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, we are increasingly seeing those consumers adopt Creative Cloud Photography Plan. That continues to do really well in terms of the new customer acquisition that we have. Second category that I will talk about are products like Adobe Spark, we are seeing more and more people who have a story to tell, wanting to use Adobe Spark. And I think in this year, you will see that also start to get integrated and folded into the Creative Cloud much like mobile apps are. They represent a big customer acquisition and adoption and migration opportunity. And the third, I have continued to impress upon education. Education as a segment does really well in Creative Cloud. It\u2019s our next-generation or whether it\u2019s K-12 students or higher ed, as they get exposed to our products, clearly as they enter university or the marketplace, they are using our products, all of which we look at as positive trends for the future. Steve Ashley : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and congrats on a great fiscal year to you all. Shantanu, the last time we met you, it\u2019s right the week before the election and I think there is a lot of folks, wondering what you guys have seen sort of post the results from a macro perspective, I know you guys are sort of operating and serve your own cadence right now through your products and your strategy, but I was just kind of curious, I guess especially in the Digital Marketing world where you guys are obviously talking to a lot of enterprises, is there any change in tone or I guess projected spend or anything like that, I was just curious, if you could give us kind of an update on that? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Kirk, I have seen a rally in the stock market as well, which I think all of us have certainly experienced. But in addition to that, I would just continue to emphasize this notion of how all enterprises are being transformed by what\u2019s happening in digital and the urgency with which they really need to think about technology that they can leverage to become more of an experienced business. I think that continues to be unabated. As you saw, we had a pretty strong Q4 revenue growth over 30% year-over-year in the Digital Marketing business. And I think the opportunity continues to be one that we are excited about not just in the U.S. but internationally as well, so nothing that we have seen either just before the election or post election changes are belief in the large opportunity and our continued execution in that space, Kirk. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned the overage or the higher than expected demand on-premise perpetual in the Digital Marketing side, how much of that happens in the fourth quarter and if you normalize, how would you kind of characterize the bookings and revenue relative to what your expectations were? Shantanu Narayen : Sterling, when we look at the entire year first, let me reflect that we continue to think that we both have the most comprehensive offering. And we are pleased with both the revenue and the bookings growth for the year. I do want to clarify that we think the cloud remains the long-term right offering for our customers, but it is a not. The fact that we have an on-premise solution, we continue to think it\u2019s a competitive advantage. And globally, it\u2019s hard to predict which option customers might prefer on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But I want to reiterate, it\u2019s all from our point of view, good revenue. When we look at the different components of revenue in the Marketing Cloud and you look at subscription, which we think is the healthiest long-term predictor and then you look at perpetual and consulting. The subscription bookings revenue grew 29% year-over-year in FY \u201816, so stronger than the overall 20%. And if you actually go back to what Mark showed at the FA meeting and look at the pie chart, it was exactly in line with what we had predicted for Q4. Relative to the beginning of the year to your question, we certainly over achieved a little bit in perpetual revenue relative to subscription bookings. However, when you normalize that and you take given perpetual revenues a multiyear commitment and look at just the first year component, I think it\u2019s really small. And so relative to overall growth, we feel good about it. The mix was slightly different relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Shantanu, the Asian business has been very strong in the last couple of quarters and I was curious if you could just talk through the fall through that you are seeing there, I know you have also made a bigger push into China where many software companies have not been successful for a lot of reasons, can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing there so far, as you push more aggressively to China? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Brent, I think the two things that we factor in, the first is as we have always stated when we first released Creative Cloud, adoption of Creative Cloud in Asia lagged adoption of Creative Cloud in the U.S. and UK for example, as markets. We now are pleased with the adoption that we are seeing. Australia was always a strong market. Australia continues to be a very strong market. So as it relates to Creative Cloud, as we said even having it in China right now, it was long overdue and the fact that we now have Creative Cloud for teams in China, I think shows our commitment to the Chinese digital economy, which we continue to think is one of the largest, so we feel good about it. The other large opportunity as you know, for us is in the Digital Marketing. And that\u2019s driven by two different phenomena. The first phenomenon is as we increasingly have global agreements with U.S. multinationals, they expect the climate of our solutions, whether it\u2019s in retail, financial services or other places to also be true in China and in India and in Australia and Southeast Asia. So that\u2019s continuing to drive some growth. And then even local companies in all of those markets as they realize mobile in particular there and the digital disruption there. There is excitement around our products. So in Digital Media, it\u2019s all about the adoption of Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing. It\u2019s both about global adoption of our Digital Marketing solutions as well as local companies increasingly recognizing that they have to migrate to digital with mobile being the key driver there. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Thanks. Shantanu, I am wondering if you can talk about the ETLA performance in the fourth quarter and your expectations in terms of ETLA as a part of that $1 billion in incremental ARR next year? And specifically trying to figure out if that \u2013 if the new ETLA business is still growing. I know you are kind of coming up on some renewals and so forth there. I just wanted to get a sense of the trajectory? Shantanu Narayen : Net summary, Walter, very strong quarter in Q4, I think driven by two different phenomena. The first is 3 years ago when we had first introduced the ETLA program for our customers it was really more a reflection of what they were licensing for Creative Suite. So I would call them more of these custom solutions, which reflected what versions of different products that we are using. Starting in fiscal \u201816, we move to a more complete solution which is people were licensing all of the products and the fact that it was integrated. The field organization did a really great job of articulating the benefits of moving to the entire complete solution. And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding that as they are deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete and clearly resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY \u201817. Walter Pritchard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Shankar Iyer : Hi, this is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have a question on your overall margin profile as you look into the next few years. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about the increased investment that you are going to make in Sensei and Adobe Spark and whole lot of other products. But if you also look at the large down potential and the potential that as your partnership that can drive your Marketing Cloud and also your margins down over time, what\u2019s the leverage in the model and can we expect an operating margin to be in the 40% to 45% range there by the end of the decade? Mark Garrett : Hey, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. I am glad I got one. I was getting ready to go home. So first, we are extremely proud of our ability to be one of the only, if not the only cloud companies that can grow significantly on top line and bottom line and the fact that we got to $3.01 this year and being well ahead of our guidance is something that we are very proud of. We do have room in the model to invest in the businesses that we need to invest in. And if you look at next year\u2019s guidance and you do the P&L based on what we just told you, you are going to come up with operating margins that are increasing by around a point from this year, so from 34% to 35%. We gave you guidance for \u201818. You can see that margins continue to improve from there. I am not going to say at this point that we are going to go back to 40%, which is where we were in 2008, but you can see that there is still tremendous leverage in our model and we feel very good about that. Shankar Iyer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stan Zlotsky : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith Weiss. So, I actually wanted to ask a question on the Document Services business, the ARR that you added in Q4 was very impressive. You guys had mentioned in your prepared remarks, the fastest and the most that you have added all year, so what was the driver of that outperformance in the quarter? And more broadly, as you moved the Document Services business to subscription, how are you thinking about that versus the kind of strategy that you adopted moving to Creative Cloud business to subscription as well? So, thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I think two comments come to mind there. First is it was a very strong year. And if you look at just the Document Cloud segment, ARR, it probably under-represents the momentum that we have with the Document Cloud and Acrobat businesses because as you know, significant number of people also use Acrobat DC when they are using the Creative Cloud. So big picture, it was driven by both the adobe.com where we have very dramatically made the switch from people buying the perpetual product to people buying the subscription offering as well as enterprise and the adoption of new services like Adobe Sign. And so when you look at the ARR, I think the ARR growth was over 20% for the year. And when you think about the unit growth that we are seeing in it, it just reflects that PDF as a standard has continued to be the win, which people share it. For those on the call, I would also really recommend, you try out our new mobile apps and the scan functionality where it\u2019s I would say one of the easiest ways for people to create a PDF out of any picture that they might have using the camera. So continued innovation I think in that space just reflects as paper to digital is this macro trend. We are very uniquely positioned to capitalize on that. Mike Saviage : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Mark, don\u2019t go home yet. I have a question for you. So the question concerns cash flow. Mike Saviage : Jay, it\u2019s Mike. I am glad you are in our call, not the Oracle call like others. Thanks. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay, you are very welcome. So, you just grew your GAAP operating cash flow by about $800 million in \u201816. And the question is how are you thinking about cash flow in \u201817? Do you think you could achieve a similar increment even considering all the investments of course that you are talking about, particularly in terms of geographic expansion in Asia, and of course, R&D? Mark Garrett : Yes, Jay. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we had extremely strong cash flow on the year, really good cash flow in Q4. As I look into next year, I expect very strong cash flow again. I will say, I am glad you asked the question, I will say just so everybody understands cash flow from Q4 to Q1 always naturally declines. We have a lot of payments that get made in the first quarter for commissions and bonuses and things like that. So you should expect a pretty substantial decline just sequentially, but I do fully expect another strong cash flow year next year. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, could you talk about perhaps the non net income components of that? I mean, how are you thinking in terms, for example, of deferred in particular? Mark Garrett : Again, I expect deferred to continue to increase as we drive bookings faster than we are driving revenue. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay, good. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks for taking my question. Mark, when we look at ARR, big picture I guess is that we added about $1.1 billion this year, \u201816, about the same level as fiscal \u201815. We are talking about $1 billion in \u201817, so there is really very little decay in the rate of new ARR being added. And I know you are not yet talking about the year even further out. But how should we be thinking about that kind of pace of moderation shall we see in that ARR increment? And the question really goes to this sort of notion of where we are both in terms of new user adds and base transition? I am just curious to just your high level thoughts. Mark Garrett : I mean, we have \u2013 like you say, we have been consistently adding around $1 billion. And we feel very good about that number. We continue to attract new users. We continue to drive higher ARPU. We are getting people off of promotions on to full price. We are adding value-add services like Stock, all of those things help drive that ARR number. Retention helps drive that ARR number. So, there is lots of different ways that we can do that. And as you know, we are addressing a much bigger TAM than we were addressing a number of years ago. So all of that plays into our ability, we believe to continue to drive that kind of net new ARR. Ross MacMillan : And then just one other just follow-up quickly, just on the seasonality of ARR this year, I think this will be the first year where we actually see decline in fiscal Q3. Is that just the base effect like the numbers are getting bigger, are there any particular things this year we should think about as we transition Q2 to Q3 that maybe we didn\u2019t see last year or the prior year? Mark Garrett : Yes, there is nothing new. We are just trying to make sure we incorporate seasonality. I mean Q3 is a slower seasonal quarter for buying for us and we just want to factor that in. Ross MacMillan : Okay, thanks again. Congratulations. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Mark Garrett : Thanks Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Wieser : Thanks for taking the question. Following the TubeMogul acquisition, I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about any other aspects of that type you think you maybe emphasizing investment in whether internal or external and may be relatedly, Tube made a pretty strong focus as an independent company on the demand side orientation, given the business you have on Primetime, I am wondering if you expect it will have some supply side orientation as well? Shantanu Narayen : I think at this point Brian, what I would say is we are excited about the TubeMogul acquisition. And we are excited about the long-term video as well as data opportunity. Just to highlight from our point of view, TubeMogul enables \u2013 it\u2019s more heft in our Ad Tech platform, which is a key part of as we are targeting the CMO or the Chief Revenue Officer or the Chief Digital Officer at an enterprise and adding to what we have in display, search and social, so that\u2019s good. To your point, we do have now more end-to-end capabilities all the way from video delivery to monetization for our publisher as well as our advertiser customers. And I think what\u2019s perhaps more strategic, the integration between their DSV offering and our DMV, we are seeing more and more people wanting to integrate with our industry leading audience manager DMV. That has really become in fiscal \u201816, a driver of the adoption of the platform. And so I think our goal when this closes, will be to share more about what we are planning to do strategically. But big picture, it just enables us to be more of a trusted platform for the Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Revenue Officers. And to enable both personalization in terms of delivery and better segmentation in deriving value from all of the data that they have. So excited about it and we will say more about that after we close. Brian Wieser : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jack Cogan : Thanks. It\u2019s Jack Cogan filling in for Heather. So you mentioned Creative Cloud ARPU continues to grow sequentially, I just wondered if you could rank order the drivers behind this, I know you mentioned that users on promo pricing, renewing at full price, new offerings like Stock, maybe if you can just put into context what sort of the biggest drivers are and how long we should expect a tailwind like the promo users renewing at full price to exist? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : All of them are clearly driving the transition of the business to ARR. I would say people are migrating off of the promotional pricing. And as long as they continue to retain to full price, that\u2019s certainly one of the large drivers. I think we talked about enterprise as one of the large drivers. The mix as it moves from single app to complete is another driver. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. And that\u2019s why our strategy of getting more and more people on to the platform, we actually did fewer promotions in the quarter, they were more targeted promotions, so they were successful. And that gives you some color, I think. Stock and Sign are starting to become reasonable ARR and we expect continued growth in both those areas as well. Jack Cogan : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just building on the last one, so some recent survey work that we have done suggest that the majority of enterprises have yet to upgrade to Windows 10, but they plan to do so within the next 12 months to 24 months, so I am just curious, how much of the as yet converted suite days is running Windows versus iOS and do you expect because I didn\u2019t hear you mention in the last answer that those Windows 10 upgrades would drive some of the ARR growth in fiscal \u201817? Shantanu Narayen : I think big picture, what I would say in that particular space is whenever there are hardware transitions or software transitions with significant new functionality, they always represent opportunities for us to accelerate migration. When people look at Windows in particular, I think what\u2019s most exciting to them is in addition to the incredible hardware that Microsoft and other companies are doing, the fact that it\u2019s touch-enabled, has really made a very significant difference. Video capabilities also in that platform are just so powerful that there is clearly migration from the high end proprietary video systems into PCs, so that hopefully gives you some color. I think Apple continues to innovate. But with Windows 10, as people migrate, it always is an opportunity for us to work with that transition team, to make sure that they also migrate to Creative Cloud. Michael Nemeroff : Thank you very much. Mike Saviage : Operator, we are coming up on to the top of the hour. Why don\u2019t we take one more question? Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in. I apologize if my question has already been asked. I jumped on late. But could you give us any idea, you gave that 1 million use of Photoshop subs that you added on your photography package, maybe any color on just what the full year trend looks like for full Creative Cloud adds and if there is any change in either the retention rate that you saw there or the add-on rates for the Adobe Stock package that the Creative Cloud packs that included Stock? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I think with respect to both the addition of subs as well as the migration of the business, all of them just continue to be really powerful. If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the core Creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes \u2013 if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that. And when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it\u2019s also higher than 80%. So as we look at retention, it\u2019s actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business. And we are pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, it just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform. Shantanu Narayen : And since that was the last question, for me my summary remarks would be while FY \u201816 was clearly a great year, in many ways I am even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we have created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the two big areas of focus for Adobe empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete, it just represent massive opportunities in our content and data platform really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we are innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth. I would like to thank our customers, partners, employees and investors and wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you for joining us. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call. Thanks everyone.",

I would like to welcome you to Adobe Systems\u2019 First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Saviage : Good afternoon. And thank you for, joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe\u2019s President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen and Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO. In the call today, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2017 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release, which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago. We\u2019ve also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, financial targets and an updated investor datasheet on adobe.com. If you would like a copy of these documents, you can go to Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations page and find them listed under Quick Links. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue and operating model targets and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, March 16, 2017, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the forward-looking statements disclosure in the earnings press release we issued today, as well as Adobe\u2019s SEC filings. During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks Mike and good afternoon. Adobe had an outstanding first quarter with record revenue of $1.68 billion and record profit, GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $0.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.94. We continue to execute well against our strategy, and are driving momentum across our entire business. Digital transformation has created a tailwind for Adobe among a diverse spectrum of customers in a broad number of industries, from students, to designers, to the public sector, and the world\u2019s largest brands. Once the domain solely of professionals, today everyone is a creator; from the teenager doing a school photography project; to the small business owner, prototyping her Web site to the film-maker; working on his first documentary; and designers become a critical element in the fabric of our lives. Design is the starting point for every connection we make, and great design requires innovative technology. At the same time, massive amounts of data, the proliferation of devices and skyrocketing customer expectations, are forcing enterprises to completely rethink their business strategies. To forge stronger customer connections that lead to brand loyalty and growth, forward-looking enterprises are reimagining the experience they provide to their customers. At Adobe, we\u2019ve have always known that a great customer experience is the differentiator that separates market leaders from the pack. At the center of every great experience are customer intelligence and amazing design, and these are Adobe\u2019s core competencies. Our mission to help our customers design and deliver great experiences has never been more relevant as is reflected in our outstanding Q1 results. In Digital Media, we continue to be the undisputed leader in helping customers inject creativity into their jobs, schoolwork and their daily lives. We achieved a record $1.14 billion in Digital Media revenue in Q1 and exited the quarter with over $4.25 billion of Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q1 was $265 million, and was driven by continued strength in our Creative Cloud business. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creatives the world over and we continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments, and adding value through new services. In Q1, Creative Cloud ARR growth was driven by strong performance in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud teams offering and international growth, as well as strong retention of existing subscribers. This year, two of Adobe\u2019s iconic creative apps are celebrating anniversaries. In March, Adobe Illustrator, the industry-standard vector graphics app that lets you create logos, typography, and complex illustrations for print, web, video, and mobile, celebrated its 30th anniversary. 30 years of Illustrator projects are visible everywhere across the world, from billboards on U.S. highways to magazine covers in Tokyo. More than 180 million graphics are created monthly with Illustrator. Earlier this week, we celebrated Premiere Pro\u2019s 25th anniversary. Premiere Pro is the world\u2019s leading video production solution, and continues to grow its footprint across every video segment. Premiere Pro was the official editing tool of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in January. Premiere Pro\u2019s virtual reality workflows are seeing strong adoption with the majority of the films in the Virtual Reality category at Sundance having used it in their creative process. As part of our year-long celebration, we are partnering with the Grammy-award-winning band, Imagine Dragons, which just released the music video for its newest song, Believer. Earlier this week, we announced that creatives in 27 countries will have the chance to take the raw video footage from the original video and cut their own version. Our Adobe Stock service business continues to accelerate. In the past year, we have grown Adobe Stock assets to more than 60 million and in January, we announced a partnership with 500px, a global online photography community, which expands Adobe Stock\u2019s Premium collection. The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud enables businesses to reinvent inefficient paper-based processes. In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $196 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $493 million. Acrobat units across Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud combined, again grew double-digits year-over-year. This achievement was driven by new customer acquisition with our subscription model and the funnel of users created by the broad use of PDF and the proliferation of Adobe Reader across mobile devices. In February, in conjunction with the Cloud Signature Consortium, we unveiled the world\u2019s first open cloud-based digital signature standard, available in any browser and on any device. We announced new functionality in Adobe Sign that enables users to create end-to-end business workflows, such as advanced document routing, online collaboration and Microsoft SharePoint integration. Adobe Sign now includes mobile tools, powered by Adobe Sensei, for scanning, reading, routing and signing documents. Deep intelligence fueled by trillions of data transactions are the foundation of our Digital Marketing business. We drove a record $477 million in Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue in Q1, which was 26% year-over-year revenue growth. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to lead the category and be the most comprehensive offering for global brands, government agencies and institutions that need to deliver personal, consistent and relevant experiences to their audiences everywhere and every time they connect with them. Adobe Marketing Cloud features best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaign management and media optimization. We managed more than 100 trillion data transactions on behalf of our customers over the past year across our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. In February, Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2017 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs research report. For the third consecutive time, Adobe was ranked the highest in completeness of vision axis among the 22 companies that were evaluated. Also in Q1, Adobe was recognized as a Leader in the Forrester Wave report on Web Content Management systems, receiving the highest score. Thanks to the completeness of our offering, our continued innovation and our growing partner network, we continue to see strong market momentum, with major customer wins this quarter at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Mercy Health, Hutchison UK, Autotrader.com, Computer Sciences Corporation, ADT and the University of Michigan. In December, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a leader in demand-side video advertising. We achieved strong Q1 TubeMogul revenue, and we are hard at work integrating TubeMogul with our current Adobe Media Optimizer solution. As a combined advertising solution, we will enable Adobe\u2019s customers to optimize their video, search and display advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Next week in Las Vegas, we will conduct our largest Adobe Summit ever, with more than 12,000 attendees, including more than 1,000 of our global partners. Executives from top brands, including the NBA, National Geographic, T-Mobile and Facebook will take the stage and we\u2019ll give an update on our strategic partnership with Microsoft. We\u2019re continuing to aggressively invest in the Adobe Cloud Platform and Adobe Sensei, our unified artificial intelligence and machine learning framework and intelligent services. Our trillions of content and data assets, along with our deep category expertise in the markets we serve, give Adobe Sensei a unique ability to help customers tackle complex experience challenges. We plan to unveil new Adobe Sensei capabilities at Adobe Summit. We will also provide an update on our adobe.io capabilities for partners, ISVs and developers, who can utilize our open platform to develop their own applications. This level of innovation can only come from talented, creative and dedicated employees. Last month, we held our internal Tech Summit where we announced our commitment to train every one of our technical employees in artificial intelligence fundamentals. We also demonstrated the incredible work happening across the Company. Last month, we were included on Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies list, and last week we were honored to be named to the Fortune Best Places to Work list for the 17th year. Adobe would not be the Company it is today without our rich diversity of employees, and that continued diversity is vital to our future. I would like to thank all our employees for the role they play in our continued success. To create an exceptional customer experience, you need a potent combination of deep intelligence and amazing design. These are our unique capabilities, and our opportunity has never been greater. We have the technology leadership, partner ecosystem and customer relationships, to fundamentally reshape how individuals, brands and institutions transform themselves in the 21st century. Q1 was a great start to what we believe will be another great year for Adobe. Mark? Mark Garrett : Thanks, Shantanu. In the first quarter of FY17, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.68 billion dollars, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.94. When comparing Q1 FY17 and Q1 FY16 results, it is helpful to remember that our year-ago quarter had an extra week due to Adobe\u2019s 52/53 week fiscal year calendar. Factoring in the extra week a year ago in Q1 FY16, year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter was greater than 25%. Highlights in Q1 included; achieving $265 million of net new Digital Media ARR; record Creative revenue of $942 million; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $477 million; strong year-over-year growth in operating income and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 85% of Q1 revenue came from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 22% year-over-year. The addition of $265 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.25 billion exiting Q1. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $942 million, which represents 29% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $244 million during Q1 and exited the quarter with $3.76 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter. Q1 ARR performance was driven by strong subscription adoption and retention; strength with Creative Cloud for teams, particularly in Europe; and continued growth with Adobe Stock. Creative Cloud ARPU was either steady or grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q1. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $196 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $493 million exiting Q1. Driving this growth was continued adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services, such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefitting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $477 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. TubeMogul added $32 million of revenue in Q1, which was $13 million above our target of $19 million. Approximately $10 million of the upside was due to some of the TubeMogul revenue being recognized on a gross basis in the quarter rather than on a net basis. Excluding the extra $10 million of gross TubeMogul revenue, year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth was 24%, which was in line with our Q1 target. As we discussed on our TubeMogul conference call in January, we intend to recognize TubeMogul revenue on a net basis. Due to some ongoing contractual commitments, there will be some small gross revenue amounts through year-end. Mobile remains a key driver for our Marketing Cloud business; mobile data transactions grew to 56% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. Total data transactions in Q1 grew to $41.3 trillion, and in the trailing four quarters, data transactions with our Marketing Cloud solutions exceeded $100 trillion. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.8 million. We had $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY17 versus $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY16; thus a net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.7 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $11.9 million. We had $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY17 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY16; thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $3.2 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q1, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 13.5% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The Q1 GAAP rate was slightly lower than targeted due to Adobe\u2019s adoption of the new accounting standard affecting taxes related to equity-based costs. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 42 days in the year-ago quarter, and 47 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.06 billion, up 28% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.65 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $730 million in the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $238 million. We have $300 million remaining under the January 2015 authority, after which we will begin repurchases under our new $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017. Now, I will provide our financial outlook. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.73 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $290 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q2, which represents both sequential and year-over-year growth in net new ARR achievement. We expect Digital Media Q2 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 24%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 26%. We are targeting our Q2 share count to be approximately 499 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be approximately $15 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.66, and Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.94. In summary, Q1 was an amazing start to what we believe will be another record year for Adobe. We remain bullish about our prospects for the rest of the year and beyond. Mike?

And we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Kash Rangan : Mark, I hate to bring this up but, AC 606, a lot of companies are starting to give it a little thought. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us your perspective on how it would that change the revenue recognition in the Marketing Cloud and also the expense recognition? Thank you so much. Mark Garrett : You\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve written some disclosure in our SEC filings on this. The standard, as you know, is effective for Adobe in the first quarter of 2019. So, we have quite a bit of time until it goes effective for us. We don\u2019t plan early adopt that we haven\u2019t selected a transition method yet. We\u2019re clearly evaluating the effect and the standard, and what it will do some revenue for us. We expect that revenue related to professional services in our cloud offerings, or enterprise individual and teams, would remain substantially unchanged. But again, we\u2019re in the process of evaluating that. And as it relates to, what we would call more of an ETLA, a term-based license where software and maintenance are bundle together. Those are the arrangements that will like have some impact from the standard. But again, we have until 2019 to work through that. And as you know, we\u2019re now selling the full could solution to the enterprise. So, that\u2019s where we stand as of today. But clearly, more work to do and lots more time. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : On the Creative Cloud side, the growth of momentum continues to be strong. But can you give us a little more at least qualitative color as to the drivers of it. How much of it might be something you\u2019re doing on price and managing promotions? How much are you adding new customers, and how much of it is deeper penetration into existing customers? Shantanu Narayen : Sterling, I\u2019ll take that question. I think we\u2019re continuing to seeing good strength across each of the groups, particularly as it relates to Q1. We saw some good SMB, small and medium business, demand that continues to do well. As you know that\u2019s the team offering, which is a higher price point offering. And especially in EMEA, we had a good quarter. I would say, Acrobat, had strong unit quarter that\u2019s reflected both in Creative Cloud, as well as in Document Cloud. In addition to that, we continue to see good progress on retention. And so, as people migrate off the performance or the promotional pricing and get on to the full plans; and then new unit adoption, as well for the new offerings, especially the photography solution; and international continue to do well. And also, there is no question that we\u2019re combating piracy as the ability to get boxes in most countries diminishes. So, I would say across the spectrum of the different offerings. And from an ARPU point of view, as well Sterling, I think Mark mentioned that in his prepared remarks. So, that continues to be strong as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin : Shantanu, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question for you about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the growth of front-office budgets. And maybe what change you\u2019ve observed this year, or at least start this year from, maybe the last year and the year before that. And how is that driving a change in kind of -- is that accelerating your visionary way because it seems like the shift of the digital transformation budget to the importance of the CEO level has really accelerated; so just curious to get your thoughts on that. Shantanu Narayen : You\u2019re absolutely right. I think big picture, the conversations that we\u2019re having day-in and day-out, our enterprises recognizing that digital is transforming their agenda. And then they decompose that into what are the key things that they have to do in order to use that as an opportunity rather than a challenge. And clearly from our point of view, the engagement that they do with their customers or how they deliver their experience continues to be we think one of the key ways in which people make digital tailwind rather than a headwind. And we're part of all of those conversations. I think if you talk to also the consulting companies, they're being brought in to aspirationally help all of these companies, rethink their business model processes and people. But top of the agenda for even the CEO and the CIO and CFO, is what are we doing with respect to delivering a better engaging customer experience? Next week at Summit, we'll talk a little bit more about how that expands on our vision or what we can do, and what people are asking to step up and do. But I think the way it manifests itself in the business is people are saying if it's just so key to my future, I want to bet and standardize on companies that have a comprehensive platform, which is why we're always pleased to see us being rated as the number one platform that exists for this kind of technology solution. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : I heard your response Shantanu on the question around demand drivers. I'm wondering if you can just talk about ARPU, specifically as a driver in fiscal '17 and beyond. In addition to like your commentary around stock suggested that you were seeing more of an uptick there, and you have things like Sensei and so forth that are incremental to the product that you're delivering in the market. Can you help us understand how much more of a driver ARPU is versus what it\u2019s been over the last several years in this transition? Shantanu Narayen : Walter, maybe I'll give you some color which we didn't touch on as another demand driver, which is in the enterprise. As you know, we are coming up on the anniversary of lot of the three year ETLAs. And the first time when we did the three year ETLAs Creative Cloud was relatively new. And so, what we were doing was in-effect providing them with subscription model that mirrored their, what I would call custom way of buying CS in the past. As those are all rolling off the first three year milestone, we are clearly selling them both on the CC complete solution as well as on services. So the number of people who are contracting for services right now, people have to get an exception to not contract for services. And so that clearly represents an increase in ARPU as well. To your point, stock had a good quarter. We continued to see growth, both in terms of the demand, as well as in terms of the inventory. Sign had a good quarter, all of them are adding. And I think what's on your minds as well as investors is, hey, is there leverage and room for price increase as we still think we're in new customer acquisition growth, we're helping people deliver value. And so, that's really what's still driving a lot of the upside in ARR with the potential to look at optimizing further out as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Shantanu, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the success of Creative Cloud impact the adoption of the marketing suites. And I know that's been one of your goals that one could help drive the other. But have you seen any change in the ability for you being the industry standard for Creative, start to impact the Marketing Cloud side of the business? And has the messaging with customer and the receptivity started to -- have you seen any noticeable difference over the last 12 months? Shantanu Narayen : It's a really good question Heather, and there's no question actually in our mind that where Creative Cloud was first the door opener for us to have conversations with the enterprise. There is an increased expectation from customers that the content lifecycle that we talk about, namely, the ability for them to accelerate how they deliver campaigns or how they personalize the experience that they wish to deliver across all of these different channels, is predicated on making sure that that content from, content all the way from creation through asset management and all the way out to delivery, is more seamless than it\u2019s ever been. So, I would say three years ago, two years ago, we were talking about that as one of the benefits. I would say today every conversation with the enterprises they see that as a differentiator for us. And the expectation is that\u2019s how they will accelerate both the campaigns and how they will ensure personalize delivery. So, we\u2019re seeing that whether it's in financial services, whether we are seeing retail, travel hospitality, automotive, it\u2019s a key part of our differentiator and one that we will continue to innovate in. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Markets. Your line is now open. Ross MacMillan : Mark, I didn\u2019t see any commentary on fiscal \u201917 guidance. I\u2019m just curious, I guess specifically, about how you are thinking on the 1 billion ARR target, given the strength in Q1 and your guide for Q2, which is certainly above our number. Mark Garrett : Clearly, from our perspective, the business is performing exceptionally well. We had a great Q1 across all the key metrics. And to your point, we provided we think are strong Q2 targets. If you remember back, we\u2019ve guided FY \u201917 the first time at Analyst Day back in November of last year. We updated it again in December with Q4 earnings. We updated it once more in January for TubeMogul. And we just don\u2019t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance so frequently. So, we\u2019re very happy with the first quarter. We\u2019re very pleased with what we were able to do from a guidance perspective on Q2. Clearly, we\u2019ve got momentum. We just don\u2019t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance that frequently. Ross MacMillan : And then one just quick one, just looking at Q2 guide it implies, at least I think in our model that operating margins maybe are down a little bit sequentially. And I know we have a little bit of an extra three weeks, I think from Tube. But are there any other factors for us to think about in terms of OpEx this quarter, Summit or anything else that\u2019s unusual? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Our salary increases kick-in for the Company and that has an effect on Q2 from a cost perspective. You\u2019ll see that every year. We continue to hire and invest in the Company. Again, we feel great about our performance in Q1 and our ability to drive leverage in the model going forward. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : On the Marketing Cloud side, you talked about and there\u2019s Gartner Magic Quadrant that came out during the quarter, and I think Forrester Wave. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment? Are any of the surround guys or any of the big guys like the Microsoft or the Oracle of the world getting more competitive in that Marketing Cloud field for you guys? And then on as a follow up, any initial gains or any initial benefits you guys are seeing from Microsoft relationship in FY17? Shantanu Narayen : Let me take the second first, which is, you\u2019ll get an update as well as Summit. So we\u2019re hoping a lot of will be at Summit. I think you\u2019ll be pleased with how quickly we\u2019ve been able to integrate the products. And from my point of view, the benefit with the Microsoft relationship is really customer driven. Customers are asking for integration with Azure, Power BI, as well as Dynamics. And I think the team has done a great job. But next week we\u2019ll give you a little bit of an update on that. On the first question, as it relates to the competitors, I think we have talked about. This is a $40 billion TAM. Clearly, there are other players that you are alluding to that that are also seeing this as a market opportunity. But our track record and our winning percentage record in the areas that we\u2019re strong continues to be excellent. I think we have a differentiated solution. And I think our vision of where we want to take this and how we want to continue to expand it, I think it still makes us a unique leader. But certainly, there are other players in this market as well Keith. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Question for Mark, as you know, I am particularly interested in your gross margin structure and the various components of that. You had a couple of dichotomous outcomes in Q1 expect to cost revenue the graphic you addressed. You had an usually large sequential increase in digital marketing; cost of revenue were before you\u2019ve been seeing some margin expansion there. Was that tied somehow to the TubeMogul mobile revenue upside given the way they were recording and their cost of revenues versus their gross revenue recognition? On the other hand you had a pretty material and sequential decrease in digital media COGS. Is that anomalous, or is that something that you think is sustainable? And lastly, you had a pretty significant increase in services cost of revenue, your revenues were down materially from Q4 to Q1, so lots of moving pieces in COGS. But maybe you can address those? Mark Garrett : Yes, I mean the still biggest thing probably worth mentioning Jay, is you\u2019re exactly right. If you look at Digital Marketing this quarter that $10 million of gross revenue recognition would flow right into COGS. So you have $10 million of revenue and $10 million of COGS. If you back that $10 million of COGS out of digital marketing, the gross profit would be exactly the same as last quarter. So, there is really no change to Digital Marketing cost of service, it's been pretty consistent. And you are exactly right it's really driven by Tube. On the Digital Media side, I think what you saw this quarter is some of the upside that you see in our revenue relative to our guidance was from a bit more perpetual product, especially on the Acrobat side. And that comes, as you know, a very, very high gross margin. So, that\u2019s why you would have seen Digital Media gross margin better this quarter. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay. And the services piece? Mark Garrett : I can't remember what your question was. It was back to\u2026 Jay Vleeschhouwer : So, services revenue were down sequentially, but you had a pretty meaningful sequential increase in services COGS? Mark Garrett : The revenues down sequentially mainly because in Q4 it's a very difficult time for the teams to deliver services with holidays and year-end. So, typically Q1 revenue is going to be a little bit lighter on the services side, and the cost of services doesn't change that much. So, that's why you see a little bit less on the gross margin side. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Samad Samana : So, we saw that in early February, the Company pushed-out price increases in some international, or outside of the U.S., in some countries where FX is a particular headwind. I'm curious if you learned any lessons from those price increases, and whether it shows you what the appetite for customers is. Is this to accept those, and how it impacts your thought on raising prices in the U.S.? Mark Garrett : We did push-out some price increases around the world in various markets, because of FX to stay FX neutral, if you will. And the good news there is we really did not see an impact to ARR. So, that does give us confidence that down the road we're able to tweak pricing a bit. We're not taking advantage of that yet other than FX, but that was a very good sign. Samad Samana : Maybe just a quick follow up. Could you give us what the Marketing Cloud revenue growth would have grown year-over-year, excluding the extra week, and the revenue contribution from TubeMogul, just for an apples-to-apples compare? Thanks. Mark Garrett : With the week, I'm going to have to get back to you. The TubeMogul gross, you just take out $10 million and instead of $26 million it would have been $24 million. But I don't have the week broken out between the different businesses. It was about $75 million, we said a year ago, but we didn't split it between businesses. I don't think it's very material for Digital Marketing, to be honest with you. It's more material on the media side, that extra week; because you think about it as recognizing revenue from subscribers, it doesn't change that much from a enterprise perspective. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Derrick Wood : Shantanu, you mentioned the Adobe Stock has $60 million assets now, and I don't really know how this compares to other offerings. But I know you guys announced partnership with [technical difficulty] a few months ago. And I guess I am just curious how impactful it is when you onboard new content into the service. So, specifically, do you think these partnerships move the needle and increase the attach rate, or getting people to subscribe to the monthly version? And would you say growth is tied to bringing more content onboard, or are you really at that full scale? Shantanu Narayen : The way I would answer that is strategically as we look at that business, there're three things that we think we continue have to execute on to ensure that we capitalize on the opportunity that we've talked about; the first is integration within the products. I think you've seen us make some good integration with products like PhotoShop. So the ability for people to contribute and to acquire assets is built into the product. So, that's one area that we're continuing to make sure we invest. The second one that tends to be a way in which you compete effectively is the inventory. So, I think having the inventory and having the inventory across different kinds of assets, including premium and including partnerships with some of the people that you're talking about, that also helps us ensure that we're competitively, either ahead of the market or at least in line with the market. And the third one that we think about when we think about stock is how good is our technology to find the right asset, based on the intelligence that we can provide. And that's where I think you know we will demonstrate superior advantage to anything else that\u2019s out there. Because our ability to understand these assets and, irrespective of what keyword is being used to search for a particular asset return the right. So in other words search relevance and search is going to be a key part of it. Now, I think in all three of those, we\u2019re continuing to make great progress. And I think at MAX, we showed you a lot of really cool ways in which we will make that more relevant. It\u2019s an area we\u2019ll continue to invest in. So, we feel good about it Derrick. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Richard Davis : Just real quick question. So it seems to me and you\u2019ve touched on this. So you\u2019re becoming a lot more critical to your customers, and typically that means larger deals. But larger deals have a different selling motion and cadence, and staff dynamics. Could you just talk a little bit about how -- what you believe you need to do to evolve and position yourself to move to larger deals? I mean you obviously keep up with the small stuff too. But that would be helpful. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : You\u2019re absolutely right. The good news is we\u2019re absolutely mission-critical to our customers, so the level engagement that we have with these enterprises is at multiple levels, all the way from the C-Suite to all the practitioners who are using our products. I would say actually on the field side and on the partner side, we have evolved that over many areas. Where we think we have a world class organization that does that. Because it\u2019s not just what you do internally, it's ensuring that the thousand partners that I talked about who are also partners to the companies that we\u2019re working with are evangelizing and are promoting our products, and are educated on our projects. So I actually feel good about all of those. In some cases, you have those deals, the larger the size the time taken can increase, but that\u2019s why we want to build a healthy pipeline and continue to execute against that. So, I feel very good about it, and that is without a doubt one of the areas where we\u2019ve invested in over the last few years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Brent Bracelin : Mark, I wanted to go back to the operating margin, non-GAAP operating margins of 36% this quarter. Should be above where we had thought they\u2019d be. If you go back to last two years, Q1 was the low-point. And then you saw basically improvement throughout the year. Is there something different about this year, or different that we should think about, relative to additional expenses or hiring plans that might be a different sequence? And then as a follow-up to that, if I go back and look at where op margins could go, I think the peak was back in 2008 at 40%. How you\u2019re thinking about the op margin trajectory longer term? Mark Garrett : There is no difference on the cost side than what you\u2019ve seen in prior years. As I just mentioned a few minutes ago, on the revenue side in Q1, we did have a little bit of the upside coming from some increased perpetual revenue on Acrobat side of the business, on the toolbar distribution deal. And that revenue upside can typically drop-down to the bottom-line pretty readily. So, that\u2019s where you saw a bit more margin than we had guided in the first quarter. Expense wise is no real change to our trajectory, and there hasn\u2019t been for quite some time. In terms of long-term margins, the best I can do for you right now is few things; one is we\u2019re very focused on margin; you see that in any given quarter; you see that when we over-achieve on revenue like we did Q1. And we gave a three year model a little while back that shows what margins could look like through, at least '18. And if you looked at that model and looked at it back when we gave it to you, you would see margins up above 35%. Beyond that, we will see. Mike Saviage : Operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions please. Operator : Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Pat Walravens : Shantanu, probably for you, what key points would you make to investors at this point about your activation strategy going forward, and what you\u2019re looking for? Shantanu Narayen : We actually feel really good about all of the technology that we have, and we were always on the lookout for small innovative companies. And I think both Mark and I have always talked about; we look for is it bringing our strategic advantage; what is the culture of the companies that we\u2019re looking at, because we are very, very thoughtful about making sure that we continue to expand on the vision of what people want; and the third is financially whether it make sense. And so we have done some when they make sense. But we feel really good about the core value that we have, and we\u2019ll continue to be on the lookout for things that meet our criteria in all of those; namely, continuing to expand strategically what we can do; ensuring that the culture fit is right, and financially making sense. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne : Shantanu, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how the upsell stock in the Marketing Cloud customers is going relative to the Creative Cloud. As that would seem to be somewhat of untapped opportunities that we don\u2019t talk perhaps as much about? Just kind of curious how should we think about that as another step forward in terms of stock? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : I think, Kirk, from my point of view as we are going more and more to these large enterprises with solutions across the Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and the Marketing Cloud, we have a quarter back model, and the named account model with this quarter back is that they are clearly bringing to bear opportunities like the ones that you are talking about. If you are in there primarily with Marketing Cloud ensuring that we sell more solutions, sale Stock, sale Sign and continue to drive the CC DLAs. And so, I think the model that we have in the field is really one of how do we comprehensively to these larger accounts ensure that they are getting the benefit of the breadth of our solutions. And to your point, in CC when we think about the CC enterprise opportunity and the conversation that we are having with those customers, we\u2019re very much moving them from custom to complete and we are moving them from complete to complete plus services. And the service that is top of mind for as Stock. So, a good question and it's clearly one of the areas that we are focused on. And since that was the last question, I think in summary, we were really pleased with the strong start to Q1. It was an outstanding quarter, and I think the Q2 targets that we gave reflect the continued momentum in the business. But in addition to the great quarterly performance, we\u2019re really excited about the long-term opportunities that we\u2019ve outlined, namely the ability to empower people to create the things they want to create and to enable businesses to transform themselves. And I think we\u2019ll continue to be unique in that, we\u2019re one of the only companies that delivering great top line growth and bottom line earnings. We're looking forward to next week's Adobe Summit, it's our largest ever. We really hope you'll join us to hear about our vision for the future, and demonstrate both product and partner progress against that vision. But thank you for joining us today. Operator : And this concludes our call. Thanks everyone.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. Adobe had a record quarter with revenue of $1.77 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q2, was $0.75 cents and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.02. We are executing on our strategy of enabling our customers to design and deliver best-in-class digital experiences. Digital transformation continues to be the burning agenda for creative professionals, enterprises, governments and educational institutions. Adobe is now the go-to company for creating world-class digital customer journeys from design to delivery to measurement and monetization. At the core of our ability to drive transformative change across all customer segments is Adobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which is being deployed across all Adobe solutions to solve our customers\u2019 greatest experience challenges. Central to our strong performance this quarter was record revenue in our Digital Media business. We achieved $1.21 billion in Digital Media revenue in Q2, a 29% increase year-over-year. We exited the quarter with over $4.56 billion of Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q2 was $312 million and was driven by continued strength in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for millions of creative people globally and we continue to successfully migrate CS customers, acquire new customers, expand into new market segments, and add value through new services. In Q2, we exceeded the $1 billion mark for Creative product revenue for the first time, an increase of 34% year-over-year. Creative Cloud growth was driven by healthy net new subscription adoption, strong retention and positive trends in our average revenue per user or ARPU. Our Adobe Stock business continues to accelerate, driven by customer demand for powerful visual content. Last week, we introduced Aesthetic Filters, a next-gen search capability leveraging Adobe Sensei, to streamline one of the most cumbersome, time-consuming tasks for creatives, finding the perfect image or video for creative projects. With nearly 90 million assets, Adobe Stock is becoming the most comprehensive marketplace for digital assets, and this week we announced the availability of new collections from Reuters and Stocksy, with USA TODAY Sports coming soon. In our video business, Premiere Pro continues to be the leader in the category, with 49% year-over-year growth in single-app subscriptions. At NAB, we unveiled a major update to Premiere Pro, which will help filmmakers and video producers create, deliver and monetize their video assets faster than ever before. This latest update delivers new features for graphics and titling, animation, polishing audio and sharing assets; support for the latest video formats, such as HDR, VR and 4K; and new integrations with Adobe Stock. Our leadership in video applications is attracting a new set of Creatives to our platform. With flagship applications like Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects, and innovative new apps like Character Animator, we have the most comprehensive video authoring solution. New customers buying single apps like Premiere Pro will be a great base to convert over time to a full Creative Cloud subscription. In addition to video, we continue to innovate in new categories like Experience Design, 3D, and mobile apps, including Adobe Spark, which greatly simplifies the process of designing social graphics, web stories and animated videos. These offerings will expand our footprint and bring new customers to Creative Cloud. The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud is addressing growing customer demand for more efficient digital processes. In Q2, Document Cloud revenue was $200 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $520 million exiting the quarter. Acrobat units across Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud combined grew double-digits year-over-year, fueled by a record number of new subscriptions in the quarter. Adobe is focused on delivering innovative capabilities to enable PDF creation in the mobile era. We recently introduced a new app called Adobe Scan, which turns a smartphone or tablet into a PDF creation tool that can do both scanning and intelligent text-recognition through integration with Document Cloud. In its first 12 days, the Adobe Scan app had over 750,000 downloads across iOS and Android. Adobe is recognized as the leader in the Digital Marketing category and we have expanded our ambition to solve enterprises\u2019 broader customer experience mandate. At Adobe Summit in March, we unveiled Adobe Experience Cloud, a comprehensive set of cloud services designed to give enterprises everything they need to deliver exceptional customer experiences. Adobe Experience Cloud includes Adobe Marketing Cloud, an integrated set of industry leading solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers. Adobe Advertising Cloud, the industry\u2019s first end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats and Adobe Analytics Cloud, the core system of data and intelligence for the enterprise. We drove a record $495 million in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue in Q2, representing 29% year-over-year revenue growth. We managed more than 135 trillion data transactions on behalf of our customers over the past four quarters across our solutions. This massive volume of data feeds Adobe Sensei, enabling our Experience Cloud solutions to better understand, predict and personalize customer interactions. We announced the availability of our first set of joint solutions with Microsoft to help enterprises transform cross-channel experiences and campaign orchestration using Adobe Experience Cloud and Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365 and Power BI. In addition, we will collaborate on an industry standard to create semantic data models that will define language for marketing, sales and services which will accelerate the delivery of digital experiences at scale across the entire enterprise. Adobe\u2019s ad tech momentum continues to build. We have now integrated Adobe Audience Manager into Adobe Advertising Cloud, enabling advertisers to identify high performing segments and do automated, data driven media planning and buying across all channels, including linear TV. Adobe Experience Cloud continues to be the leader across multiple industry analyst categories. Forrester Research named Adobe as the only leader in Digital Intelligence Platforms, an emerging market segment bringing together digital data management, digital analytics and customer engagement optimization technologies. They also recognized Adobe Advertising Cloud as a leader in the Omnichannel Demand Side Platforms and Adobe Audience Manager as a leader in Data Management Platforms. Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Multi-channel Campaign Management, where they placed Adobe furthest in the Leaders quadrant for completeness of vision out of 22 vendors evaluated in the report. Interest in Adobe Experience Cloud continues to be strong. We had record attendance at our US and EMEA Summits as well as at our symposia in New York, London, Mumbai, Toronto and Sydney. Major customer wins this quarter included Best Buy, Cisco, Morgan Stanley and Verizon. Last week, Adobe joined the Fortune 500 list for the first time, an exciting milestone for our company. This quarter, we were also included on Forbes\u2019 Best Large Employers list and LinkedIn\u2019s Top Global Companies List, and received Great Places to Work recognition in the UK and Germany. People are our greatest asset at Adobe and we continue to invest in creating an innovative culture and exciting work environment to attract and retain the best talent in the industry. With the introduction of Adobe Experience Cloud, we have expanded our vision and our market opportunity. Our brand, coupled with our deep technology platforms are further distancing us from the competition. We have the world\u2019s best customers, partners and employees and we look forward to a strong second half. Mark? Mark Garrett : Thanks Shantanu. In the second quarter of FY \u201817, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.77 billion, which represents 27% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $0.75 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.02. Highlights in Q2 included; our first $1 billion quarter of Creative revenue, achieving strong net new Digital Media ARR of $312 million, record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $495 million, strong year-over-year growth in operating profit and net income, record deferred revenue with strong cash flow from operations and 86% of Q2 revenue came from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $312 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.56 billion exiting Q2. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $1.01 billion which represents 34% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $285 million during Q2 and exited the quarter with $4.04 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued solid demand for Creative Cloud across all segments, including individual, team and enterprise. We saw particular strength on Adobe.com and in the education market. International adoption of Creative Cloud was notable, particularly in Germany and Japan. Q2 ARR performance was also driven by solid retention, as well as quarter-over-quarter ARPU growth across all key offerings. Adobe Stock contributed to this performance with another quarter of record revenue. We are also pleased to see the growing subscription base for Adobe Stock adding to overall ARR. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $200 million and Document Cloud ARR grew to $520 million exiting Q2. Across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, Acrobat unit growth accelerated when compared to last quarter and again achieved double digit year-over-year growth. In addition, Adobe Sign growth continues and we expect the recent Document Cloud launch with new Acrobat, Sign and Scan functionality to contribute to the overall Document Cloud performance moving forward. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $495 million, which represents 29% year-over-year growth. We are hard at work integrating TubeMogul into our new Advertising Cloud solution and Q2 performance with the TubeMogul business continues to track as we outlined earlier this year. TubeMogul gross revenue recognized in the quarter was de-minimus, as forecasted. Mobile remains a key driver for our Experience Cloud business, mobile data transactions grew to 57% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. Experience Cloud success is fueled by a large ecosystem of partners including systems integrators and digital agencies. They are working with us and our joint customers to create digital strategies, plan and execute implementations and achieve value realization. In Q2, partners were involved in approximately 50% of our bookings. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $0.4 million. We had $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201817, versus $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201817, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.6 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $19.2 million. We had $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201817, versus $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201816, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $9.5 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q2, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 43 days in the year ago quarter and 46 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.07 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $4.93 billion. Cash flow from operations was $645 million in the quarter. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a cost of $266 million and we exhausted our $2 billion authority granted in January 2015. In Q3 we will begin utilizing our new $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017. Now I will provide our financial outlook. In Q3 \u201817, we are targeting; revenue of approximately $1.815 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $300 million, Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 26%, Adobe Experience Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%, share count of approximately 501 million shares, net non-operating expense of approximately $14 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.72 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.00. Given our business momentum, we continued to expect total Adobe revenue, Digital Media ARR and earnings per share to all grow sequentially from Q3 to Q4. When modeling segment and total revenue estimates for Q4 \u201817 it is important to factor the material amount of perpetual revenue reported in our digital marketing business in Q4 \u201816 which we do not expect to reoccur in Q4 of this year. Considering this and our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect total Adobe revenue year-over-year growth to be approximately 23%, an increase from our prior target. In summary, our record Q2 achievement demonstrates we are executing well against a large growth opportunity. We remain excited about our prospects for the rest of the year and beyond. Mike?

We would now be happy to take your questions and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan : Thanks a lot and congratulations. I had one for Shantanu and a follow-up for Mark. Shantanu, just you mentioned Premiere Pro and the success you are having there with the single app products and then you commented that, that could be mechanism to drive more sales into pool of Creative Cloud. And I guess I just had a question on the overall sort of strategy in terms of the potential to create new bundles in the Creative Cloud with the analogy being the Creative Suite, but I think you had 6 different suite types. So I just wondered if you could just elaborate on that for a second and help us think about the opportunities going forward to kind of segment the Creative Cloud product portfolio? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, thanks Ross. I am happy to do so. Also, I wanted to say upfront Mark and I are actually on different cause, I was visiting the debt counsel, so I am in New York and Mark is in San Jose as usual. The strategy, Ross, with Creative Cloud was initially as you know to migrate existing customers. And so it was really important for us to simplify the offering and have a CC complete that we thought would be the right solution for the broad swath of customers that we have. And as you are aware that has played out really well. We always knew that as we wanted to attract new customers, the single app product would be a great stepping stone to get people into the platform and then convert them into full units. This is something that we did in the past whether it was within design during the print era or think products like Dreamweaver or Photoshop or Illustrator, they have always been great ways to attract new customers who may have real experience with one product and then focus on multiple products. And video is clearly being one of those new categories where more and more people are using video and the fact that Premiere Pro is such a great product in video were attracting customers to the platform and then we will convert them into CC complete whether it\u2019s through promotions as well as training. So that\u2019s the way to really think about it, which is when we are doing new customer acquisition just the way, photography has played out really well with photography expansion and market expansion, we think video will be the same. We are equally excited about XD and what\u2019s happening with screen design. So, think about it as bring more customers into the platform through single apps and then convert them to higher ARPU servicing products. Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s helpful. And just the follow-up for Mark on the ARR, you have obviously exceeded now Q1, Q2 and guiding a bit above where certainly we were for Q3, it looks like you are going to do better than your $1 billion for the year, but you didn\u2019t raise that number. Just maybe any thoughts around sort of the $5 billion sort of exit target how we should think about that? Thanks. Mark Garrett : Yes. Actually, if you don\u2019t mind Ross before I answer that question, I want to clarify something. As we were reading our prepared remarks I caught something that needs clarification. So in the end of my prepared remarks we talked about how we now expect Adobe revenue year-over-year growth to be approximately 23%, that\u2019s for the full year. It wasn\u2019t clear whether that was the full year or the quarter, so just to be very clear, we expect the full year to be up 23% year-over-year. So, just make sure you think about that as you update your models. For ARR yes, we are very pleased how that\u2019s playing out Ross, obviously relative to our expectations and we are not updating annual targets but clearly we are on a great trajectory, we had a great first half. And as you know, there is just lots of positive trends that are driving ARR up, everything from ARPU growing across each of the offerings. We have consistently said ARPU continues to grow across each of the offerings bringing new people into the franchise, selling them services, migrating the base over and all those trends continue. So, we are very optimistic about ARR in general. Shantanu Narayen : And Ross, the other thing I might add here is that we are really focused on the $20 billion large opportunity that exists for this entire business. We were pleased also in addition to the stuff that Mark said with how both Germany and Japan have started to adopt Creative Cloud and Stock as well. So, our focus is continue to execute on the near-term, but focus on the large untapped opportunity that we have. Ross MacMillan : Great. Thanks, again. Congratulations. Mark Garrett : Thanks, Ross. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. Mark, I am wondering just on the ARR guidance for Q3 that seems like stronger performance than you are seeing in the last couple of years given that\u2019s a pretty seasonally light quarter and you had strength in areas like Germany and Japan which might be weaker that quarter as well. I am wondering what gives you the confidence and what areas of the business do you expect to see the strength in Q3 ARR for Digital Media? Mark Garret : Yes. I mean, we kind of touched on it, Walter. We do have seasonality in prior years in the third quarter. So, I don\u2019t think this is anything unusual in terms of strength. We just continue to see momentum across the business though it\u2019s everything from international whether that\u2019s Germany or Japan, like you said, ARPU going up across all the different offerings. We continue to migrate the base over. We continue to attract new users. Stock is contributing to ARR. We are starting to see the benefit of less piracy across the offering. So, all of those factors just play into our performance in the first half and what we see moving forward. Operator : Your next question is from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Tom Mao : Hi, this is actually Tom Mao on for Kirk. Mark, as some of your original ETLA deals come to can you talk about how that\u2019s impacting ARPU for Creative Cloud now that you have a subscription version for the enterprise? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Maybe even I can touch on what we are hearing when we go meet with all of these customers from enterprises. The two points I would make is firstly ARPU is actually increasing. One of the things we track is the amount of the Creative Cloud ETLA customers who are adopting services when they renew their contract. And the second thing we are actually tracking right now is the actual number of users who are downloading and using the products and training it so that we can ensure that our customers get the value associated with it and both of those are going well. That again and even answering Walter\u2019s question gives us confidence as to the ARR moving forward in the Digital Media business. But fundamentally, it\u2019s the adoption of services, it\u2019s the deployment of the Creative Cloud applications and the usage and training associated with it that have all done well for us in the enterprise customer base. Tom Mao : And just more broadly in the Digital Media business, can you talk about I think you kind of touched on the this a little bit, but just some of the drivers for ARPU increases outside of Adobe Stock? Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think we have always said that as it relates to getting people on to the platform, the first step is on promotional prices to get them on to the platform. I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that retention continues to be strong. People are using increased number of products. And so I think when we look at ARPU that\u2019s really the reason and foreign exchange hasn\u2019t had an impact. So it\u2019s true usage as well as adoption of more products that\u2019s driving ARPU. Tom Mao : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Stan Zlotsky : Hi guys, good afternoon. This is actually Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. So one question for Shantanu and then one for Mark, for Shantanu, since the marketing summit what has the customer feedback been like on the partnership with Microsoft, what are customers most excited about and with this combined solution, which parts of the market are you looking to address near-term and then more long-term as the solution matures. And then a quick one for Mark, recurring revenue now just hit 86%, how much further can that go as we go and as we look at 2018 and beyond? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I think big picture, actually when you look at what customers are saying they are all struggling with digital transformation and they want to understand how we can help them create this digital customer journey and help them take advantage of all of the technology trends that are happening. The combination of Adobe and Microsoft in that regard is clearly providing a more comprehensive solution than each one of us alone and as they are thinking about which is the cloud provider that they would standardize on the fact that we have a great application. On Azure, also really provides great go-to-market synergy between the two build organizations. The first solutions that we identified and we have actually started to deliver are the Adobe Experience Manager solution, which is a managed service on Azure. The second solution is being able to run campaign integrated with dynamics, so think of it as a complete CRM as well as messaging and campaign and orchestration solution and clearly being able to look at all of the data that they have in Experience Cloud and visualize that through Power BI. And so I think it\u2019s the fact that together we have a more comprehensive solution, the fact that the field organization and the marketing organization is very aligned. And the fact that unlike all other partnerships which are press releases the fact that we have actually executed against it and delivered value, I think is leading to a lot of interest in our joint solutions. Mark Garrett : And in terms of recurring revenue that\u2019s my favorite number. It does just keep creeping up. It\u2019s going to keep going up a bit. But it\u2019s not going to go to 100% if we are always going to have some revenue that\u2019s going to be recognized upfront. But I do expect that it keeps slowly increasing like this is hard to say exactly where it settles in. Stan Zlotsky : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant : Hey, this is Mark Grant on for Heather. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up real quick on the enterprise, as you talked about some of those renewals from the ETLAs from 3 years ago and with the announcements that you made around Experience Cloud at the summit, are you seeing an improvement in customer response there given the introduction of the Experience Cloud and that integrated suite and what\u2019s the impact that you are seeing on typical contract values in the enterprise as you bring that up? Shantanu Narayen : If you put yourselves in the shoes of a customer, if you are in retail what you are trying to do is ensure that all the assets that you have from creative \u2013 creation of these assets all the way out to delivery are in a consistent life cycle of content all the way from our content creation tools to when it\u2019s delivered either through a mobile application or on the website. If you are an advertising or you are creating a campaign you want to make sure that the brand content that you have created in one country rolls out exactly with the same fidelity across multiple countries. So when we go customer after customer, they are trying to ensure that all of the digital content that\u2019s exploding they have a good way to deal with it and to roll it out with the fidelity and the efficacy that they expect. That\u2019s where the combination of what we have done with Creative Cloud with the ETLA option and AEM assets, the experience manager assets solution is a clear leader in the marketplace. And when I alluded to the fact that services and tracking the service usage within CC ETLA, that\u2019s what we are trying to do which is to make sure that they have the ability to do asset management. So, the interest level I would say 3 or 4 years ago we were pitching this vision of how they could corral all their assets across the enterprise in a global way. Today, they are absolutely utilizing it and getting benefit out of it. So there is no question that we have been able to solve a customer pain point. Mark Grant : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much. I would like to ask a question both Shantanu and Mark. Given the strong revenue growth for Adobe in the last few years and the expected growth this year of 23%, what would you think are the largest impediments to driving roughly 20% year-over-year growth for the next few years, is it external issues such as market size, lot of large numbers, because more internal issues such as sales staff or breadth of product offering in Digital Marketing, how should we think about it? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Mark I think the first thing we always try to do is to state the overall opportunity in TAM that\u2019s available for us. And we identified that, that was an over $60 billion market opportunity available to us. So I think you start with that. I think you look at the tailwinds that exist in the categories that we are namely content creation and what\u2019s happening on the media side with new media types, what\u2019s happening with augmented reality, virtual reality, more people coming into a Creative franchise. And frankly, as we have always said people having and wanting a story to tell. On the Digital Marketing side, continuing to help businesses transform just like on the individual side we are empowering people to create, it\u2019s a massive opportunity associated with it. So, we look at it and say big picture there is no question that the market opportunity is available. Within the company, we want to make sure we are really focused on building these deep technology platforms. I think at summit Mark, you saw us talk about what we are doing with the data platform and these key strategic partnerships to ensure that we build a moat around our offering and that\u2019s what we are focused on. And we have to continue to execute and focus on our customers. But as long as we keep our customers front and center, the opportunity is there. If you are trying to get us to back into a long target right now we are not going to do that, but we are really pleased with what we did in the first half and we are going to continue to execute against this opportunity. Mark Moerdler : That\u2019s excellent. I appreciate it. We are just trying to get an understanding of how we should think about it. Any color would be appreciated? Shantanu Narayen : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Mark Moerdler : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Derrick Wood : Thanks and nice job on the quarter. A question on the partner front, one of the things we have heard, I have been hearing recently is that demand for certified developers on Adobe, especially the Marketing Cloud is really starting to outstrip supply. So, are there incremental investments you guys are looking at in terms of driving more partner enablement in the channel? And I guess as a follow-up I would be curious if the integration with Microsoft or other ISBs can attract new third-party developers or resellers to your cloud? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Derrick that\u2019s a great question and I think we said at summit and this is to not just of the U.S. summit, but all around the world. The number of partners who are there and creating digital practices that are based solely on Adobe\u2019s Experience Cloud solutions is growing quite dramatically. I think from our point of view, we continue to ensure that we are providing the best training solutions for these customers. Our professional services organization is available to help them onboard, to help with architectural services that they might need and to continue to be the eyes and ears, but we are thrilled with the number of practices that have been created in every large SI as well as every large digital agency that exists. And so we just have to continue to focus on providing the best training allowing them to download and use our products. All of them are our customers. So they have first hand experience so every thing that they are doing in this particular space. And with respect to your second question, you are absolutely right, they are a couple of key both digital agencies and SI partners who view the fact that Microsoft and Adobe are working so closely together to actually create a joint practice where they have real experience with integrating these two and delivering that as value to their customers. So as long as it continues to grow and do as well as it has and an Experience Cloud does, there will be a market for somebody who is an expert in specifically the integration of these two offerings. Derrick Wood : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Saket Kalia : Hi, guys. Thanks for having me in the call. Maybe just to build in that last question for you, Mark, in the prepared comments you mentioned that partners were involved with about 50% of bookings in the Experience Cloud. Qualitatively, could you just talk about how services revenue in the Digital Marketing business has trended and maybe how you are thinking about it going forward? Mark Garrett : Yes. Services marketing has clearly increased in that business over time as we have driven more implementations into customers, but that is not a critical number for us. From our perspective, a lot of customers want us to do the services, but we are very happy if that partner ecosystem picks up some of the services work as well. So, it\u2019s going to be a mix of us doing it as well as our third-party ecosystem. Shantanu Narayen : So one thing I might strategically add from a color perspective is one of the things we are doing is as they become more and more facile at doing each of the individual point products, we are focusing our services a little bit more on architecture and the integration between these products as a way to supplement and augment their offerings. And so again I think as Mark said in the prepared remarks, we are thrilled that we have more partners and that they are driving more revenue for themselves and we are happy to augment that through higher end architectural services as required. Saket Kalia : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Alex Zukin : Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask a go-to-market question around the Experience Cloud, can you maybe comment about the current structure of the sales organization? And maybe as you move towards these bigger solution oriented sales and it\u2019s less kind of individual product focused is how are you realigning or thinking about strategically with the sales organization? And then just a follow-up to Mark, any impacts on deferred revenue that we should be aware of from the ETLA to Creative Cloud conversion or anything else? Shantanu Narayen : I will take the first part. Certainly, big picture when we think about our go-to-market with sales organization and I am assuming you mean primarily in Digital Marketing, it\u2019s a very traditional named account and organized by vertical with our sales organization in Digital Marketing, so think of it as a financial services or retail or travel and hospitality, media and publishing sales organization, so that our customers clearly understand the vocabulary of the people that they are dealing with named accounts, because these named accounts are increasingly relying on us as the complete mission-critical solution for them. And then we have the equivalent of what you might call either territory or commercial which are customers who are not yet named accounts or other verticals that exist. And we certainly have specialists as well and these specialists are able to augment, but exist with the named accounts. So, the field organization has been structured like that. All around the world, it\u2019s executing against that. One of the new initiatives that we also have in the field organization is the strategy group that\u2019s actually enabling them to have a recipe all the way from going from a digital transformation all the way to how they can start to execute us. So more and more customers are asking us to be their trusted strategic advisor in that particular effect and we stepped up to do that as well. Mark Garrett : And then Alex, as it relates to deferred revenue, yes, there are a couple of things that you should probably know in there. As you know, it\u2019s comprised of both digital media and digital marketing invoiced bookings. On the digital media side, ETLAs continue to perform well and that flows through deferred. More and more of our business is going through Adobe.com, some of which goes through deferred and then some frankly doesn\u2019t flow through deferred. And then in Digital Marketing, there is a seasonal component to deferred. So, in Digital Marketing, you usually see a decline from Q1 to Q2, because in Q4, we have a very strong booking quarter and those Q4 bookings are typically built and hit deferred in Q1 so then you will see a bit of a seasonal decline in Q2. It was a little bit different than that last year, not to complicate things, because we had the extra week last year in Q1 and that extra week ended up billing in Q2, but typically you do see in Digital Marketing a seasonal decline from Q1 to Q2. Alex Zukin : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Shantanu, I would be curious if you could compare and contrast the drivers of the strength in Creative Cloud today versus a year ago and specifically wondering how much of the strength is what you are doing in the enterprise versus continued conversions of legacy Creative Suite versus just up-sell an expansion within existing Creative Cloud users? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Sterling, I think when we identified the three strategies that we were going to continue to focus on which is migration of the Creative Suite based market expansion and delivering new services. I think you have to look at it across each one of those. On the migration side, certainly, we had I think identified in November of 2016 that we have about 7 million people left to convert. We are continuing to make progress against that. We have said that Japan and Germany had lagged. That\u2019s now showing good progress. So, the migration continues well. From a new customer acquisition, the new customer acquisition has been very healthy. And I think the fact that we have combated piracy, you can\u2019t buy a box anymore on one of those e-commerce channels that you were able to the fact that it\u2019s a low price of entry like I mentioned, Sterling, with video, with XD, we have new categories where we are leading the platform. That continues to be really healthy. It starts off a lot with single app and so people come on with a single app and then may move them into the complete suite. Education had a strong quarter. So that was good. And on the CC ETLA and team, I think we are just executing against all of this, our awareness of the customer, our ability for them to get value out of the entire offering is improving. And I would say big picture, Sterling, I think the biggest thing that\u2019s driving it is the creation of good design and content has never been more important, whether that\u2019s for the web, whether it\u2019s for mobile applications. And so it\u2019s not like I can point to one thing that\u2019s actually fueling this business, it\u2019s the fact that we have the most comprehensive offering we are innovating and we are executing, because we understand each customer in a more unique way and are addressing our offering to target them in a personalized way using our Digital Marketing solution. So, I can\u2019t point at one thing, but are pleased with our progress against all of the initiatives we identified. Sterling Auty : Great. Thank you. Mike Saviage : Operator, well, we try to fit two more questions in, please. Operator : Your next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. Two questions for both Shantanu and Mark. Mark, you highlighted the role of Adobe.com as you typically do on the call, could you talk about the margin leverage that you are continuing to get from the growth of Adobe.com? Do you think that\u2019s marginally played out or do you think there is further margin leverage benefits you can get from Adobe.com as the business continues to grow or perhaps you offer some new structural ways of doing business with Adobe perhaps with new combined products, single sign-on and the like? And secondly, with respect to Document Cloud, your ARR increased just over 100 million there year-over-year. At that rate, it would probably take you another 4 or 5 years to get to a $1 billion ARR for Document Cloud, but given the size of the Acrobat base more than double the Creative base and the conversion more and more to subscription. Could you foresee a perhaps material acceleration in the ARR accretion for Document Cloud and thereby get to a much higher 9-figure number sooner? Shantanu Narayen : Maybe I will start off with the latter one, Mark and then you can, which is on the Document Cloud side, Jay, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that Acrobat is also available as part of the Creative Cloud offering and is doing extremely well as part of the Creative Cloud offering. It\u2019s probably something I should have mentioned even in Sterling and the other questions that are coming. I think we mentioned that Acrobat is seeing a record number of subscriptions and is doing well both in the Creative Cloud funnel as well as in the Document Cloud funnel and I think we have identified many times that one of the choices that we have made is to offer Acrobat as a single opt more in the Creative Cloud funnel so that we can than upsell them to our imaging solution. So I don\u2019t just look at the Document Cloud ARR or the revenue when you think about how well Acrobat is doing, because PDF is actually doing well across both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. And I will let Mark answer the second question. Mark Garett : Yes. And then as it relates to Adobe.com, Jay as you know we have been scaling Adobe.com dramatically over the past several years as we have gone through this transition. There is no doubt that that has contributed to improved margin. I think it will continue to contribute to improved margin as we continue to scale up the business on Adobe.com. It\u2019s a major, major channel for us now and clearly a profitable, very profitable one. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Operator : The last question is from Samad Samana from Stephens. Samad Samana : Hi, congrats on a great quarter. Mark, I have a question for you, when I look at the Experience Cloud forecast for the third quarter, it looks like a deceleration which I am really surprised given the year-over-year comp and adding TubeMogul revenue can you maybe remind us if there is a lot of license revenue in the third quarter of last year and also I think you mentioned ASV growth in the past from Marketing Cloud, maybe what that was so we can reconcile that the forecast with our models? Mark Garrett : Yes. There was some perpetual in the third and especially the fourth quarter of last year as I said in my prepared remarks. You have also got as we have said for quite a while now the mix of ASV subscription and services revenue is well in there and sometimes the services revenue plays into that. But if you look at it across the year, it\u2019s tracking nicely against what we have said. Samad Samana : Okay, great. Thanks for answering that. Shantanu Narayen : And since that was the last question, I just wanted to end by saying we are really pleased with our performance in the first half of fiscal \u201917 both by delivering great top line growth as well as bottom line earnings I think what excites us really is the long-term opportunities that we have to continue to empower people to bring their creativity to life as well as to enable businesses to transform themselves. And from our point of view if this combination of content to create the world class digital experience customer journey is that it become so important. And the analysis of that data to deliver great business outcomes we think as what differentiates the modern enterprise and we have a unique mission critical solution in that entire life cycle. We continue to invest in deep technology. We didn\u2019t touch much on AI & ML, but that we believe will continue to distance us from our competitors. We look forward to chatting with you at our next earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : This concludes our call. Thanks everyone.",

I would like to welcome you to Adobe Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Quarterly Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Saviage : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe\u2019s President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; and Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO. In our call today, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2017 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago. We\u2019ve also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, financial targets and an updated investor datasheet on adobe.com. If you would like a copy of these documents, you can go to Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations page and find them listed under Quick Links. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue and operating model targets, and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, September 19, 2017, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure in the earnings press release we issued today, as well as Adobe\u2019s SEC filings. During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is available in our earnings release and in our updated investor datasheet on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website. Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live in Adobe Connect, and is also being recorded for playback purposes.

The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. Adobe had another record quarter with revenue of $1.84 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q3 was $0.84, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.10. We continue to deliver strong top-line and bottom-line growth, with expanding operating margins and strong cash flow from operations. Digital transformation has become the top agenda item for C-suites across the globe, and Adobe\u2019s Cloud offerings are mission-critical for CMOs, CIOs, CTOs and CEOs charged with modernizing their businesses and the way they engage with their customers. At the same time, we are significantly growing our footprint in the creative space well beyond our loyal base of creative professional customers. Whether it\u2019s designing the user experience for a personal blog or editing a short film, Creative Cloud\u2019s capabilities are expanding to address the needs of today\u2019s youth, social media mavens and creative enthusiasts while continuing to push the technology boundaries for our most demanding creative pros. In addition to delivering continuous product innovation, we are investing deeply in Adobe Sensei to dramatically improve the accessibility, design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei leverages Adobe\u2019s massive volume of content and data assets as well as our deep domain expertise in the creative, document and marketing segments. We are making the Adobe Sensei framework and intelligent services available to our ecosystem of partners, ISVs and developers who will deliver additional magic. Central to our strong performance this quarter was record revenue in our Digital Media business. We achieved $1.27 billion in Digital Media revenue in Q3, a 28% year-over-year increase. We exited the quarter with over $4.87 billion of Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q3 was $308 million, and was driven by continued strength in our Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud businesses. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and we increased revenue 33% year-over-year in Q3. Creative Cloud growth was driven by net-new subscriptions, continued focus on customer value that fuels retention, adoption of enterprise services, and focus on high-potential segments like education. The video category is exploding and we continue to drive strong growth with our market-leading Creative Cloud video solutions. At the IBC Conference in Amsterdam, we highlighted our latest innovations in virtual reality, animation, motion graphics, editing, collaboration and Adobe Stock video. We unveiled new premium features in Adobe Spark, a family of easy-to-use services for creating high-quality social graphics, web pages and video stories. Spark with premium features is now available as a standalone subscription, and is also included in our Creative Cloud All Apps subscription. In addition to Adobe XD for Experience Design and Project Felix for 2D to 3D photo-realistic rendering, we are driving innovation to enable authoring for emerging media types such as AR and VR. We recently acquired best-in-class 360-degree and virtual reality software from Mettle. The acquisition complements Adobe Creative Cloud\u2019s existing 360/VR cinematic production technology, and we will integrate this functionality natively into future releases of Premiere Pro and After Effects. Next month\u2019s MAX in Las Vegas will be the world\u2019s largest creativity conference. At MAX, we will outline our expanding vision for Creatives, release new Creative Cloud apps and services, and showcase amazing new technology that our brilliant scientists are working on in our labs. The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud is enabling businesses to automate their paper-based processes. In Q3, Document Cloud revenue was $206 million, a year-over-year increase of 10%, and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $556 million exiting the quarter. We drove strong uptake of Acrobat across both Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud. Adobe Sign is helping drive Adobe Document Cloud ARR growth. Earlier this month, we announced Adobe Sign is now Microsoft\u2019s preferred e-signature solution across the company\u2019s portfolio, including the 100 million monthly commercial active users of Microsoft Office 365. Adobe Scan is at the heart of our mobile PDF creation strategy. Adobe Scan has had over 2.7 million downloads across iOS and Android, delivering revolutionary scanning and text-recognition capabilities through integration with Adobe Document Cloud. The leader in the Digital Marketing category, Adobe Experience Cloud is enabling enterprises to deliver intelligent, intuitive and effective customer experiences. We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $508 million in Q3, which represents 26% year-over-year revenue growth. The breadth of Adobe Experience Cloud, which includes Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud, is enabling us to address an expanding array of customer experience categories. Central to the differentiation of Adobe Experience Cloud is our data and analytics platform, which provides unique insight into customer behavior and ROI across every digital touchpoint. In the trailing four quarters, we\u2019ve helped our customers manage more than 150 trillion data transactions across our Experience Cloud solutions. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver hyper-personalized content and campaigns to their customers. We announced new capabilities in Adobe Target to further enhance customer recommendations and targeting, optimize experiences and automate the delivery of personalized offers. In Adobe Campaign, marketers can now predict the highest performing images, forecast likely customer churn and gain real-time insights to adjust their campaigns. Adobe Analytics Cloud is foundational to the digital enterprise. We announced new voice analytics capabilities that enable brands to deliver personalized customer experiences using voice-based interfaces. Through deep analysis of voice data, brands can gain robust audience insights and recommendations, while automating the traditionally cumbersome, manual analysis. Adobe Advertising Cloud enables marketers to deliver video, display and search advertising across any screen in any format. We announced the addition of digital audio advertising formats on desktop and mobile devices. We added Spotify as a premium inventory source for digital audio, display and video advertising formats. At Advertising Week, we are extending automated buying and data-driven optimization to all TV advertising for the first time in a cross-channel platform. Last week, we announced new automotive focused analytics, personalization and advertising capabilities in Adobe Experience Cloud that give brands the ability to deliver unique consumer experiences including personalized playlists, on-route recommendations and audio ads. The 10 largest automakers in the world already use Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe is working with these brands along with ecosystem players to advance new digital in-car capabilities. Our strategic partnership with Microsoft is providing us with an expanded footprint in the enterprise with Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365 and PowerBI complementing Adobe Experience Cloud. We see a strong pipeline of joint customer opportunities with enterprise customers who are navigating their digital transformation. Significant customer wins this quarter included Adidas, HSBC, Kellogg\u2019s, Marks & Spencer and University of Maryland. Despite this success with global enterprise customers, we were disappointed with our Experience Cloud bookings in Q3 but remain confident in our ability to execute against this large opportunity. Two weeks ago, we held our second annual internal Adobe & Women Leadership Summit and announced that we will be at 100% pay parity between women and men in the U.S. by the end of this fiscal year. Achieving pay parity underscores our leadership and commitment to being a diverse and inclusive employer. In Q3, we were named one of the Best Workplaces for Millennials and one of the top 10 Best Places to Work in both India and Australia. And for the second year in a row, Adobe has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index World, the gold standard of corporate responsibility reporting for the investment community. Adobe is the clear leader in creating and delivering digital experiences across all segments and geographies. Our strategy has never been more relevant and we continue to execute well against our plan. No other company empowers every individual to tell their story while enabling businesses to compete more effectively in the digital age. With the world\u2019s best employees, partners and customers, we are equipped to continue to deliver on our mission and look forward to a strong close to our fiscal year. Mark? Mark Garrett : Thanks, Shantanu. In the third quarter of FY17, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.84 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $0.84 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.10. Highlights in Q3 included record Creative revenue of $1.06 billion, strong Document Cloud revenue of $206 million, strong net new Digital Media ARR of $308 million, record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $508 million, strong year-over-year growth in operating profit and net income, record deferred revenue of $2.2 billion, more than $700 million in cash flow from operations, and a record 88% of revenue during the quarter came from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 28% year-over-year. The addition of $308 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.87 billion exiting Q3. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $1.06 billion which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $272 million during Q3 and exited the quarter with $4.32 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strength with Creative Cloud across all segments, including individual, team and enterprise. Notable Q3 highlights included the achievement of strong net new subscriptions; maintaining or growing ARPU across all key Creative Cloud offerings and strength in Japan. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $206 million, and Document Cloud ARR grew to $556 million exiting Q3. Across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, Acrobat adoption accelerated again when compared to recent quarters, achieving 19% year-over-year unit growth. In addition, our electronic signature service Adobe Sign continues to show strength and we expect the recent partnership we announced with Microsoft to fuel growth of Adobe Sign moving forward. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $508 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Notable areas of strength include Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Campaign, and Adobe Advertising Cloud. We now have approximately $3 billion of annualized ad spend across search, social, display and video. Mobile remains a key driver for our Experience Cloud business; mobile data transactions grew to 57% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. Overall interest in digital marketing and Adobe Experience Cloud is strong, and we continue to drive subscription bookings growth. The scale of our engagements is growing with customers increasingly adopting multiple Adobe solutions which is leading to larger deal sizes but longer sales cycles. As a result, we did not achieve our Q3 bookings goal and are no longer on track to achieve our 30% net new ASV bookings growth target for the year. However, we do expect greater than 20% organic annual growth in FY17 on the subscription book of business. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $9.6 million. We had $200,000 in hedge gains in Q3 FY17, versus $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY17; thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $3.5 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $11.3 million. We had $200,000 in hedge gains in Q3 FY17, versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY16; thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $15 million. In Q3, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 22.5% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was slightly lower than targeted due to stronger-than-forecasted profits from outside the U.S., as well as certain tax benefits we were entitled to claim upon filing our U.S. income tax returns. Our trade DSO was 50 days, which compares to 45 days in the year-ago quarter, and 46 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in Digital Media. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $5.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $704 million in the quarter. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares at a cost of $298 million. We have approximately $2.2 billion remaining of our $2.5 billion stock repurchase authority granted in January 2017. I will now provide our financial outlook. In Q4 FY17, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.950 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $330 million; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%; Adobe Experience Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 17%; as a reminder, last quarter we outlined that the Experience Cloud Q4 FY17 year-over-year growth rate will be affected by a material amount of perpetual revenue that we achieved in Q4 FY16; share count of approximately 500 million shares; net non-operating expense of approximately $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis; tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.86, and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.15. Our Q4 targets, combined with our year-to-date performance, would yield the following annual FY17 revenue results : Total Digital Media segment growth of approximately 26%; total Adobe Experience Cloud growth of approximately 24%; and total Adobe growth of approximately 24%. Our strong results coupled with our Q4 targets demonstrate that FY17 will be another record year for Adobe. Mike? Mike Saviage : Thanks, Mark.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Walter, your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. I\u2019m wondering, Shantanu, on the digital marketing performance. I noticed one product that wasn\u2019t mentioned as strong in the quarter was Experience Manager. If you go into some detail as to whether or not weakness in that product was because of what you saw -- and I know, what you mentioned on the larger transactions, but was there any sort of product maturity issues you were facing there? And any more detail around sort of steps you\u2019re taking to try to resolve some of those challenges you faced in the quarter? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. I\u2019ll talk about that, Walter. I mean, we wanted to be clear in our communication that Q3 subscription bookings were below our expectations, but that in no way diminishes both, our excitement around the opportunity and how we\u2019re helping companies deal with digital transformation. And when you see the minor impact of that Q3 bookings to our Q4 revenue target, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re still targeting 24% revenue growth in fiscal 2017. So, as we think about providing a little bit more color on how we inspect that business, as you know, Walter, there are three components to the Experience Cloud. There is the non-recurring revenue sources including perpetual and that\u2019s now de minimis in the consulting services. The largest part of the business is now represented by our subscription based model in both marketing cloud and analytics cloud. And growth there is best described I think by net growth on the book of business at the beginning of the year, and that\u2019s very similar to how we describe Digital Media ARR. That continues to grow and we are expecting that book of business to grow organically at greater than 20% this year. So, the fact that we highlighted revenue in certain categories, has nothing to do with an implication that there was revenue weakness in AEM. So, wanted to get that out there. In Advertising Cloud, the business model again, as you know is the traditional usage based model and/or percentage of advertising spend. This includes an organic -- inorganic compare in FY17 but again, that will grow substantially over 30% this year. And so, the way we think about it, the 30% target that we had given was actually based on a different methodology which was prior to the acquisition of TubeMogul and was blended across both the subscription and the usage based models, and was actually growth on top of last year\u2019s growth in the business as opposed to just net growth on the beginning book of business. So, the business remains healthy. There were some large deals that were taking longer. But we expect the traditional year-end strength across Experience Cloud will lead to a substantial increase in sequential bookings from Q3 to Q4, which was the last part of your question, very stringent focus on execution, and we remain excited about the business. We will probably provide an update to you guys at MAX as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Shantanu, just to follow up on Experience Cloud. There was some concern that you pulled the target that may be these larger deals will take longer than Q4 to close. Can you just comment in terms of what you are seeing in the pipeline or are these just pushing from Q3 to Q4 or do you anticipate a push into the fiscal year? And then, just a quick follow-up. There has been a lot of talk about iOS 11 and the blocking of cookies and ads, as well as the weakness that\u2019s been found in some of the ad agencies as of late. Is there anything else going, maybe outside your control that you are seeing that\u2019s new, that we should take into account? Shantanu Narayen : As it relates to the Q3 pipeline, that did not close, it\u2019s primarily moved to Q4, it has nothing to do. We still remain the leader in the category and it\u2019s not competitive. So, we expect the traditional year-end strength across Experience Cloud will lead, as I said earlier, to the substantial increase in sequential bookings. But we are also anticipating that as a result of the larger deals, there is a possibility that we will continue to see an ongoing larger sales cycle that might lead to a phase shift in terms of when the bookings are closed. And so, we don\u2019t think that the fundamental opportunity has changed. With respect to the Advertising Cloud, we had a strong quarter. And as I said, the business is growing substantially over 30% this year. So, no impact yet in terms of what we are seeing with respect to cookies or iOS. The advertising spend, I think Mark also spoke to in his prepared remarks, we have a significant amount of dollars under marketing spend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Sterling, your line is open. Sterling Auty : Just want to continue that line of questions. Shantanu, you mentioned that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s competitive, but still want to try to zero in, is there any more color as to why the extension or the lengthening of sales cycle, whether the approval process, rethinking in terms of the direction that customers are taking some of their spend, because I know, we\u2019re going to hit that question allow, which is why? Why do you think, you\u2019re seeing the lengthening sales cycle and spillover in some of these deals? Shantanu Narayen : Well, one thing, Sterling, that is happening is given that these are much larger deals, the number of approvals that you need within an enterprise is extending beyond the marketing person who is responsible for this activity. And so, as we were targeting the Chief Revenue Officer, the Chief Digital Officer that was a single point of approval, now there may be a couple of points of approval. But beyond that, it\u2019s just the bigger engagements, is resulting in more people in an organization, who are responsible for digital transformation and being involved in the process. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think people agreed [ph] too much into this as opposed to the fact that, we are being as candid and transparent as we always are. The big term opportunity remains exactly the same. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC. Ross, your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Mark, maybe one of your. Just, this year has obviously been a really strong year in Digital Media ARR. I think the net add in your forecast is going to be above 1.2 billion, which is actually higher than we\u2019ve seen in the past two years. I\u2019m just -- I know you\u2019re not guiding for next year, but just to help us think about the shape of the curve on the net new ARR, because we\u2019ve been sort of hanging out above a 1 billion now for three years. Is it something you think is sustainable or should we start thinking about the potential for the net new ARR to begin to come down. Maybe just help us think about that because there is a lot of factors obviously that play into that number? Mark Garrett : Yes. We\u2019re very pleased with ARR and we\u2019re very pleased with the fact, to your point Ross, that we\u2019ve been able to continue to add over $1 billion every year. And as you know, it comes from three big groups. So, we\u2019re still migrating the base over, there is still opportunity there. We continue to attract more and more new users, and that remains a very big opportunity, and we continue to sell services. So, those three growth vectors still play out very nicely. We don\u2019t really see any change in that right now. We are very pleased with what we\u2019ve been able to do. And as Shantanu laid out on the marketing side, this 1 billion plus dollars that we\u2019re adding every year is an increase to our book of business, which is how we were trying to explain the way we will begin to look at digital marketing. So, no change to the trajectory from our perspective. Shantanu Narayen : And also Ross, more nascent businesses like Adobe Stock and Adobe Sign are continuing to perform really well, international expansion continues to grow, and new customer acquisition, so as well as enterprise services. So, continued focus on that. And last but certainly not least, you can see that impact of Acrobat on that overall business continues to be strong. Acrobat had a strong business in both, Document Cloud as well as in the Creative Cloud. Mark Garrett : And not to pile on, but we also continue to see an opportunity to combat piracy and drive more into education. So, there is just a lot of growth vectors left in this business. Ross MacMillan : Yes. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you. And then, just quick follow-up on marketing. The 30% number is a big one. And as you mentioned, that was a kind of combined -- sorry for the background noise, combined on the advertising as well as sort of underlying prior assets. Just as you\u2019re thinking about that business, do you think a 20% growth in sort of new ACV [ph] is a reasonable way to think about at that? Do you think that\u2019s high, do you think that\u2019s potentially low? Just maybe little bit of framework around what you think is sustainable one kind of new ACV [ph] basis that will be helpful. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think, first, Ross, the market opportunity continues to be incredibly large. I think we\u2019ve talked about 40 billion TAM. I think you\u2019ve got it exactly when you talked about, that was a growth-on-growth number as opposed to just a percentage growth on the book-of-business. And so, when we look at it as a percentage growth on the book-of-business which is similar to what we do in digital media, as I said, the Marketing Cloud and Analytics Cloud will grow greater than 20% then the Advertising Cloud is going to be substantially greater than 30%. And so relative to the market opportunity, we continue to think that there is headroom for us and we continue to be the leader. Operator : Your next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Saket, your line is open. Saket Kalia : Sure. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here. Just to change gears a little bit towards Creative. Shantanu or Mark, can you just talk a little bit about Adobe Stock? I realize that you won\u2019t give the contribution to ARR. Could you maybe talk qualitatively about whether customers are asking for monthly or annual plans and maybe what price spans are proven to be more popular? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. With respect to Adobe Stock, we just continue to think it\u2019s a significant opportunity for us. Big picture, we offer it both in conjunction with the Creative Cloud all apps as well as we offer it as a subscription. We have actually tapered down the on-demand part of the Adobe Stock in favor of the subscription, so that it becomes a recurring part of the business. I think it\u2019s clear when you look at the other stock content services that the growth in that category, we are continuing to drive it. We\u2019ve added new capabilities in video as well. But the business is growing well for us across our offerings which are primarily subscription based offerings. Operator : Your next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Heather, your line is open. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you. I was wondering, Shantanu, if you could help share some color with us on the cross-sell and up-sell trends you\u2019ve been seeing in the Creative Cloud community. And also wondering if you look forward, what do you see is being a bigger driver of growth? Can you help us think about just directionally, net new subs contribution versus cross-sell? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Heather. When we look at the business, I think as we add new categories of products in the authoring space, whether it\u2019s Adobe XD, or whether it\u2019s what we are doing with Project Felix and as we think about AR and VR, the first that we can continue to do is think about is it time to also offer another premium Creative Cloud service that can drive and up-sell in terms of ARR. We continue to see good adoption of new single apps as was also evident in the Creative Suite business of old. That\u2019s the way in which people enter the platform and then, we move them from single app to the entire Creative Cloud offering. Services, the ARPU in the enterprise continues to grow as people adopt the services. And we are certainly in the process and have seen success in attaching whether it\u2019s Stock or whether it\u2019s Sign to those Creative Could enterprise term license agreements. We haven\u2019t yet started even looking at pricing, which continues to be a big opportunity for us in terms of optimizing pricing because we are trying to get more and more people to the platform. So, I think net international expansion, Mark talked about education and piracy, it\u2019s -- the nature of everybody who has a story to tell is just expanding. I am excited about Spark and now offering Spark as a premium feature, which we think there should be a significantly larger set of people who would be interested in Spark. So, across all of those dimensions Heather, the cross-sell of people who have the applications through mobile and stock, the upsell from individual users to the entire suite and also from enterprises, not only adopting asset management and Creative Cloud ETLAs but also adopting the Marketing Cloud, I think all of those continue to be areas of focus and execution for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thanks. A good segue way to Heather\u2019s question. I was looking to see, given your exceptional track record in being able to lay out longer term targets and being able to hit that with a lot of panache and style. How should we think about Adobe\u2019s growth opportunities ahead? Is it -- the way you answered Heather\u2019s question, the different vectors, is that the next third chapter, if you will, of your long-term planning that is going to give us the comfort in your ability to sustain this growth? [Ph] because there is not maybe a widely held belief but in maybe some pockets of the investor community that once you hit the full penetration in Creative, whenever the time, it\u2019s 2018 or 2019 that growth will decelerate and therefore Adobe is going to have to do something to keep that growth rate. Just curious how we should think about it and you think about it, more importantly? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I think, at our analyst meetings, we always take it upon ourselves to talk about our long-term growth opportunities, whether they\u2019d be in Creative, Document or Marketing Cloud. And as we talk about the large TAM available to us, it\u2019s clear actually that we are executing against all three of those. And so, we will continue to provide updates at MAX. But from the point of view of your specific question around Creative, we think we are so early in the adoption of our Creative Cloud applications and services and mobile and new forms of offering that any concern associated with sort of migration being the only fuel of the business, we should have put that to bed a long time ago in terms of the new customer acquisition and the new services that are driving the growth. So, a multiple opportunities. I hope you are coming to MAX where you will see a lot of the tremendous innovation, and we\u2019ll again outline all of the growth vectors that are available for us. Kash Rangan : MAX in Vegas, tough combination to be, we\u2019ll be there. Mark Garrett : I was going to say, Kash, we both touched on it separately but if you just list out all the different opportunities in Creative to grow the business, whether it\u2019s people coming from the base, new users or services, and then pricing opportunity, international opportunity, piracy opportunity, education opportunity, international opportunity -- I said that one, there\u2019s just a lot of different opportunities to continue to grow this business for quite a while from our perspective? Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Holt from MoffettNathanson. Adam, your line is open. Adam Holt : A very good quarter from a cash flow perspective, and I was hoping maybe you could detail a little bit, what drove that, specifically around the deferred revenue lines. I wanted to know, are you seeing any benefit -- are you making any changes [Technical Difficulty]? And then, secondly\u2026 Shantanu Narayen : Adam, you\u2019re fading. Can you be just a little bit closer to the mic, please? Adam Holt : Sure. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Adam Holt : So, a very good quarter from a cash flow perspective, and I wanted to drill down on what\u2019s driving deferred revenue. Specifically, have you started to see any impact of maybe better duration from your billings, moving people from monthly and quarterly to annual, and how do you think that plays out going forward? Mark Garrett : As it relates to the Creative business -- so first of all, Adam, congrats on the new job, welcome back. Adam Holt : Thank you. Mark Garrett : As a relates to the Creative business, most people are on an annual plan already. So that gets factored into deferred revenue already. The beauty of our business and you guys all know this, but the beauty of our business overall is that you\u2019ve got two businesses, three businesses growing very nicely and two of which just are amazingly profitable businesses that drive a lot of cash flow, and that\u2019s going to continue. So, we\u2019re thrilled with the cash flow; that is one of the beautiful parts of our business, and that will continue. But, as it relates to deferred, most people are already on an annual plan on the creative side. So, it\u2019s really factored in there. Adam Holt : If I could just ask a quick follow-up to what you talked about moments earlier. Would you expect relationship [technical difficulty] bookings change going forward? Mark Garrett : To the extent that we in a quarter come up a little short on bookings like we did this quarter, you\u2019re going to come up a little short on invoicing and you\u2019re going to come up a little sure on deferred. And that\u2019s why we said, in the deferred, most of what you saw there was Digital Media related. So, there is definitely a correlation there. But again, none of the fundamentals of the business have changed, none of the opportunity has changed. This is from our perspective, just a short-term change to drive larger transactions in the enterprise. Operator : Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay, your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Shantanu, Mark, without meaning to suggest anything about the new customer acquisition, I\u2019d like to ask about you of various opportunities in upgrading and migrating several large basis. Specifically, if you could comment on for instance, the opportunity to upgrade or migrate CC Team to CCE; by our calculation about a quarter of the CC subscriber base is using the full product on teams, that seems just a pretty substantial base upgrade opportunity. Similarly, the years after you grew AEM after the acquisition of Day, you still sold a substantial amount of your life cycle business. We calculate roughly $0.5 billion or more over a period of half a decade, even as AEM was growing. So, again, there too seems to be a substantial migration opportunity. And then, lastly, with respect to Doc Cloud, which has always been your bigger base, do you think that the new PDF to point out spec could engender a new growth cycle for Acrobat either within the base or for new customers? Shantanu Narayen : So, Jay, I\u2019ll go third backwards. And so first on Acrobat, I think we\u2019ve said in the past, we had over 30 million installations of Acrobats. So clearly that represents a large opportunity. I think mobile PDF creation with what we\u2019ve done with Adobe Scan and the ability for all of those assets to be in the cloud and to use Adobe Sensei to do things like OCR, clearly we see large opportunity. That business has migrated faster than we would have thought to subscription based business while we are growing the overall base. So, large opportunity, continue to be focused on it, and clearly, I think to your point, we are much earlier in the cycle in terms of migrating. I think as for the second one that you talked about within the enterprise, the opportunity associated with how people move from traditional lifecycle to new forms capabilities in the AEM stack, absolutely that continues to be a large opportunity as people are moving from paper to digital, the ability to now electronic signatures which completes the last mile of that workflow is again an opportunity whether that\u2019s in government or whether that\u2019s in enterprises that are regulated, continues to be a large opportunity. And on the CC Team versus CCE, we look at that a little bit more honestly as a buying preference that people have where some people are buying CC Team and they are getting that fulfilled through the channel, and others are CC Enterprise and want the direct relationship with the customer and with Adobe in that particular case. In both those scenarios, we\u2019re focused on up-selling services as opposed to migrating them from one buying vehicle to another buying vehicle. So, on that one, I would say, the focus is more on how do we get both of those categories to buy more of the services rather than necessarily transition them at their preferences buying through the channel or adobe.com to having that CC Enterprise relationship with Adobe. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith, your line is open. Keith Weiss : I wanted to ask a couple of bigger picture questions. One is on Sensei, with respect to you\u2019ve got some positive feedback on Sensei, particularly in the broader Experience Cloud. Could you guys talk to us a little bit about sort of what you\u2019re hearing back from customers? And also remind us kind of how the monetization strategy around Sensei is going to be evolving as we move forward? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Keith. I mean, as it relates to Sensei, I mean, we\u2019ve had as we\u2019ve outlined on many occasions, decades of significant expertise, whether it\u2019s an understanding video, understanding images, understanding the semantic meaning of documents, and on the Experience Cloud side everything to do with predicting based on these large data sets, behavior that will drive otpizmation of business outcomes on behalf of our customers. And as we embed more and more of that intelligence that people have access to directly in how they use their products, I think the aha moment is going. I think people have that more and more on the creative side when they saw the magic that they saw within our products. And now what we are doing is actually ensuring that the ability for them to action all of the insights that we are getting is far more within the hands of the users. So, as you point out, the feedback that we are getting on Sensei across all of our offerings is very positive. I do want to clarify one issue as it relates to the question around monetization of intelligence in our applications is there are other companies that are saying we\u2019re going to monetize the intelligence separately, does that mean that their other applications and dumb and don\u2019t have actually the functionality. So, for us we just look at all of the technology that we are putting in and it\u2019s making our existing products that are already world class better. So that\u2019s the way I look at it. We are not going to go and say you can buy the non-intelligent product for a $1 and you can buy the additional intelligent product for additional $1 amount. That makes no sense whatsoever, Keith. But the intelligence is being appreciated. We are investing very deeply in it. And from our point of view, the best is getting better. Keith Weiss : And perhaps one follow-up on distribution. We heard about sort of an expansion of the ETLA program, trying to sort of [technical difficulty] put more customers into it. Can you talk a little bit about that expansion of ETLAs and whether sort of the initial feedback has been -- whether you\u2019ve been successful on getting more customers on to that program? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Keith. I think we\u2019ve had tremendous success with actually migrating people from the traditional way of procuring the Creative applications from us into ETLAs. And I think we have described in the past how the first version of that ETLA was in effect mimicking the sort of different solutions that they got in Creative suite. In other words, Creative suite was available as a design collection or as a master collection or as a video collection, and the first versions of ETLAs in terms of doing no harm, we were just providing an equivalent way for them to license the Creative Cloud applications. The second wave of that as they are rolling off the three years, we have been very active in up-selling them into the Creative Cloud Complete application which is an increase in ARPU for us as well as selling them new services like Stock and Sign, which is additional revenue. And so, the way we measure the business and I look at this all the time, is migrating all ETLA customers first to Creative Cloud, then to Creative Cloud Complete and then monitoring usage of not just Creative Cloud all of our applications but also monitoring Stock as well as Sign. And so, we are well on our way to the journey, which is leading to better satisfaction on the part of our customers and clearly increase revenue and ARPU to us here at the Adobe. Operator : Your next question comes from Derrick Wood from Cowen and Co. Derrick your line is open. Derrick Wood : Great, thanks. Back on the marketing side. And it seems like there is more companies forming a position for the Chief Data Officer. I know you guys have all had the era of the Chief Marketing Officer, but I would think as data has become more important in the marketing investments, you guys start to have more engagement with the CDO. So, I guess what I am trying to get at is, do you think that may be an element of longer sales cycles? And if so, do you think you need to change or expand your account coverage capacity to sell in through a different approval point or do you feel like you\u2019re entrenched enough with large accounts that the rate of investment doesn\u2019t need to change much? Shantanu Narayen : Good question, Derrick. I think we are definitely entrenched in the accounts where the selling motion or process doesn\u2019t have to change as a result of what we are seeing because they know about us; the cycle may take a little bit longer. With respect to your second question, there is no doubt that there is additional scrutiny on ensuring whatever the frameworks are to protect the data appropriately. If you go to our website, you\u2019ll see were leader and whether it\u2019s FedRAMP and the government or looking at it as HIPAA or healthcare and ensuring that all of those standards as part of Adobe\u2019s security framework and our data privacy framework that we\u2019ve taken the lead on that. I think the third part of your question associated with are we then finding ways that enable our customers to monetize the insight associated with that data, that\u2019s clearly something that we\u2019ve been doing for a while including with the data co-op go up that we\u2019ve announced in terms of being able to monetize their data. So at all three levels, we feel confident. Namely, we have the right people on the table, we deal with all of the checkless items that are important for them to feel comfortable with our solutions, and we\u2019re providing business value and business outcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore. Kirk, your line is open. Tom Mao : This is Tom Mao, calling in for Kirk. Just from the product side. Can you talk about some of the updates to your 360/VR technology apart from Mettle? What kind of impact could we start to see in 2018 and how do you think about the TAM of those segments today? Shantanu Narayen : Within the Creative Cloud, I think we\u2019ve touched on the fact that video is clearly the most exclusive category that we\u2019re seeing, IBC was another great opportunity for us. Within video, we had already added some 360/VR capabilities. The technology that we\u2019ve acquired also was available as plug-ins to some of our applications. But as we have done traditionally, we take those plug-ins and apply that natively, because then the performance is significantly better and the usability of that functionality is better. So big picture, we look at it saying, video is certainly exploding with the leaders in that video as Apple and other companies do a lot more innovation on things as AR and VR, extending our existing applications and continuously looking at new opportunities like we did with Project Felix to enable people to author [ph] for those. There is no question that\u2019s going to lead to both an increased set of new users as well as established users asking from Adobe support for all of those new media types. So both represent long-term opportunities for us, and we\u2019re pleased with the performance. Tom Mao : And just a quick follow-up. It looks like your sales and marketing expense grew 14% year-on-year. Can you talk about where you are in terms of adding sales capacity on digital marketing side and how, we should think about that initiative, as we head into 2018? Mark Garrett : Yes. It\u2019s Mark. We\u2019ve said for a while now that our incremental spend, if you look at it quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year, is going to be primarily in sales and marketing and R&D. And we\u2019re going to need to continue to invest in sales and marketing to drive both, awareness on the Creative Cloud side and sales capacity on the digital marketing side. So, I don\u2019t foresee that changing, especially as you look out and we continue to drive growth in both of those businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from Nate Cunningham from Guggenheim. Nate, your line is open. Nate Cunningham : Shantanu, on the marketing side of the business, what do you see as the strategic gaps in your portfolio? And what are some areas where we could see you either partnering or making acquisitions in the future? Shantanu Narayen : Well, let\u2019s start with the partnering. We clearly see an opportunity with Microsoft to partner. We have -- that\u2019s far more than a press release, we\u2019re open for business on that particular front, both with AEM and with Campaign in terms of managed service implementation on Azure and integration with Dynamics as well as integration with the PowerBI is certainly an opportunity. That pipeline is growing very healthily. We will be at Microsoft events. I think they\u2019ve been participating in the Adobe events. So, on partnership wide, we have a platform that enables a number of small startups to also benefit from and leverage our data assets. That\u2019s the one that I would highlight first and foremost. With respect to M&A, I\u2019m certainly not going to highlight for the smaller companies that may be on our radar, what we are interested in to drive our price. But, we feel really good about the overall portfolio that we have. And in terms of the available market and growth opportunities for what we already have, we feel really good. We will continuously look at adjacencies in order to continue to extend our lead, but nothing stands out as a weakness or gap in our portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Keith, your line is open. Keith Bachman : Hi. Many thanks. Shantanu, I wanted to try this for you. Going back to the Marketing Cloud and you commented in your formal remarks the Experience Cloud that you expect FY17 to be better than 20% organic bookings growth. And yet, I\u2019m trying to understand how to reconcile, because there was clearly some degradation in the Q4 guidance. And I understand it\u2019s a tough comp where you\u2019re talking about 17%, but that still includes TubeMogul, which is mostly in the quarter. And so, as we think about the business, as you look out beyond this quarter, can the Experience Cloud grow on an organic basis more -- is 20% the message that we should be thinking about as we look at next fiscal year for the growth of the Experience Cloud? Shantanu Narayen : I think those are two separate issues. And we want to make sure, Keith that we separate the two separate issues. Because when we started the second half of the year and provided targets for the remainder of the year for the Digital Marketing revenue segment, even at that point, we had talked about while we were targeting 25% which is now 24%, we expected sequentially Q3 to be higher from a year-over-year growth perspective than Q4. So, there is nothing that you should read into the 17% because that\u2019s something that we had outlined at the beginning of the second half of the year. So, I wanted to make sure we clarified that. Mark Garrett : And the reason Keith that we had a 25% target as opposed to what used to be a 20% target for revenue was specifically because of Tube. So, that was factored in both the quarter and the year. Shantanu Narayen : Correct. And as it relates to the long-term growth prospects, I think we\u2019ve outlined how large this opportunity is. We\u2019re not proving FY18 targets right now. But nothing has changed, as it relates to the substantial opportunity that exists for the offerings that we have as people embark on digital transformation. Keith Bachman : Okay. Will you provide some specific context associated with the upcoming Analyst Event? Mark Garrett : At Analyst Day, yes, we will provide much more context. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Alex, your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So, maybe the first question on Marketing Cloud specifically. Were there any changes to sales teams or sales leadership or do you anticipate making them on the digital marketing side? And then, Shantanu, maybe a big picture question along the same lines, not necessarily what a gap you have in the marketing portfolio. But if you stack rank your ability to weigh [ph] your success in continued market leadership in B2C marketing into B2B or do you need a customer record or a customer dataset to be able to do that and/or do you look at maybe going down market as easier pathway to continued growth? So, just big picture and a small -- more specific account there? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I think on the first question, I mean, there\u2019s nothing that we are outlining except continued focus on execution with respect to sales execution. So, that one is an easy one. As it relates to the stack ranking, I think you are right in saying that B2C clearly represented the first beachhead in terms of people who are embarking on digital transformation. However, there are a number of customers who are already in the B2B space who are adopting our solutions because they are going through absolutely the same scenarios and they have been using our solutions in order to deliver digital transformation whether it\u2019s B2B or B2C. So while the first beachhead was B2C, we have already made traction and continue to see opportunity in B2B. As it relates to your question around going down market and the existence of a customer record, I think the big differentiation in our particular product is not about the customer record as much as it\u2019s the ability to in real time deliver the customer experience. And I think over time, the existence of what\u2019s on disc as a customer record is far less important than what is in memory in terms of being able to deliver the digital experience. So, I think the game is completely changing to an in-memory how do you action based on all the data that you have, the behavior, the demographics rather than an existence or a flat file or a record associated with it. And that\u2019s really what we are focused on. We talk about it as the last millisecond in the Experience Cloud. And big picture, I think that\u2019s where we will continue to across all digital touchpoints where a customer engages with an enterprise, ensure that we deliver the best possible customer experience. And given that was the last question, in close, we are absolutely proud of the strong financial results we reported in Q3. And I think you\u2019re clearly seeing the leverage that exists in our business model. We remain excited about the growth opportunities, clear the strategy, whether it\u2019s empowering people to bring their creativity to life or enabling businesses to transform, continuous to resonate with customers from individuals to the larger enterprises. We have a strong portfolio of products. And this represents multiple multi-year growth opportunities. And we continue to be one of the only companies that\u2019s delivering stellar top-line and bottom-line financial results. We hope you are going to join us at MAX because we are going to showcase tremendous innovation and we will provide update at our Analyst Meeting in conjunction with MAX. With that, thank you for joining us today. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call. Thanks everyone.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. FY '17 was another strong year for Adobe, highlighted by record Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud revenue and capped off by the first ever $2 billion quarter in company history. In Q4 we delivered revenue of $2.01 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $1, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.26. For the year we grew total revenue to $7.3 billion which represents 25% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY '17 was $3.38 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.31. Our strong results are validation of the relevance of Adobe's mission to change the world through digital experiences. That vision serves a broad and diversified set of customers from artists, students and anyone with a story to tell to the world's most prestigious brands, media companies and institutions all of whom are betting their future on Adobe as they embrace the opportunities of digital transformation. In digital media Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud are fundamental to how people and businesses communicate, entertain and engage with each other. We exited the year with more than 5.2 billion of digital media annualized recurring revenue or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was 359 million, fueled by our ability to attract and retain new users, deepened product engagement and drive new opportunities through services. Creative Cloud remains the gold standard for creativity and design. Tens of millions of people use Creative Cloud and it is becoming the creativity platform for all. We achieved Creative revenue of 1.16 billion in Q4. For the year we achieved Creative revenue of 4.2 billion which represents 31% year-over-year growth. At our annual Max Creativity Conference in October we introduced the next generation of Creative Cloud including a set of new applications across the design, video and photography segments. Highlights included the introduction of Adobe XD, our tool for end-to-end UX/UI design, Adobe Dimension, which greatly simplifies 3D design, Adobe Character Animator, which brings 2D puppets to life using voice, facial expressions and gestures; and Adobe Lightroom CC, our photography cloud service that works across desktop, mobile and web to edit, organize, store and share photos. We have delivered on Creative Cloud\u2019s promise to bring continuous innovation through updates to our flagship products including Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere Pro. We introduced a premium version of Adobe Spark, our tool for helping everyone communicate their ideas visually. Spark with Premium Features offers enhanced customization capabilities for branded graphics, web pages, and video stories and is a key part of Adobe\u2019s strategy to introduce our creative tools to a wider audience of storytellers. The value of Creative Cloud is enhanced through the delivery of innovative new cloud services. Adobe Stock has continued its steady growth as we innovate in areas like aesthetic search and introduce new features and content such as Motion Graphics templates. We\u2019ve continued to add new contributor features to Adobe Stock, allowing our community to customize their portfolios and present their best work.  Last week we announced that Scott Belsky, co-founder of Behance, returned to Adobe as Chief Product Officer, and EVP of Creative Cloud and has joined my staff. Scott is one of the most admired leaders in the design community. In this role, he will focus on product delivery and driving long-term innovation for Creative Cloud products and services. Scott will partner closely with Bryan Lamkin, EVP and General Manager of Digital Media, as we continue to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with Creative Cloud and drive continued growth and customer engagement. The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, is enabling businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was 235 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to 600 million. We achieved annual revenue of 837 million for Document Cloud in FY'17.  Mobile has become the new frontier for Document Cloud. This quarter, we announced new updates to Adobe Scan which leverage Adobe Sensei to capture and create intelligent PDFs on your mobile device. To date, Adobe Scan has had more than 5 million downloads. Adobe Creative is the leader in the digital marketing category, which has redefined the enterprise software landscape. Today, we are targeting the much broader Experience Business opportunity which we estimate to be a 53 billion addressable market in 2020. In Q4 we achieved Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of 550 million, resulting in annual revenue of 2.03 billion. In an era when entire industries are being disrupted, every business must now compete for the hearts and minds of their customers with every click and every interaction. With Adobe Experience Cloud, we are transforming how businesses compete in this new reality. Our offering includes Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud, making it the industry\u2019s most complete and integrated offering.  Adobe Advertising Cloud is the first end-to-end platform that helps marketers manage their ad spend across all digital formats including display, search and video, as well as traditional TV. It\u2019s been a year since our acquisition of TubeMogul and we have successfully integrated the technology with Adobe Media Optimizer. This has played a key role in driving strong Advertising Cloud performance and leadership in the digital advertising space. We introduced several advancements to Advertising Cloud, including the release of the Adobe Advertising Cloud Mobile App, the industry\u2019s first mobile app for cross-channel advertising campaign management.  Adobe Analytics Cloud continues to be the intelligence engine for the enterprise, combining digital and offline data to help brands move from insight to action. Recently, Gartner positioned Adobe as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Analytics research report, for the third year in a row. Adobe was also recognized as a leader in the recent The Forrester Wave : Web Analytics report. Adobe Experience Cloud processed approximately 65 trillion data transactions for its customers in Q4, and 186 trillion data transactions in the trailing four quarters. The insights gleaned from this data provide a valuable window into customer behavior and business trends. Our annual Holiday Shopping Report has become the industry benchmark for measuring the trajectory of ecommerce spending and trends. This year we accurately predicted Cyber Monday to be the largest online sales day in U.S. history. Underscoring the importance of delivering a great mobile shopping experience, revenue driven by smartphones hit an all-time high of more than $1.59 billion on Cyber Monday. Together with Microsoft, we are now enabling enterprise marketers to deliver one-to-one personalization of web content at scale and connect any lead generation data captured on the web to their CRM system through Adobe Experience Manager integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365. To date, more than 50 enterprises leverage Adobe and Microsoft\u2019s joint offerings including Air Canada, Great West Life Assurance and the U.S. Army. Other significant customer wins in the quarter included Allianz, Barclays, BNP Paribas, IKEA, JPMorgan, Mattel, and Opel. The centerpiece of our innovation efforts across Adobe is Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework. We\u2019ve invested heavily to make Sensei a foundational part of our offerings to both our creative and enterprise customers. With Adobe\u2019s massive volume of content and data assets fueling Adobe Sensei, and our unmatched domain expertise in creativity, documents and experiences, Sensei is a critical differentiator for our business. Last week, we celebrated Adobe\u2019s 35th anniversary. I know I speak for our 18,000 Adobe employees around the world when I share how proud we are of everything we\u2019ve achieved as a company, not only the strong business results, but the impact Adobe has made in the markets we serve and in the communities where we do business. We were recently recognized by Glassdoor as a 2018 Best Places to Work, as well as a World\u2019s Best Workplace and one of the Best Workplaces for Diversity by Fortune. We recently announced that Adobe has achieved equal pay between men and women in the U.S., an important milestone in Adobe\u2019s ongoing efforts to create an inclusive and rewarding environment for all employees.  The pride in what we\u2019ve accomplished is exceeded by our excitement about Adobe\u2019s future. With our strong brand, our compelling strategy, and our culture of innovation, our best days remain ahead of us. We\u2019re looking forward to a fantastic 2018. Mark? Mark Garrett : Thanks, Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2017 results. In FY17, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $7.3 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth.  GAAP EPS for the year was $3.38, and non-GAAP EPS was $4.31. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy, and noteworthy achievements, including record Creative revenue with 31% year-over-year revenue growth and exiting the year with $4.63 billion of Creative ARR; record Document Cloud revenue of $837 million and exiting the year with $600 million of Document Cloud ARR; record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.03 billion, which represents 24% annual year-over-year growth. Generating a record $2.91 billion in operating cash flow during the year, growing deferred revenue to approximately $2.5 billion, and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.9 billion exiting the year; together, this represents approximately $6.4 billion of contracted revenue; and returning over $1.1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of FY'17, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.01 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.00 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.26.  Highlights in Q4 included : record Creative revenue of $1.16 billion; record Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $235 million; record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $550 million; record net new Digital Media ARR of $359 million; and record cash flow from operations of $833 million. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $359 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $5.23 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, Creative revenue grew 30% year-over-year and we increased Creative ARR by $315 million during Q4. The strong quarter for our Creative business was achieved across several areas : strong net new subscriptions, helped by increased Adobe.com traffic after the Adobe MAX announcements and end-of-year promotions; stable or improving ARPU across key offerings; the attachment of services with Team and Enterprise offerings; and continued momentum with Adobe Stock. With Document Cloud, we achieved record revenue with 23% year-over-year growth. The performance in Q4 was driven by continued strength with Acrobat subscription adoption, normal Q4 enterprise seasonality, and strong year-end Acrobat perpetual product licensing through the channel. Unit growth for Acrobat DC across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud accelerated again in Q4, pushing total year-over-year Acrobat unit growth to over 20% for FY'17. Adobe Sign also achieved strong results, and contributed to Document Cloud ARR growth. In Digital Marketing, we exceeded $2 billion of Adobe Experience Cloud revenue for the year, with 24% annual revenue growth. Advertising Cloud had a strong year, and we achieved the expectations we set in January for TubeMogul.  Excluding the addition of TubeMogul, Experience Cloud subscription revenue grew 22% year-over-year during FY'17. Subscription revenue growth was helped by strong performance with Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Campaign and Adobe Audience Manager during the year. In Q4, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $550 million, which represents 18% year-over-year growth. We drove strong sequential subscription bookings growth from Q3 to Q4, reflecting typical enterprise year-end strength. Multi-solution selling in our top accounts and strong bookings of the Adobe/Microsoft solutions drove this sequential growth. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by 11.1 million. We had 1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY'17, versus 0.2 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY'17; thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was 11.9 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by 4.1 million.  We had 1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY'17, versus 8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY'16; thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was 3 million. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 22% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 55 days, which compares to 47 days in the year-ago quarter, and 50 days last quarter. Our DSO has increased slightly over the past year given the nature of the Advertising Cloud business model and the addition of the TubeMogul business. Deferred revenue grew to a record 2.49 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was 5.8 billion.  Cash flow from operations was a record 833 million in the quarter. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at a cost of 297 million. During the year, we repurchased 8.2 million shares, returning 1.1 billion dollars to stockholders. We have approximately 1.9 billion remaining of our 2.5 billion stock repurchase authority granted in January 2017. Now I will provide our financial outlook. Entering FY'18, we are excited about our momentum and the large addressable markets we discussed at our recent analyst meeting. We remain well-positioned to continue to deliver strong top-line and bottom line growth. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary we revalue ARR at year-end for the current currency rates.  FX rate changes between December of last year and this year have resulted in a 154 million increase in Digital Media ARR. This increases our FY'18 beginning Digital Media ARR to 5.39 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated investor data sheet, and ARR results will be measured against this amount during FY'18. In FY'18, we are targeting : total adobe revenue of approximately 8.725 billion; digital media segment revenue growth of approximately 23%; Adobe Experience Cloud subscription revenue growth of approximately 20%; adobe experience cloud total revenue growth of approximately 15%; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $4.40; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $5.50; net new digital media ARR of approximately 1.1 billion; and Adobe experience cloud subscription bookings growth of approximately 20%. We expect quarterly revenue, earnings per share and Digital Media ARR results to follow similar seasonality as was achieved in FY'2017. In Q1 FY'18, we are targeting : revenue of approximately $2.40 billion; digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%; Experience Cloud year-over-year total revenue growth of approximately 15%; tax rate of approximately 9% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 500 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.15; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.27; and net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $275 million. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is seasonally higher in Q4, and typically decreases sequentially in Q1 due to several year-end related disbursements made during our first quarter. In summary, 2017 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader across our key businesses, and are executing well against a large and growing addressable market. We\u2019re excited about what lies ahead for Adobe and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming year. Mike? Mike Saviage : Thanks, Mark. Beginning with our Q1 FY18 earnings report in March, we will modify our segment reporting moving forward. LiveCycle and Connect, which have been reported in our Digital Marketing segment, will be moved to a new segment called Publishing which will include the current Print and Publishing segment products. We will also rename our Digital Marketing segment to Digital Experience. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we will publish an updated investor data sheet in late January with historical information adjusted to reflect the segment changes. The updated data sheet will coincide with the issuance of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for FY'17 which will also reflect these changes.  Adobe Summit, the world\u2019s largest digital marketing conference, is scheduled for the last week in March, with Day One on Tuesday March 27. An invitation with registration and discounted Summit pricing information will be sent out in January to our investor and analyst email list. More details about the conference will be available at summit.adobe.com.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. Mark, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the comment you made about the traffic uptick you saw post MAX to the adobe.com site and you also added promotional activity in there but specifically the post-MAX uptick, was that sort of what you normally would see after a MAX event or was it different this time? And what were the types of products that were really benefitting from that uptick in traffic. Was it the traditional fully configured Creative Cloud or were you seeing more activity around some of the newer product offerings? Shantanu Narayen : Why don't I take that? In terms of what we saw after MAX if you recall MAX was perhaps the most productive release ever in the history of the company in terms of the five new products that we had introduced. At the end of Q4 if you look at the business that we have both in terms of single app adoption which continues to grow as well as the CC complete which continues to grow. I would say the photography offering continues to be a very popular offering we introduced a new version of Lightroom and so that\u2019s seeing good traction.  The second product I would highlight would be XD which is the product for screen design, everything that the creators are doing in terms of designing new interfaces for products across a variety of screens. And then we saw the traditional strength in the existing products that we continue to see namely Photoshop, Illustrator, the video products continue to do well as well. So, I think this is something that we do standard which is, we just continue to make sure that we are delivering great innovation for our customers. MAX certainly represents the culmination of a lot of effort and so as expected the attention that we bring to it drives more traffic. Jennifer Lowe : And maybe just one more if I can. On the Experience Cloud I know in Q3 there was some color around extending sales cycles, bigger deals, the longer sales cycles. I'm curious if that was the trend you saw in Q4 as well or if there was any change there? Shantanu Narayen : We had a really strong close to the end of the year so the sequential increase in bookings from Q3 to Q4 as is consistent with year-end seasonality, we were pleased with the strength associated with that in terms of the subscription bookings for the years as well. We were pleased with that advertising cloud had a good quarter as well. So, the opportunity continues to be really large as we talked about the $53 billion-dollar opportunity that we have we\u2019re the undisputed leader. And our innovation is really helping our enterprise customers with their digital transformation needs. Mark Garrett : And I would add just add a little bit to that subscription bookings were up 20% for the quarter and for the full year which is what we had targeted back at Q3. And the subscription organic revenue I said this in my prepared remarks even without the benefit of 2 was up 22% year-over-year. And that subscription revenue as we have said is the way we are really going to start to measure the health of the business. So, we were really pleased with both of those. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Mark I'm wondering if relative to what you are thinking about for ARR the progression and the number for the year, you expect any impact from customers buying ahead of this price increase. And any impact you saw generally in terms of customer behavior reacting to that move you made? Mark Garrett : So, we have not seen any indication that people are buying just ahead of the price increase. We just think the strength that we saw in the fourth quarter was coming off as Shantanu said MAX as well as just Q4 seasonality. And the truth of the matter is if people are buying ahead of the price increase that\u2019s great, because just like we do with promotions that brings people into the franchise and allows us to move them up the ladder so to speak later. So, either way we are happy but we don\u2019t think Q4 was a result of people buying early. Shantanu Narayen : A big picture in terms of the overall demand for Creative Cloud, it continues to be clearly the one stop shop for creativity and the increase in the ARR that we issued as a target is more a reflection of just the continued comprehensive nature of the offering, the adoption that we're continuing to see in international markets rather than necessarily anything different in terms of what we expect for the price increase which as we said at the Analyst call we expect to be low this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill. Your line is open. Brent Thill : On Experience Cloud, Shantanu are there new routes to market, or new ways you're thinking about distribution for that business as you head into the new fiscal year? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Brent, I mean as that business continues to expand and continues to grow well, I think the first phase of that business was clearly everything that we were doing direct with large verticals in what we would call the strategic accounts in specific verticals, and B2C was a big push associated with that, we're seeing quite a bit of adoption in B2B and consistent with the way I think every other enterprise software company would do we're looking not just at the strategic and corporate accounts but expanding into Greenfield territory both in the United States and abroad so that continues to be an area of push and as you can imagine that happens both with our direct sales force as well as with the ecosystem of partners that continues to be really key for us in terms of growth in that business. We talked and touched on the Microsoft partnership and how that's yielding good implementations with customers and we expect that momentum to continue but also whether it'd be digital agencies or SI partners they're certainly bringing us into more of their accounts. So, just continued expansion and we're pleased with the execution that we have there. Brent Thill : Mark just to clarify on Experience Cloud to Jen\u2019s question, I wanted to be clear, the deals that did push in Q3, it's not like some of those came back into Q4, but did you see other deals extend out into the next fiscal year that were not closed yet? Shantanu Narayen : Brent maybe I'll take that one as well, I mean the pipeline just continues to be an evergreen pipeline and we're continuing to both close deals, we're continuing to up sell, when we looked at the number of large deals that we have and we think about the number of customers who are adopting multi solution deals that has certainly increased which we look at as good validation of the comprehensive and integrated nature of our product but you've been tracking enterprise software for a long time, we had a great sequential bookings quarter between Q3 and Q4 but pipeline is an evergreen thing that we'll continue to put a lot of focus on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Congrats. Maybe Shantanu first, just on the Document Cloud, you highlighted Acrobat DC units up 20% growth. Any context for that in terms of history and then I had a follow-up for Mark? Shantanu Narayen : Sure Ross, I mean I think it's driven a lot by PDF adoption on mobile devices and PDF continuing to be the best way for people to share files across devices, when we think about PDF adoption it actually accelerated in Q4, over the rest of the year which as we've been saying all along was pretty strong. Primarily we've seen people adopt the subscription which is consistent with what we're doing across the Creative Cloud but we also saw some traditional strength that we expect at the end of the year with respect to enterprises continuing to either true up or do licensing of the perpetual version. We're pleased with that and that provided some nice upside. There's a significantly larger install based of Acrobat that isn\u2019t on the subscription and as people continue to adopt both the subscription offering, which is the primary offering, as well as the perpetual that just signifies good growth opportunity for us. But specifically, we saw quite a bit of licensing of the perpetual new Acrobat DC product at the end of the year as enterprises use the end of cycle to true up and buy more product. Ross MacMillan : And Mark, just a clarification. So, when you rebase the end of the year Digital Media ARR, the way I think about it is it\u2019s the rebase on the base. So, 154 and 5.23 billion is about 3% rebase. And then every new ARR dollar that comes into fiscal \u201918 is going to be commensurately higher at 3%. I just wanted then to think about that in the context of what you\u2019d said previously about net new ARR of 1 billion and now 1.1 billion, I would argue that\u2019s 10% higher, not 3% higher. So, it\u2019s an implicit raise and I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about that correctly. Mark Garrett : For sure, this is an implicit raise. Shantanu Narayen : Explicit raise, Ross. Ross MacMillan : Explicit raise, I\u2019m just a bit slow tonight. Mark Garrett : Yes. The 100 million has little to do currency, it\u2019s more based on our over achievement through the year and what we expect to deliver in \u201918. So, it\u2019s not a currency related raise. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss. Your line is open. Stan Zlotsky : It\u2019s actually not Keith Weiss, its Stan Zlotsky seating in on his behalf. But thank you so much for taking our question. Around the large deal that you\u2019re seen on ground experience manager and approach services that are associated with those deals. Should we expect given the complexity deal that you part services would maybe take up a little bit in order to dedicate the proper resources to these large strategic implementations? Shantanu Narayen : Stan, the Analyst Meeting, we actually talked about given the robustness of the ecosystem that we will be leveraging the ecosystem more to do the actual implementation of these whether they be for the entire marketing cloud or for Adobe experience managers specifically that\u2019s part of the reason, why when we talk about our bookings growth it's going to be greater than the revenue growth that we report, that includes services. So, a great ecosystem of partners, I think we\u2019re focusing on some specialized services with these customers, which is at the very strategic level. But for the most part, we have a great set of partners, who will be doing the heavy lifting associated with the implementation of not just experience manager, but the rest of our solutions and in fact our clouds with the customers. Stan Zlotsky : And just a quick follow-up. The 50 joint customers you now have with Microsoft, you mentioned a few sample logos. But from a go-to-market perspective how do these opportunities could develop, who brings into the deal and are the logos that you mentioned are they kind of representative of the typical logo that we would see within that list of 50? Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Stan, I think the real goal for us was to demonstrate that we are open for business, the stuff is actually working, customers are excited about as you can expect in these cases, it\u2019s both joint selling between Microsoft and us, its us bringing them into deals, its them bringing us into deals and its partners bringing both of us into deals. So, it's the usual combination that you see in the enterprise in terms of how people adopt software. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini. Your line is open. Mark Grant : Hi. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a quick for me on marketing and analytics. We got the announcement last month, the partnership with Google Analytics and Salesforce. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you interpret that, what you think the competitive landscapes is going to be looking like over the next little while. And just any interpretation you can offer there. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think we've always talked about how we have been the leaders in creating those categories and how the analytics that we have is without a doubt one of the secret sauces and the biggest competitive advantage that we continue to have. Enabling integration between that Analytics as well as our other solutions has been over a five-year effort and we've integrated it. And I think it's just of a reflection that others in the marketplace are understanding that Adobe has a significant competitive advantage with respect to everybody else. But big picture this is an incredibly large opportunity. We're the leader we're going to continue to innovate. We're seeing great customer wins and there will be competition in the space as well as we expect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks, good evening. One each on Creative Cloud and the digital marketing business. On Creative Cloud when we think about the new product roadmap that you laid out at MAX, and couple that with the creation of a new position with the Scott's joining the company as Chief Product Officer, could you perhaps talk about some of the objectives over the next number of years for Creative Cloud? And what I have in mind specifically is would you think there is any sense to perhaps re-segmenting the product line as you once did with CS and use that as a means to further drive APRU upside?  Secondly on the marketing cloud, you've spoken in the past of having four dozen or more use cases across multiple industries and as well an objective of eventually having more of a single sign-on or a usage model across all the products. Could you in that score talk about perhaps the momentum across the various verticals or use cases that you're seeing or perhaps talked about? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Jay. I mean first on the Creative Cloud, the success that we've continued to see it's the golden age of creativity and design right now. And when you think about what's happening with Augmented Reality, Virtual reality, artificial intelligence, the kinds of mobile apps that are being created at Adobe. We're just attracting the best. And as you know, we focused tremendously on product Scott is phenomenal at that. And we're just attracting the best in the world to continue to help us push the envelope on being the design and creativity applications. So, thrilled to have him onboard. I would not read into that necessarily anything different with respect to segmenting that. I would definitely read into that that we continue to focus on innovation and making sure that we lead that market the way we've been doing.  And with respect to your question on the Marketing Cloud, we will continue to demonstrate all of the different use cases. We will continue to focus on vertical industries, we will focus on sort of how people are using this at high level for things like personalization or multichannel engagement with our customers. But from our point of view, the integration associated with these products, every year it gets better. So, the notion of a single sign on that you're talking about and the fact that our customers can think about audience segmentation and demographics, or campaigns, or promotion or content velocity already within this platform, we're so far ahead of where the rest of the market is, but you can correctly continue to expect us to make both the integration better as well as the individual point products better. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana. Your line is open. Samad Samana : So, I had a question on the company's partner program, it's something that your competitors and enterprise software talk about a lot and I think the companies have been talking a lot more about them as well, I was wondering if you maybe could help us understand how much of Experience Cloud bookings they help you close out and maybe how we could think about that contribution changing in fiscal '18 as you come off of the changes that you put in place in fiscal '17? Shantanu Narayen : I think when you look at the partner program, there're multiple dimensions to it but very quickly the first dimension to it certainly is that all of our products when we architect our products just allow developers whether they be individual developers, whether they be enterprises, whether they be system integrators or agencies, to extend our products and so them having their secret sauce to augment our products is a key part of one of our partner strategy.  With respect to implementation and strategy services, again the traditional SIs and digital agencies are very much part of the ecosystem in terms of both implementation, architecture, services and strategy, and as is probably similar to everybody else in this space when you think about the large deals and the large customers that we have most of these customers have engagement with some partners as well, and so the partner involvement in these accounts will only continue to increase with the strategic nature of this, but everybody has an Adobe practice you'll see at our kickoff that we have, they're very well represented as well as our summit where we have a Partner Day, so we're pleased with the partner interest and we will continue to leverage it because it's in our best interest as well as in the customer's best interest. Samad Samana : And then maybe Mark if I can just ask a follow-up the guidance for 15% growth in the first quarter for Experience Cloud I believe implies kind of flat revenue from 4Q to 1Q, could you maybe help us think about seasonality for that business and how we should think about the growth cadence across the quarters? Mark Garrett : I mean we've said that if you model out the business next year it'll follow typical patterns that you saw in 2017 so I think you should expect whether that's total company or even down to the segment level, things following along similar growth patterns to what you saw in '17. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia. Saket Kalia : Mark perhaps a less exciting question about the business but topical nonetheless, I guess I was just wanted to ask about tax structure and the impact of potential reform, so I guess I understand that a lot of it is still very uncertain, can you just give some broad brushes about how free tax income and tax rates in the U.S. maybe compared to the rest of the world and how you are thinking about potential tax reform for Adobe? Mark Garrett : Yes, I mean obviously as you said based on the fact that this isn't final yet, I can't comment too much. I'll say we clearly believe that the tax code needs to be overhauled, that its outdated and we clearly are excited about the proposition to really access foreign cash. So, based on what I see this is all very positive for Adobe. It would result we believe in a lower tax rate for us. It would result we believe in our ability to access foreign cash. The good news for Adobe as well is that we have been accruing for a significant percentage of our foreign cash at a 30% tax rate. So, if this passes at a 14% rate on all our foreign cash you wouldn\u2019t see a significant P&L hit, because basically we have already accrued that tax which is great from the Adobe's perspective. So, we will see where it plays out but based on what we see so far, it's very positive from our perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman. Your line is open. Keith Bachman : I was wondering if you care to make some comments on cash flow for FY '18 and the context of the question is either as our percent of revenue or cash flow growth rates. You mentioned previously and it was in Q4 your days receivable were up. Is there anything you want to call out? Or give us any kind of context for cash flow guidance for CY'18 or FY'18 rather. Mark Garrett : So, the only significant change to the way we have been executing so far is that as I said DSO is up a little bit because of the two-mobile business just being a different kind of a business from a collections perspective. But outside of that we gave you margin and earnings guidance for next year that will continue to drive good strong cash flow. I did say Q1 there is some seasonality in cash flow because it makes a lot of year end disbursements based on accruals that we make in the fourth quarter, but we are continuing to drive growth in cash flow. That\u2019s about all I can tell you right now. But I fully expect that cash flow will be up again significantly next year. Keith Bachman : And I'll ask a quick follow up if I could -- your total book business the 6.9 million was up about 18%, so strong growth, but relative to your guidance of revenue growth it's a little less than what the revenue guidance is. How should we think about that number as a proxy going forward in terms of the total book business relative to revenue guidance? Mark Garrett : So deferred revenue was up 24%, unbilled navy was up less than that year-over-year. But we are pretty pleased with just that total number of 6.4 billion and the growth that that generates going into next year. It\u2019s a little hard to take just that and think about how that compares to revenue growth because it's a little bit apples and oranges not all of the revenue comes off of deferred or unbilled. So, you kind of have to look at them separately. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne. Your line is open. Tom Roderick : This is Tom on for Kirk. So, I was actually wondering about the transition of ETLA contracts to subscription and how that\u2019s impacting your growth in Creative Cloud? And what are your expectations for that transition heading into 2018? Shantanu Narayen : Tom on the Creative Cloud side, a lot of those transitions have actually happened and what we are actually seeing and what we focus on even more right now. Two things, one is name user deployment, so ensuring that the adoption of the new Creative Cloud within enterprises is high and second, adoption of services. So, I would say the transition of enterprise customers from buying perpetual to buying Creative Cloud is largely behind us and really the focus is on adoption of all the new products and services that we have and on ensuring that the named account and deployment is going well from their point of view. I would say on the Acrobat side, they\u2019re still probably some install base that exists, but on the Creative Cloud it\u2019s largely behind us. Tom Roderick : And can you just touch upon your thoughts on opportunities for Document Cloud heading into fiscal year \u201918 and seems like it was picking up momentum in the quarter? Shantanu Narayen : We talk about right through the year, how the unit growth is really been driving momentum not just in the Document Cloud, but also since some of that is reflected in the Creative Cloud and its primarily subscriptions, in fact all of the subscriptions and services that we continue to see such as sign and the scan product is driving more PDF adoption. And so, we continue to think that PDF will be a really important format as people move from inefficient paper based processes to electronic processes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin. Your line is open. Taylor Reiners : This is Taylor Reiners on for Alex. I had a follow-up question on the ETLA question. What are the things that we\u2019ve been hearing in a conversation? Is that, you've been having a lot of increased success on renewals moving ETLA customers from point solutions to the entire Creative Cloud portfolio. Just wondering, if you could speak to what aiming you\u2019re at with respect to its expansion dynamics? Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think the focus that the field organization has in that particular area is really making sure that people understand that there is a complete offering and we have customer success managers who are in there ensuring that people get the value out of it. That\u2019s a program that\u2019s really been working, we do Adobe Day as we do evangelism. And as design is becoming more prevalent within enterprises, I think adoption of either the individual products or the complete product within enterprises is increasing. As with the adoption of the Creative Cloud, we started in North America and now we continue to roll that out. But we think that as we\u2019ve laid out even for individual users moving the core, migrating the core to Creative Cloud and then doing both market expansion and value expansion even with enterprise customers based on the new offerings continues to be headroom for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan. Your line is open. Shankar Subramanian : This is Shankar on behalf of Kash. Congrats on a great quarter. I have a question on the Marketing Cloud. As you work through the adoption curve and get into the mid-sized businesses, can you talk about the adoption trends for marketing solutions? Do you see customers adopting more client solutions versus more than full speed? And is, how much of that is factored into that fiscal \u201918 kind of support. Shantanu Narayen : Well, I will answer the second question first. I mean, we clearly look at everything that\u2019s happening in the marketplace as we think about the guidance that we have because we take it very seriously. But I think I would say in terms of adoption with new customers the multi-solution adoption is primarily the way in which we are going to market, because people see if they're using content management having content management with analytics is really the way to go as well as the audience segmentation part of audience manager. And so, the fact that we have this comprehensive offering from Visitor acquisition to delivery of the content to measurement and monetization, it's really the way we go to market to reflect the depth of our suite and the importance of the platform adoption. Shankar Subramanian : Got it. And I think a follow up, on the Microsoft partnership you talked about the 50 logos that you added on. But you also talked about any up selling that you had based on the partnerships with your existing customers. Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think this is still early, but the initial success that we are seeing is really good. And it was just to reflect when you think about whether it\u2019s the dynamics integration with campaign, whether it's what we are doing with Adobe Experience Manager with Azure, what's happening with PowerBI. The people are adopting both solutions and the momentum in the business is strong. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Adam Holt. Your line is open. Adam Holt : Hey, guys. Thanks so much and congrats on a terrific end to the quarter. I just had two quick ones. One to E-mark [ph]. This is sort of another embarrassment of margin riches and as we look into next year you're looking at 40% margin plus. You are getting into a rare era for software companies. Do you think that this has actually margin upside from 40% or we kind get into the level where you have to reinvest for the growth rates that you all want to achieve? Mark Garrett : Yeah, obviously we are very fortunate to be able to have in my perspective both significant top-line growth that 20% plus and significant margin growth at scale already. We've done a great job over the years of managing margins. If there is anything we know how to do with Adobe that's it. If there are things that we feel that we need to invest in to drive growth, we will do that. But outside of that, we can deliver margins. So, I'm not going to guide beyond the 40%ish that we talked about for next year. But we make those tradeoffs every month as we go through spending in the company and clearly want to drive growth. Adam Holt : And if I can just a quick follow up for Shantanu. When he had talked to Brian Lincoln at our event a couple of weeks ago. He was pretty constructive about the services opportunity and you called it out relative to one of the drivers for the Digital Media cloud. Could you maybe breakdown how do you see that unfolding? What services you're most excited about and how big that can potentially be from a revenue stream? Just order of magnitude not guidance obviously? Thanks so much. Shantanu Narayen : Well thanks Adam. And as it relates to services, the one that we're seeing a fair amount of traction and year-over-year had quite significant growth versus Stock as it relates to Creative Cloud as well as sign as it relates to the Document Cloud. And in addition to that, I mean when we think about the Creative Cloud total addressable market, and we think about market expansion in the $5.7 billion I think we had talked about as the 2020 addressable and $7.1 billion for value expansion. I think the other thing such as storage collaboration I think is a big opportunity ahead of us. The number of people who do the design within an enterprise as it relates to the number of people who will engage in that collaboration, so I expect to see Adobe do more in that particular space.  But I think just continuing to afford our customers, the ability to come -- training we've always said is a -- and learning content is something that's an opportunity associated with it, so at the Analyst Meeting, Adam we gave some numbers but hopefully that also gives you some color in terms of the different services that we have. And since that was the last question, what I wanted to say was as we celebrate our 35th anniversary I know all of us here at Adobe are really proud of the impact that we've had on society and really the continuous innovation that we're delivering across the world by all of our employees.  It feels the strategy that we have empowering people to create and helping businesses transform is really resonating, they represent large addressable markets with very significant tailwinds, the relentless execution we continue to demonstrate, means that we're pretty unique from a financial perspective in terms of both driving top line and bottom line growth profitably, with significant operating margins. We had outstanding financial results in Q4 and FY'17. Our focus in FY'18, continuing to deliver great value to an incredibly diverse set of customers, and so we remain really enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead of us. Thank you for joining us today and wishing you and your families a joyous holiday season. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our call today.",

I would like to welcome you to Adobe Systems' First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go-ahead sir. Mike Saviage : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe's President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; and Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO. In our call today, we will discuss Adobe's first quarter fiscal year 2018 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago. We've also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, financial targets and an updated investor datasheet on Adobe.com. If you would like a copy of these documents, you can go to Adobe's Investor Relations page and find them listed under Quick Links. Before we get started we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue and operating model targets, and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, March 15, 2018, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure in the earnings press release we issued today, as well as Adobe's SEC filings. During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is available in our earnings release and in our updated investor datasheet on Adobe's Investor Relations website. Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live in Adobe Connect, and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe's Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days, and is the property of Adobe. The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. FY2018 is off to a strong start for Adobe as we continue to successfully execute against our strategy. In Q1 we delivered record revenue of $2.08 billion dollars, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $1.17, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.55. Our strategy to empower people to create and transform how businesses compete is working. Our relentless focus on delivering innovation to our customers is continuing to drive our outstanding performance. Across the globe, individuals and companies now recognize that great experiences have become the basis of differentiation in an increasingly competitive and complex world. With the world's best digital media and digital experience cloud-based solutions, Adobe has become the go-to company for helping customers develop and deliver transformative digital experiences. In our Digital Media business, we achieved strong growth in both Creative revenue and Document Cloud revenue for Q1, achieving net new annualized recurring revenue, or ARR growth of $336 million. We exited Q1 with Creative ARR of $5.07 billion, marking the first time Creative ARR has surpassed $5 billion. Across our individual, team and enterprise offerings, we continue to acquire new subscribers through Creative Cloud single app and all app offerings. We focus on retention by driving customer engagement through products, services and community. In addition to strength in our major geographies, emerging markets such as Korea, China and Southeast Asia are beginning to contribute to subscriber growth. Creative Cloud remains the gold standard for creativity and design. We deliver ongoing value to our subscribers through major feature enhancements in our existing flagship applications across desktop and mobile devices. In addition, we are attracting a broader set of consumers and creative professionals through innovative new applications like Adobe Character Animator, Spark, Lightroom CC, Dimension and XD. Adobe XD is an innovative new app for designing experiences across multiple screens. In addition to graphic, mobile and website designers, product managers are adopting this all-in-one solution that combines design, prototyping and collaboration capabilities. We recently delivered workflow enhancements, tighter integration with Photoshop and deeper support for new modalities such as pen and touch. Major companies including Wipro have standardized on XD as their core design product. Video continues to be an explosive category, and our editing and production products including Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, continue to gain momentum among large production houses as well as independent film makers. More than half of the films at the recent Sundance Film Festival were edited with Premiere Pro, as were the majority of virtual reality projects. Adobe Spark makes it easy for everyday communicators to transform their ideas into beautiful visual stories that make an impact with graphics, videos and web pages. Starting next month, Adobe Spark Premium will be accessible to every student globally, and we're already beginning to see strong adoption across school districts in areas like Anaheim in California, Roanoke in Virginia, Burnsville in Minnesota and Deer Park in Texas. In addition to the world's best desktop and mobile tools, we continue to focus on community and services to provide inspiration and accelerate the creative process. Adobe Stock now has a library of more than 80 million images, videos and creative assets. Last month we announced a partnership with the Pantone Color Institute to curate a collection of Adobe Stock Premium images inspired by the top colors in fashion, as well as a gallery of Adobe Stock images that captures the essence of Pantone's always highly-anticipated Color of the Year. It's Pantone, 18-3838 Ultra Violet, for those of you who are curious. Adobe Stock achieved record revenue in the quarter, with greater than 20% year-over-year growth. Adobe Document Cloud is the world's leading digital document service, enabling individuals and businesses to automate inefficient paper-based processes. Acrobat performance across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud was particularly strong in Q1. Document Cloud subscriptions and Acrobat perpetual licensing drove 18% year-over-year revenue growth, and $33 million in net new ARR. As worldwide PDF adoption continues, we are focused on delivering new services including Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign. Adobe Scan, our mobile PDF application that leverages Adobe Sensei to capture and create intelligent PDFs, has been downloaded more than 7 million times. Adobe Sign is now the preferred e-signature solution in Office 365, and we closed our first set of joint customers in the quarter. Digital transformation and the ability to deliver immersive, intelligent and impactful customer experiences is a strategic imperative for businesses and governments worldwide. To drive customer engagement and growth, you need to be an experience business and the Adobe Experience Cloud is the industry's most complete and integrated offering. We achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $554 million in Q1, and strong bookings across Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud. Key customer deals included Braun, City National Bank, Expedia, Ford, the NFL, Rakuten, Samsung and T. Rowe Price. In Q1, Adobe was once again recognized as a leader by industry analyst firms, achieving top scores among evaluated vendors in The Forrester Wave : Enterprise Marketing Software Suites and The Forrester Wave : Cross Channel Campaign Management reports. Adobe was positioned as a Major Player in IDC's Marketscape Worldwide AI in Enterprise Marketing Clouds Vendor Assessment, with Adobe Sensei ranking highest in capabilities.

Mark. Mark Garrett : Thanks Shantanu. In the first quarter of FY18, Adobe's momentum continued with record revenue of $2.08 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.17 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55. We drove strong performance across our product offerings and geographies during the quarter. Highlights in Q1 included, record Digital Media revenue, including Creative revenue of $1.23 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $231 million; record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $554 million; net new Digital Media ARR of $336 million, and exiting Q1 with more than $5 billion of Creative ARR; deferred revenue growth of 25% year-over-year; record cash flow from operations of $990 million; returning over $300 million of cash to our stockholders through stock buyback; and a record 88% of our revenue in Q1 was from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 28% year-over-year. The addition of $336 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $5.72 billion exiting Q1. Within Digital Media, Creative revenue grew 30% year-over-year in Q1 and we increased Creative ARR by $303 million. Several key factors helped drive this growth, including, strong net new subscriptions across user segments and geographies, spanning creative professionals to consumers and students; And quarter-over-quarter growth in ARPU across all product categories. In addition, services are helping to grow Creative ARR and revenue. Adobe Stock had a strong quarter, and Stock and collaboration services helped grow Creative Cloud enterprise ARR. 86% of creative enterprise agreements signed during Q1 included services, which helps expand the use of Creative Cloud within companies and makes it more mission critical to content workflows. During Q1, we finalized the transition on Adobe.com from using US dollar estimates from our third-party ecommerce platform in certain emerging markets, to using transactional level data denominated in local currencies. This transition resulted in a one-time catch-up of approximately $20 million to our ending ARR balance, and is reflected in the Q1 ARR increase. With Document Cloud, we achieved strong revenue with 18% year-over-year growth. The performance in Q1 was driven by continued strength with Acrobat subscription adoption, and perpetual licensing of Acrobat through the channel. Acrobat year-over-year unit growth across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud again exceeded 20%, and Adobe Sign contributed with another solid quarter of revenue and ARR growth. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $554 million which represents 16% year-over-year revenue growth. Subscription revenue grew 22% year-over year. Experience Cloud performance in Q1 was driven by success across our Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Advertising Cloud offerings, with emerging solutions such as Audience Manager, Campaign, Target and Media Optimizer solutions achieving strong results. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $12.2 million. We had $1 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY18, versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY17; thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $12.2 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $35.6 million. We had $1 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY18, versus $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY17. Thus, the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $18.3 million. In Q1, Adobe's effective tax rate was 17% on a GAAP-basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis. These rates are consistent with the updated tax rate targets we provided in January which reflect the impact of the new Tax Act. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 46 days in the year-ago quarter, and 55 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.57 billion, up 25% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $6.15 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $990 million in the quarter. In Q1 FY18 we repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of $301 million, which lowered our diluted share count to less than 500 million shares. We have approximately $1.6 billion remaining of our $2.5 billion stock repurchase authority granted in January 2017. I will provide our financial outlook. In Q2 FY18, we are targeting, revenue of approximately 2.150 billion dollars; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 15%; tax rate of approximately 13% on a GAAP basis, and 11% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 499 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.16; Non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.53; and Net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $330 million. We expect revenue, earnings per share and Digital Media ARR results in Q3 and Q4 to follow similar seasonality as was achieved in FY17. Our leadership in the large addressable markets we created, combined with Adobe's leveraged operating model, contributed to another record quarter in Q1. We look forward to seeing you at Summit.

We will now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Adam Holt : Hi, guys. Thanks very much and congratulations on another spectacular quarter, 60% plus EPS growth, just amazing. I guess my question is for Shantanu. As we head into the Summit event, it's an interesting market. We've been seeing headlines about companies like Procter & Gamble cutting digital media spend. And it's been - it sort of seems like a little bit more of a mixed environment, yet you all continue to do well. And I wanted to, A, get your sense for how the end market feels to you? Whether things like cut on digital spend trickles down into your market? And, B, just thinking about the growth rates, do you feel like you're at steady state with sort of Digital Experience at 15%? Or can that - can you do better as some of your products get more mature? That's it. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Adam. As it relates to digital transformation and what's happening in the Digital Experience business, it actually feels like the spending environment for digital within enterprises remains unaffected by what you're referring to as marketing spend. And the reason for that is that everybody is trying to engage with their customers digitally across touch points. And as you know, our offering, which is the most comprehensive, actually has everything to do with not just the advertising spend aspect of marketing but also the delivery of the content, the multichannel campaign communication, the audience segmentation. And to give you maybe a little bit more color on that, Adam, it's really about - the themes that we hear about are first, every business is trying to do customer segmentation. Every business is trying to do - ensuring that they can personalize the experience they're delivering for their customers, and running the business, frankly, by looking at real-time metrics, which correspond clearly to our Audience Manager product, our Analytics product and our Campaign product. So it feels like long term, the digital media spend is only going to increase. People are going to ask for more attribution associated with it. And so it feels really strong. We had a strong revenue as well as a booking's quarter. The last thing I might say in that is if you look at the underlying business, I think we said in the prepared remarks that the revenue actually grew greater than 20%. And that's as a result of us focusing a lot more on subscription bookings and subscription revenue rather than focusing on services because we have an incredibly large ecosystem of partners. So feels really good and we expect the momentum to continue. Adam Holt : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much and my congratulations as well. Maybe just on actually on Digital Media. I'm curious on the comment on 86% attach of services on Creative Cloud. I'm just curious as to, is there any way to think about how material that is on driving ARPU as you think about that service attach? And then maybe as a follow-up to Mark, was there any impact on new ARR from the impending price increase that went into effect on March 1? Was there any sort of shift of renewals, for example, into Q1? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Ross, with respect to your first question and the environment within the enterprise, we have talked about, during the first time we transitioned enterprise customers from buying the perpetual product to buying the cloud product that we had, in effect, mirrored the various solutions that we had as part of Creative Suite. As we are now increasingly renewing them, we have been doing, I think, a great job of evangelizing the entire suite of products. So the first thing we see as it relates to ARPU increases is people moving from a subset of products to using the entire suite of products. The other thing that we've been doing with enterprises is continuing to reflect the benefits of adopting Adobe Stock, so that they can have access to all of those great content as an on-ramp to accelerate the creativity process as well as things like Creative libraries, which enables an enterprise to globally ensure that they're using the same fonts and colors and assets to ensure consistency and improve what we call as content velocity. And so I think the need from enterprises to really standardize across all of our products and with content management and asset management now becoming an increasingly important thing, it's really great to see both the ARPU increase and the increased adoption of our Creative product within enterprises. And that's certainly contributing to the strength in ARR that you saw. Mark Garrett : And then Ross, as it relates to the price increase in Creative Cloud, it's a process. We started communication with the channel and customers in March. We're trying to be very diligent about the communication and getting it right. The price changes were not in effect in Q1. They'll take effect in Q2. And as we've said from the very beginning, it won't represent a material impact on ARR in '18. Shantanu Narayen : And the last thing I'd maybe add to that, Ross, is we don't think there was some impact associated with the impending price as it related to Q1 results. And so when we look at our Q1 results across geographies, it wasn't as if there was an impact of that in Q1. Mark Garrett : Meaning that people were not buying in advance of the price increase. Ross MacMillan : Yes, exactly. No, I think that was clear from your guide on ARR in Q2. Thanks again, congratulations. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. Shantanu, maybe a question for you, you've commented in your prepared remarks that you were seeing an increase in demand for Creative Cloud in some emerging markets and you named Korea, China, Southeast Asia. And China in particular is an interesting one, given how usage of Creative Suite and may be low monetization. Can you talk a little bit about what your sense is on how much of that is existing paying customers migrating to Creative Cloud versus starting to eat into piracy a bit in that market in particular? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Jennifer. I mean, I think what we are seeing in those emerging markets is actually a phased shift in what we have seen in the other major geographies that we have, which is people love the new innovation that we're providing. People love the comprehensive nature of what we've delivered with Creative Cloud. People, who are casual pirates are now finding that the affordability of the upfront price allows them to actually be legitimate customers of Creative Cloud. And I think the one difference that we have for the first time is in those markets we're able to offer differential pricing and not feel like the differential pricing will cause people to take the product, put it in a box and resell it in the United States. And so I think we've very effectively combated piracy. But I think it just actually reflects with mobile exploding in those particular areas and content creation for mobile being such a large requirement in those emerging markets. It just continues to do well. In different markets the last thing I might say is that there may be different offerings where we are seeing the initial traction. So I would say in the - in some of those emerging markets the traction might be more with team and enterprise, then in individual, but overall I think the trend is really positive. Jennifer Lowe : Okay thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Mark, you mentioned the ARPU was up, quarter-over-quarter in all categories. I think that's a shift in your tone versus kind of the flat to up that you've commented in the past. I am just curious if going forward you expect that trajectory to continue throughout the year? Mark Garrett : Well clearly we are benefiting from continued people coming off of price promotion. As we said we are benefitting from services. As we said stock's doing well and we are benefiting from services there. So that's clearly the trajectory that we see. The price increases, like I said, have not taken affect yet. So that will help down the road as well. Brent Thill : Okay, and just a quick follow-up on close to 42% operating margins. One of the questions that you've gone is as it relates to the reinvestment back in the business, and at the growth rate you are at and the margin structure is there a level where you feel that there is an appropriate reinvestment back for the future you feel that you are balancing that, given where margins are at now? Mark Garrett : Yeah, I mean clearly we think we are balancing it. Q1 strengthen margin and earnings, though was clearly driven by the revenue upside that you saw. And hiring in the first quarter is lower just based on seasonality with hiring. We expect hiring to pick up the balance of the year. We have Summit. We have MAX. We're definitely going to have increased spending as we go through the rest of the year. So I wouldn't look at that 42% as the new watermark. I would look at the revenue and earnings and information we provided for Q2, and you'll see that operating margin will be a little bit lower in Q2. So that's not kind of the new run rate. Shantanu Narayen : And Brent, we'll continue to be very diligent about the opportunities. There are still tremendous opportunities ahead of us. I think our investment in deep technology, you'll see some of the benefits of that at Summit, and with AI and us being continued to recognize in terms of what we are doing with AI, expect to see continued investments in that space. And so we have large opportunities and we're going to continue to focus on driving aggressive growth. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Congrats on another great quarter. I guess one question I maybe had and then a follow-up is just given the upside versus kind of the guide for Digital Media ARR, were you more surprised by the strength in our ARPU growth or new subscriber growth? And maybe also just can you help us stack rank the new subscriber growth coming from the lower SKU customers versus the international subscriber growth? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Again, I would look at the success that we had and what we have seen in the past is maybe a little bit a falloff from Q4 to Q1. And the momentum actually continued, which I think just reflects interest in the Creative products. It continues to be across the board. Clearly, a lot of the new customer acquisition we are seeing is as a result of Single App adoption and we're doing an effective job of completing them to use the entire suite. So I would say it was the new customer adoption that drove more of the ARR than the ARPU. We're doing a good job, however, of engagement, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And as people are coming to their annual cycle or re-upping. And I think as it relates to the specific products, the usual suspects continue to show a lot of strength. Imaging continues to be strong. One interesting thing, we introduced a mobile offering of our product. We're seeing now mobile offering being adopted, and so we're starting to monetize that. We're monetizing Spark, and stock continues to feel good. And last but certainly not least, as we have said, Acrobat and the strength of Acrobat, both as it relates to what we are seeing on subscriptions across Creative and Document Cloud as well as licensing, the licensing tends to be primarily customers who are already using Acrobat and are adding more seats as a result of the strength of their businesses, that was also really encouraging. And all of the Acrobat that's being used as perpetual, that continues to be an opportunity for us down the road to move to subscription. So I feel strong all around. Alex Zukin : Got it. And then, Shantanu, maybe a follow-up on Sensei and AI, are you seeing that given the broader adoption of the suite rather than specific products, are you seeing any of that being driven by Sensei? And maybe the automation of workflows across product lines that you're driving? Shantanu Narayen : Without a doubt. I mean, what people come, and whether it's a company like Reliance Telecommunications in India or Loblaw visited us from Canada or Tourism Australia, or MasterCard, what they're asking us is you guys have transitioned your business to be more direct. Tell us how you are moving from data collection, to insight, to automation, and whether it's in analytics or what we do with anomaly detection, or whether it's in personalization, what we do with recommendations based on data or media attribution in the marketing side. They are clearly expecting and we're delivering on this automated nature of what AI can bring to it. Hopefully you're going to be at Summit and we'll share a little bit more about it. The deep investment that we've also made in our data platform and how you can actually start to get this unified view of a customer, I think a lot of people are finding that very impressive in terms of what that can do for their businesses. So the investment is clearly being recognized and adding value. Alex Zukin : Great, thank you guys. Operator : The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. One for you, Shantanu, and one for Mark. For Shantanu, we've sometimes spoken of the cohort phenomenon within Creative Cloud, that is the aging or mix of older Digital Media customers that you've been trying to move or migrate to CC. So similar question regarding Marketing Cloud, when you think back to the deployment of AEM and MO and so forth, 4, 5, 6, seven years ago, what kind of upgrading phenomenon have you been seeing as part of the business recently? And for Mark, what further gross margin leverage do you think you might still be able to experience? You are at 95% in Digital Media but might there still be some upside there in you are around 63% or so in Digital Marketing? Is there some leverage there? Shantanu Narayen : Jay, as it relates to the Digital Experience business, I think we have always said that with existing customers who have adopted one solution, the strategy has been to continuously demonstrate how the integration of our newer solutions can add more value. I think in the prepared remarks we talked about how some of the emerging solutions showed strength, whether it's Audience Manager, which is being used for customer segmentation and definition. So that's clearly the - how we continue to grow existing accounts as well as increased usage of our products. And with new accounts, it tends to be a little bit more of adoption of the entire platform that's driving it. So I would say the earlier cohorts, because they had originally adopted one or two solutions because that's what the portfolio had, that cohort we focus more on upsells. And the newer cohorts, we are focusing more on the entire story in the platform. Mark Garrett : And then Jay, on gross margin, a lot of that improvement comes from operating efficiency in our hosted costs and it comes from better margin on professional services. I would expect that we'll continue to see margin improvement, probably more so on the Digital Experience side than the Digital Media side. You're not going to see a big movement but you'll see continued improvement in gross margin. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Hi, thanks. Shantanu, on the Digital Marketing side, I'm wondering you bought TubeMogul about a year ago. I'm wondering how you're thinking about M& A in that area, it just does seem like that market's moving pretty quickly and acquisitions could be a part of the future. Just curious, anything especially anything large you might be contemplating in that area? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Walter, I think with the acquisition of Tube, we became the most comprehensive offering already in the market and adding the ability to do linear, nonlinear and adding TV to the mix of search, social, display really was good. So we feel good about our opportunity there. And it's unlikely that there's anything large that's going to change. We like what we have organically, Walter. Walter Pritchard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : First of all, congratulations to Mark Garrett on your retirement. Outstanding job, and still be tremendous value. I think it will go down as one of the best. And a question for you, Shantanu. When you look at the old cycle, which ended I think you gave CS installed base of 12.8 million, I forget how many years back that was. Now you got a different word [ph] to your point, it's more mobile, it's more smartphones. What is your best prognostication as to how the days of the old Creative users will play out in the next cycle? Are we looking at an addressable opportunity in terms of even it's a job creation that is multiples of what the old base? Because we're used to analyzing Adobe through the lens of this is the old cycle, this is the old base, this is where the company matures, and whatnot. Can help us understand some numbers in perspective as to why the addressable market could be, if I'm right, it could be multiple, given mobile and a whole bunch of other factors that just did not exist in the prior cycle. That's it for me. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Well, Kash, you're right that we about the fact that we look at it as not just as a migration opportunity but a very significant new opportunity as it relates to the importance of creativity, everything from K-12, which is why we try to give an example of how Spark is used there. It was never really a migration story and as people like you have recognized that it's been a hugely expansive story in terms of attracting new customers. And what we try and do, and that's probably more appropriate at our analyst call, is to continue to show how big that TAM is, when we talk about the $20 billion TAM and the number of users and the different offerings that we have. And so within the company, we're just focused on how do we keep adding more subscribers, the migration is not the first, second or third thing we talk about. We talk about the acquisition, we talk about engagement. And our product like XD, every product manager in the world should be using it. When we talk about everyone has a story to tell and the media types that they are using to tell that story and the devices that they are using to tell that story on and the modalities that they're using to create that story, it has never been more exciting in terms of what we can do for content creation. And I think our teams are doing an incredible job at innovating. So it's clearly a multiple of what we considered at the peak of the Creative Suite. And it really should be. I'd love to see every single student in K-12 as part of every history project use our Creative Suite to tell - Creative Cloud to tell the story. Kash Rangan : In my next life I want to be a creative artist. Thank you so much guys. Congrats. Shantanu Narayen : With artificial intelligence, we're going to make that happen right now happen right now, Kash. Kash Rangan : Exciting guys. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Mark, I think it was mentioned earlier that in Digital Experience, there is more of a focus on subscription versus services kind of given the ecosystem of partners. And I know we don't talk about segment margins specifically, operating margins that is. But can you just talk about qualitatively whether we should see a more concerted effort in leveraging the partner ecosystem in Digital Experience? And what that can mean for segment margins? Shantanu Narayen : Maybe I'll start off and then Mark can certainly add. When we talk about ecosystem of partners, the ecosystem of partners is really in three categories. I mean, we have an incredible set of what you would have considered the traditional SI partners, the Accentures, the Deloittes of the world who have practices built around digital transformation, who are out there not just implementing our solutions but also certainly co-selling and helping sell our solutions. We have the media agencies as the media agencies are moving their business to include a technology and strategy component for digital transformation, the WPPs, the Publicises of the world have become incredibly great partners in that. And then you have the traditional ISVs and the partnership with Microsoft allows us to jointly go to market with a very integrated offering across what they are doing with dynamics and power BI and Azure, and what we are doing with Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Advertising Cloud. When the business was starting, we had a consulting organization that enabled people to implement this. I think a lot of the implementation and the running - we have a great ecosystem of partners, and so that results in us not requiring as many consulting resources. And we've shifted our focus there to be more architectural services, so that we can ensure that people are getting the best value out of our products. And so that reflects itself in terms of when we use those services as part of COGS instead of that being there, and that's why it's more a traditional software sale, which, in your words, would result in better margins. So that's how we tend to think of what's happening in the environment and why we feel well-served by both the super global partners as well as some regional partners. Mark Garrett : The only thing I'd add to that is to the extent that we can leverage that partner ecosystem that Shantanu talked about, we could potentially invest a little bit less in the sales and marketing line than we are currently doing a lot on our own today. So you get leveraged both in professional services and in sales and marketing. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Grant : Thanks. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Appreciate you taking the question. You've mentioned a couple of times that there are opportunities that you've taken advantage of within the customer base to look at customers that are single product, or using a subset of the product and then moving them to the full suite, obviously driving some improved ops there. Can you give us a sense of the relative size of that opportunity going forward? And how much of the base do you think is still in a position to make that shift into a larger ticket? Shantanu Narayen : You're referring to the Digital Experience side in terms of single solutions and multiple? I think Brad, at the last analyst call, gave you some update about how we are moving in terms of the top 100 customers and the significant improvement in revenue associated with each of those customers. But as we continue to offer more integration between our products, as they continue to grow their own businesses and the transactions caused, they're significant. I would go back to our big picture of how when we think about Digital Experience, it's a $60-plus billion opportunity. And while we are doing well, there's still is a significant amount of headroom in that business. Mark Grant : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. You called out Acrobat and Document Cloud a couple of times. I'm just curious is there any particular vertical industry that are seeing a bigger uptake? Or maybe a new use case that's starting to drive that growth? Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think the use of both PDF and Adobe Sign to automate paper-based processes across a variety of industries is certainly one of the places that we are seeing it. But I would also point back to mobile and the adoption of PDF on mobile and what's happening there and the ability for that. We've also done a really incredible job I think as a team of leveraging Reader. And so the fact that we have Reader distributed and you get when you get one of these documents that has an embedded, whether it's a spreadsheet or something else in it and you want to edit it, the ability for people to now edit PDFs and to use it as an on-ramp as part of their creative process, that's also helping out. So I think there are three or four horizontal use cases. And as it relates to vertical industries, anybody who is trying to automate paper-based processes and regulated industries like government, financial services, tends to be at the forefront of that. They're certainly seeing the benefits, not just of moving to PDF but also the benefit of using Adobe Sign. Mike Saviage : And this is Mike. Operator, we'll do two more questions and before we do that, just to build on what Shantanu said, the datasheet that we have publish has the Excel file built into it as an attachment, just as an example of what Shantanu said. And I say that not only to point that out but also with the new segment information we published in January, it would be helpful to look at the updated datasheet for the new segment information that we have moving forward this year. So operator, two more questions, please. Operator : Certainly. You're next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Just want to thank you for taking the call guys. And another outstanding quarter. Just a quick question on sort of Digital Marketing side of the equation, with GDPR really coming onto the horizon, do you guys see an indication or do you have any concerns that there may be some frictions around some of the more sort of customer data-type functionalities that guys are doing in the marketing office with deeper innovation [ph] and segmentation? Or is that kind of a non-issue amongst the customer base? Shantanu Narayen : I'd point back to what happened when the cloud first came out. When the cloud first came on the horizon, I think a lot of people appropriately talked about what that meant for security. And I think a number of cloud vendors clearly pointed out that the ability for people to update that would actually make systems more secure, which is something that I think most people would look at. I think as people are collecting data, the emphasis and importance of data and privacy continue to be front and center. But I don't think it changes the fundamental trajectory associated with people wanting to have all of this in the cloud. We just have to make sure that we use it as a tailwind against the competition and step up, like we have done when we collect customer data to enable our customers to do that as well. And so we'll be ready for GDPR when it comes, but it's not going to change this fundamental move where things are going to move in the cloud and digital is going to be the way in which enterprises transact with consumers. Keith Weiss : Got it. And maybe a quick one for Mark. The repurchase activity continues to go on pace and even sort of up the pace a little bit. You guys building up a lot of cash on the balance sheet, any update on kind of potential uses for that cash? Mark Garrett : So there's no change to our current prioritization of capital. We still take excess cash and put it towards M&A and share repurchases. Obviously, we have more excess cash now with the tax reform. We have $1.6 billion remaining on our current authorization, and obviously we're executing against that. When we're ready, of course we'll come out to you with any change to the current trajectory on that. Keith Weiss : Excellent, thank you guys. Operator : Your last question comes from Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Great, thanks. So we're hearing more and more digital agencies enter the SI market and kind of want to participate in technology implementation on the marketing side. Not just large ones that you talked about but a lot of midmarket agencies. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the midmarket opportunity for Experience Cloud. Is there anything - any new initiatives he could look at to focus more on the midmarket? Shantanu Narayen : We've announced a couple of partnerships there, Derrick, with midmarket providers in order to do it. I would say our focus is really more on the larger enterprises right now. That's not to say that we do not partner with regional media agencies and/or SIs. They tend to have, in many countries, very strong relationships with enterprises. So our partner ecosystem is open to all. But in terms of taking our own solutions and focusing them down market as opposed to focusing our solutions on what we think the largest opportunity is, we're focused a lot more on the large enterprise opportunity. Since that was the last question, you know what, Mark, Mike and I do is when we are going through our preparation we try and make sure we address some of the things that may be top of mind. And one of the questions that actually didn't come up was the fact that we haven't updated our annual guidance, and we wanted to sort of proactively ensure that we address that and say we really don't want to get into updating annual targets across revenue and balance sheet every quarter. I think for those of you as you think about how this plays out, the Q1 performance as well as the Q2 targets, I think, are clear indicators of the strength of the business. And the one thing we might have you continue to focus on is our original second half growth of 20% on revenue as you think about how you want to be prudent about your models. But having said that, we had an outstanding quarter. This strategy of empowering people to create and helping businesses transform just represent large addressable markets. And we see significant tailwinds. I'm pleased with the relentless execution. And it just continues to hopefully demonstrate to you that we're a unique company that's able to drive both top line and bottom line growth with significant operating margins. We will continue to invest in driving innovation through long-term technology investments in both Digital Media and Digital Marketing. And we're really pleased with how Sensei has continued to be a differentiator. Look forward to those of you who will be able to join us at Summit, and thank you again for joining us today. Mike Saviage : And one last thing, we had some connectivity problems on Connect. So for those that are on Connect, the archive will be complete as well as the phone replay. So if you did have some issues listening on the Connect session, we'll have that rectified in the archive, and thanks again for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. Adobe delivered record revenue in our second quarter with strong financial results. Q2 revenue was $2.20 billion dollars, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.33, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.66. Adobe enables individuals, companies, governments and educational institutions to design and deliver transformative digital experiences, immersive, intelligent experiences that inspire, entertain, and drive loyalty and growth. The breadth of our product portfolio, the deep science embedded in our Adobe Cloud platform, the insights derived from the trillions of data transactions we process every year on behalf of our customers, and our global ecosystem of partners and developers have made Adobe the leader in enabling great customer experiences. In our Digital Media business, we achieved strong growth in both Creative and Document Cloud revenue in Q2. We added net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR of $343 million, which grew total Digital Media ARR exiting Q2 to $6.06 billion. We continue to drive steady adoption of Creative Cloud subscriptions and services by individuals, teams and enterprises across all segments and geographies. This resulted in another strong quarter for Creative Cloud, with Creative revenue growing to $1.3 billion. At Adobe, we believe everyone has a story to tell. Our strategy to empower more of the world\u2019s storytellers to express themselves depends on our ability to make our tools more accessible, enjoyable and invaluable to a broader set of creative customers, from creative pros, to hobbyists, to young creatives. Experience Design is one of our fastest growing creative segments and we recently introduced a new starter plan for Adobe XD, our all-in-one UX/UI design platform. Adobe XD is the most modern, cloud-based solution available for designing, prototyping and collaborating with colleagues across multiple platforms. We recently announced several new integrations between XD and designers\u2019 existing workflows inside of tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator. We launched a $10 million design investment fund to support designers and developers who innovate and push the boundaries of Experience Design. Enabling creativity in the Education segment remains a passion for Adobe. Adobe Spark Premium, our application for everyday communicators to transform their ideas into beautiful visual stories, is now available to every student globally. We\u2019ve achieved strong adoption of Spark in school districts across the nation. To further bolster our commitment to K-12 students, we introduced a new offering that gives students more affordable access to applications including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and XD. These actions are part of our commitment to partner with educators, promote STEAM, and ensure art and creativity remain an essential part of education and professional development. Adobe\u2019s video editing and production tools, including Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, are the gold standard for creating films and video from the silver screen to the mobile screen. At NAB, Adobe unveiled innovative updates to Creative Cloud\u2019s digital video tools. In addition, partners including Canon, RED Cameras, AMD, and Sony announced tools and updates that allow users to work in an integrated, collaborative production environment. Our mission is to push the limits of creativity and storytelling while supporting exciting new mediums. We provided a sneak peek of Project Aero, a powerful new augmented reality, or AR authoring tool at Apple\u2019s WWDC last week. Project Aero is a system that makes it easier for designers and developers to create immersive content and bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. With close to 1 billion AR-enabled devices expected to be in market next year, AR can drive a new wave of digital transformation and creativity. In addition to the world\u2019s best desktop and mobile tools, Creative Cloud services are driving growth in our business while offering new ways to inspire our customers and accelerate their creative process. Adobe Stock achieved record revenue in the quarter, with greater than 25% year-over-year growth. Adobe Stock now has a library of more than 100 million images, videos and creative assets including new curated HD and 4K videos, as well as Motion Graphics templates. Adobe Document Cloud is the world\u2019s leading digital document service, enabling individuals and businesses to digitize inefficient paper-based processes. In Q2, we achieved record revenue for Document Cloud of $243 million. Document Cloud subscriptions and Acrobat perpetual licensing drove 22% year-over-year revenue growth, and $47 million in net new Document Cloud ARR. This week marks the 25th anniversary of Acrobat and PDF, the innovation that ushered in the era of digital documents. 25 years later, the pace at which we\u2019re innovating with Document Cloud has only accelerated as digital documents become more collaborative and mobile. More than 800 million PDFs are opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader on mobile devices each month. Adobe Scan, our mobile PDF creation app powered by Adobe Sensei that turns your phone or tablet into a scanning and text recognition tool, has been downloaded more than 10 million times. Adobe Sign, our digital signature solution for Document Cloud, continues to have strong momentum. Today, over half of Fortune 100 companies use Adobe Sign. Last September, we teamed up with Microsoft to integrate Adobe Sign into Microsoft Office 365. Next week, we\u2019ll be unveiling industry-first innovations in Adobe Sign focused on delivering superior digital document experiences to millions of customers. Adobe Experience Cloud is the most comprehensive, integrated, and actionable set of solutions in the market, designed to help companies deliver consistent, continuous and compelling experiences across every touch point and channel. In Q2, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million, and strong bookings across Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud. Key customer deals in the quarter included Audible, Intuit, Shell, H&R Block, Japan Airlines, PNC Bank and Samsung. In May, we announced our intent to acquire Magento, a leading commerce platform. Commerce is an integral part of an end-to-end customer experience as consumers and businesses now expect every interaction to be shoppable. The addition of Magento Commerce will enable commerce to be seamlessly integrated into Adobe Experience Cloud, delivering a single platform that serves both B2B and B2C customers globally while providing the flexibility to scale to serve mid-market and large enterprise customers. The Magento Platform is supported by a robust community of more than 300,000 developers and a partner ecosystem that provides thousands of pre-built extensions, including payment, shipping, tax and logistics. The acquisition of Magento will make Adobe the only company with leadership in content creation, marketing, advertising, analytics and now commerce, enabling real-time personalized experiences across the entire customer journey, whether on the web, mobile, social, in-product or in-store. We believe the addition of Magento expands our available market opportunity, builds out our product portfolio, and addresses a key underserved customer need. When combined with our world-class content and data platform, and leveraging our Sensei machine learning and AI framework, this latest capability will further differentiate Adobe Experience Cloud as the leading platform for Experience Businesses. We expect the acquisition to close next week. We continue to host successful customer Summits across the globe where we roll out new innovations across Adobe Experience Cloud, including major enhancements to the Adobe Cloud Platform. Recent advancements include a new Unified Customer Profile that combines data across an enterprise, intelligent services, and General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR readiness, all aimed at solving key challenges facing marketers, data scientists and developers. Adobe was once again recognized for our leadership in technology segments that help to deliver and orchestrate experiences across the entire customer journey. We were named a Leader in the Forrester Wave : Digital Asset Management for Customer Experience, achieving the highest score for current offering of the vendor leaders. Adobe was positioned as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Marketing Hubs. In this inaugural report, Adobe had the strongest ranking for completeness of vision among the 21 vendors evaluated. Adobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework forms the foundation of the innovative Adobe Magic across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. We were pleased to be recognized again as one of the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies by Forbes for 2018. The talent and passion of our more than 18,000 employees worldwide continues to be the catalyst for Adobe\u2019s success. We take pride in making Adobe one of the world\u2019s best workplaces and cultivating a diverse and innovative team of global employees. This summer, we\u2019re pleased to welcome over 1,000 interns and university graduates to Adobe, the largest such group in company history. Adobe has the right strategy, partners, products and people in place to win. We look forward to building on the momentum we\u2019re driving across our entire business and expect a strong second half of the year. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. In the second quarter of FY18, Adobe\u2019s momentum continued with record revenue of $2.20 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.33 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.66. We drove strong performance across our product offerings and geographies during the quarter. Highlights in Q2 included record Digital Media revenue, including Creative revenue of $1.30 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $243 million; record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million; net new Digital Media ARR of $343 million, and exiting Q2 with $5.37 billion of Creative ARR; deferred revenue growth of 27% year-over-year; cash flow from operations of $976 million; returning $589 million of cash to our stockholders through stock buyback; and approximately 89% of our revenue in Q2 was from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 28% year-over-year. The addition of $343 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $6.06 billion exiting Q2. Within Digital Media, we achieved another record quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 29% year-over-year in Q2 and we increased Creative ARR by $296 million. Several key factors helped drive this growth, including strong net new subscriptions across user segments and geographies, helped by robust traffic and conversion on adobe.com; continued momentum with Creative Cloud adoption in emerging markets; stable or increasing ARPU across key offerings, which continues to be driven by retention of users on promotional prices migrating to standard prices, as well as attachment of services in the enterprise and the recently introduced price increase in North America; and strong growth with Adobe Stock. With Document Cloud, we achieved record revenue of $243 million, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. The performance in Q2 was driven by continued momentum with Acrobat subscription adoption as well as strength in the enterprise with Acrobat and Document Cloud services. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million, which represents 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Subscription revenue grew 24% year-over year. Experience Cloud performance in Q2 was driven by success across our Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Advertising Cloud offerings. Experience Cloud data transactions grew to 97 trillion in the quarter, with 60% of Analytics transactions driven by mobile device usage. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $15.2 million. We had $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY18, versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q1 of FY18; thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $14.5 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $51.3 million. We had $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY18, versus $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 of FY17; thus, the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $38.3 million. In Q2, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 4% on a GAAP-basis and 5% on a non-GAAP basis. These rates are below the targets we provided due to a structural change we made during Q2 in how we serve foreign customers based on the new U.S. Tax Act. Our recent international tax structure change will benefit our tax rates for the remainder of FY2018 as well as next year. Our trade DSO was 44 days, which compares to 46 days in the year-ago quarter, and 47 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.63 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $6.33 billion. Cash flow from operations was $976 million in the quarter. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $589 million. We currently have $900 million remaining of our $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017. We expect this authorization to be exhausted by the end of this fiscal year. On May 21st, we announced that our Board had authorized an incremental $8 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal year 2021, which will be funded from future cash flow generation. Now, I will provide our financial outlook. In January, we updated our financial targets to reflect provisions of the new U.S. Tax Act which became law during our fiscal Q1. The Tax Act affords companies like Adobe the ability to make changes to the way we serve our foreign customers with our international corporate structure. During Q2, we made a structural change and the effect of it results in even lower tax rates than we discussed previously for both this year and subsequent fiscal years. In fiscal 2018, we anticipate an incremental 6 percentage-point reduction in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates when compared to the rates we provided in January. We are now expecting a GAAP tax rate of approximately 7% in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2018; and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 5% in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2018. Our November fiscal year calendar and the timing of certain Tax Act provisions make our FY18 a unique year from a tax rate perspective. We indicated in January that we anticipated our tax rates would stabilize at a new rate of approximately 18% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis in FY19. Based on the structural change we made in Q2, we now estimate our tax rates in FY19 will stabilize at GAAP and non-GAAP rates of approximately 14%. Turning to Q3 FY18, we are targeting revenue of approximately $2,240,000,000; Digital Media segment year over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 15%; tax rate of approximately 7% on a GAAP basis, and 5% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 498 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.27; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.68; and net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $310 million. Our Q3 targets do not reflect our pending acquisition of Magento Commerce. We have received regulatory clearance and anticipate closing the acquisition next week. For the second half of calendar year 2018, Magento\u2019s internal plan projected achieving approximately $100 million in revenue. After the transition to Adobe\u2019s November fiscal calendar and the write-down of deferred revenue due to purchase accounting rules, we anticipate Adobe will report approximately $40 million of Magento revenue in the second half of Adobe\u2019s fiscal 2018, with approximately $10 million of it in our fiscal Q3. We expect the closing of Magento to be slightly dilutive to our Q3 GAAP earnings per share target. We do not expect the closing to impact our non-GAAP Q3 earnings per share target. In Q4, we anticipate normal seasonal strength and a strong finish to the year. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Saviage : Thanks, John.

We ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Looking at the results, the revenue in Digital Media, both in the quarter and from the outlook is better than expected, despite the Digital Media ARR coming in line. I am wondering if there\u2019s something that\u2019s improving the revenue conversion in the quarters or some other factor that\u2019s allowing that to happen? Shantanu Narayen : Sterling, I\u2019ll take that. I think, as we look at Digital Media, as you pointed out, ARR was again strong across all different segments. Retention continues to be in line with expect. Acrobat Perpetual had a good quarter. So, Acrobat, as it related to both licensing and perpetual was strong as well as Stock. So, I think across the board we continue to focus on converting ARR to revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : I wanted to ask on the Experience Cloud business, clearly showed some really nice acceleration in the quarter on a much tougher comp to last year. So, I wanted to ask if kind of what changes have you observed, what strengthening, renewal activity and up sell, any comments would be helpful and how sustainable do you expect some of these trends to be? Shantanu Narayen : Alex, big picture, I think we\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the Experience business. I think, the metric that we look at a lot was the subscription revenue growth. If you look at the subscription revenue growth in the quarter, that was 24% year-over-year. I think in the prepared remarks we said, it was across the Marketing Cloud, Analytics Cloud as well as the Advertising Cloud. Again, digital transformation is front and center as an imperative for every single organization. Without a doubt, we have the clear leadership position in that. The value proposition is very unique. We\u2019re getting larger deals. We\u2019ve talked about the multi-solution opportunities that we have. I would say, particularly in the quarter as well, with the two summits that we organized and the interest that we have in summits, as closing opportunities for us. And last but not least, partnership with Microsoft where we\u2019re jointly going in and engaging with customers at higher levels. So, I\u2019d just point to continued leadership on the product and vision side and focus on execution in the quarter. Alex Zukin : Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jeffries. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Shantanu, just following up on digital experience, the first half of the year, you actually outpaced your yearend growth rate target and you have easier comps in the back half of this year. So, I\u2019m just curious in terms of why not take up your aspirations there? Is there something that\u2019s worrying you in the second half? Obviously, you\u2019ll have Magento layer in as well. So, are you just kind of waiting for that to layer in before you update your aspirations there? Shantanu Narayen : I think, in terms of overall, as you know, Brent, we do not update our full year guidance. At this point, we\u2019re coming into what has been the Q3 seasonal quarter in Europe. But, the interest and the excitement or aspirations haven\u2019t diminished in any way. As you point out, it was a strong quarter. We have with Magento even more of a comprehensive offering and so, particularly remain excited. But it\u2019s -- I won\u2019t read anything into it except for the fact that we -- we did touch on the fact that Q4 will continue to be seasonally strong. So, should proceed as expected. Brent Thill : And just a quick follow-up for John on ARPU. I think, last quarter, you said ARPU was kind of up across the board. I think now, you\u2019re saying flat to up. Given the price increases, can you just maybe parse that? And I know we\u2019re probably digging in on a metric that we\u2019re probably going too deep into, but any color there why that won\u2019t be up and up like we saw in Q1? John Murphy : No. I think what we said is that it's stable and that we expect it to remain stable to up. So, also, I think it\u2019s really from our perspective a healthy metric. We don\u2019t guide to that or target externally but this really contributes to our ARR. Shantanu Narayen : Maybe just adding color, Brent, on that as it relates to the enterprise licensing, nothing has changed, as we see enterprise licensing, we\u2019re certainly seeing good adoption of the full offering from the customized versions that we had said. As it relates to the price, since you asked that question, we always expected it to be marginal in terms of the impact associated with that. We\u2019re pleased with what we have seen so far in terms of whether it\u2019s people buying new subscriptions or renewal, where people see the price increase, I think that is very much in line with the additional value that we provided. So, on Digital Media, we continue to be excited about the opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is open. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up a little bit on subscription growth that you\u2019re seeing with Creative Cloud outside of the U.S. and in particular in geographies outside of the U.S., and I guess in two pieces. First, I think last year, one of the talking points was that Japan and Germany were still relatively early in the transition from on-prem to cloud. So, I\u2019m curious if we sort of have any update on the rate of the base migration there. And then, related as you think about subscriber growth in emerging markets, I\u2019m curious if you have sort of an update on how much of that sort of piracy conversion versus net new users to the base. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Jennifer, I think globally, when we look at the demand for the creative solutions and specifically the cloud offerings, I think we\u2019ve stated that Japan and Germany and the other emerging markets were phase shifted from the United States and Australia where we first introduced the offerings on the learnings that we\u2019ve had about how to acquire customers and convert them whether they be new customers to the platform or as you point out former pirates. We have certainly learnt from that. We continue to think that the differential pricing that we have in countries like China as well as Southeast Asia is helping us. There is more creativity in those markets. So, Japan and Germany net-net continue to be good areas of growth for us moving forward. The emerging markets, both the piracy as well as the attractive upfront pricing are reasons why people are adopting the platform. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter. Shantanu, can you share with us, what the learnings have been from the price increase you introduced in North America this quarter and your observations on elasticity? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think, Brad, it\u2019s early. I would actually point to the learnings that we\u2019ve had from the foreign exchange changes that have happened in other countries and as a result of that what we have done with respect to pricing. Our strategy continues to be how do we get more and more people on the platform. And so you know, we continue to attract new customers with attractive pricing. And during the first year, the more engagement that we have with them, the more they are likely to add the standard pricing continue in renewal. And so, renewal continues to be an area of focus for us. And again, the goal for us right now is attracting new customers to the platform. Everything we\u2019ve done with respect to price changes has not impacted retention. And so, we continue to focus on that blend, if that makes sense. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Shantanu, realizing that it still has to close, can you just talk about initial customer feedback on Magento? It\u2019s been a few weeks. And any early ideas, broad brushes that you can share with us on how the business can look different as part of the Adobe family, post closing? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Saket. I mean, I think, despite the fact that we already had integrations with commerce systems, we had clear ask from our customers for a complete Adobe solution from content creation to delivery to analytics and now all the way out to commerce. What we are particularly excited about is the investment that we\u2019ve made in the Adobe Cloud platform provides a clear architecture and a playbook for us to integrate new acquisitions like Magento, seamlessly. We were attracted by a few things when we looked at Magento, great people, great technology. But I think what\u2019s unique was that they targeted both digital and physical goods as well as B2B and B2C in terms of the customer segments. And Mark, who is their CEO, did a great job of leading them after they transitioned out of eBay. While their traditional strength has been in the mid market and departments or single geographies where large enterprises use them for commerce in one geography and then translate it, I think that will continue to be an area of good opportunity for us. And what we will bring to that is the enterprise relationships that we have with larger enterprise. So, like all our acquisitions, we look at it from the point of view of can we accelerate their growth, does it fill out our offering that we have a unique and differentiated solution. And the good news was, Magento, I think checked all of those boxes. And so, we\u2019re excited about it, as we said, hopefully it closes next week. And we\u2019ve given you some transparency into the size of their business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Mark Moerdler : Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. So, I\u2019m going to follow-up on the questions on Magento. Discuss how Magento has had strength in selling the digital goods Adobe\u2019s -- digital marketing is all about digital marking but both digital and electronic. How big a nuance, how big a difference is there, how big an opportunity is there? The fact that they are so strong in selling the digital goods and how does that play into the existing customer base that Adobe has in digital marketing? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Mark, I think from our point of view, we just want a very comprehensive solution. When you go into a retail customer, for example with Digital Experience who is making available for sale physical goods, we say, yes, we have the ability for you to transact and finalize your sale for physical goods that\u2019s shipping. That doesn\u2019t mean that we are in shipping our sales, but the ability to have that inventory, the building materials, the payment methods is clearly an advantage in terms of them taking non-digital way of transacting commerce and converting it to commerce. What\u2019s also nice about them is for people who want to do rooms or airline reservations or other digital ways of transacting business, the same solution scales from physical goods to digital goods. Things like subscription, what Adobe offers. I think, we would all acknowledge that more and more companies want to get to a subscription mechanism. And so, I think, I would look at it more as a comprehensive way of dealing with anything that needs to be transacted online, whether the end result was a physical good or digital good or subscription, being able to have a comprehensive offering across B2B and B2C is really helpful. And what I mean by B2B is you might have companies whether they\u2019re consumer goods companies or companies that are actually shipping to other retailers who also want to use this to transact business electronically. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting for us about what Magento offers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Shantanu, congrats on the quarter. You look like you\u2019re tracking again this year to something around 1.3 billion of net new Digital Media ARR. And we\u2019re just coming up into a period where you\u2019re starting to move on price, you have some new product introductions, there are some ARPU effects from Stock. Just philosophically, how do you think about the progress of that net new ARR, as we think about that, no just this year, but broadly speaking over the next two or three years? And do you feel like there are levers that you have to manage that number to a sort of target? And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for sustainability on that line item. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Ross. Again, when we look at the ARR accomplishment and entire Digital Media performance in the first half, it\u2019s very clear that we continue to have momentum across all of the various offerings, as well as geographies. I think, if you look at our Q3, and then I\u2019ll get to the picture, we do expect Q3 is seasonally weak. And we\u2019ve said that we expect the traditional strength in Q4. One of the things that we are discontinuing to monitor in Q3 is what\u2019s happened with GDPR and the recent privacy law changes is that everybody who is doing business online in Europe, will have to make sure that GDPR is not sort of just the checklist item but a new ways of doing business which requires people to tailor their digital marketing. We were ready with that on May 25th. We just want to continue to monitor that as we transact business online. We are best-in-class both for ourselves as well as for the service that we deliver for our customers. And so, we look at the 310 million target for ARR; it\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve actually had in Q3 for Digital Media. To your point, it should result in record ARR addition in this business for FY18. But long-term, as you think about new media types, as you think about devices, what we are doing across education, immersive media opportunities with AR and VR, screen design, video and the explosion of video, I think, you\u2019ll continue to see us innovate more, attract new customers to the platform, and really drive the addressable opportunities. So, that\u2019s really is the focus for us in that business. Ross MacMillan : And just a quick follow-up, if I can, for John. Welcome, just on the tax rate that new run rate of 14%, is that something that in the absence of material geographic revenue mix shift or M&A, is that something that you would view as broadly a sort of stable run rate, even beyond fiscal \u201819? John Murphy : Yes. Thanks, Ross. I think, how I would describe it is with the new Tax Act, we\u2019ve been digesting the different impacts to that. And so, you see as we made this recent change, again after just starting in January. So, we do feel this rate is stable, but we continue to evaluate opportunities with the provisions of the tax law. And just to remind you, our fiscal year \u201818 is really unique for us. So, we don\u2019t have the full effects of the Tax Act until FY19. But I think you can rely on those rates at this point, to be relatively stable. And then, as we continue to evaluate opportunities, take advantage of the provisions, we can update them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Shantanu, a technology roadmap question for you regarding Digital Experience. How much of a role do you think there may ultimately be for you to have a self-serve model in the portfolio in digital experience, paralleling what you\u2019ve done with Digital Media, particularly with adobe.com. The reason I\u2019m asking is was the launch of Advertising Cloud Creative at Summit for instance perhaps an early sign of a longer term ambition for more comprehensive self-serve capability that you can deliver to customers for Digital Experience. If that\u2019s so, would there then be positive incremental margin implications, as you\u2019ve seen on the Digital Media side from that kind of a model? Shantanu Narayen : I think, Jay, there is no question that a focus on time to value and getting more practitioners adopting our digital experience solution sooner rather than later is a priority for us. We\u2019ve certainly, to your point, done that with Acrobat and CC. Magento is a really nice addition to that, because if people can create a website, start doing it with their customers through multiple channels and transact business through commerce, that opens up new vistas for us. And if you remember, the original Day Software as well as what Omniture had, actually targeted small and medium businesses. So, I look at it as, are we focused on continuing to drive time to value and getting more practitioners to be self served. That\u2019s only a benefit in terms of their NPS with Adobe. And it\u2019s clearly an area of focus for us. Jay Vleeschhouwer : A quick one for John. Could you talk about the implications for cash flow from the new cash structure, both in terms of not just net income, which is obviously going to be affected on the GAAP side but also perhaps in terms of deferred tax implications within cash flow? John Murphy : Clearly, we benefit from the tax rate changes. And I think what we\u2019ve demonstrated is that our business continues to throw cash flow strength in growth. So, I would just say that that trend is pretty consistent. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard : Just a further question around pricing. You\u2019ve talked about services for some time and stock I think continues to do well. Can you help us understand how services are impacting pricing versus some of these other factors, especially the price increase that just started to have impact this quarter, maybe a stack rank or kind of relative conversation about the drivers of ARPU? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Walter. I mean, I think as it relates to Adobe Stock, that is clear service. It makes the entire offerings sticker. And I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that Stock had a very strong quarter, I think it continues to make the whole aspect of an on-ramp to creativity easier. So, that\u2019s been good. I would say in the enterprise in particular as people are finding that whether you\u2019re interfacing between freelancers and the marketing or graphics departments within enterprises, storing all of these assets, so that you can increase content velocity, things like Adobe Sign, all of them are causing us to be able to both deliver better value and charge more to our enterprise customers. So, in the enterprises in particular, we\u2019re very maniacally focused on named user deployment, ensuring more people use it within an enterprise, having services be the win, which they can engage more people in the creative process. And that\u2019s leading to both greater ARPU as well as new seat deployment within the enterprise. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini : I just had a question about, as we look at your revenue targets, Shantanu, and as you look out a few years, is there a reason to think that the pace of expense growth, which we\u2019ve been seeing, would change at all? You guys have done such a great job kind of growing expenses at such a much lower pace obviously than revenue. I am just wondering if there is any reason to think that kind of the pace of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of expense growth would change based on what your revenue plans might be down the road. Shantanu Narayen : That\u2019s a great question, Heather, in terms of how we think about it. And I think as a company, we\u2019re just being ruthlessly focused on both top line and bottom line growth. I mean you are driving 24% year-over-year growth in revenue, but driving 60% growth in non-GAAP EPS, I think it shows that we\u2019re really focused on both of those. We just have some very significant opportunities. And I think as you think about Q2, maybe there were a couple of investments in the Adobe Cloud platform as well as in preparation for GDPR that were factored in. But I think long-term, we just continue to ensure that are we driving great top line growth at a very profitable margin, and we\u2019re going to continue as we did in Q1, for example, all revenue overachievement will result in greater earnings and that continues to be our focus. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI, your line is open. Kirk Materne : Shantanu, I was wondering if you could just -- I want to go back to Magento again. And could you just walk us through I guess how you\u2019re thinking about the integration? I assume given the time of your fiscal year, it\u2019ll operate generally on a standalone basis. But, is this a product that the Adobe sales force can start taking to market once the deal closes? I guess, just how are you thinking about sort of integrating, I guess mainly from a go to market perspective once the deal closes over the next couple of quarters? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Kirk, I think, the sales force is already chomping at the bits in terms of saying how do we, once the deal is closed, have Magento in our bag. It\u2019s such a natural extension. But, I think to your point, our focus has always been with acquisitions, do no harm, really make sure that we can continue to bring to bear the Adobe brand, bring to bear the customer relationships that we have and truly understand the magic sauce that makes them so special. So, certainly, in terms of from day one when we are closing being able to expand our story of how we can serve customers, looking at some of the customers. And I think we pointed that out in the introductory call in terms of who they already have as customers. So, I think, we will start to deliver to enterprises but we will be a little cautious because we just want to make sure that we have discipline on-ramp to that particular product. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Great, thanks. I wanted to touch, drilling in on GDPR. And one could argue, it could have some mixed impact for you guys. The regulation focuses on data minimization in terms of the amount of content companies should be storing about their end consumers and email lists have to be more scrutinized. And I guess that could weigh on capacity subscription sales. But at the same time, companies are needing to put more governance and workflow around their digital engagements and we could see more standardization and more usage on the Adobe platform. You clearly had a good quarter, but how do you see these dynamics around GDPR working out and impacting the demand trajectory on Experience Cloud. Shantanu Narayen : When I take a step back, Derrick, the trend towards online businesses and digital spend and the desire on the part of enterprises to understand attribution is only going to increase. More money is going to be spent digitally but the bar of how that\u2019s being spent and the understanding and effectiveness of that marketing and spend is only going to increase. And I think big picture, we look at that as a big opportunity for Advertising Cloud, because not only are we a channel for the major online marketing platforms like search, social, display and TV, but we are unique and that we have sort of the broadest perspective of efficacy across all marketing expense. On the second side, all companies will need to balance the customer acquisition where this third-party data plays an important role. And the more important issue for all companies is going to be customer engagement, to your question around email list and how you engage with them. And then, I think leveraging the first-party data is going to become even more crucial. And so, we look at it and say we have the best of both worlds. The Advertising Cloud will continue to focus on helping customer acquisition, but really the energy is going to be spent by companies more on Marketing Cloud where engagement is going to be even more critical in this world of GDPR, so that you don\u2019t in any way impact the trust that you have built with companies. And I actually think analytics also across both acquisition and engagement will become even more critical in this new environment. So, you\u2019re right in that we have to help our companies navigate it and you\u2019re right. And I think long-term, it just continues to be a tailwind as the leader in this business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : I just had a clarification question around the guidance. Last quarter, Mark Garrett was talking about Digital Media ARR and talking about Q3 and Q4, the expected seasonality of Q3 and Q4 to follow similar to what was achieved in FY17. And when I look at ARR from last year, Q2 to Q3 was pretty sort of flat seasonality. It looks like we are looking for closer to like down 9% to 10% this year. Is something changed between sort of Mark Garrett\u2019s comments and sort of how we are thinking about ARR into Q3 this quarter? Shantanu Narayen : No, Keith. I think, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, when you look at from an absolute perspective, the Q3 target that we provided for ARR will still be the largest that we have. I think we continue to see strength in the business and nothing\u2019s changed from that particular quarter. I mentioned briefly that we want to just make sure that we get a little bit more experience with what\u2019s happening with GDPR to Derrick and other peoples questions associated with what\u2019s happening online but in no way reflects a change in how we see the business. And Q4 again, we expect the traditional strength in the business. Keith Weiss : So, some caution perhaps around GDPR, potentially questioning some Digital Media business from Q3 into Q4? Shantanu Narayen : I think, we look at it from first half second half and we still continue to model it, but you can look at it as we just want to make sure that we underpin GDPR in more detail across Q3. Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Shantanu, I\u2019m just curious, if you look at companies like in your peer groups Microsoft, Intuit, they have had revenue growth in some of the key businesses outpace unit growth. Obviously, pricing and ARPU growth has been a key trend of the industry. I\u2019m curious how you think about that. Are you at a point where it\u2019s more so ARPU growth versus unit growth? If so, what is driving that? If you on the contrary believe what you said, on the previous earnings conference call that the TAM is a multiple of the previous cycle. I was curious to hear you elaborate on why you believe the TAM as a multiple of the prior cycle. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I mean, I think when we look at the two businesses where we have a B2C business, when we look at Acrobat and units growth for Acrobat, all the strength in the Document Cloud businesses is being driven by unit growth rather than what you would call ARPU growth. When we look at customer acquisition in Creative Cloud, we\u2019ve been pretty forthcoming about how it\u2019s really being driven by few people coming to our platform. And so I can\u2019t comment on what Microsoft and Intuit are saying, but from our point of view, it\u2019s certainly being driven not more by few customer acquisitions and focus on that. And so, as we thing about big picture, what we are focused on in creative, the first is let\u2019s just continue to drive net new subscriptions, focused on retention, the pool is becoming larger and larger. So, this is in emerging markets. I would say a little bit more adjacent markets, what we\u2019ve done with education and hobbyists. We continue to make sure that ARPUs are increasing as people go into renewals. But price is not on that first list of things that we\u2019re focused on, given where we\u2019re in the cycle. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Pat Walravens : Shantanu, I\u2019m going to step back a little bit. And I\u2019m curious how far -- I'm sorry, the artificial intelligence side of things. How far away are we from having Sensei help customers search video content with a high degree of accuracy, Sensei find all the footages that has Brad Pitt in it. Shantanu Narayen : Pat, I think if you look at what we already have with respect to Adobe Stock, the two things that I would call Adobe magic that Sensei has provided is first auto tagging. So, you can actually get thousands of pictures and we have the ability based on the prior data set to be able to tag it and infer intent. And so, you can search. And the economical example we give us fire engine versus being it called different things in different countries. And so, we already have that. With video as well I think we have the ability across frames to do searching. And so, it\u2019s only going to get better and better with the data sets. But that data is not far in terms of being able to find across video. And in fact, we have already demonstrated abilities to do search on video. Mike Saviage : Operator, we\u2019re coming up on the hour. Why don\u2019t we take one more question, please? Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal. Your line is open. Brian Wieser : I was wondering if you could offer a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing with Advertising Cloud. You called it certainly as supporting some growth there. And we see some of the peers to that business in particular doing phenomenally well. And related GDPR, as we\u2019re seeing something with shake out with much of the ad tech sector, I\u2019m wondering if you see opportunities for deeper investment. It seems like anyone with deep pockets a long time horizon is maybe well-positioned to take advantage just growing organically or by picking up businesses that are now available. Shantanu Narayen : We had a good strong revenue quarter for Advertising Cloud in Q2. I think if you look at our overall revenue growth of 18%, it was certainly higher than what we had guided to. Advertising Cloud played a role in that. I think, to your point, we are one of the few companies that has the brand to have the ability for people to invest across search, social, display and all forms of TV. And so, I think, we\u2019re pretty uniquely positioned. I think what\u2019s even more unique about our offering is the tie-in to the segmentation that we have with audience manager and the analytics that we provide on the efficacy of the spend. So, we continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have both in Advertising Cloud as a separate cloud an opportunity, and the integration of that across the entire Experience Cloud. And since Brian that was the last question, in close, the momentum in our business clearly continued in Q2. We continue to be excited about the product roadmap that we will deliver in the second half and the innovation agenda. Big picture, the strategy of empowering people to create, as well as helping businesses transform, continue to be large addressable markets with good tailwinds, and we continue to focus on driving both top-line and bottom-line growth with significant margins while we invest in technology as a long-term differentiator for Adobe. Thank you for joining us today. Mike Saviage : Thanks, everyone. This concludes our call.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Q3 was a record quarter for Adobe. We delivered $2.29 billion in revenue, representing 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.34, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.73. Adobe is empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete. Our execution against this strategy is driving strong financial results across our Digital Media and Digital Experience businesses. In every market around the world, students, creatives, enterprises and governments are choosing Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud to deliver the transformative digital experiences required to compete and win today. In our Digital Media business, we achieved strong growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud revenue in Q3. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $339 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to $6.4 billion. Key Digital Media customer engagements in the quarter included the U.S. Department of Education, Facebook, Marks & Spencer and Walmart. Creative Cloud has become the creativity platform for all with millions of highly engaged subscribers and a strong base of trialists whom we actively convert each month into paying customers. Whether it's YouTubers looking for an intuitive video solution or mobile-first photography enthusiasts, we continue to see significant opportunities for growth in new customer segments as well as untapped potential in emerging markets. Video continues to be an explosive category. In June, we previewed Project Rush, a new video editing app that makes creating and sharing online video content easier than ever. Whether your passion is vlogging about food or posting a cool skateboarding clip, Project Rush gives users a way to create video projects across surfaces, providing them with maximum creative flexibility. This week at IBC, we shared a slate of new video creation capabilities that'll speed up video production and enable more seamless workflows for professional editors and animators. This includes Adobe Sensei-powered features for audio editing, color grading and animation in Premiere Pro, Audition, Character Animator and other video tools. Lightroom CC, our cloud-based photography service, continues to attract new customers. We announced a number of updates to Lightroom CC and Lightroom Classic for Mac, Windows, Android and iOS and shipped several improvements including new in-app learning capabilities, support for new cameras and more than 1,200 different lenses. We previewed a brand-new feature, Best Photos, which combines Adobe Sensei intelligence with user-made edits to quickly recommend the best photos within an album. Adobe XD, our all-in-one UX solution for designing and prototyping websites and apps, is quickly becoming the leader in the screen design category with strong monthly active usage among customers. This quarter, we unveiled new open platform capabilities, which allow users to customize their workflow with a broader ecosystem of community and partner plug-ins. As students around the world head back to school, Adobe is partnering with educators and institutions to ensure that creativity, a core 21st century skill, is a central part of curriculum and that students have access to the creative tools they need. Adobe Spark, our app for easily creating high-quality graphics, web pages and video stories, is a cornerstone of this effort. This quarter, we were proud to partner with the Ministry of Skill Development in India to enable more than 1 million students to access Spark. Next month, we'll host MAX, the world's largest creativity conference. We'll unveil new capabilities across Creative Cloud that will enable our customers to push the boundaries of creativity across modalities like voice and touch and emerging media types, including 3D and augmented reality. Adobe Document Cloud is the world's leading digital document service, enabling individuals and businesses to automate inefficient paper-based processes. In Q3, we achieved record revenue for Document Cloud of $249 million. PDF creation, sharing, reviewing, scanning and signing is accelerating across devices, and Adobe's document business is experiencing strong growth. Over 50 billion PDFs were opened in Adobe products in the last year. In a few weeks, we'll announce major advancements to Adobe Document Cloud, including an update to our flagship Acrobat DC solution, which will radically transform what's possible with PDF on mobile devices. In August, we teamed up with Samsung for the launch of the new Galaxy Note9 and its intelligent assistant, Bixby. With the introduction of Adobe Scan for Bixby Vision, we're providing PDF scanning capabilities to Samsung users through Adobe Sensei and Adobe Document Cloud. Adobe Scan has become one of the most popular mobile scanning apps with nearly 14 million downloads to date. Adobe Sign continues to revolutionize the electronic signature market and has become the solution of choice for customers, particularly in highly regulated industries such as government, health care and financial services. This year, Adobe Sign received FedRAMP Tailored authorization, meeting the U.S. government's rigorous security standards. As part of our collaboration with the Cloud Signature Consortium, which is furthering an open standard for cloud signatures, we support key industry standards and guidelines such as HIPAA and the eSign Act. Overall, we continue to drive strong growth in the Adobe Sign business. Adobe Experience Cloud is the leading customer experience platform for the modern enterprise, helping companies deliver predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences across every touch point. Our unique differentiation stems from the breadth and depth of our offerings and the unparalleled intelligence we derive from the trillions of transactions we process on behalf of our customers. In Q3, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $614 million with strong bookings across Adobe Marketing Cloud, Analytics Cloud and Advertising Cloud. Key customer deals in the quarter included NBA Properties, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, The Federal Aviation Administration, CBS Interactive and Navy Federal Credit Union. In June, we completed our acquisition of Magento, bringing its industry-leading commerce capabilities to Adobe Experience Cloud for B2B and B2C customers. We delivered the first integrated deployment of Adobe Experience Manager and Magento Commerce Cloud this quarter. Expanding Magento's reach in the global enterprise space continues to be an area of opportunity for Adobe as is expanding other Experience Cloud solutions deeper into mid-sized businesses where Magento has a strong market position. Next month, we'll host over 2000 customers at MagentoLive in Barcelona, where we'll share more details about how we're integrating Experience Cloud with the Magento Commerce Cloud. Adobe Advertising Cloud enables marketers to deliver search, display, video and TV advertising across a growing number of screens and formats. We recently announced new capabilities for TV ads in partnership with LiveRamp as well as new fraud protection features and support for emerging formats including digital audio ads on smart speakers and home devices. Our leading offering in data-driven TV advertising continues to see strong interest from brands and agencies as we bring more refined targeting options to linear and addressable TV. We continue to deliver new innovation across our entire set of Experience Cloud solutions, including new e-mail and cross-channel marketing capabilities in Adobe Campaign and Attribution IQ inside of Adobe Analytics Cloud. Growth in our Digital Experience business is enhanced by a strong network of global partners. Our strategic partnership with Microsoft continues to gain traction among enterprise customers as we bring more joint solutions to market. More than 100 enterprises now leverage Adobe and Microsoft's joint Digital Experience offerings, including Bank of America Merchant Services, Cintas, CDW and Virgin America Airlines. In Q3, Adobe was once again recognized for our technology leadership by top industry analysts. Adobe was named the only leader in the Forrester Wave : Experience Optimization Platforms, and we were named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Web Content Management for the eighth year in a row. Additional leadership recognition included the Forrester Wave : Customer Analytics Solutions and the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Personalization Engines. Adobe's employees have always been our greatest asset. We pride ourselves on recruiting and retaining world-class talent and making Adobe a place where our employees can do their best work. Last week, Forbes ranked Adobe as the number one Best Employer for New College Graduates, and we were recognized by Fortune as one of its Best Workplaces for Millennials. The Great Places to Work Institute recently included both Adobe India and Adobe Australia on its Best Workplaces lists. As we look to Q4, we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We expect a strong close to Adobe's 2018 fiscal year and are confident that we have the right strategy, products, people, customers and partners to sustain our growth and momentum. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. In the third quarter of FY '18, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.29 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.34, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.73. We delivered another quarter of strong performance across product offerings and geographies while also successfully integrating Magento. Highlights in Q3 included : record Digital Media revenue, including Creative revenue of $1.36 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $249 million; record Digital Experience revenue of $614 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth; net new digital media ARR of $339 million; deferred revenue growth of 23% year-over-year; cash flow from operations of $955 million; returning $714 million of cash to our stockholders through stock buyback; and approximately 90% of our revenue in Q3 was from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 27% year-over-year. The addition of $339 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $6.4 billion exiting Q3. Within Digital Media, we achieved another record quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 28% year-over-year in Q3, and we increased Creative ARR by $289 million. Several key factors contributed to this growth, including: strong net new subscriptions across user segments and across the U.S., Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific, driven by robust traffic and customer acquisition on adobe.com; strength in new individual app subscriptions with the Photography plan and Acrobat; continued momentum with Creative Cloud adoption in emerging markets; retention of users migrating from promotional to standard prices at annual cycles; new pricing introduced in North America; seat expansion and adoption of services in the enterprise; and strength with Adobe Stock, which achieved greater than 30% year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter. We transitioned our adobe.com sites in Europe to comply with new GDPR requirements, and we are successfully engaging with potential and existing customers, allowing us to continue to drive growth in revenue and ARR. Retention, upsell, new customer acquisition and conversion remain huge opportunities, which we address through digital marketing campaigns, frequent targeted promotions and the introduction of new offerings across desktop and mobile. With Document Cloud, we achieved record revenue of $249 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth, and we delivered another solid quarter of Document Cloud ARR growth. Acrobat unit growth across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud was again greater than 20%. Adobe Sign achieved greater than 25% year-over-year revenue growth. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $614 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. Experience Cloud subscription revenue grew 25% year-over-year. Experience Cloud performance in Q3 was driven by success across our Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Advertising Cloud offerings with particular strength in Audience Manager, which is our data management platform, and in Adobe Campaign. Magento is off to a strong start and contributed subscription and services revenue of $27 million in Q3. Strength in demand, a longer-than-anticipated stub period in Q3 and a smaller-than-anticipated write-down of deferred revenue contributed to this success. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $13.8 million. We had $16.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '18 versus $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY '18. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.7 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $27.7 million. We had $16.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '18 versus $0.2 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '17. Thus, the net the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $44.3 million. In Q3, Adobe's effective tax rate was 5% in both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted due to larger-than-expected tax effects related to share-based payments as well as a favorable resolution of an income tax matter. Our trade DSO was 41 days, which compares to 50 days in the year-ago quarter and 44 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.71 billion, up 23% year-over-year. With strong bookings, deferred revenue was in line with our expectations. Given Q3 FY '18 ended on August 31, deferred revenue was impacted by having 1 less billing cycle for many enterprise customers when compared to Q2 FY '18 and Q3 FY '17. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $4.94 billion. The quarter-over-quarter decline in our cash position was due to the Magento acquisition. Cash flow from operations was $955 million in the quarter. And in Q3, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares at a cost of $714 million. We currently have $150 million remaining of our $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017. We expect this authorization to be exhausted by the end of fiscal year 2018. On May 21, we announced that our board had authorized an incremental $8 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal year 2021, which will be funded from future cash flow generation. Now I will provide our financial outlook. In Q4 FY '18, we expect normal seasonal year-end strength in our business and are targeting : revenue of approximately $2,420,000,000; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 22%; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%; tax rate of approximately 6% on a GAAP basis and 5% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 495 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.42; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.87; and net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $385 million. Our Q4 FY '17 Digital Media segment included a material amount of Acrobat perpetual licensing revenue. As we continue to migrate the business to subscriptions, we do not expect material Acrobat perpetual licensing this Q4. This is factored into our Digital Media year-over-year revenue growth target. Given the lower-than-expected write-down of Magento deferred revenue that we discussed earlier, we expect some slight upside to our original target of $30 million of Magento revenue in Q4. We look forward to a strong Q4 close and another record year for Adobe. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Saviage : Thanks, John.

[Operator Instructions]. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Jennifer Lowe : I wanted to ask about, coming into this quarter, there was some concern that GDPR could have an impact on Q3 Digital Media ARR. Obviously, the results speak for themselves that there wasn't as much of an impact there as maybe were contemplated initially. But if I put that in the context of Q4 ARR guidance and given sort of Adobe's long history of conservatism, the seasonality there is maybe even a little better than I would have expected going into Q4 relative to what you did last year. So can you talk a little bit about that was no impact from GDPR or was just less than maybe you thought it could be? And does that sort of set up a more positive dynamic headed into Q4 around ARR? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Jennifer. I mean, there a couple of questions in there. First, some color on GDPR. As we know, requirements and regulations for all businesses that are transacting online continue to evolve. But from our perspective and looking at Q3, we don't think it'll fundamentally change the relentless move that all businesses have to do more online, which is driven by customer preference. We did transition our own adobe.com sites to meet these requirements. And we'll continue to tweak and evolve our technology to lead the market. And as you pointed out, our results show that we achieved strong results in Q3. When we look at the transition between Q3 and Q4, I think it's important to remember a couple of things. The first is Q3 tends to be seasonally weak, and so Q4 is our seasonally strong quarter. Education comes back, and education will show its strength in Q4. I think, with MAX coming up and all of the innovation that we continue to show with respect to MAX, which will be exciting, I hope you're attending, is also going to be in Q4. So Q3 ARR was strong. The business continues to add momentum. I think John spoke in his prepared remarks also as to strength that we saw across offerings. I'll highlight mobile. Mobile, we continue to drive a lot of new customer acquisition through units, Single App of Acrobat and the Photography continue to do well. So we continue to innovate in creativity, and there's strong demand there, Jennifer. Jennifer Lowe : Okay. Great. And maybe just one last one for me. The pricing increase in the U.S. was obviously sort of a big topic amongst investors. Is there any notable benefit to ARPU as a result of that? Or does it just sort of become rounding [error][ph] given the size of the business? Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think our primary focus, again, putting it in big picture, continues to be attracting new customers and delivering value. Certainly, the new pricing that we introduced was accretive to us, but we continue to attract new customers. And they are seeing the benefit, as you point out again, with all of the innovation that we deliver, Lightroom, XD, Character Animator, Spark and Dimension, it was clearly the right time to introduce new pricing. And -- but we have also had quite a bit of experience with that as currency has fluctuated in other countries. The one other thing I might mention here is I know there have been some questions to Mike about promotions and how we look at promotions as well. From our point of view, they continue to be compelling events to drive a call to action. And then we see a double benefit because not only do we attract new customers to the platform but with strong retention rates that, at renewal time, leads to a further increase in ARR, which, again, when you think about Q4, given annual cycles, that's another thing that factors into our guidance for Q4. So all in all, we think our business is good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : Shantanu, you've seen a steady re-acceleration in Experience Cloud. I'm curious if you could just talk to what you're seeing there. And I think tying into that, just coming off of a $1.8 billion acquisition, there's obviously some chatter about you looking to be more inquisitive. Just given the re-acceleration in Experience Cloud, maybe just talk through your appetite for larger transactions. Realize you have the [$8][ph] billion buyback also on your plate. Shantanu Narayen : I think big picture, the whole digital transformation agenda, Brent, continues to be front and center to every C-level executive. We had strong bookings. I think we talked about that a couple of times both in my prepared remarks as well as in John's and I think the strength of our product portfolio, which continues to be differentiated. Magento was off to good start. I mean, the fact that they have both B2B and B2C, I think, continues to help. We saw some good deployments of Adobe Experience Manager. So big picture, we, again are continuing to see a lot of demand for our solutions. We had some great events that we had all around the world. We normally do Japan and Sydney and Singapore during the quarter. And so I think it's digital transformation and customer centricity and loyalty that's driving the Digital Experience business. As you know, we would never comment on a market rumor. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan : Congrats from me. Sorry for any background noise. I actually -- Shantanu, I wanted to ask a little bit around the announcement you -- that's coming up on the Adobe Document Cloud. And I wondered if there's any sort of way you could maybe give us a little preview of that here or at least directionally talk about what the intent is there. And then related to that, John, the comments around the Acrobat perpetual license being not material, couple that with the deceleration in Digital Media revenue in Q4 relative to the strength in net new ARR, my math, I was trying to back into it, would suggest a little bit below $100 million of perpetual win last year and maybe most of that's going to go away. And I wondered if you could maybe just comment on whether that's directionally right. Shantanu Narayen : Ross, to answer your first question, we continue to see a lot of demand in people really both automating inefficient paper-based processes as well as using mobile devices to deal with PDF. I think we mentioned that over 50 billion PDFs are being opened in our documents alone. And so I think as we think about the document business in particular, among the customer pieces of feedback that we're getting, the first one clearly is that they want access to that PDF across all of -- all devices. They continue to want to have mobile devices being a PDF-creation device. So we talked a little bit about scanning and storage therefore so that people can actually have access to their content across devices. The other area I would say that a lot of people are looking at is certainly collaboration and what we can do with respect to collaboration and allowing different people to participate in a document workflow. And certainly signing and the interest in signing, whether that's ad hoc completely using the Acrobat product and desktop readers or complete workflows where signing is an ingredient within the enterprises. Hopefully, that gives you a flavor for how we are thinking about how we will continue to innovate in Document Cloud. And the one other thing I'd mention is a deeper focus on partnerships and what we are doing to ensure that PDF is embedded within other ecosystems. We certainly introduced recently support for both Sign in SharePoint as well as in Outlook. So that hopefully gives you a flavor of where we're focused with the document business. John Murphy : And Ross, just in regards to your comment on perpetual revenue with Acrobat, really, what we're trying to explain is that in Q4 FY '17 we actually had a large perpetual revenue in that quarter. And we still sell both perpetual and subscription, and what we're expecting this quarter is not quite as large a perpetual revenue this quarter because we see continued momentum as customers are migrating to subscriptions. So it's -- for us, it's really kind of following our strategy for the business, and we're excited about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Two things for Shantanu. At MAX -- sorry, at Summit month ago, you talked about the strategic objectives or road map for Experience Cloud, and you said that what you want to do is deliver unified experience, streamlined integration of Experience Cloud. I wish I assume you were referring to both content and data and the multiple solutions. And then also deliver what you called domain-specific expertise via AI. And when you look back over the last six months and well, clearly, perhaps over the next 12 months, can you talk about some of the key things that you achieved, particularly in the area of integration, which had been a bit of an issue within the portfolio a while back? And maybe talk about that vis-\u00e0-vis the Experience Cloud road map. And at MAX last year, in the context of talking about your various new products within CC, you made the very interesting comment that XD could be the next InDesign. In other words, that would be your next big holding new product. And as such, when do you think XD might become your next nine-figure business, particularly when you think about the fact that you have no incumbent to go up against as you did with InD? Shantanu Narayen : So Jay, let me take both of those questions. First, with respect what we are doing on the Experience Cloud, an area of innovation that we're particularly excited about is enabling for all enterprises to have a Unified Customer Profile, where we are getting all of the behavioral, demographic data for customers across all of our different solutions. It's something that customers are already testing out in beta. And if you think about that, what it really means for us is this Unified Customer Profile can become the central nervous system in an enterprise, not just therefore targeting the CMOs but increasingly having the CIOs look at that as the basis for how they want to integrate a unified customer experience across all of the different enterprise solutions that might exist. And so that also then allows us, to your second question about the domain-specific AI, with Adobe Sensei, we have the ability for people not only to have our AI be applied to their dataset but for also their own AI and their data science continues to be leveraged using the datasets that they have. So both of those, we've started to deliver them. When I look at the results of the bookings in Q3, the multiproduct implementation and sales continues to be strong. So it's clearly an effective tool for us to go in and have more of the entire CMO deck be served by Adobe. So both of those, we continue to do it. I'm sure Brad will give an update at MAX as well in terms of how we see that, and so we look forward to that. And with respect to your question on MAX, certainly, XD and screen design has been an area of fairly deep investment for us. It's the only cross-platform solution, I think, we talk about not just helping design mobile applications but every screen. I mean, you have all of this content that's being delivered to screens across retail, across even fast food. And our products, all the way from content creation to content management and delivery, is powering that. Collaboration is another area for XD. And it's harder than it was in the InDesign as a result of more and more people using the Creative Cloud entire suite to look at just an individual product but both from an individual product monthly average usage of XD as well as the adoption in Creative Cloud All Apps, we continue to be pleased with how XD is doing. And that just serves as additional value to all of our Creative customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Walter Pritchard : A question for you, Shantanu, on the experience side from a product perspective. I'm wondering if you feel like sort of going down market where you have a lot of competition in that space. Do you feel like your product is adequately positioned there? And if not, what else do you need to get that whole experience suite down market into more of the mid-market? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think, Walter, we were looking for a nice beachhead to start to think about how we could leverage the strength that we had in the enterprise down into whether that's departments, mid-market, commercial, sort of is another way in which people look at it. And that has been an area where we have seen some good adoption. And so our job was to continue to leverage Magento within the enterprise and to leverage Magento's base and their ecosystem of developers by allowing them. And I would say both the Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Analytics are products that can be used in that particular category to create websites as well as to have analytics in there. So it will continue to be an area. I think you're also seeing this product now being used within B2B installations as they all want to create a direct relationship with customers. So you have a lot of these companies that have billions of customers but don't have direct access to those folks because they go through a distribution channel. So hopefully, that gives you some indication of how we're continuing to expand the customer set that we target with Experience Cloud. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Shantanu, continuing on the Digital Experience theme. Can you talk a bit about your relationship with Microsoft in Digital Experience? And is there any way to size or scope these types of deals or think about the number of products included? And are you seeing accelerating adoption now that you've been in market for some time? Shantanu Narayen : The first answer, Brad, is we're definitely seeing accelerated adoption as a result of our products having been delivered on Azure. And I think going back to what I talked about with respect to the customer profile, what we are seeing are people are standardizing on Azure increasingly as an infrastructure for their cloud-based solutions, and we have a really great solution on top of that in order to be able to bring this Unified Customer Profile that exists. And so the success is leading to larger deals. It's leading to higher close rates. And frankly, I think more and more of both the Microsoft field force as well as the Adobe one are now looking at it and saying this is something that's resonating with customers. And so it is accelerating. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Saket Kalia : Shantanu, perhaps a more strategic question for you on Magento, understanding that it's still relatively early. I guess, as you look at other commerce clouds out there, how can you differentiate Magento either technically or perhaps from a pricing packaging perspective over time? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Saket. I mean, a couple of things. The first is I would not underestimate the importance of commerce being tied into content management systems and analytics because while commerce is closing the loop, the real activity is happening when you're doing A/B testing or where you're delivery content. And from my point of view, what was really attractive about Magento in addition to this really closing the loop and making every experience shoppable is the fact that they were the only player who had both B2B as well as B2C as well as digital goods and physical goods. And the other thing that I think they brought to bear, which is really paying off, is this ecosystem. What's happened in the commerce market, if you think about it, is that there are so many separate customization efforts. Having this large ecosystem of over 300,000 developers leads to both more rapid time to value for the enterprise customers, and honestly, they actually serve in many ways as a channel because they are helping with the ability to quickly install Magento as a way to bring us into more deals. And so that was the strategic rationale. I mean, it was a clear -- as you know, we had integrations with a whole bunch of different vendors, but the customers really wanted a solution end to end from Adobe. And we're pleased that we're able to deliver it, and it's off to a good start. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Aleksandr Zukin : So just maybe a strategic one on mid-market and B2B. You've mentioned it a couple times now. So I guess, my question is basically, if I think about from a go-to-market perspective, how are you thinking about attacking the mid-market opportunity. And is the Microsoft partnership something that could evolve to be helpful there? And then what about the B2B market, in addition to Magento, makes that uniquely interesting for Adobe at this point in time? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I mean, first, to your question, Alex, partner certainly plays a huge role in terms of the amplification of how effectively we can get in and meet all of those customers in the mid-market. But we also have and we've always had ability through inside sales as well as the ability through partners to target them. So that isn't rocket science. We certainly have the ability to do that. And with Magento, we have the product as well that serves them well. And then as we think about B2B, what's really happening -- I mean, think of yourself as a consumer goods company. You may be a consumer goods company where you have 1 billion people use your product every day, but you don't have the ability to have those customers in your profile because you're going through a distribution channel. They're increasingly understanding that they have to create that direct relationship with customers, and so it's going to be a big part of the expansion of how we look at our business because they're all looking at Adobe to help them do what we frankly did in many ways, which was have a direct relationship with our customers. So B2B2C is already a major trend that's happening, and we're a key part of digitally enabling that. Aleksandr Zukin : Got it. And maybe just one follow-up. If you think about Experience Cloud growth, and we -- if we back out Magento from the quarter and your guide, kind of core markets, core Experience Cloud revenue growth is in the mid-teens, is that what you consider healthy and what we should expect going forward? Do you see that accelerating over time? What's the right way to think about it? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think when you look at Experience Cloud, I think it's important to remember what we said at the beginning of the year as we are focused a lot more on subscription bookings and subscription revenue growth, and to really understand that from our point of view, when you look at Q1, Q2, Q3 and the targets for Q4, it's actually ahead of what we had said. And so I -- we think we have a great offering. We're the leader in that market, and continuing to focus on the massive addressable opportunity is what we are doing. But clearly, 2018, we were going through that as well as we talked about having the partner ecosystem take on more of the services part of it. And you can -- you probably see that as well if you look at the financial data sheets that we've provided. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from BofA. Kasthuri Rangan : Shantanu, a question for you. You talked about conversion rates from free products to paid subscribers for Creative in a way that I've not heard before. Can you just expand on that in the context of your previous observations that the TAM for the Creative Cloud product in this cycle is a multiple of the TAM that existed in the days bygone? So how is this all working out conceptually? Do you still continue to believe that to be the case? It does look like the front end of the funnel is expanding at a rate greater than we all anticipated. I know it's more of a question/observation but just really want to draw you out on your thoughts on why this creative cycle is a much bigger cycle and why is it taking much longer in this cycle than what we all expected. Shantanu Narayen : Kash, I think we've always talked about the fact that if we look at the installed base of Creative and the number of creatives that exist, it's a massive number. And when you think about what's happening with the segment like photography or when you think about what's happening with mobile and you think about what's happening with emerging markets and students, those have always been areas of tremendous interest for us. I would say where we have really matured is when you think about the data-driven model that we're using to run that particular business, and Bryan's going to touch in more detail on this at MAX. The fact that we understand what we have to do on the discover, try, buy, use and renew part of that workflow, we have got so much better at understanding how people are discovering us and why trialists is a key part of getting people both aware of our products, using our products and then converting. And so I wouldn't say that, that's new. I would say that we're getting better and better at it as we understand how to tailor our offerings. I think the other thing that we've always talked about is the fact that we now have more offerings enables us to further attract new customers to the platform. With the only All Apps, we did not have the kind of offerings that we have right now. The fact that we can do it with mobile, we have multiple photography offerings, there's just far more scrutiny and focus on how we attract new customers to the platform, Kash. And I think in the past, we've thrown out that we have over 100 million IDs that are being created by these trialers, and that's how we look at expanding the top of funnel. Kasthuri Rangan : So that's the ultimate TAM, $100 million in an ideal case. Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think we talk about it more with respect to the over $30 billion that exists in Digital Media between what we have as Document Cloud and Creative Cloud. And I know the question that has also always come by is piracy and are we affecting piracy. There's no question that we're continuing to impact piracy with the business model and the fact that we're allowing people to trial and then convert more effectively. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : In the prepared remarks, there was a comment about customers increasingly coming direct to adobe.com to transact the business. It's been some time. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of your business is now being transacted direct through your e-store or through adobe.com? And is there still further margin benefit to be captured moving forward from further increasing that percentage? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Sterling, I mean, when I look at the Digital Media business, I maybe separate a little bit of what's happening in the Creative side of that business with what's happening on the Acrobat side of the business. In the Creative side of the business, and there may be a few countries that are the exception, but the vast majority of consumers are directly interfacing with us on adobe.com. We certainly have, as you know, an enterprise ETLA. That did really well as enterprises are adopting more and more services. That's increasing the ARPU that exists with enterprises. So I would say the Creative business is primarily happening through adobe.com, except again, as I said, in some countries, where retail is a strong presence. On the document side of the business, I think given a lot of people still buy Acrobat when they buy a new PC as well as in conjunction with Office, the channel continues to be an important partner for us. And that's why we continue to offer both the subscription now, which is increasingly the preferred when -- which people are buying Acrobat DC. But I would say, there, it's still a fairly large percentage of our business and an important part of how we go to market. So hopefully that's giving that gives you some color of what it is. But more and more, it's happening on adobe.com. And as we expand the base and as we renew online and we hopefully up sell them to higher value products, all of those represent both ARR as well as margin improvement opportunities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : I'd like to drill a little more as others haven't experienced digital marketing. When you look at that overall market, there's a lot of fragmentation within the market. How should we think about the drivers of growth going forward? Is it more market consolidation or market growth? Which do you think is the bigger driver that's going to help drive that business? Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think you're right in terms of fragmentation. I think the fact that we have a platform is a clear differentiator and allows us to get a disproportionate share. We talk a lot about the number of multi-solution deals, and we're going to continue to, I think, do well in that particular respect. Outside the U.S. continues to be a really important market opportunity for us. I think we've said with commerce now as part of the portfolio that we have, that's an over $60 billion TAM, and that's available for us. But a lot of the small players that existed in different categories, we're clearly getting the request from our customers that across all of these channels, they want one unified way of personalizing the experience. And so I think the consolidation that's happening in that space, Mark, is as a result of when people are using more and more of our solutions, their ability to address that customers is significantly better when -- than when all these fragmented solutions don't talk to each other. And that's our goal, to be the experience platform to enable them to run their business online. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : I just had two quick questions. Obviously, you guys had great performance with Magento this quarter. And I know you mentioned it closed a little early and you didn't have the amount of the write-down that you were expecting. But when you think about the comments you made about the upside to your guide for Q4, you had guided to $30 million, how do we think about the magnitude there? Because I would imagine there are some good seasonality in the business and you'll catch the tail end of the start of -- I'm sorry, the beginning at the tail end of your quarter of the holiday shopping season. And then I also had a question, if we look out to ARR build, obviously, you outperformed very nicely there this quarter as you typically do. And if we look out to the next fiscal year, is there any reason -- or anything that would cause you -- or cause it -- cause the change in ARR in the next fiscal year to be below what you're guiding to this year, the net change? Shantanu Narayen : I'll take the question on ARR, and then maybe John can give you more color on the Magento. I think on the ARR, Heather, at the FA meeting, we'll talk a lot more about it. I think it's -- we're focused on a strong close for Q4 and we'll give you more color on the interesting things that are happening at MAX. We continue to be excited about the long-term opportunity. John Murphy : Heather, in regards to Magento's deferred revenue, when we acquired the company, of course, everyone goes through and evaluates the deferred revenue and whether or not you have a haircut, how much of a haircut. And so when we did the deal, we announced that we really didn't have that work done through the quarter. We ended up realizing that we ended up with a much smaller haircut than we expected. Much of that haircut was really realized in Q3, so we had slight upside in Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Stewart Materne : Shantanu, can you just talk a little bit about stock this quarter? Actually, you sort of called it out in your prepared remarks being up 30% year-over-year, which is pretty obviously very strong. So I was just wondering if there's anything specific this quarter you all saw in terms of just better cross-selling, new net sort of demand gen. Anything you want to maybe just add in terms of some color around that specific product? Shantanu Narayen : Look, I would just say we continue to execute against the opportunity. And we've always maintained that the people who contribute stock and the people who use stock are our customers. And I would say the success was both in the enterprise where we're certainly now having large stock deals that allow them to have access to our entire assets. The fact that the content inventory is improving across a different variety of media types, I think that continues to play a role. And if you look at our apps, I think one thing we're continuing to do better is the integration of the stock portfolio that we have and the Sensei-based features that we have to find the right asset as a means to accelerate content creation is also I think starting to show benefits. And last but not least, I mean, we do have offerings that have both the creative products as well as Stock as part of an offering. We think that's great value, and that continues to be something that we are making available to our customers. So I think across-the-board, we continue to be excited about stock as a service that people will look at as an extension of the Creative Cloud. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. James Wood : I wanted to ask about churn in your Digital Media business. So I'm curious, have you seen any impact on retention rates with -- since the price change in U.S.? And then if you take a longer term view, I think churn has been steady for some time in the mid-teens range. Do you see any things you can do to improve that? Or is that just kind of the natural state of the market going forward? Shantanu Narayen : I think with respect churn and retention, which continues to be a huge area of focus for us, I think the way we continue to be focused on it, it continues to do well so that we haven't seen really any change in the aggregate as it relates to churn. But the thing that we will continue to do is the more offerings you have and the more those offerings can be tailored allows us to actually target and retain more of the customer base. So I think that is one of the things with mobile. We're able to do that. And we continue to be really focused. I mean, in that sense, I just look at it and say when there's a long tail of creators, the deeper our offering is, whether it's Spark, Premium at one end of the spectrum or the ability to do one PDF conversion all the way to the entire Creative Suite or Creative Suite plus Acrobat app, that's the way in which you can continue to make sure that you're delivering value to a broader and broader swath of customers. And outside the U.S., the ability to have differential pricing and look at that differential pricing also is another way that we will continue to focus on retention, on sales and continuing to have people have value. And so I think that's the way we look at it. But given that was the last question, Derrick, I mean, just for everybody, I think Q3 reflected another quarter from our perspective of both strong execution and validation that the strategy of empowering people to create and helping businesses transform is working. When you look at the Q4 targets, I think it reflects the momentum that we continue to drive across all geographies and all offerings. And we're really excited about sharing more at MAX about how we intend to continue to expand addressable markets and the strategic initiatives that we will focus on as a company to drive sustained growth on both the top and bottom line and deliver more value to our customers. But we appreciate you joining us on the call today. Mike Saviage : Thanks, everyone. We'll see you at MAX. This concludes the call.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Fiscal 2018 was an outstanding year for Adobe, and I'm thrilled with what we've accomplished. Our vision to empower people to create and transform how businesses compete has never been more relevant, and we welcomed millions of new customers to Adobe. From students to creative professionals to government agencies in the world's most successful brands, customers everywhere are turning to Adobe to tell their story, drive their digital businesses and change the world. This year, we delivered significant innovation across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. We made strategic acquisitions, which have expanded our offerings in addressable markets, and we forged key partnerships that bring us increased scale. These actions have resulted in record revenue and impressive growth across all our businesses. As we enter 2019, Adobe is well positioned to build on this momentum, delight our customers and continue to deliver impressive long-term top and bottom line growth. Total Adobe revenue was $9.03 billion in FY '18, which represents 24% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY '18 was $5.20, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $6.76. Total Digital Media annualized recurring revenue or ARR exiting the year grew to $6.83 billion. FY '18 Creative revenue was $5.34 billion, which represents 28% year-over-year growth. We achieved annual revenue of $982 million for Document Cloud. And in our Digital Experience business, Experience Cloud revenue for the full year was $2.44 billion, representing 20% year-over-year growth. We closed the year with another record quarter, delivering Q4 revenue of $2.46 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.37, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.83. These results include the acquisition of Marketo and the associated financial impacts that come with a large transaction. Excluding Marketo, we met or exceeded all of our Q4 and annual targets. Adobe believes everyone has a story to tell. Tens of millions of people around the world tell their story with Creative Cloud, whether it's in a high school magazine, a mobile app, a documentary at Sundance or an enterprise website. We achieved record Creative revenue of $1.45 billion in Q4 with 26% year-over-year growth. In Q4, our Creative business was fueled by strong performance across all segments, particularly among consumers. Black Friday and Cyber Monday were two of the largest single selling days in company history. We focused on expanding the value of Creative Cloud for existing customers while extending its capabilities to meet the needs of broad new segments of users. In October, we held our annual MAX Creativity Conference. MAX has become a movement with reach and impact well beyond the physical event. This year, hundreds of thousands of Creative customers tuned in online to watch MAX and millions more continue to view MAX content. Product announcements at MAX included major updates to our flagship Creative tools, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign and Premiere Pro; the introduction of Premiere Rush, the first all-in-one, easy-to-use video editing app for social media creators, simplifying video creation and sharing on leading platforms such as YouTube and Instagram. Online video is one of the fastest growing Creative segments, and Rush is a cornerstone of our strategy to unlock this opportunity for millions of new customers. Exciting new innovations, powered by Adobe Sensei inside of Adobe XD, include new technology for prototyping experiences and applications for voice-enabled devices such as Amazon Echo; and new apps including Photoshop on the iPad, which will bring the power and precision of Photoshop to a touch device; and Project Gemini, a new drawing and painting application that brings unprecedented watercolor and oil painting capabilities to the digital canvas. In our Document Cloud business, we're revolutionizing how people scan, edit, collaborate, sign and share Adobe PDFs, whether they're consumers, small businesses or large enterprises. Document Cloud revenue in Q4 was $259 million, and we grew Document Cloud ARR to more than $800 million. We continue to accelerate our pace of innovation with Document Cloud, investing to modernize the PDF experience on every device and surface and building on the document intelligence available from the billions of PDFs in market to power AI-driven experiences. We recently shipped an all-new Acrobat DC with connected mobile apps like Adobe Scan and Acrobat Reader Mobile to create, share and collaborate with PDFs across smartphones and tablets. Adobe Sign, our e-signature solution, continues to gain momentum across businesses through new integrations and partnerships, including Dropbox, Microsoft Dynamics and ServiceNow. Digital transformation continues to be the mandate for CEOs across the globe. To compete and win today, both B2C and B2B businesses must provide a world-class, end-to-end customer experience across every touch point. With Experience Cloud, Adobe is reimagining customer experience management and delivering the industry's only end-to-end solution for marketing, advertising, analytics and commerce purpose built for the modern enterprise. In our Digital Experience business, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $690 million for the quarter, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. Key Experience Cloud customer wins in the quarter include Unilever, The Home Depot, Telegraph Media Group, Geico, Heathrow Airport and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Delivering exceptional customer experiences demands deep customer insights and a platform built for action. We continue to invest in building the industry's first open platform for customer experience management, the Adobe Experience Platform. The Adobe Experience Platform will deliver true, unified view of the customer for both CMOs and CIOs. In partnership with Microsoft and SAP, the recently announced Open Data Initiative is aimed at eliminating the data silos that exist across enterprises. It will enable enterprises to harness and take action on massive volumes of customer data to deliver personalized, real-time customer experiences. We're excited to have early support for ODI from leading brands, including Coca-Cola and Walmart. Adobe's retail reports, powered by Adobe Analytics data, have become the industry bellwether for holiday shopping forecasts and other digital media, commerce and cultural trends. Adobe analyzed over 1 trillion visits and 55 million product SKUs across U.S. retail sites this holiday season. Data showed that online sales reached $7.9 billion on Cyber Monday, making it the largest online shopping day of all time in the U.S. In October, we completed our acquisition of Marketo, the leader in B2B marketing engagement, and we're off to a great start. Marketo strengthens our offering to customers, combining Experience Cloud's analytics, personalization, commerce and content capabilities with Marketo's B2B marketing engagement platform, helping customers automate and orchestrate mission-critical marketing campaigns and activities from lead management and customer engagement to account-based marketing and revenue attribution. The addition of Marketo, along with our recently integrated commerce capabilities via our acquisition of Magento, widens Adobe's lead in customer management across both B2B and B2C in all industries. We're well positioned to continue capitalizing on this growing opportunity that we estimate to have a total addressable market of more than $71 billion by 2021. Adding Marketo to our Digital Experience business immediately accelerates overall revenue growth for Adobe, and other financial benefits will ramp during FY '19 as the accounting impact from the transaction dissipates. Adobe is the clear leader in the markets we serve : creativity, digital documents and customer experience management. Our solutions have become indispensable to millions of customers, whether they are in the design department or the IT department, the classroom or the boardroom. At Adobe, it is our 20,000 global employees that form the heart and soul of our business. In October, we achieved global gender pay parity, a critical milestone in Adobe's commitment to providing employees with a workplace that is diverse and inclusive. Last week, we were named one of Fortune's Top 100 Best Workplaces for Diversity. Adobe was once again ranked on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a key barometer tracking sustainability-driven companies. In 2018, we made significant investments across our product portfolio, entered new markets and made strategic acquisitions, which we believe will fuel continued top and bottom line performance. We expect 2019 to be another year of strong product innovation and financial results. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. We're pleased with our Q4 and full year FY '18 results. We're excited about our acquisition of Marketo, which closed on October 31, and as part of my prepared remarks, I will review our consolidated Q4 and FY '18 results and outline Marketo's impact in comparison to our targets previously provided, which excluded Marketo. In FY '18, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $9.03 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $5.20, and non-GAAP EPS was $6.76. Noteworthy achievements during the year include : Creative revenue of $5.34 billion, which represents 28% year-over-year growth; Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $982 million, which represents 17% year-over-year growth; adding a record $1.45 billion of net new Digital Media ARR during the year, and exiting FY '18 with $6.83 billion of Digital Media ARR; Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.44 billion, which represents 20% year-over-year growth; generating more than $4 billion in operating cash flow during the year; returning $2 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program; and growing deferred revenue to approximately $3 billion, and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $5 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $8 billion of contracted revenue. Total annual revenue growth, excluding Magento and Marketo, was approximately 22%, well ahead of the revenue target we provided entering the year. In the fourth quarter of FY '18, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.46 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.37, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.83. Excluding the impact of the Marketo acquisition in Q4, we estimate GAAP EPS would have been $1.48 and non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.90, both of which would have exceeded the earnings targets we provided in September. Business and financial highlights in Q4 included : Digital Media revenue of $1.71 billion, including Creative revenue of $1.45 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $259 million; record net new Digital Media ARR of $430 million; Digital Experience revenue of $690 million, which represents 25% year-over-year growth; deferred revenue growth of 22% year-over-year; record cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion; returning $397 million of cash to our stockholders through stock buyback; and approximately 90% of our revenue in Q4 was from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of $430 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $6.83 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 26% year-over-year in Q4, and we increased Creative ARR by a record $373 million. Key growth drivers included : strong net new subscriptions across user segments and geographies, driven by robust traffic and customer acquisition on adobe.com and helped by typical year-end benefits including enterprise seasonality, post-MAX traffic and holiday campaigns, which drove strong consumer adoption; education market success driven by our year-long effort to increase our focus on Creative Cloud use by students and schools; continued momentum with Creative Cloud in emerging markets; services adoption, including continued strength with Adobe Stock revenue, which grew by more than 25% during the year; and pricing optimizations in North America. As we outlined at our financial analyst meeting in October, we're focused on numerous initiatives to continue to fuel Creative Cloud growth in the coming years. We achieved record Document Cloud revenue of $259 million in Q4, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, and we added $57 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. As we discussed previously, in Q4 FY '17, we achieved a significant amount of perpetual Acrobat revenue through the channel, which impacts year-over-year comparisons. Acrobat unit growth across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud was greater than 30% during the year, and Adobe Sign revenue grew by more than 25% during FY '18. With strong Acrobat subscription and Document Cloud services adoption, we exited FY '18 with more than $800 million of Document Cloud ARR and solid momentum. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record quarterly Experience Cloud revenue of $690 million. Magento exceeded the $30 million target we shared previously for Q4, and Marketo added $21 million during the quarter. Digital Experience year-over-year segment growth was 25% in Q4 inclusive of Marketo and 22% excluding Marketo, ahead of our Q4 target of approximately 20%. For the year, Digital Experience year-over-year segment growth was 20% inclusive of Magento and Marketo. We finished the year with strong subscription bookings in line with our target. In Q4, Experience Cloud subscription revenue grew 30% year-over-year; and for the year, we achieved 26% year-over-year Experience Cloud subscription revenue growth, both including Magento and Marketo. Experience Cloud performance in Q4 was driven by success across our offerings with particular strength in Analytics, AEM Assets and Magento Commerce. Our go-to-market relationship with Microsoft resulted in strong bookings in Q4 and during the year. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $30.5 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '18 versus $16.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '18. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.2 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $7.9 million. We had $30.5 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '18 versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '17. Thus, the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $37.4 million. In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 3% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Both rates were lower than targeted due to a more favorable-than-expected geographic mix of earnings as well as the favorable resolutions of certain income tax matters. Our trade DSO was 49 days, which compares to 55 days in the year-ago quarter and 41 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $3.05 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $3.23 billion, and cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion in the quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline in our cash position was due to the funding of the Marketo acquisition. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a cost of $397 million. During FY '18, we repurchased 8.7 million shares at a cost of $2 billion. We currently have $7.85 billion remaining of our new $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May, which goes through 2021. Now I will discuss our financial targets for the coming year. Entering FY '19, we are excited about our business momentum, our market leadership position and the large addressable markets we presented at our recent financial analyst meeting in October. The strategic acquisitions we made in FY '18 increased FY '19 revenue growth targets with some added complexity in describing our financial outlook. I'll explain some of the details as I walk you through our targets. As we've stated previously, we will report our FY '19 results based on the new ASC 606 accounting standards beginning in March with our Q1 results. The targets we are providing today are based on ASC 605 as we are still in the process of integrating Marketo into our financial systems to report results utilizing 606. We continue to believe that moving to 606 in FY '19 reporting will not materially impact our revenue. However, we now expect there will be a slight improvement to earnings through the year as we benefit from the capitalization of sales commissions. We measure ARR in constant currency during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year-end for current currency rates. Adverse FX rate changes between December of last year and this year have resulted in a $123 million adjustment and lowers our beginning FY '19 Digital Media ARR balance to $6.71 billion. This expected revision is reflected in our updated investor datasheet and our FY '19 net new growth target, and our quarterly results will be measured against this revalued amount during FY '19. In FY '19, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $11,150,000,000; Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.45 billion, an increase above our preliminary target provided in October; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 34%; Digital Experience subscription bookings growth of approximately 25%; a GAAP tax rate of approximately 10% and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 11%; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $5.54; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $7.75. Certain factors are reflected in our FY '19 annual targets specifically : approximately $35 million of adverse revenue impact due to current FX rates, which have moved against us since we provided preliminary FY '19 targets that were based on September spot rates; approximately $75 million reduction in revenue from the write-down of deferred revenue for Magento and Marketo due to purchase accounting; and the increase in tax rates between FY '18 and FY '19. In Q1 FY '19, we are targeting revenue of approximately $2,540,000,000; Digital Media segment year-over-year growth of approximately 20%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $330 million; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 31%; other expense of approximately $39 million; tax rate of approximately 3% on a GAAP basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 495 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.14; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.60. For modeling purposes, after Q1, we expect total revenue in each quarter to grow by approximately the same year-over-year growth percentage implied in our targeted revenue growth rate for the year. In addition, after Q1, we expect net new Digital Media ARR in each quarter to be sequentially similar as that achieved in past fiscal years from quarter-to-quarter with typical summer seasonality, which can lead to sequentially lower net new ARR in Q3 as well as normal year-end sequential strength in Q4 net new ARR. As the impact of lost deferred revenue due to purchase accounting tapers off during FY '19 and as we grow our business, we expect quarterly operating margins to increase sequentially. We also expect quarterly year-over-year earnings growth rates to increase during the year. In summary, FY '18 was another record year for Adobe as demonstrated by our strong revenue and earnings growth and exceptional cash flow from operations. More importantly, during the year, we've invested in the business to continue our momentum over the long term. Our growth targets for the coming year reflect our confidence in our ability to execute, and we expect to exit FY '19 with a business that continues to exhibit strong top line growth, expanding profit margins and earnings growth rates that equal or exceed top line growth rates. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Saviage : Thanks, John. Adobe Summit returns to Las Vegas in March. Day 1 of our Digital Experience conference is Tuesday, March 26.

[Operator Instructions]. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : I'm wondering, for Shantanu, on the Creative side, as we look to next year, fiscal '19, and ARR that you're talking about, can you help us understand maybe how some of the drivers that you saw this year may evolve into 2019? Which of the drivers there were -- do you expect to continue? Which do you expect to strengthen? And any that you expect to sort of wane in terms of driving that $1.45 billion ARR? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Walter. I mean, first, as it relates to FY '18, we're certainly thrilled with the performance; and when you think about both Q4 and FY '18, we actually saw strength in ARR across all offerings as well as all geographies. Q4 was characterized, I would say, with the typical seasonal enterprise strength that we see at the end of Q4. We saw a bunch of consumer strength as we also said in our prepared remarks. But whether it was the Individual offering, the team offering or the enterprise offering, they just continue to show quite a bit of momentum. And we expect that momentum, frankly, to continue into FY '19. So I think from the Individual products, when you think about what's happening with the photography bundle, what's happening with Acrobat, what's happening with the video products, clearly, we've identified that we're working on some new categories like XD and what we showed with augmented reality and virtual reality, continued offering of services, which is adding to this. But as you remember, even during MAX, we announced numerous set of initiatives that we expect we'll all continue to drive, emerging markets, continued adoption of our services. So we're just really pleased. And I think it's important to remember, even when you look at the $1.45 billion target for next year, that FX did go adversely against us. And so when we think about both new units as well as renewal of units that happens next year, if they are internationally, that's actually going to be adverse relative to FY '18, so clearly, I think, indicating that the momentum that we saw in '18 will continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Saket Kalia : Shantanu, just to maybe think a little higher level, can you just talk about how the Digital Experience sales force might change this year now that it has just a lot more to sell and potentially different types of customers to sell into with both B2C and B2B? How do you think about the sales force can sort of go to market in 2019 with the addition of Magento and Marketo? Shantanu Narayen : Saket, what we have done is, even in fiscal '18 as we have segmented the market and we think very strategically about what's happening in what we call the strategic accounts versus the corporate accounts versus the territory accounts, we've got a go to market that's optimized around what's the best way to generate pipeline, what's the best way to have what we would call named account salespeople versus the specialists. And the more comprehensive the offering, the more it actually strengthens our ability to drive pipeline and then convert existing customers. FY '18 was characterized, I think, by a return to momentum that we saw in subscription bookings. We have certainly seen good adoption, as we mentioned, of our Analytics and AEM products as well as Magento. And so what I'm excited about in FY '19 is when you think about what we had with Adobe Campaign and the B2C high-volume e-mail and cross-channel campaign capability, when you think about what Marketo bought in B2B with a lead management and account-based marketing capability, we now have really a far more comprehensive offering for the enterprise to manage and personalize their end-to-end customer journeys across all channels. So we've already demonstrated integration. Magento is being integrated with AEM. So it just feels like there's more demand for our products. There's more refinement of our go to market; and there's a strengthening, frankly, of the offering, which should help. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Congrats on a strong finish to a great year. Shantanu, at MAX, you spoke a bit about Adobe's data-driven operating model, but I think it would be helpful if you could spend a moment reminding us why this is a competitive advantage and how it contributes to the visibility and predictability that you have in your business. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Brad, and thanks for the comments. I mean, going back to the data-driven operating model, I mean it's a vocabulary that's so prevalent now within Adobe; and when we talk about discover, try, buy, use and renew, I think it just enables us to have tremendous focus across each part of it. I think most companies start off with really good awareness at the top of the funnel, which is on the discovery phase, but what I think we have done is actually provided a really good mathematical underpinning to what we need to do across each of those. So I know you have and others in the past have asked us questions about how we think about promotions. We have incredible data about what is the right way to target those customers, how do they then convert into paying customers, in which countries do trials work, in which countries do trials not work. In terms of the buying, what are the right offers? How do you make recommendations? How do you convert people and upsell them into other offerings? And on the use, which is where I would say in FY '18 we spent the most time, clearly, as the base grows larger and larger and larger, it's in the utilization of the products and ensuring that they get value that the greatest upside exists for Adobe. And so the best example I could give you is once I was at a Wednesday meeting where the entire team was talking about what was happening in realtime and they were making decisions in realtime. So having this mathematical underpinning in a model and empowering people in realtime across every geography to make the right decisions based on data, I think that's really the power of this model. And I think you've seen that in our results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Taylor Reiners : This is Taylor Reiners on for Alex. I guess one of the interesting points we picked up from our conversations with partners is that it seems like AEM Forms has been picking up quite a bit. I was wondering if you could dig in a bit more on the momentum you've been seeing there. And then maybe any comments on what you've been seeing within the e-signature market? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I mean, I think the whole paper-to-digital movement just continues to be a big driver of what's happening in digital transformation. And so if you think about most enterprises, what they have to do is they first have to create this website to engage with customers, and then allowing them to transact businesses digitally is a big imperative. And so to that end, what we have done, both on the Acrobat side as well as on the AEM Forms side to allow everything from ad hoc workflows as well as more structured workflows to happen using our products, it's clearly a drive that we see. Government tends to be a big area of usage for AEM Forms as you can imagine, and the usage of PDF there is high because governments can never mandate that citizens buy software in order to engage with customers. And so I think that's the reason for the underlying strength. And AEM is a platform. It's -- we also talked about AEM Assets and how content management has grown. And from our point of view, as we think about documents, sign is just one of the many verbs that we focus on. The entire document opportunity is such a large opportunity. And it's -- signing is something that we've enabled. We have this incredible reach in terms of the client that we have, and the footprint allows us to sign things. But it's, again, all about creating those documents and sharing those documents and scanning those documents. And so our strength in PDF as a format, our strength in the web content management and our strength in these verbs, including the ability for people to sign, I think, is what gives us confidence that this will continue to drive business for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Stewart Materne : I\u2019ll echo the comments around another strong quarter and great year. I guess, Shantanu, I was wondering just about Magento. It seems that, that came in a little bit above your expectations, and I know it's still early. But commerce seems to be an area that almost every enterprise is interested in to some degree or the other. I was just kind of curious about how that's helping round out -- I think you talked about this a little bit earlier -- but how that's specifically helping you round out sort of your offering, especially at B2C clients as that's an area you used to have to partner with other people around. So I was just kind of curious if you could just comment specifically on Magento. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Kirk. I mean, strategically there are two things that we're excited about with the Magento Commerce solution. The first is, for larger enterprises, the ability to now finally close the loop. We have the content management. We have audience segmentation. And at MagentoLive in Barcelona, we actually already have shown how you can integrate AEM with Magento Commerce. So that's been one of the strategic wins for us as people are thinking about next-generation commerce with mobile being a more fundamental part of it. So just having that built-in integration, having the ability for our salespeople to sell the entire solution to our customers, it's clearly an advantage. The other strategic area of focus for us with Magento is really -- well, Magento was very strong, namely in the mid-market and small and medium businesses. The fact that we have technology and content management and analytics and personalization to add to that as an out-of-box offering for those set of customers is also a strategic advantage for us. And certainly, Marketo adds to that in terms of the offering for that particular segment of customers. So it's across both these dimensions that we do it. And underlying all of that, I think, is their over 300,000 developer, the ecosystem that they have, that's, in effect for us, a channel and that I think with Adobe's brand and that distribution and reach, I think we should continue to capitalize on that opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Jennifer Lowe : Thank you for the detail on Marketo and Magento impacts in Q4 and maybe rolling that to fiscal '19. I think there's a few breadcrumbs in there that would let us get to the revenue impact and the interest expense impacts associated with Marketo. But can you just talk a little bit about the expense line impacts from Marketo embedded in the guidance, both in terms of direct cost acquires with Marketo and also opportunities to invest in that business given that private equity's been controlling the purse strings for a while? Shantanu Narayen : Well, first, Jennifer, I think there were a little bit more than breadcrumbs, but we appreciate the call out in terms of us trying to be transparent associated with that business. Maybe I'll take a little step back and then John can add colors. But I think we just look at it and say Q4 and FY '18, the financial results were clearly stellar. At MAX, as you know, we provided sort of the preliminary targets for FY '19, ARR of $1.4 billion, Digital Media revenue growth of 20%. At that point, what we had said was that we expect DX revenue growth of 20% and subscription bookings growth of 25%. And as you know, at that point, it did not include Marketo because the deal hadn't closed, but we highlighted two things. We highlighted that it would probably -- the earnings would be impacted moving forward as you factor in Marketo, and the tax rate would also impact our earnings profile. What we tried to do is update all of that today to both reflect the continued momentum and demonstrate that -- so from a currency perspective, currency went against us. So since September, despite that, we've raised our ARR target from $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. We've kept the revenue growth for Digital Media at 20% despite, again, as I said, foreign exchange is going against us. In Digital Experience, which is your question, as we think about it, the segment revenue target we have raised to 34% year-over-year growth. So clearly, we are reflecting the continued momentum that we would expect as a result of getting Marketo. The base is much larger right now. And so including that base, what we said is that we expect to drive 25% subscription bookings growth for this much larger book of business, and that's already factored in how we think about the operating expense in terms of what goes for Marketo and actually what goes for the entire DX business. And then what we tried to do is reflect that, while we continue to be excited about the potential of earnings, once you factor in the accounting impact of purchase accounting that's approximately $75 million for Magento and Marketo, primarily in the first half of the year, that's like a 15% -- $0.15 impact in non-GAAP earnings. So that's sort of how we think about it. We're certainly investing for growth. You see that as we talk about a 25% growth in the entire subscription bookings growth, and we try to reflect what the accounting impacts are as well in that business, which should taper off starting the middle of the year and towards Q3 and Q4. So hopefully, that helps set the context of how we move from MAX. And if you think about it from an operational basis, Marketo is actually not dilutive. So what you have to do is factor in what's happening with accounting for deferred revenue. You have to factor in, as you said, the financing and what happens in that particular area as well as you have to think about what's happening with respect to tax rates. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : On Digital Media ARR, you raised the guidance by 3.5% or $50 million going into '19. I guess, can you just outline your confidence to make that big a raise right out of the gate here? Shantanu Narayen : Brent, again, I think it just reflects the momentum that we saw in Q4. I think we outlined a number of different initiatives that we just continue to drive. I mean, we're certainly going to see the benefits of pricing and how we continue to optimize that around the world. It's the new product introductions that are coming and just continued strength in Acrobat in emerging markets. We continue to do a good job combating piracy. We're seeing good strength at what we call named user deployment within the enterprises, I think continued strength in Sign and Stock and what that's doing to the particular business. So just across all of the various priorities that we outlined, we just continue to feel good about the opportunity and we have to continue to execute, Brent. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Kasthuri Rangan : Shantanu, I am curious if -- when you come through your natural intelligence and artificial intelligence from Sensei, what is the current read? Because I think you're one of the very few companies that has reported a Q4 and is giving guidance for Q1. What is your take on the emerging markets, especially in some of the volatilities you have seen? Whereas the U.S. seems to be a pocket of strength. What is your take on these other questionable economies and your prognostication behind how you'd see those markets play out for Adobe next year? Shantanu Narayen : I mean, from our perspective, I think we're no economists. What we see is that both creativity as important initiative for everybody just continues to be really an area of emphasis and digital transformation and the digital tailwinds or headwinds that enterprises are seeing, depending on their perspective. So I think what gives us confidence is that it doesn't matter which country you're in. Digital has become an imperative for enterprises. And for individuals, the importance of creativity and design has never been more important. And so we will just continue to monitor it, we see strength across emerging markets as well. We've talked about that. I think the fact that we have a differential pricing scheme that allows us to target customers in those emerging markets might help. But overall, clearly, the exposure in that area for us is probably lower than some of the other companies that you are covering. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Shantanu, I'd like to follow up on two broad statements Adobe made about its business, one at MAX and one at Summit. At MAX, the company said that Creative Cloud at least is at an inflection point in terms of moving from the desktop largely to more of a multiservice -- surface device TAM. And at Summit, you noted that your objective in Digital Experience is to enable or establish what you call that Experience System of Record. On the former, could you talk about how you're thinking about your correlation of Creative Cloud new business to new hardware business as compared to the old days of packaged software in terms of the correlation to hardware sales. And then for the latter, do you think that you've established now the Experience System of Record, you are de facto, you've done that? Or do you think that's still aspirational? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Jay, first, as it relates to our belief and assertions around multisurface, it stems from a very simple observation that we want to enable our products to be used wherever inspiration strikes. And second, I think to your question, the capabilities of these new devices, whether they be tablets or whether they be mobile devices are infinitely more powerful than the prior generation. And so whenever there's a step function in capability or there's a new modality like voice or touch or other interfaces that emerge, all of them represent opportunities for Adobe. We pioneered our own offering in that particular space with Lightroom, and we are seeing good results with Lightroom, which is clearly a space where people want to be able to manage their pictures on any device that they want. The second category in which we have shown a lot of capability in this particular space is with XD, where, again, the number of people who design products and the number of people -- stakeholders in that entire design workflow is probably significantly larger than those who design. So those were the two first flagship products that showed it. But I think at MAX we clearly announced that not only would we bring -- bringing our flagship products like Photoshop to the iPad, but in addition to that, we would be doing brand-new products that took advantage of this media like Project Gemini, where people would use a stylus and a tablet to draw. So we're well on our way on that journey. We're really excited about what we can do. We also showed, as you know, voice-enabled applications in XD that integrated with Echo. So if you start to think about a world where every single screen, you're going to be able to talk to that screen, we want to enable people to use our apps to create applications for that screen. So that's on the MAX front, excited about it. But we're early in the journey, and we think there's a lot more that we can do that'll enable people to tell their story with ease. On the Digital Experience side with the Experience System of Record, I think the ODI announcement that we made in conjunction with SAP and Microsoft was the next step in that particular journey, where all three companies have talked about the need to have this Unified Customer Profile, where in realtime you can action it and you can integrate that with support systems, supply chain systems, financial systems and certainly the marketing systems, which is what we are pioneering. We made some good progress in that. The interest, honestly, in that is pretty high because every CIO has worried about, \"How do I get this Unified Customer Profile?\" So again, I would say that's a multiyear journey for us to deliver value. Our Experience Platform has already been delivered to customers. They're giving us feedback in realtime. Our applications, much like we did with the Creative Suite of products, will all build on top of the score content and data platform. But that's what we do, Jay. I mean, we are excited about the product journey and building deep technology moats. And so I would say off to a great start but there's so much more that we can do in terms of delivering value to our customers and further strengthening our differentiation against the competition. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : I mean, Shantanu, I had actually two questions. You -- I think just to follow up on one -- something that Kash asked. I was wondering, given digital transformation is a top area of focus for years, I'm trying to get a sense for how resilient do you think the spending could be if the macro environment were to become more challenging. And then I had a follow-up on piracy. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Heather, my belief is that the customers, there's no way that customer expectations are going to change in terms of how they transact businesses with enterprise. And as you know, when -- if economic climate changes, there's even more reason to prioritize on the first few imperatives that are essential. And so if you just look at what's happening with mobile devices as the only form of interaction with enterprises, we just continue to think that digital will be very important and very central to the C-level mandate. So that gives us confidence that we need to continue to drive it. I mean, we will certainly monitor what happens if there is, but you don't want this to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, where everybody says, \"Hey, what do we do if there's a slowdown and then people cut spending?\" We haven't seen that so far. So that's how I would describe this as a priority. And we help with the top line driving revenue for customers. And so I think that's the important part of our mandate and offering. Heather Bellini : Right. So for the CEOs you talk to or the CMOs, it's much more been about the fear of not spending because of their competitors' spend than they're falling further behind. Is that kind of the way to think about it? Shantanu Narayen : That's exactly the way to think about it, and it's also the way they -- every one of them knows that if they are not using digital as an enabler, there's some small company out there that's going to completely disrupt their business using a mobile app and digital technology. So the heightened importance of digital I think is there front and center for every enterprise. Heather Bellini : Great. And then just the last one would just be a follow-up on your comments on piracy and you've mentioned some good success that you're having there. Is there a way to help think about the tailwinds that this could add to your Creative business? Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think we've seen that, Heather, right through our journey. The affordability of Creative Cloud from day one has been one of the drivers of the new growth, our new customer acquisition that we've highlighted every year, including at MAX. And so I think that continues to give us confidence. I think the pricing upfront, which allows more people to enter the platform, I think that's another way in which we are combating piracy. And third is the fact that we don't have boxes. They used to be a real gray market associated with selling our boxes. That's also gone away. That's not to say that people aren't finding ways to somehow get their hands on Creative Cloud. And our brand continues to be strong even in areas where there are malicious users of our product. But we've -- we made significant traction, and we continue to focus on driving value through services. And I would say a step function for us, as all of these assets are in the cloud, then they become DOA unless you're a legitimate user of Adobe products. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Maybe one for John, so he doesn't feel completely left out on this call. If we strip out the acquired assets, Marketo in particular, how are you thinking about sort of operating leverage within sort of the core Adobe businesses into FY '19? Do you think this is another year where you could see the nice expansion that you have been seeing in the underlying operating margins? Or is there like a broader investment, that core going on for -- through FY '19 as well? John Murphy : Thanks very much, Keith. I think when you think about our core business, we have that operating leverage as we've shared throughout FY '18 before the acquisitions. And what we tried to articulate in the prepared remarks was that because the accounting implications coming with the acquisitions for purchase accounting, you have this first -- really the kind of first half to third quarter impact of deferred revenue, for instance, on the operating side. And as that tapers off during the year, we believe the leverage on our model continues to return to growth in terms of operating margins. And so we see that expanding as we exit the year into familiar territory that I think you've seen before. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Can you give us a sense of where you are in the journey of Acrobat's subscription and how to think about the negative impact of the move of perpetual license subscriptions on the Document Cloud revenue growth? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Mark, as you know, we have actually used a different strategy for Acrobat than we used for Creative Cloud because in that particular business, perpetual just continues to be an important area of both new customer acquisition for us as well as I think we've done a good job of bridging. And so you've clearly seen -- now the business continues to do well. We talk about the unit growth that we're seeing in Acrobat. And so we don't particularly see a headwind as it relates to perpetual moving to subscriptions the way we saw in the Creative. We just want to continue to focus on driving more unit growth, and that's really our focus. What is still a big opportunity, however, which may be the other part of your question, is that there's a larger and larger installed base that as we add more value in the services and apply our AI services, that'll continue to be a forward-looking opportunity for us with document. So I think that's all factored and tailored in the targets that we provided for next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : So trade negotiations with China are dominating the headlines. If we actually see an agreement that brings true IP protection and a real open market in China, how big could that market be for Adobe? What could that do to your revenue and revenue growth going forward? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Sterling, one way you can look at it is you can say what this the number of PCs and mobile devices that are used in China and how does that compare to what's being used in the U.S. And if you look at what our revenue is in the U.S., I mean, that would, I think, at the high end show the potential of what that could be because creativity is just as important in China. And you could actually argue, we're one of the few companies, U.S. technology companies, that really doesn't have an alternative in China, so we feel good about it. But even if those trade agreements that you allude to happen, I think it would take a little while for that to completely translate into our business. So having said that, the China business for us has been doing well. As you know, we introduced CC. We focused on the team offering because we thought that would be the right beachhead for us to focus on. And the other area that we focus on is our company is doing business in China. How do we make sure that they have a site license, so to speak, or enterprise license agreement that allows us to do it? So from a purely mathematical and installed base perspective, it's massive how that translates. We have been clearly baked any of that sort of inflection point or dramatic shift into our numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Brent Bracelin : I wanted to follow up on the operating margin question that Keith kind of went down. And taking a little bit of a different tack here, full year operating margins have risen by more than 200 basis points, I think, for five consecutive years. You're now above 40%, phenomenal kind of progress here, highest in over 10 years. My question is going forward. I get the first half accounting impact. But as you think about the opportunity in the $70 billion Experience Cloud, do you plan to invest incremental dollars to accelerate the share in the Experience Cloud? Or do you think you can actually drive margins well above 40% on a blended basis? John Murphy : Great. Thanks very much, Brent. I think when you look at the Digital Experience business, we've always long believed that, that business can actually have margins typical of a SaaS business. We continue to invest in the Digital Experience, of course, obviously recently with the two acquisitions. And so our goal there is to help them integrate to make sure that they can accelerate our growth in that space. That market's huge. So as we continue to invest in that market, certainly we want to see op earnings leverage in it, and it'll be healthy for the business overall. If we look at top line growth and we look at bottom line growth really is what we're trying to drive. And so our long-term model has always been to grow our earnings as fast as our top line or faster. So once we kind of get past this noise of accounting through the year, more so in the first half and then it trails off in the third and fourth quarter, you'll see the operating margin for the total company kind of return to historical levels. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel. Thomas Roderick : So the company took some pricing up here last March in Creative Cloud, I guess just in North America. But would love it if you could provide just a little bit of feedback as to how the price bumps that were put in place have been received by both new and installed customers. And can you add any color there as to whether you've seen any changes to net dollar retention stemming from the price bumps? Just overall some color on how this has gone would be great. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. I think it's gone completely in line with our expectations. I mean, we have just a significant amount of experience with that. As you know, we look at FX in other countries as well to also look at pricing. So it's not the first time that we have made changes to Creative Cloud pricing since the time it was introduced. From our perspective, it was on the heels of MAX, where we introduced 5 new products, which was the sort of most significant innovation after the original introduction. We continue to be focused on a lot more innovation driving value for our customers and I think you'll continue to see it. But North America went very much in line with our expectations. And as we said, our goal is to continue to drive new customers to the platform. That remains front and center but nothing that I would say is to doubt in our experience. And I think that's just because of the diligence that we did, which is we're thoughtful about it. We want to continue to attract customers to the platform with promotional pricing and deliver them the value, which enables us to give more credence to whatever pricing changes we might do. But since the last question, I mean, I'll also start off by wishing everybody on the call happy holidays. Thank you all for joining us. We're certainly thrilled with Q4 and FY '18. I think we had a very, very strong year. And I think it's a clear indication that our strategy of empowering people to create and helping businesses transform is working. We think it represents, as we have said at our MAX financial analyst meeting, a massive addressable market opportunity, and the FY '19 financial targets reflect the momentum that we expect to continue to drive across all offerings and geographies. And we're excited about the product innovation road map that we have for all of our customers. And again, wanted to thank you all for joining us today. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call. Thanks, everyone.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. I would like now to turn the call over to Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Saviage : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe\u2019s President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen and John Murphy, Executive Vice President and CFO. In our call today, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2019 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release, which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago. We\u2019ve also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, and an updated investor datasheet on Adobe.com. If you would like a copy of these documents, you can go to Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations page and find them listed under Quick Links. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue and operating model targets and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, March 14, 2019, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the forward-looking statements disclosure in the earnings press release we issued today, as well as Adobe\u2019s SEC filings. On our Q4 FY18 call in December, we provided targets for fiscal year 2019 and for Q1 FY19 based on revenue accounting standard ASC 605. As required, we have adopted ASC 606 for FY19, and today are reporting our results based on ASC 606. Where applicable, we will call out differences in our results between ASC 605 and ASC 606 for comparison purposes against our prior ASC 605-based targets. On this call we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation between the two is available in our earnings release and on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations Web site. Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live, and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days, and is the property of Adobe. The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Fiscal 2019 is off to a strong start for Adobe as we delivered another record quarter in Q1. We achieved $2.60 billion in revenue, representing 25% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.36 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.71. Adobe empowers people to create and transforms how businesses compete, a highly differentiated strategy that we continued to execute well on in Q1. Across all industries and geographies, we are helping customers large and small transform themselves and their businesses with Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. In our Digital Media business, we achieved strong revenue in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q1. Net new Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR was $357 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q1 grew to $7.07 billion. Q1 Creative revenue was $1.49 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. Adobe Creative Cloud is democratizing creativity by delivering innovative new ways for everyone, from businesses to students, to creative professionals, to hobbyists, to tell their story. Our flagship digital imaging and video solutions, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects, have long been the go-to tools for indie and feature filmmakers and editors. At this year\u2019s Academy Awards, both Adobe Photoshop and After Effects received Scientific and Engineering awards for their contributions to the filmmaking industry. It\u2019s a tremendous honor for Adobe, and we\u2019re very proud of the product and engineering teams who contribute to the development and ongoing innovation in these iconic products. Most recently, Photoshop was used in the making of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which won this year\u2019s Oscar for Best Animated Film. Our photography business including mobile usage continues to show strong momentum. The number of Lightroom CC mobile subscribers has increased by more than 400% over the past year. Beyond film and photography, Adobe is pushing the boundaries of creativity onto new canvases and broadening the appeal of Creative Cloud to entirely new segments of users. New media types, including 3D, video and augmented reality continue to emerge, which will enable more immersive and engaging digital experiences. In January, we acquired Allegorithmic, the industry standard in tools for 3D material and texture creation for gaming and entertainment. The addition of Allegorithmic further expands Creative Cloud into interactive content design and allows us to better equip video game creators, Visual FX artists working in film and television, designers and marketers, to deliver the next generation of immersive experiences. Premiere Rush CC, our popular video editing app for social media creators, is expanding its footprint to Android, and was recently showcased at Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 event. We continue to innovate with Adobe XD, our solution for designing and prototyping Web sites and apps, adding expanded collaboration, prototyping and voice capabilities, all supported by a growing ecosystem of plug-ins and integrations with companies like Microsoft, Slack and Atlassian. We feel passionately that creative skills are a critical component for success across K-12 and higher education classrooms. We recently announced a partnership with the Royal Shakespeare Company in England. Together, we\u2019ll make new creative teaching resources and tools, including Creative Cloud and Adobe Spark, available to teachers, and to millions of students learning the works of Shakespeare in schools throughout the UK. This quarter we partnered with the California State University System to give students and staff at 21 campuses access to our full suite of Creative Cloud tools. Since Adobe launched Spark for Education in April 2018, over 7 million licenses have been provided to students and teachers worldwide. With Adobe Document Cloud, we\u2019re reinventing how people create, scan, edit, collaborate, sign and share documents, and leading the paper-to-digital revolution. Document Cloud revenue in Q1 was a record $282 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $856 million. Overall momentum for Acrobat is fueled by strong demand for Adobe PDF among individuals and businesses worldwide. Our mobile footprint continues to grow. Adobe Reader and Adobe Scan downloads have now surpassed 600 million, and our partnership with Samsung contributed significantly to downloads of Adobe Scan in Q1. In addition, Adobe Reader is now available in the \u201cMade for Samsung\u201d section of the Galaxy App Store, increasing our potential reach to millions of Samsung smartphone users. We recently launched the \u201cPDF Like a Boss\u201d global advertising campaign to drive further awareness for new Document Cloud, Acrobat and Adobe PDF capabilities. Last month, we announced a partnership with the PGA TOUR, which will feature our new campaign in TV coverage for 10 tournaments this year. Adobe Sign has strong momentum and has become the e-signature solution of choice for organizations across all industries. We continue to enable resellers such as Nintex to sell Adobe Sign to thousands of partners, public, private and government organizations on their platforms. In our Digital Experience business, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $743 million for the quarter, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. The success of our Digital Experience business is bolstered by several industry tailwinds : the mandate for enterprises and organizations to digitally transform their businesses, and the need to deliver the world-class end-to-end customer experiences consumers have come to expect. More and more businesses are choosing Adobe Experience Cloud, the industry\u2019s only end-to-end solution for marketing, advertising, analytics and commerce, serving both B2C and B2B customers. Key Experience Cloud customer wins in the quarter include HSBC, NBC Universal, Bass Pro Shops and WebMD. Delivering exceptional experiences requires a lot more than tapping into a customer database to deliver a personalized email. Businesses need a full range of capabilities from creation through commerce and acquisition through renewal. For today\u2019s digital businesses, it\u2019s not enough to have data, you need the right data, behavioral, transactional and operational, to understand your customer and the intelligence to act on it in context. With our Adobe Experience Platform and breadth of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, Adobe is enabling enterprises to achieve a unified, real-time view of their customers, and harness these insights to deliver engaging digital experiences. Last year, we made several significant investments to further expand the range of capabilities we offer to Experience Cloud customers with the acquisitions of Magento, with its best-in-class ecommerce capabilities and Marketo, the leader in B2B marketing engagement. We\u2019re off to a strong start with both Magento and Marketo, and we\u2019re successfully integrating them into Adobe Experience Cloud. This is creating an unmatched value proposition for customers, and growing Adobe\u2019s addressable opportunity in the Customer Experience Management category. We are focused on product integration while driving acceleration of the Magento and Marketo businesses, leveraging Adobe\u2019s brand, enterprise sales and go-to-market organization, while maintaining a strong global footprint in the mid-market. With Magento, we are driving momentum by cross-selling our commerce offering to existing Adobe Experience Manager customers. With Marketo, we delivered our first integrated deployment of Adobe Experience Platform Launch, our tag management system. We are seeing strong interest from strategic Adobe accounts, many of which are B2C, who have significant B2B operations as part of a broader digital transformation strategy. Industry analysts continue to recognize Adobe Experience Cloud as the market leader. This quarter, Adobe Experience Cloud was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms and once again achieved the strongest position in the quadrant out of 17 vendors for \u201cCompleteness of Vision\u201d. Our upcoming Summit in Las Vegas will be our largest to-date, and we will welcome the Marketo Marketing Nation community to the event. We are excited to share our Customer Experience Management vision, strategy and technology roadmap with our customers and partners. At Adobe, our employees are our greatest asset and we are proud to have a brand that continues to be recognized for its innovation, progressive workplace practices and commitment to the communities in which we do business. For the third consecutive year, we were named one of Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies. Forbes recently recognized Adobe as one of its Best Employers for Diversity. And Fortune included Adobe on its annual Most Admired Companies in Software list again this year. Adobe is the clear leader in empowering people to create, and helping businesses transform to deliver the customer experiences needed to compete and win in today\u2019s competitive climate. These two tremendous market opportunities are fueling our business. With the world\u2019s best employees, customers and partners, we are well positioned for further growth and continued success in 2019. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. Our strong results in Q1 reflect a solid start to fiscal year 2019. As we discussed on our Q4 FY18 call in December, we provided targets for Q1 FY19 based on ASC 605. We are reporting results today based on our adoption of ASC 606 as required. Where applicable, we will call out differences in our results between 605 and 606 for comparison purposes against our prior 605-based targets. In Q1 FY19, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.6 billion under 606, which represents 25% year-over-year growth when compared to $2.08 billion reported in Q1 FY18 under 605. Q1 FY19 revenue would have been $2.58 billion under 605, which represents 24% growth. Based on 606, GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.36 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.71. Based on 605, GAAP diluted EPS in Q1 would have been $1.31 and non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.65. This compares to our EPS targets based on 605 of $1.14 on a GAAP-basis and $1.60 on a non-GAAP basis. Business and financial highlights in Q1 included : Digital Media revenue of $1.78 billion, including Creative revenue of $1.49 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $282 million; net new Digital Media ARR of $357 million; Digital Experience revenue of $743 million; exiting the quarter with deferred revenue of $3.22 billion; cash flow from operations of $1.01 billion; repurchasing 2.1 million shares of our stock through stock buyback; and approximately 91% of our revenue in Q1 was from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 22% year-over-year under both ASC 606 and ASC 605. The addition of $357 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $7.07 billion. Exiting Q1 ARR included an approximately $20 million cumulative adjustment from adoption of ASC 606. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 22% year-over-year in Q1 and we increased Creative ARR by $292 million. Notable growth drivers in Q1 included : new customer acquisition across all offerings and geographies; subscription momentum and strength with Creative Cloud enterprise deployments; continued growth in emerging markets; ARPU increases, particularly in markets where price optimizations were introduced last year; and services adoption including continued momentum with Adobe Stock, which again achieved greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth. We achieved record Document Cloud revenue of $282 million in Q1, which represents 22% year-over-year growth, and we added $65 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. In addition to delivering another strong quarter with Acrobat and Document Cloud, some of the revenue strength in Q1 is attributed to a benefit from the move to ASC 606 revenue recognition. Notable drivers of Document Cloud growth include continued strength with Acrobat subscription adoption, helped by a steady on-ramp and conversion of free mobile app usage to paid subscriptions, strength with enterprise adoption of Acrobat and Document Cloud services, and strong performance with Adobe Sign. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record quarterly Experience Cloud revenue of $743 million, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. There were minor benefits from adoption of ASC 606, and year-over-year growth would have been 32% under ASC 605. Experience Cloud subscription revenue was a record $612 million. In addition to new revenue from our recent Magento and Marketo acquisitions, Experience Cloud performance in Q1 was driven by success across many offerings, with strength in Adobe Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager. Cross-sell of Magento within existing Experience Cloud accounts was notable, and Marketo delivered solid results in their first full quarter as part of Adobe. Our Publishing segment, which includes OEM contracts, saw a sizable benefit from the move to ASC 606, and benefited from a large renewal deal in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $6.6 million. We had $8.5 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY19, versus $30.5 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY18. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $28.6 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.7 million. The $8.5 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY19 versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY18 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $7.2 million. In Q1, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 4% on a GAAP-basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 47 days in the year-ago quarter and 49 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $3.22 billion, up 25% year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligations, RPO, a financial measure required with reporting under ASC 606, was approximately $8.13 billion exiting Q1. RPO includes approximately $600 million of non-cancelable and non-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements. These funds do provide our customers options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses, or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $3.23 billion, and cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion in the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares at a cost of $491 million. We currently have $7.35 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018, which goes through 2021. Now, I will discuss our financial targets. We are providing ASC 606-based annual fiscal 2019 targets that reflect our Q1 results. In FY19 : we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $11,150 million dollars; Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.5 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 34%; Digital Experience subscription bookings growth of approximately 25%; a GAAP tax rate of approximately 10% and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 11%; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $5.59; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $7.80. We anticipate Q3 and Q4 year-over-year revenue growth rates to be similar to the growth rate implied in our Q2 revenue target. As in prior years, we expect summer seasonality which can lead to sequentially lower net new Digital Media ARR in Q3, followed by normal year-end strength in Q4. As the impact of lost deferred revenue due to purchase accounting from our acquisitions of Magento and Marketo tapers off during FY19 and as we grow our business, we expect quarterly operating margins to increase in the second half of the year. In Q2, we are targeting : Q2 revenue of approximately $2,700 million dollars; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $370 million; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 32%; other Expense of approximately $36 million; tax rate of approximately 12% on a GAAP basis, and 11% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 495 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.20; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.77. As a reminder, Q2 continues to be impacted by lost deferred revenue and acquisition-related costs. In summary, Q1 was a great start to what we expect will be another record year for Adobe. We look forward to seeing many of you at Summit. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Saviage : Thanks, John. Adobe Summit is just around the corner.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Brad Zelnick : Thanks so much, and congrats on a good start to the year. If I'm limited to one question, my question is for John. John, how should we think about the impact of 606 on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year? Will it be a tailwind to both revenue and margins for each quarter relative to 605? Thanks. John Murphy : Sure. No, I think as we have talked about at Analyst Day and further in December at our Earnings Call. Overall, 606 does not have a material impact to our results. What we're seeing in Q1 is the pull forward of revenue by recognizing some OEM contracts upfront that otherwise would have been recognized throughout the year. But otherwise we don\u2019t expect a material impact for the year. Brad Zelnick : And if I could slip in a quick follow up. The $20 million ARR benefit from ASC-606. How does that split between Document Cloud versus Creative in the quarter? Thanks again. John Murphy : So that was a cumulative catch-up adjustment against the $7 billion base of ARR. So really quite immaterial and the split that's really more in the Creative versus Document. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Shantanu, there were some questions about some of the promotional activity towards the end of the quarter. And I think then you noted that Creative Cloud ARR was more in line and historically you've been beating that number. So can you just talk to the promotional activity and what happened, was that just a coincidence at the end of the quarter, or is this just ongoing promotional activity you've seen historically that we shouldn\u2019t read too deeply into? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : The short answer, Brent, is you shouldn\u2019t read too deeply into it. The slightly longer answer is when I think about the business and the momentum that we saw across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud, it's clear we're off to a strong start. With respect to the Creative and Document businesses, specifically, we talked to you about the state of the art DDOM model that we have, the Data Driven Operating Model. And the fundamental strategy continues to be to acquire new customers. We're very aware of what is the activity that enables us to attract them, how we can make it a compelling event. But if you look at our success that we've had associated with attracting new customers to the platform, up-selling them, and if you look, Brent, also at the Q2 targets that we are providing, as well as the raise in ARR for the year, I think that should reflect the continued confidence and momentum that we have against the overall addressable market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Ross MacMillan : Just along the same lines I guess. Just if I pool $20 million of that cumulative benefit, I think your net new ARR would have been a little bit better than your initial guide. But then I look at your Q2 net new ARR guide, and it's certainly a lot better than I would have thought given that adjustment off of Q1. And I wondered if you could just maybe talk about why that second quarter guide is where it is and relative to Q1 and is there certain things you'd highlight? So for example, the price changes on international and Doc cloud, I think go into a full effect for the current quarter. But I was just curious as to that transition adjusting out the $20 million cumulative adjustments from Q1 to Q2. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Ross, I think when we look at the business from a seasonal perspective, we do see traditional change between Q2 and Q1 that's been something that you can go back and look at fiscal '18 as well and you see the same trends. Remember in fiscal '18, there was that catch up as it related to the systems. So you see a nice growth in Q1 '19 over Q1 '18 and you see the same sequential change then if you look at it, whether it was in '18 or it was in '19. And I think where we continue to see momentum in the business, John, certainly alluded to some of those in his prepared remarks. Enterprise continues to do well. Mobile and the adoption of mobile continues to do well. Acrobat, we're seeing tremendous trend in the Acrobat business. If you look at the 22% revenue growth that we talk about, both in the Creative part of the business, as well as in the document part of the business, we're continuing to see that. And remember, in addition to new customer acquisition, there's a very significant installed base that exists with the perpetual version of Acrobat as we move them to the subscription offering. That's part of the reason why we're spending money in advertising and awareness of the new document cloud features. And this is the traditional, December slowing a little bit as it relates to the Creative, you start to see the momentum in the business. So, nothing different from what we've seen in past years. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is now open. Saket Kalia : Shantanu, just to maybe switch gears off of Digital Media towards Digital Experience. Given the change in management there with Brad Rencher moving on can you just talk a little bit about the search for his replacement and perhaps just as importantly how that organization can change structurally now with a bigger slate of things to sell and a bigger team? Shantanu Narayen : Yes first, Saket, let me talk a little bit about the momentum that we're seeing in the business. I was actually with customers the last two weeks on the road in both U.S. and Europe. And all the meetings that you have, whether it's with CEOs, CMOs and CIOs, they're absolutely reflecting the urgency of digital engagement and an appetite really to work with Adobe, because we are viewed not just as a leader in the technology strategy part of it, but a company that can share results, lessons as a result of our own transition. So very pleased with the success that we saw in that business in Q1. I think it was 34% growth under the 606, 32% under the 605, so really strong part of that. And I think we highlighted as well the success that we're seeing with both Magento and Marketo; and so Magento, the integration with AEM and the success that we're seeing there; Marketo, which is the leader in B2B. So, fundamental market dynamics continue to be very favorable. My immediate and direct involvement and frankly, the alignment of the entire DX organization that was previously matrixed at Adobe, the whole goal was intended to accelerate the momentum in what is very clearly a large and growing opportunity for Abode. And so, Saket, what we've done is we're actually integrating the two recent acquisitions quicker where appropriate, Magento and Marketo, to enable the synergies between the businesses. I touched on what was happening there. Operationally, Matt's been running the combined go-to-market. Abhay, has been running and helping us with the product roadmap. And so, I think the scale and the momentum of that business, that's now north of on a $3 billion run-rate, allows us the luxury of attracting world-class executives and growing internal talent. But net-net I would say the direct involvement that I have and the alignment of the entire organization is frankly allowing us to operate at a faster pace. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin : I want to ask about the partnership with Microsoft and maybe just if you could give us an update on the impact that had on the digital experience business, and then maybe how you're thinking about that partnership given the Marketo and Magento integration as well? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I mean, big picture, it's clearly one of the most successful partnerships we've had. I'll make a little bit of a plug for Adobe Summit for those of you are there, Satya, will be joining us on day two, and so on Wednesday. So I think you'll hear from him as well, his perspective on not just the current partnership and what we've been able to do, but some of the new opportunities that are emerging ahead of us whether it's ODI where we're continuing to make progress. And I think speaking for Adobe, we're certainly excited about the ability to have Magento and Marketo as well work on their cloud platforms. The current success is all based on what we've done with AEM, Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Campaign. But the go-to-market alignment, I mean again, when I was on the road in Europe as I was mentioning as well as in America. Executives all around, the fact that they are all moving to a cloud-based environment for native applications and they see not just rhetoric but actual evidence of how Adobe and Microsoft have partnered to make our technology work together and for us to connect the desperate SaaS based systems. It's working. It's actually exceeded our targets. As I think we mentioned for '18, we expect the same success in '19. Operator : Next question comes from the Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is now open. Jennifer Lowe : So as we look at through the incremental investments into the business in terms of sales and marketing and R&D at this point. How much of that is going towards the traditional Creative business, the Document Cloud business versus the Marketing Cloud? And has that shifted at all, particularly in creative as you start to go on for a broader set of users or continue to expand? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Jennifer. And as you look at the OpEx and if you look at the margins, I mean just recall again the impact of Marketo and Magento. But big picture unless you're trying to get me in trouble with my product organization, I would say we see so much opportunity across each of the three businesses. And I think we're investing in all three. On the creative side certainly, we've touched on the new applications that are coming out on iPads. We've talked about the innovation in the fundamental desktop applications. We've alluded to with the acquisition of Algorithmic, our excitement around what we can do with immersive media. On XD, what we've done with respect to fundamentally changing the nature of collaboration and allowing people to collaborate in a meaningful way. We talked about some good partnerships there with Slack and Atlassian, in addition to Microsoft, the new voice enabled application. So on Creative, there's absolutely significant amount of product innovation that's underway that\u2019ll be delivered to customers, Acrobat, what we are doing the strategy around delivering more functionality with verbs around documents, things that we've done with scan and create and sign. Document Cloud had a really successful business. And clearly with Experience Cloud, the delivery of the platform, I hope you're going to be at summit where we\u2019ll share more and show more. And I think underlying all of this, the investments that we're making in the core cloud infrastructure for us, to not only deliver value but over time reduce the COGs, because we're going to get more efficient there, as well as on AI and ML, so really comprehensive roadmap that exists against all of those, Jennifer. And given the opportunity, when you have a $100 billion addressable market, I think we've done a good job of balancing the long-term while continuing to deliver great value for shareholders. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks very much and congrats on a nice start to the year. Shantanu, you mentioned that that\u2019s running the combined go-to-market efforts for the Experience Cloud. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned some good initial cross-sell of Magento. Can you just maybe remind us about how the go-to-markets is working right now? Are Adobe sales reps able to sell Magento and Marketo? Are you leaving those somewhat apart for now? Can you just remind me of how that playing out in the early stages and where you maybe have to have that size the end of the fiscal year? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : I mean, I think when we first acquired both Magento and Marketo, we had the field organizations a little distinct. They were part of the business unit as part of the -- as opposed to part of the field organization. What we've done is we've got a complete aligned pipeline generation right now for the entire Experience Cloud. And so the marketing initiatives, the partner initiatives and the organic sales initiatives, are aligned around getting a very healthy pipeline. And what we are doing is really now then with the enterprise sales force focused on delivering the entire value to the customers. I mean, so many of these customers are already customers of other Adobe solutions and so the ability to plug-in commerce and to plug-in B2B marketing directly into that pipeline. We had a really strong quarter with Magento in the enterprise segment. And while we're doing that, we want to make sure that the mid-market motion that exists globally is not impacted. And so I think having this really unified single message, single sales kickoff, I think is showing success. And Steve, who is CEO of Marketo and Mark Lavelle, they are helping us make sure that we understand the nuances of how to best market Magento and Marketo, but to leverage again, as I said, the Adobe brand. And so, having that one unified running the business is definitely accelerating the integration and presenting a very unified view to the customer. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Maybe the one other thing I would mention there is the number of partners actually having a single unified view is enabling us to get all of our existing partners in addition to I think as we said the hundreds of thousands of people on the Open Source community, having that all aligned enables us to paint a much bigger picture as well very quickly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Shantanu, I would like to ask you to comment on three internal programmatic initiatives that Adobe clearly seems to be investing in or ramping up, those being; first, retention, which you described at the MAX meeting as both the new growth; number two, monetization; and then thirdly, self-service, particularly EC. And if you could just comment on how you are looking at those generally and how any or all of those might be informing your guidance for this year and beyond? Shantanu Narayen : Can you maybe just, before I answer, Jay, talk a little bit about the middle one? What did you mean by monetization? We are trying to monetize everything, so I just want to make sure I\u2026 Jay Vleeschhouwer : Yes. Well, what I'm looking at, for example, you're looking to bring people on that are specifically focused in the monetization area. I realized it's an ongoing thing. But it looks like something that you are incrementally focusing on, particularly in Creative Cloud and new services and Experience Cloud. I'm going off of some of the internal investments you seem to be making. Shantanu Narayen : No, those are good questions. I mean, first on the retention. While retention is the -- and I still continue to believe that retention is the new growth. The focus there really has been a lot on engagement and understanding how people can get the value out of our products. I think you know we use our own campaign products to communicate with people. I think what Scott Brezski has done with what he described at MAX at the first mile initiative, which is when people first come on board how they can get advantage of our products. I think the integration with Adobe stock and enabling them to participate and not have the fear of a blank slate. And I would say the community and the hands and the success that we are seeing for people to get benefit of participating in the larger community, all of that is helping with the retention and that just continue to be ongoing focus for us. Because the more you retain, not only do you get the benefit of those customers they also serve as evangelists. Spark -- the monetization side, I think the more we can get people at the early part of the funnel, whether it's coming in through mobile, whether it's coming with the reader and Acrobat and then converting them that just continues to be a way for us to get our brand out there, and certainly serving as a good funnel. The other area where we're seeing success there, Jay, is the fact the system approach that we are taking products like Light Room where you can use Light Room exactly the same on mobile or on a tablet or on a PC, the retention rates for products like that are certainly higher, because people are seeing more value associated with that. And the self-service, again, all about top of the funnel and making sure that we can get people to experience Adobe products that\u2019s certainly been part, I think the last number we probably shared was a 100 million IDs that we've been able to create. And going back to I think a question that may be Brent asked earlier. Certainly, we provide promotions to some of those people who otherwise may not have even made the lead from a fee product to a paid product. So I think the DDOM is where we continue to emphasize our internal effort to make sure that we are optimizing and delivering value at the same time. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard : Question for John on the Experience side. I guess, a little challenge to try to understand maybe as we move pass all of the moving parts on deferred revenue write downs and acquired revenue and so forth. Could you help us understand what the business is growing either, if we were to look at all-in with everything part of the past year and the current year or if we were to maybe strip out some of the things we've acquired. It feels like we're working with numbers maybe in the mid-teens and the reported numbers are in the mid-30s, and there is a lot of room between I think for people to interpret how fast you maybe growing on the Experience side? John Murphy : I think when you look at the Digital Experience business, it's a portfolio of solutions and services and products. And certainly, Magento and Marketo been the new additions to that provide an accelerated growth for the total Digital Experience business. So our target that we're really comfortable with -- in the combined because we're selling everything right now, so it's 34% for the year. We don't necessarily parse out what Magento is doing and what Marketo is doing, which gives us integrated sales approach at this point now. So for us, we're looking at the larger opportunity in the Digital Experience space as we talked about at the Analyst Day. And these new assets help us accelerate that opportunity. And then subscription bookings growth has been very strong and really pretty pleased with the performance this quarter and with the momentum that we have through the rest of the year. Walter Pritchard : So, John on that, I mean, it doesn't feel like though we get pass the end of the year there we're going to be growing at 34%. That seems I guess I feel like people are going to mis-calibrate the model as they look forward at the growth rate. Any help as we look at it that way, I think that's the real confusion I think we get as we get the guidance and even the 606 impact? Shantanu Narayen : I think, Walter, if you look at it taking a step back and you think about the book of business, I think the most app comparison is we take Magento, we take Marketo we bring it into the beginning of business. And when we say we're growing that book of business by 25% that's shows the growth of what is the core part of the business, mainly software as a service and licensing when you take the fact that consulting as a result of the partner ecosystem that exists is less of a focus for us. Hopefully, that gives you a sense of the underlying dynamics in that business and our excitement, because at the scale at which we are to continue to grow subscription bookings at that rate and to continue to expand, I think reflects the momentum we have. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. Your line is now open. Richard Davis : On the broad product line, so I realized that's hard to answer. But is there a way to think about the customer wins that you're getting and that are rip and replace versus new budget dollars, because I think you're getting both, right? I mean, there is more budget dollars going to marketing, tech and customer stuff but there is also rip replace. Is there a mix and how does that deal? Shantanu Narayen : I would say when we look at 2018, we were doing a lot more of the existing customers. And we put a pretty good emphasis on new logos as well, that is really helping bring a lot more people. I think the whole B2B space that we had talked about now with the combination of Magento, and Marketo that's been good. But to your point, there's a fair amount of expansion within existing customers. And the expansion is coming from two different sources. The first is the expansion is coming from the cross sell of new products that we're acquiring into existing customers as people see the benefits of the integration. The upsell is also coming from more usage of the current products as they're seeing more efficiency gains and/or additional benefits associated with it. So, we're pretty focused on all three of those. I mean you want to keep growing new logos and going after greenfield territory, I think we're getting more international expansion that continues to be new logos. But within accounts, we\u2019re very focused and in most of the accounts, we're very diligent about making sure as we look at a particular account, that we're not just measuring renewals but we are measuring growth in those particular accounts. And so hopefully that gives you some color of what it is. You're right. We don't break that out. I wouldn\u2019t know how to break that out frankly for a business this size. But internally, we're absolutely inspecting all three of those. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss : I think a question for John, just to get into the ASC 606 impacts. I just want to make sure I understand how it's impacted the guide. So if we look at Q1, you beat the original guide on Q1 by $0.11. It looks like about $0.05 of that came from the underlying fundamental on a like for like basis and $0.06 from ASC 606 impact, but the full year guide only moves by $0.05. So am I reading correctly that $0.06 benefit that you saw in Q1 on ASC 606, you see actually a headwind of you have a lower earnings, or is it negative impact throughout the year? And then related to that on the last quarter in Q4, you guys mentioned that you did expect to see sales and marketing benefits, and it wouldn't be much of the change to revenues at ARR, but you did expect to see sales and marketing benefits from different commissions. Does that still apply is there still that benefit that's coming through? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I think maybe, Keith, I'll just start and then I'll certainly have John add more color to it. I mean, first big picture when we look at the momentum in the business, it just continues the way we had imagined. The way you have to think about it is you're right. I mean if you look at the 60 million above the guide that we had done, you also have to factor in that there was actually foreign exchange, there was probably a little bit more of a headwind. So we actually had a very strong quarter. What happens in some of the accounts as you're recognizing the revenue upfront rather than recognizing them rapidly and so that's part of the reason for how you should think about what might that also play out in Q2 for the same reason, namely deferred revenue. But in terms of how we looked at the targets for 606 for fiscal '19, we wanted to give you an update. It's early in the year. The business is doing well. On the ARR front, which has nothing to do with 606 or 605, moving forward, we were very clear about the success that we're continuing to have. And so that's part of the way we are doing it but we're excited about the business. John Murphy : So I guess just to add on to that in relation to the sales and marketing benefit that we\u2019ve talked about last quarter, it's really because of the Marketo acquisitions so it\u2019s a slight benefit that we are seeing from the capitalized commissions related to the Marketo business. So you can see a little bit of that benefit here in Q1 and you look at OpEx under 605 and 606, and you will see that through the year. But certainly as Shantanu said, I think it's just being a little cautious in terms of how the rollout of the different contracts are in terms of upfront revenue versus recognizing the rest of the year. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking the question. This is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have a question on XD and then just a question on how we think about the total TAM opportunity for that business. It seems like when you talk to partners and customers who use it, is this not UX designers, UI designers using it, but there are more developers also on the platform. And when you think about the total opportunity, both in terms of units and dollar, how do you think about it? And does XD provide you an opportunity to drive more enterprise wide adoption of your creative cloud? Shantanu Narayen : When we think about XD, in particular, I mean I think the biggest picture message that I would send is we look at it and say everything is going to have a screen. And if everything is going to have a screen then it's going have digital content delivered to it, whether you are on your automotive, whether you are in a retail store, whether you are having a watch. We think XD is a perfect application to design, prototype and deliver content for all of those different devices. So it's not just UX designers it's certainly developers as developer breaking that designer, developer bridge that exist today to deliver great applications that's another use case. I think your question around enterprise is actually spot on. We are seeing a fair amount of success and adoption in the enterprise, because enterprises are standardizing on the collaboration between the marketing organization, the product organization and the engineering organization. We are seeing some good traction there. New apps like voice, that\u2019s certainly area where XD I think continues to shine. And so we are just excited. I mean every time you see one of these new applications, you see both new app adoption among new customers. The monthly average usage of XD is growing very nicely and you certainly see that as an additional benefit to the full value Creative Cloud. And that\u2019s also true. I know you didn\u2019t ask the question, but when you think about algorithmic as well, it's the same thing. We start to attract a whole new set of customers with algorithmic. It gives us the opportunity to have a higher priced all apps bundle for people who are doing even more high-end work. And so both from a top of funnel acquisition as well as from optimization, that's how we think about each one of these different categories. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick from Stifel. Your line is now open. Tom Roderick : So maybe just building on Keith's question that he just asked a little bit earlier regarding 606 and the impact to EPS, so just thinking about the second quarter, in particular. If I look at the full year, great guidance above where we all were for the second quarter, I think our models were a little bit heavy maybe by somewhere in the magnitude of around $0.10 $0.11. Can you just talk to some of the seasonal investments that might be taking place in addition to some of the 606 impacts that might have pulled some of that profitability forward just so get a sense of what's impacting that Q2 EPS guidance? Thank you guys. Shantanu Narayen : I think part of it where you also have to factor in was the Q1 over-performance and the operating margin that we showed in Q1. So I wouldn't be surprised if some of you had modeled it where I think as I've looked at the models Q2 and Q3 where you were probably a little ahead of where the numbers were not fully understanding the Magento and Marketo, both impact of deferred revenue and the purchase accounting impact. And you were probably a little light on Q4 as it related to how we thought the year would play out. So I look at it and say, there is a little overachievement in Q1. We've guided to a good operating margins in Q2 based on the revenue that we have. And we've I think guided that Q3 and Q4, once the impacts of Marketo and Magento deferred revenue and purchasing accounting taper off then you're back to where you may have modeled it. But John, anything to add? John Murphy : Yes, I think that's exactly right. We had said that the first half of FY19 was going to be more greatly impacted by the deferred revenue haircuts. And I think you're probably modeled a little more linearly in terms of returning it to the operating margin, and it really does actually accelerate towards the backend of the year. So we exit FY19 at rates that you typically see them our performance in the past. Tom Roderick : And then as we get into FY20, just more standard seasonality not this upfront haircut that we got this year\u2026 John Murphy : That's correct. Shantanu Narayen : That's absolutely correct. Tom Roderick : Thank you and I appreciate it. Mike Saviage : We're coming up in an hour here. We'll take two more questions, operator. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi thanks for taking the question. This is Tim for Mark. I wanted to talk a little bit more about ODI, and specifically if you could talk about where you guys are in the roadmap and maybe feedback that you've gotten from customers? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : I think the core strategy of ODI and three large companies getting together to say we're going to agreeing on the taxonomy, we're going to agreeing on an API and we're going to ensure interoperability between the data that exists today and silos. There hasn't been a customer that isn't excited about the fact that we're all stepping up to do that and allow enterprises to get value out of all of the data that they have in different silos. So I would say big picture first, there is a lot of excitement. It clearly builds on the progress that Adobe and Microsoft have made over the past few years as we've integrated PowerBI and campaign, or the work that we've done with AEM. I think you'll see at Summit having more people on the ingestion or ETL side also signup and say, they're going to enable all of this data that exists in silos to get normalized. I mean, the holy grail of what we are trying to do with ODI with a whole bunch of partners is to bring all of the data that exists into this real time stitched platform there is a common taxonomy. People don't care about where this data is stored, people care about can I action it in real time. And that is really the goal of ODI. We're making good progress. We'll share more at Summit. But the core value proposition really resonates with customers. Operator : Last question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty : Earlier in the call, Shantanu, you mentioned the importance of adding customers into growth algorithm. So within Creative Cloud, I'm curious what is the biggest target of new users that you're still tapping into? And what ARPU or pricing are you getting on those customers versus what you've seen traditionally? Shantanu Narayen : Sterling, there's so many different opportunities there. If I had to pick one, I would still say mobile, imaging and imaging is the area where there's the most. But what we've done with Premiere Rush, we talked about that. Spark having 7 million people and that being a real seeding ground for what we can do in education, I think that's very significant. The aura that comes from us doing high end work with AR and what we are doing with algorithmic. While the numbers may not be small, don't underestimate the importance of how that attracts the whole new generation of creators to our platform. But I would say imaging and PDF still continue to be the two largest areas of acquisition for new customers in the Creative Cloud. And I would highlight Spark as well only because Spark is this incredibly easy product that everybody from K-12 to teachers are starting to use and the more we get that standardized in school districts and frankly, in some cases entire countries as the platform of choice for education, I think that will continue to be a way in which we expose young creative talent to the joys of using Adobe products. But sterling since you had the last question, let me just summarize by saying, I think when we think about the Q1 financial results. I think it's again, a clear reflection of the core strategy on the enterprise side, helping businesses transform on the content side, empowering people to create. That strategy resonates and our execution against that strategy continues to be strong. We think design and creativity have never been as important as they are today. And whether you call it digital transformation like you call it in the U.S. or digitization as it's called in Europe, it just represents an incredible opportunity for us to continue to grow and deliver value to our customers. We're excited about summit we hope we'll see a bunch of you there. One thing I'll also mention is that it actually integrates Marketo's Marketing Nation, so we're welcoming that community as well to Summit in a few weeks. And the targets that we provided I think reflect the momentum we continue to drive across all geographies. So Q1 was off to a great start. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : And this concludes our call. Thanks everyone for joining.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Q2 was another strong quarter for Adobe, with record revenue and continued growth across Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud, and Adobe Experience Cloud. We delivered $2.74 billion in revenue in Q2, representing 25% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.29, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.83. Adobe\u2019s solutions have become the standard for creating and managing the world\u2019s digital experiences. Millions of consumers depend on brands like Photoshop and PDF for their personal and professional pursuits. Thousands of enterprises the world over are turning to Adobe every day to help them transform their businesses. The power of our brand, the continuous innovation in our products and services, the deep investment we are making in our technology platforms, and a robust ecosystem of partners are enabling us to serve millions of customers around the globe. We are creating large, addressable markets in the creativity, document, and customer experience management categories. Our opportunity has never been greater. In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q2. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $406 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q2 grew to $7.47 billion. Q2 Creative revenue was $1.59 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. Mobile is a tailwind in our Digital Media business and we are driving significant increases in mobile traffic and member sign-ups for our offerings. This is the golden age of creativity, and our vision for Creative Cloud is to be the creativity platform for all. Whether you are a student, an experience designer, a YouTuber, or a marketer, storytelling is central to the way you communicate and connect. The key part of our Creative Cloud growth strategy is appealing to new segments of users. Adobe Spark, our offering for easily turning ideas into compelling stories, graphics, and webpages, is rapidly gaining popularity among creators from the classroom to the boardroom. Spark traffic on web and mobile has more than doubled year-over-year. In Q2 we expanded Spark\u2019s global footprint with support for five new languages : Brazilian-Portuguese, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. We\u2019ve expanded our vision of platforms to include social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Premiere Rush is rapidly becoming the solution of choice for YouTubers and social video creators. Premiere Rush is now available on Android in addition to iOS, Mac, and Windows. Experience design is one of the most explosive creative categories and we continue to innovate in this space with Adobe XD, our design system for UX and UI. We released a major update to Adobe XD in May enabling teams to create and share designs to enhance both productivity and collaboration. In Q2, we drove strong subscription growth across our flagship photography and digital video offerings. At NAB in Las Vegas, we unveiled new innovations across Premiere Pro, Audition, Character Animator, and After Effects. One exciting announcement was the availability of the Content-Aware Fill feature in After Effects, powered by Adobe Sensei, which magically enables editors to seamlessly remove unwanted objects from video, saving hours of tedious manual work. It won five awards at the show, including the NAB Show Product of the Year Award. We continue to expand Creative Cloud with value-added services. Adobe Stock, our fast-growing service for stock images, videos, and millions of additional creative assets grew greater than 25% year-over-year. We are proud of the role our solutions play in inspiring the global creative community and shaping popular culture. This quarter, we launched a creative campaign with 17-year-old music sensation Billie Eilish, which inspired significant participation among our important Student segment. With Adobe Document Cloud, we are reinventing how people scan, edit, collaborate, sign, and share documents in the cloud and mobile era. Document Cloud revenue in Q2 was a record $296 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $921 million driven by continued strength in Acrobat subscription adoption. Mobile is the next frontier for digital documents and our flagship apps. Adobe Reader for mobile and Adobe Scan, continue to gain traction. Adobe Scan, which allows you to capture everything from documents to forms, whiteboard sketches or business cards, and turn them into picture-perfect, high-quality PDFs is now the leading scanning app on iOS and Android. We are driving adoption for Adobe Sign, our cloud-based electronic signature solution, with customers including Merck, Hitachi, and Iowa State University. They are using Adobe Sign to provide a better customer experience, close contracts, and win business. In our Digital Experience business, we achieved record Experience Cloud revenue of $784 million for the quarter, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. To win in today\u2019s competitive landscape, businesses must become more customer-centric and data-driven. Our vision for Adobe Experience Cloud is to enable businesses to reimagine the entire customer journey using data to understand and drive their business from discovery through trial, purchase, use, and renewal. At the core of Adobe\u2019s own transformation has been our use of Adobe Experience Cloud. B2B and B2C companies across every country and industry are choosing Adobe Experience Cloud, the only end-to-end solution for marketing, advertising, analytics and commerce to master the art and science of Customer Experience Management. Key Experience Cloud customer wins in Q2 include Amazon, Rite Aid, Vodafone and Wyndham Hotels. The acquisitions of Magento and Marketo have significantly increased our value to existing customers, helped us attract new logos, and expanded Adobe\u2019s addressable opportunity. Magento adds to our Experience Cloud vision by allowing us to make every moment personal, and every experience shoppable in addition to attracting a large and vibrant developer community to Adobe. This quarter, we announced the availability of Adobe Commerce Cloud, built on the Magento Commerce platform, with deep integrations across Adobe Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Advertising Cloud. We announced a new partnership with Amazon, creating Magento Commerce branded stores for Amazon sellers, which will give merchants a more seamless way to manage their business across both Amazon.com and their own storefront. With the addition of Marketo, Adobe provides the leading marketing engagement platform for both B2B and B2C customers. We\u2019ve deepened the integration between Adobe Marketing Cloud and Marketo Engage. We are leveraging Adobe Sensei, so companies can deliver the right experiences to the right people at the right time. This quarter, we announced our partnership with LinkedIn, empowering B2B marketers and sellers to easily identify, understand and engage B2B customer buying teams. At Summit, we announced the global availability of Adobe Experience Platform, the industry\u2019s first real-time platform for Customer Experience Management. Adobe Experience Platform provides real-time CDP and DMP capabilities, and stitches together data from across the enterprise, creating real-time customer profiles and enabling the activation and delivery of hyper-personalized experiences. Some of the world\u2019s leading brands are already using Adobe Experience Platform in beta, including Best Buy, Sony Interactive Entertainment, The Home Depot and Verizon Wireless. We\u2019ve built a strong ecosystem of global partners. Recently, we announced new partnerships with ServiceNow and Software AG. We will deliver integration between Adobe Experience Platform and the ServiceNow Platform as well as with Software AG\u2019s webMethods platform. Adobe and Marketo were both positioned as leaders by Gartner in the Magic Quadrant for multichannel marketing hubs. Among the 21 companies evaluated, Adobe achieved the strongest position for Completeness of Vision. Adobe Experience Cloud was recently named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms. Adobe Marketing Cloud, Advertising Cloud and Analytics Cloud were reviewed and successfully validated by TrustArc, making Adobe the first company in the digital experience space to receive TRUSTe GDPR Privacy Practices Compliance Validation. Our mission to change the world through digital experiences gives purpose to the work we do. We are proud Adobe was honored with a Hope Award from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. For more than a decade, Adobe has been partnering with NCMEC through software contributions and technical expertise in service of its important mission to find missing children and prevent child exploitation and victimization. At Adobe, our employees are our greatest asset and we continue to invest in our future talent. This summer we\u2019re pleased to welcome more than a thousand interns and new grads to Adobe from more than 150 schools around the world. Our strategy of empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete offers a unique value-proposition in the market, and large addressable opportunities to grow our business. FY2019 is expected to be another record year. We expect the first half momentum to continue in the second half. Our revenue growth, cash flow, and operating profit differentiates us among SaaS companies at scale. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. As with last quarter, we are reporting results based on our adoption of ASC 606 this fiscal year. As a reminder, our results in the year ago fiscal period were reported based on ASC 605. We have not adjusted our prior fiscal year reported numbers for comparison purposes under ASC 606. In Q2 FY2019, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.74 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.29 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.83. Business and financial highlights in Q2 included record Digital Media revenue of $1.89 billion, including Creative revenue of $1.59 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $296 million, strong net new Digital Media ARR of $406 million, record Digital Experience revenue of $784 million, Remaining Performance Obligation, or RPO, grew to $8.37 billion, cash flow from operations of $1.11 billion, repurchasing 2.5 million shares of our stock through stock buyback, and approximately 91% of our revenue in Q2 was from recurring sources. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth. The addition of $406 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $7.47 billion. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 22% year-over-year in Q2 and we increased Creative ARR by $341 million. Notable growth drivers in Q2 across conversion, upsell and retention included new user growth driven by numerous global initiatives to generate demand, including targeted campaigns and promotions, leveraging the funnel of users coming to Creative Cloud through mobile apps and online engagement, and continued focus on new categories including immersive media and new segments such as social media creators, Creative Cloud Photography plan subscriptions, Adobe Premiere Pro single app subscriptions in the video category, Creative Cloud enterprise, including customer acquisition, seat expansion and services adoption, and adoption of Adobe Stock, where revenue and subscription growth rates remain strong. We achieved record Document Cloud revenue of $296 million in Q2, which represents 22% year-over-year growth, and we added $65 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. The growth in the Document Cloud business was driven by strong demand on Adobe.com, the continued migration of Acrobat perpetual customers to subscriptions, enterprise services adoption, and monetization of mobile app use. In addition, Adobe Sign achieved another strong quarter of growth. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record quarterly Experience Cloud revenue of $784 million, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. Experience Cloud subscription revenue was a record $654 million. Business performance in Digital Experience during the quarter was driven by strength in Adobe Marketing Cloud, including Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Target and Adobe Campaign, multi-solution digital transformation engagements, and traction with cross-selling Magento and Marketo in the enterprise. During Q2, we continued to focus on driving Magento and Marketo synergies, including organizational, product and go-to-market alignment. Both Magento and Marketo were prominently featured at Summit events in the U.S. and Europe, and we also held Magento Imagine and Marketo Marketing Nation events during Q2. The depth and breadth of our enterprise partner ecosystem remains a competitive advantage contributing to pipeline generation, customer success as well as financial performance. We had another successful quarter of selling alongside Microsoft, where our combined value proposition is resonating with enterprise customers. Our overall financial results were negatively affected by currency rate movements. Total Adobe Q2 year-over-year revenue growth would have been 27% if measured in constant currency, and year-to-date, total first half FY2019 year-over-year revenue growth would have been 26% if measured in constant currency. More specifically in Q2, from a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $4.9 million. We had $9 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY2019, versus $8.5 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY2019 thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.4 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $45.3 million. The $9 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY2019 versus $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY2018 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $36.6 million. In Q2, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 11% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 42 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter, and 46 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation, or RPO was approximately $8.37 billion exiting Q2, which compares to $8.13 billion exiting Q1. Deferred revenue exiting Q2 was $3.13 billion. The sequential decline in deferred revenue was a result of timing rather than business performance due to fewer billing cycles in our second quarter. The impact was more than offset by an increase in unbilled backlog. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $3.48 billion, and cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at a cost of $659 million. We currently have $6.6 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018 which goes through 2021. Now I will discuss our financial targets. As a reminder, our Q3 includes the summer months of June, July and August and we expect normal seasonality to influence our results during the quarter. In Q3 FY2019, we are targeting revenue of approximately $2,800,000,000, Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $360 million, Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 34%, other expense of approximately $22 million, tax rate of approximately 11% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, share count of approximately 491 million shares, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.40, and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.95. As usual, we are not updating annual targets at this time of the year. We are pleased with our first half performance and we expect our first half momentum to continue in the second half, with typical seasonality in Q3 and strength in Q4. We continue to expect sequential operating margin growth as we move through the second half of the year. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Saviage : Thanks, John.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thanks. Good afternoon. Shantanu, just on Magento and Marketo, just curious if you could give us your updated thoughts on the integration? How you're doing in the field? And some of the customer traction on both those acquisitions, that would be helpful? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Brent. Both of them are actually big picture going really well. We have, as you saw, started to integrate the products, the delivery of the Adobe Commerce Cloud that was based on Magento Commerce. We announced some good partnerships there as well as it relates to what we are doing with Amazon to allow multiple small and medium businesses to be able to deliver their storefronts based on this combined technology. We did some good work as it related to integration between the Adobe Experience Manager as well as the Adobe Commerce Cloud, so you can now have in a single digital foundation the ability to do web content management, analytics as well as commerce. So product integration with Magento is going well. I think on the go-to-market efforts, the enterprise motion that we have, which is clearly a strength of Adobe, we are putting the Magento solutions through that enterprise go-to-market motion. We've also done a good job, I think of integrating the mid-market, small and medium business, whatever you want to call it, the Magento and Marketo because the combination of both of them give us a little bit more heft in the marketplace. And on Marketo as well, I mean, it's clearly a fabulous SaaS platform for engagement as it relates to B2B marketing, the focus there has been on both integration with Adobe Analytics as well as making sure that the combination of Campaign and Marketo will be the best B2E, which is what we call sort of the business to everyone engagement platform. So pleased with it, results are good, continued focus and I think that's one of the reasons why we are aligning the organizations more rapidly to make sure that we get the appropriate alignment. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please go ahead. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. It was nice to see the net new ARR outperformance this quarter. So it sounds like it was a few different things there, but just any more color on what drove the upside would be great. In particular, I know last quarter there were some unusual items in there. I just want to check was there anything unusual this quarter. And maybe just around it out, as we think about seasonality into Q3, it looks like the guide implies a bit more seasonality than what we saw last year, anything to keep in mind there as well? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think big picture, Jennifer, Digital Media, we continue to do really well. We had, as you point out a great Q2 achieving I think $406 million in net new ARR, which is a record for Q2. Certainly, I think in terms of the different offerings, as John mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are seeing traction on the video offerings, we're seeing traction with enterprise adoption, services, both Stock and Sign are continuing to perform quite well, international expansion continues to be an area of opportunity as well as new customer acquisition through the marketing campaigns that we have. And if you think about, as you pointed out again, the $360 million target that we're putting for Q3, which would be a record for a Q3 and then you add to that what the $750 million plus in ARR for the first half, I mean it's clear that the momentum continues in the business, I think to your question around seasonality and color. I think it's our expectation that net new DM ARR in Q4 would be similar to what we had last year in Q4. And so, if you add that all up, it implies that we will have record new ARR again in 2019. And I think underlying all of that, as we've outlined to you is the DDOM model that we have, it allows us to optimize our marketing spend, it allows us to engage better with customers, and MAX should be another great show for that business. One thing I should also mention, sorry, is that, Acrobat continues to, as you clearly saw from the results, do really well. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, Keith, your line is open. You may be on mute. Keith Weiss : Sorry about that, I was on mute. Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter. I wanted to touch based on kind of leadership on the Digital Experience side of the equation. I'm kind of \u2013 what the current thought process is, I'm sure Shantanu, you're doing a great job sort of with leadership there, but are we planning on replacing Brad and kind of what's the sort of the game plan for rolling out new leadership and how sort of the new assets are going to sit under that new leadership plan? Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Keith, for the question. It's such a large opportunity that we're completely convinced, I am that the focus on the aligned organization was the right choice. It's been great. I focus a lot of time on the customer, just I think over the last 10 days three Fortune 100 CEOs have come in to talk to us about our view and our vision for digital transformation, spent a lot of time on the product to make sure that we get great alignment. You've seen the general availability of the Adobe Experience Platform, the Artificial Intelligence features that we're now in beta attribution and customer journey. We've signed some great partnerships with Software AG and ServiceNow. And really, I've been trying to focus also the organization on a lot more with respect to customer centricity. I think as we've aligned the two acquisitions of Magento and Marketo, which we've outlined to you, Keith, was a priority. We brought the same rigor that we have in DDOM for creating that cadence and customer centricity for pipeline progression, for marketing demand generation, as well as for the software delivery lifecycle. And so, I'm really also pleased with how the current management team, which is extremely strong and has stepped up and is executing an alignment. So, while the search continues, we haven't missed a beat and I've been spending a lot of time, which just continues to give me a lot of faith in the long-term opportunity associated with the business and it's not hampering the progress at all in terms of what we need to do. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Sounds great. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thanks so much, and congrats as well on a great quarter. Shantanu, on customer data platforms, there's been a lot of recent news from Adobe as well as some of your competitors launching their own CDP offerings. How will Adobe Experience Platform differentiate from peers? And why is your product going to be better and wining the market? Shantanu Narayen : It's a good question, Brad. And I think fundamentally it stems from the fact that when you have the leading content management platform, we have the data and I think that continues to differentiate us in terms of the customer interaction across different channel points. We've been talking to you for a couple of years of the investment that we've made in the Adobe Experience Platform, the vision there has always been not only to integrate all of our existing solutions, so we have a platform across content and data to win it, but to frankly stitch together all that customer profile in real-time. And when you have all that customer interaction that's happening as a result of mobile access to the website or website access or as customers are giving us access to the other channel data, that's just as unique differentiator that no other company has. So we start off from that being a huge advantage. I think the effort that we've put into an ecosystem of partnerships there in terms of ingesting that data, the common taxonomy that we've agreed to the partnership with SAP and Microsoft on ODI, and, frankly, the credibility that we just continue to get associated with the fact that when you're processing these hundreds of trillions of transactions on an annual basis that we have more insight to be able to activate it, I think all of that gives us hope. I think with the whole Experience Cloud, I will continue to reinforce that when we talk about it being north of a $70 billion addressable market, you should look at this as it's not a win/loss kind of situation, there's just so much opportunity. But starting with what we had with Audience Manager and DMP that we had with Demdex combined with what we are doing in CDP and making sure that that all operates in real-time, I think that is just a unique combination for Adobe. Brad Zelnick : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia : Hey, thanks for taking my question here. Maybe for you, Shantanu, just to dig into one of the prior questions on Creative, Adobe Spark seems to be doing very well. So can you just talk a little bit about why you think that's doing so well? And maybe more specifically talk about what you've seen in the last couple of years that Spark has been available? What you've seen in terms of lifetime value and customer acquisition cost qualitatively? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Saket, I mean I think it stems from this fundamental assertion and hypothesis that we have \u2013 beliefs that we have that everyone has a story to tell. And when you have K-12 student all the way to the largest enterprises in the world wanting to use social media, wanting a quick template-based approach to start to be able to express themselves and then grow that expertise into using our products, it's just a fantastic on-ramp. And so the millions of customers that we have, the penetration in the education segment is both an opportunity in itself, but frankly great brand building and awareness of what the Adobe Solutions can do across the spectrum. And so, I think it really \u2013 we've been talking about this for a while, but it's the golden age of creativity and design and it doesn't matter whether you're studying history or geography, I mean, the ability to express yourself visually and graphically and to do that across social channels is just such an intrinsic part of what it is and I think we've really struck a chord with the great, great product across both mobile. I think the fact that we're exploring different platforms and previously we used to look at print and web as a platform, now we look at even channels like YouTube as a platform. It's just a great in addition to mobile, way to attract new customers. So I think that's why it really resonates with customers and while it'll continue to be both from an ARR perspective of growth as well as from overall brand and awareness, just a significant ability for us to continue to keep Digital Media ARR momentum going. Saket Kalia : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Maybe I can bring John into the conversation here, kind of curious, as you look at the growth in Creative Cloud for the quarter? Is there a way to disaggregate how much of that growth has actually come from, the price changes that you've made over X number of quarters versus how much that growth is actually coming from pure volume? John Murphy : Yes, sure. It's really coming from both. And when you think about the North America price increase that we did last year in Q2 that as we said was going to be accretive and certainly through the year as we now anniversary that price increase. And then earlier this year, in February, we did a price increase for a Dark Cloud and also in EMEA for Creative. So all these things are accretive, but one of the things that we've talked about for a long time now is, attracting new users to the platform is really our biggest growth opportunity and we're able to do that through the various new products that are attracting folks to our platform because some of these newer products are easier to use and then as they get comfortable with those, they end up \u2013 we're able to upsell them into full suite of products for multiple applications. So we had this opportunity to really kind of tack load from many different ways. And we've been successful now in growing the number of users across the platform and also leveraging the mobile app on ramp. Shantanu Narayen : But if you think of it in terms of material, it's primarily new user growth and new subscriptions, Sterling, is how you should think about it. I think the value that we're providing enables us to keep driving at the anniversary of people moving over to the new pricing, keep them as loyal customers and improve their engagement. But as it relates to the photography and video, it's primarily new user growth that's driving the Digital Media ARR. Sterling Auty : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kasthuri Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations. I'm curious given the strength in the quarter. You had a very nice quarter on net new ARR, and on the Experience Cloud side, you had very good bookings as well. But when I look at the guidance, you didn't change the guidance for the year. But Q3 numbers look a little bit right relative for the Street, it's just a function of conservatism given, maybe a questionable macro environment, or is it just that the seasonality of the business? We've had the firsthand chance to model the seasonality of the business, including the acquisitions and that we may have been a little off relative to what is the new seasonality of Adobe? Just wondering what your thoughts are there? Thank you so much, and congrats. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I think, Kash, thanks first. I mean, big picture, it's clear. We're having another record year and great execution against both growth opportunities across all of the three marketing clouds, Creative, Document and Experience. And as you point out, the results, revenue growth of 25%, the significant cash flow as well as the strong EPS, while we're increasing margins. I think on Digital Media, I gave some color as it related to what will certainly be a record Digital Media ARR year and I think we factor in seasonality, and so that's I think part of how you should be thinking about Q3 versus Q4. And in DX as well, I mean the subscription revenue growth, if you look at that, when you see the revenue growth of 34%, the subscription revenue growth certainly has exceeded that and it's closer to 39%. And so I think that also reflects the success that we continue to have and the fact that we have the leading SaaS enterprise platform for enterprises to engage digitally with their customers. And so, I think big picture, the two opportunities continue to be significant tailwinds. We're executing well against it. I think we'll give you more color as it relates to Q4 in September as well as 2020 at MAX. But continue to be really optimistic. And I think where we are in the quarter, just updating annual numbers for a year is akin to giving Q3 and Q4 targets and that's why, as you know, typically we don't do that. But that should not change the fact that we have momentum in the business and optimism for the future. Kasthuri Rangan : Congrats, Shantanu and team. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Mark Moerdler : Thank you so much. I really appreciate, and congrats also on the quarter. So you've guided to 34% digital marketing growth for the back half of the year. What's the more difficult set of compares as you lap Magento's acquisition and lap a bit of the Marketo? Can you give us a bit more color on what's driving that strength? I appreciate. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think as it relates to the Digital Experience business, we've always outlined, Mark, that the focus has been on driving subscription bookings. I think as the deferred revenue also starts to taper off, that's certainly going to factor into what happens. But it's just a large addressable opportunity. We have the market leading products and we continue to be excited about how we execute against that. So that's how I would think about that particular business. Mark Moerdler : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Yes. Thank you, good evening. Shantanu, a technology strategy question, I was hoping we could parse through with plethora of three-letter acronyms that Adobe has been sharing with us at Summit and on other occasions. We now have CDP, CXM, CXP, XPM and so forth. The question is, ultimately does Adobe have a single underlying data model that is the Adobe Data Model, or could you foresee two or more principal data models, particularly in DX? I ask in part because at Summit in EMEA last month, there was some mention in one of the sessions about you are having a new purpose built B2B data model, and so maybe you could put this in the context of the complexity of the architecture or the technology as it might relate to any implications for R&D and sales efficiency? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. You forgot ODI and maybe a couple of other TLAs, Jay, but it's a good question. And I think as it relates to how we think about the technology underpinnings, we think about it from two strategic points of view. The first is, are we able in our own products to have a common way in which people can really provide integration for our existing applications better than any other individual point product vendor can provide? And I think our track record, as you know better than most in terms of what we have done on the Digital Media side of having colors and types and font faces work well, that is the reason why the underlying data model allows us to have things like campaigns or segments or audiences work better across our applications than anybody else. And so, we did that heavy lifting associated with having a common way to define the taxonomy, the customer journey across our products. We clearly saw that that was not going to be adequate in terms of the aspirations we had to actually being the underlying sort of infrastructure for how all companies deal with digital transformation and the reasons for the partnership with both Microsoft as well as with SAP is to actually through ODI and make that true not just for customer behavioral data where we clearly have access to all of that data, but also to extend that to financial data, to transactional data over time to IoT data. And so, the way I would think about it is, it's a common taxonomy, it's a common way for people to extend it, but we don't have to do the heavy lifting of defining everything. The beauty of the model is that actually we defined the framework, we defined the API, we defined the services and other people can actually extend and augment that, and so it enables the entire ecosystem to partner. So it's exciting. We delivered that through the Adobe Experience Platform. I talked in the prepared remarks about how we have early beta customers who are starting to see it. Certainly, Adobe is using it in our own offering. But I think it's really going to be the underlying infrastructure for our next generation enterprise who wants to engage with their customers. So we're excited about that. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks, Shantanu. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Shantanu, I want to ask a little bit about Sensei in the context of, is that coming up at all and it's under conversations on the Experience Cloud side. I know there's a lot of factors that go into those decisions from a product portfolio perspective. I was just kind of curious, if Sensei is adding to the conversation if you view that as sort of a needle mover for you all at this point? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : I'm really glad you asked that question, because we talk a lot about the Adobe magic that we've had in the Digital Media products and we certainly touched on what we've done with Content-Aware Fill, which is magic as it relates to being able to do that across frames and reduce a whole bunch of complexity for the video products. We are investing very heavily in the same technology Sensei in the Experience Cloud. Let me maybe give you a couple of examples to make it more tangible. I mean, the first is when you're doing search, the way you do search when you're doing it in Digital Media trying to find an object in Stock where we have the best technology is still substantially different from the way you would do search, in Commerce where you're looking for an object maybe based on a color or based on a type of preference. So I think in Commerce, that's one area where Sensei and the ability to do search and find the right shopping good that you're interested in. That's a game changer in targeting and in what we can do around how we can optimize targets and recommendations, that's another area where AI is certainly beneficial. When you're talking about a subscription model and customer preference and a prediction score of who's likely to churn and what are the best way to engage with them across channels, that's another area where we have AI technology. But in addition to that, as part of the experience platform, we actually now have modules. I talked a little bit about attribution.AI and things like that, which are AI modules and frameworks for people to actually augment the Experience Cloud. So I think, unlike other companies, we believe that the AI is best built in into each of the existing solutions and through frameworks, but our track record of delivering against that has been strong and it's only getting better. Kirk Materne : Perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Please go ahead. Thomas Roderick : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. John, let me throw this one at you, just looking at the Digital Experience segment itself, we saw a nice bounce back in the segment gross margins and part of that, of course came into scale and some of the deferred revenue write-downs rolling off. But the other part, of course, is realizing some of the integrations between the components. And I was hoping you could speak to what you're seeing with some of the leverage between the properties of Magento and Marketo, and the core of Digital Experience, in particular on the COGS side, are there elements of architectural leverage that are starting to show up and then even below that line are you seeing much sales leverage between the acquired properties? Thank you. John Murphy : Yes. No, absolutely. For sure, we're seeing the ability in both properties that we acquired for us to be able to unify development across the platform and that in of itself provides us some efficiencies. In addition, from the go-to-market perspective, as we've talked about, we've unified and aligned our go-to-market strategy with the existing Adobe Enterprise sales organization under Matt and so that's been able to bring a lot more efficiency as we cross-sell not only the existing Digital Experience products, but also Magento and Marketo. Not to mention then our partner ecosystem where we are selling alongside Microsoft, for example, and being successful in having multi-solution sales with them as well. So it's been something that through scale and through continued focus on the integration that we're able to get some leverage out of that. Thomas Roderick : Excellent. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : The one thing, maybe, I'd like to add to that, I know there was some question around seasonality and while this question was specifically around operating margins, I think cash Adobe, so maybe we'd give you color on how we think about our investment as well as what's happening as it relates to margins. I think it's clear that despite the revenue growth and investment that the operating margin of the company has improved throughout the year and I think we remain very focused on profitability. If you look at seasonally how that should play out over the second half of the year, our guide for Q3 shows EPS increasing by approximately, I think $0.12 despite seasonality. And we certainly expect Q4 to be a strong seasonally finish to the year. And I think to give you some color on that while we are not updating our annual targets, we would expect that sequential EPS growth from Q3 to Q4 to be about 3x the growth from Q2 to Q3. So hopefully, that gives you some color on how we think about the investments. We certainly continue to believe in investing for the revenue growth that we're seeing and it also clearly gets us back to north of 40% margin. So hopefully, that gives you some color on seasonality as well as while the question was on gross margins how we think about operating margins and expenses. Thomas Roderick : Really helpful, Shantanu. Thank you. Mike Saviage : Operator, I think we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our final question from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. Question on the Digital Experience side, you've been talked in the past about a 25% growth in the book of business, including the two acquisitions. I'm wondering, sort of how things are tracking so far this year and what you've learned in terms of first half growth as that trend progresses into the second half? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. As you know, Walter, we don't update how we're doing against the bookings during the year as we think about the underlying dynamics of the industry and the need for Digital Experience solution. Nothing diminishes the belief that we have that that continues to be a large growth opportunity. I think as you could see from the subscription revenue growth that we see, we continue to focus on executing against that. And so we'll certainly provide more color as we've said on that on an annual basis. But I just big picture the \u2013 available opportunity, I think continues to be large. And given Mike said that that was the last question, maybe just as a quick summary again, it's clear that we have the right strategy and the focus on delivering great customer value. We're pleased with the first half financial results, so we expect that momentum to continue in the second half. The strategy of empowering people to create and helping businesses transform. We believe that continues to be a north of 100 billion addressable market opportunity. And we're really pleased with the attendance that we saw at the customer events in the DX, and whether it was the Summits in the U.S. and Europe, whether it was Marketo Marketing Nation, whether it was a Magento Imagine. I think that just reflects both the leadership that we have in product strategy and vision as well as the strength of the customer and partner community. And FY2019 is shaping up again and we expect it to be another record year for revenue and I think the innovation roadmap and opportunity positions us really well for future growth. We appreciate all of you joining us today. Thank you. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call. Thanks everybody for joining us.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. Q3 was a record quarter for Adobe, with strong revenue and continued growth across our entire business. We delivered $2.83 billion in revenue in Q3, representing 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.61, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.05. Adobe\u2019s strategy to empower people to create and transform how businesses compete is fueling our continued success. The ability to deliver a personalized relationship with every customer using digital technology is a mandate for every business. Internal efficiency, including a paper-to-digital revolution, is critical to achieving that imperative. In addition, design and creativity has never been more relevant. Everyone has a story to tell from professional photographers, to immersive content and experience designers, to students and small business owners, and they need to tell it on an ever-increasing number of canvases. Adobe is innovating to expand these market opportunities, and customers around the globe continue to count on Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud to run their businesses, transform how they work, and bring their creative ideas to life. In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q3. Net new Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR was $386 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to $7.86 billion. Q3 Creative revenue was $1.65 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. Creative Cloud is the creativity platform for all. Through a relentless focus on innovation across different media types, devices, and segments, Creative Cloud has become the one-stop shop for creative applications and services as well as the leading source for creative inspiration, learning, training and community. Our goal is to ensure that Creative Cloud applications and services make every creative possibility a reality for every one of our customers. Adobe\u2019s vision is that mobile devices and tablets should be used for creation in addition to consumption. Adobe Lightroom, our complete system for photo editing, achieved significant growth on mobile devices with Q3 monthly active users growing 130% year-over-year. In Q3, new Adobe IDs created from Adobe mobile apps rose more than 40% year-over-year, showing that mobile continues to be a healthy on-ramp for subscriptions. In Q3 we announced Adobe Fresco, a groundbreaking drawing and painting app, which will be available first on iPad later this fall. Fresco digitally reimagines the process that artists have traditionally used, whether it\u2019s chalk, pastels, oil, or watercolor paint. Like Photoshop transformed and democratized photography, we believe Fresco will change how artists use digital to draw and illustrate. Apple will feature Fresco in hundreds of its retail stores as part of its iPad Pro Big Draw campaign. At Adobe, we believe that creative skills should be a core part of school curricula and that STEAM, not just STEM, should be a focus in education. We\u2019ve expanded our Adobe Ambassador Network to target more than 100 colleges across the country, where students evangelize creativity and lead on-campus workshops to help fellow students learn to use Adobe creative products. Last week, we launched a new program with Reddit to encourage young creators to contribute their personal designs to a giant, global canvas on the Reddit front page. This was the biggest community event on Reddit based on total contributions and participation.  These types of partnerships give us an opportunity to introduce Creative Cloud to millions of next-generation creators. Adobe MAX is the world\u2019s largest creativity conference. In November, we\u2019ll welcome our global creative community and partners, more than 15,000 live attendees and nearly one million virtual attendees and unveil significant new Adobe Creative Cloud innovation. With Document Cloud, we are accelerating the transformation of paper-to-digital processes and reinventing how people scan, edit, collaborate, sign and share digital documents. Q3 Document Cloud revenue and net new ARR were records for a quarter, and we grew total Document Cloud ARR to $993 million. Key Document Cloud customer wins in Q3 included Deutsche Bank, Saudi Aramco, Dell and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. As with our creative products, our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across desktop and mobile devices. In Q3 more than 2.5 billion PDFs were opened in Adobe Reader on mobile devices. Adobe Scan, which has become the top document scanning app for both iOS and Android, has close to 35 million installs, with downloads increasing more than 30% year-over-year in Q3. Strong uptake of our Document Cloud mobile applications, as well as continued strength in Acrobat subscription adoption, is driving momentum in the business. In addition, we launched new web-based services that offer instant access to Adobe PDF creation and compression capabilities from any browser. We believe these services are not only relevant to individuals looking to quickly get work done, but also developers who need to build best-in-class PDF document support into their web applications. We are investing in creative marketing campaigns to drive awareness of these capabilities and target new users. Adobe Sign, our leading cloud-based electronic signature solution, continues to gain traction among businesses and organizations. This quarter we introduced Adobe Sign for Small Business, providing small and mid-market businesses enterprise-level e-signature capabilities.  In our Digital Experience business, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $821 million for the quarter, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. Our vision is to help every business become an Experience Business. This means enabling them to deliver engaging experiences that anticipate and meet the needs of their customers at every stage of their journey from acquisition to purchase and renewal. We believe Customer Experience Management is a significant growth opportunity for Adobe. Experience Cloud is the industry\u2019s most comprehensive offering, providing content and commerce, customer journey management, and customer data and insights to power experience-driven businesses across all industries. In Q3, Experience Cloud was named a Leader in seven Gartner Magic Quadrant and Forrester Wave reports. Key Experience Cloud wins in Q3 included Delta Airlines, T-Mobile, Capital One, and Best Western. We are the undisputed leader in this large and growing market, and we continue to expand the opportunity in front of us, extending our footprint from B2C to B2B, from enterprise to mid-market, and from the CMO to the CIO, CTO, and CEO. Content and commerce are the foundation for every digital business. We continue to drive strong performance with Adobe Experience Manager for multi-channel experience delivery. Through integration with Magento Commerce, we are making every experience shoppable. This has led to strong performance of our integrated content and commerce offering, and Magento Commerce bookings growth of more than 40% year-over-year in Q3. Multi-channel campaign management is another differentiated pillar of the Adobe Experience Cloud. The integration of Marketo with Adobe Campaign gives Adobe the industry\u2019s strongest offering in the customer journey management and orchestration space across both B2B and B2C.  Earlier this year we introduced Adobe Experience Platform, the industry\u2019s first real-time platform for Customer Experience Management. Adobe Experience Platform will solve a critical challenge every enterprise is facing, how to harness massive amounts of valuable customer data that is siloed and not easily accessible or actionable. Adobe Experience Platform stitches together data from across the enterprise creating real-time unified customer profiles, enabling the activation and delivery of hyper-personalized experiences. By combining Adobe Experience Platform with Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and our new real-time Customer Data Platform, or CDP, we are creating a new, comprehensive customer data and insights offering for the digital enterprise that is unmatched. Adobe Experience Platform has been several years in the making and we\u2019ve seen tremendous enthusiasm from customers for this solution with multiple pilot deployments already in market. We continue to be the leader in Customer Experience Management, which has a TAM of more than$70 billion by 2021. While we experienced some bookings delays in Q3, our robust product roadmap and customer pipeline positions us for multiple years of strong growth. At Adobe, we continue to invest in our employees, who are the heart and soul of our company. Last week at our annual Adobe for All Summit, we reaffirmed global gender pay parity for our workforce, and shared new details and data on our opportunity parity initiative, which examines fairness in promotion rates and access to new opportunities for our employees. Adobe is the leader in several large and growing categories, creativity, digital documents and customer experience management. We remain excited about the opportunities in front of us and confident in our ability to drive strong top-line and bottom-line growth. John. John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. In Q3 FY19, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.83 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.61 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.05. Business and financial highlights in Q3 included, record Digital Media revenue of $1.96 billion, including record Creative revenue of $1.65 billion and record Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $307 million. Strong net new Digital Media ARR of $386 million; Record Digital Experience revenue of $821 million; Remaining Performance Obligation, or RPO, grew to $8.77 billion; Cash flow from operations of $922 million; Repurchasing 2.6 million shares of our stock; and approximately 92% of our revenue in Q3 was from recurring sources. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth. The addition of $386 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $7.86 billion. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 22% year-over-year in Q3, and we increased Creative ARR by $314 million. Strong acquisition, up sell and retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions continued during Q3, and were driven by New user growth, helped by many global initiatives to generate demand, including targeted campaigns and promotions, a large funnel of users coming from desktop and mobile; and leveraging Adobe\u2019s brand and new products to expand into adjacent creative categories. Increasing adoption of single app offerings, including Adobe Premiere Pro for video and Adobe Illustrator for artwork. Continued growth in international markets, including greater than 40% year-over-year unit growth in key emerging markets. Ongoing success in the enterprise, including new logos, seat expansion and services adoption which drives higher contract value; and adoption of creative services including Adobe Stock, where revenue grew greater than 30% year-over-year.  Our momentum with Document Cloud accelerated in Q3. We achieved Document Cloud revenue of $307 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth, and we added a record $72 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. Strong Document Cloud performance during Q3 was driven by subscription demand across key routes to market with individuals, small and mid-market businesses, and large enterprises; the continued migration of Acrobat perpetual customers to subscriptions, enterprise services adoption and the conversion of free mobile Reader users to paid subscriptions. Adobe Sign revenue grew greater than 25% year-over-year. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved quarterly Experience Cloud revenue of $821 million, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. Experience Cloud subscription revenue was a record $679 million, growing 37% year-over-year.  While we had strong overall revenue in Q3, our subscription bookings growth for Marketo in the mid-market did not meet our expectations, which is being addressed by increasing our focus and investment on demand generation and inside sales. In addition, there were Analytics Cloud subscription bookings delays with related shortfalls in consulting services bookings and revenue associated with the launch of our new Adobe Experience Platform. We are confident the enhanced innovation in Analytics Cloud, the introduction of our Real-Time CDP product, and the ongoing global roll-out of the Adobe Experience Platform will convert strong customer demand and the current pipeline into bookings starting in Q4. We now expect to grow our total Digital Experience subscription bookings in fiscal 2019 by greater than 20% year-over-year. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $8.5 million. We had $10.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY19, versus $9 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY19; thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $6.7 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $38.3 million. The $10.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY19 versus $16.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY18 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $44.3 million.  In Q3, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 5% on a GAAP basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 44 days, which compares to 41 days in the year-ago quarter, and 42 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO was approximately $8.77 billion exiting Q3, which compares to $8.37 billion exiting Q2. Deferred revenue exiting Q3 was $3.26 billion. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $3.65 billion, and cash flow from operations was $922 million in the quarter. In Q3 we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $750 million. We currently have $5.85 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018 which goes through 2021. Turning to our targets, considering second half Digital Experience bookings and consulting revenue, in Q4 FY19 we are targeting revenue of approximately 2 billion 970 million dollars; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%; Net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $450 million; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 23%; Net non-operating expense of approximately $20 million; Tax rate of approximately 11% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis; Share count of approximately 490 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.68; and Non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.25. We look forward to a strong finish for the year, and sharing insights with you about our strategy and opportunities at our financial analyst meeting at MAX.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question of a day from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. KeithWeiss: Thank you guys for taking the question. And very nice quarter particularly on digital media side of the equation. It does sound like you guys are having some sort of go-to-market and disruption impacts on the digital experience side of equation. I was hoping if you could dig in a little bit further to help us explain exactly what's going on that side of the business. What does it take to fix that? Because it's definitely something like you were much more optimistic about that business a quarter ago. And then maybe one for John is there any margin impact in terms of increasing investment and inside sales and some other go-to -market stuff that is going to take to get experience clouds back up to the growth rates you guys are expecting. ShantanuNarayen: Great. Keith as you pointed out, it was a strong quarter, we were pleased with the growth across the businesses. Since I suspect that there'll be a couple of people asking about digital experience, let me go into a little bit more color on that particular opportunity. And let me clarify that wasn't any impact associated with macro. The interest from enterprises all sizes, different verticals in our comprehensive solutions remains incredibly strong. And even if you look at the targets that we've provided, it's clear that we are delivering strong revenue growth while actually accelerating the subscription bookings year-over-year on what is a much larger book of business because we do an apples-to-apples comparison. I think as you think about Q3, it's clear we have leading solutions in the first mile and the last mile. So Adobe Experience Manager campaign and Magento had strong growth. The Magento acquisition\u2019s been viewed exceedingly well by customers. It's clearly very strategic and we grew the book of business greater than 40% in Q3. And actually have done a really good job of taking Magento into the enterprise. The other part that we're absolutely clear about is that there's a new generation of enterprise software that's going to emerge which will be required to digitally engage with customers across all these multiple channels. What it has to do is deliver first mile content experiences, that\u2019s the content and commerce piece. It has to segment audiences now in real time across multiple channels. You have to do customer journey management and orchestration and you have to provide data and insights to enable these AI services. We've been focused on this opportunity just like we created the digital marketing category. We believe this is absolutely crucial for the experience business and so we built the Adobe experience platform from scratch to deliver what we call DDOM in terms of how we run our own digital business. Customers are really excited. It's the first software actually that exists that's designed to specifically integrate the needs of the CMO, the Chief Revenue Officer and the CIO. So our strategy with the Adobe Experience platform is that we want to actually augment the analytics capability, the audience manager capability with what we are doing with these new services as well as the real-time CDP in the market. We're really excited about the multiple installations that we have as well as the interest globally. You can argue we were maybe a tad aggressive, Keith, about the timing adoption, but this phase shift that we've seen in no way diminishes the magnitude of the opportunity or my belief in the lead that we have. And so as I think about the business, as we think about the targets, we're leading in this particular category. We saw as I said some delays in the bookings, but that has in no way changed our excitement and optimism about the business. So hopefully that helps give you some color associated with each of the businesses. The last thing I would say is that we talked about Marketo specifically. And there I would say our natural inclination was to perhaps focus our aspirations on the enterprise business, serve our existing customers that's going well. Mid market continues to be a huge growth opportunity. We have the leading product in that space and much like we drove growth in the Magento business; our focus will now be the same on Magento as well as Marketo. And so we've created a unified organization; it's going to drive - align demand generation, customer support. We have the right individuals in the field. It's organized the right way. So I'm excited about that as well. I know I was a little long, but I thought I'd just give you color associated with all of those businesses. And again the Adobe Experience platform that is really our platform that deals with future of what we are doing around analytic services, what we are doing around campaign services. And so when bookings are light you certainly see some impact on consulting as well. JohnMurphy: Yes. Keith, to answer your question on investments here. They've been factored into the targets that we issued for Q4. And as you've seen those targets we continue to expand, our operating margin as we had expected through the year as we said the second half would accelerate expansion. So the investments are embedded in those targets and as Shantanu said, we're focused on really driving that big market motion like we did with Magento. Operator : Next we hear from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. KirkMaterne: Thanks very much. Maybe I\u2019ll flip over to the digital media side the business which actually had a really strong quarter. Shantanu maybe the stat that stood out to me was actually some of the subs growth in the emerging markets. And can you just provide a little bit more detail on that sort of how you feel like you're monetizing those opportunities, how that is coming along? And maybe just talk a little bit about the opportunity maybe internationally because I know that sort of just sort of taking off right now. Thanks. ShantanuNarayen: Sure, Kirk. And yes when we look at digital media ARR both across the creative as well as the document business, we just continue to see strength. If you look at our targets for the combined year, I mean it's clear that driving approximately $1.6 billion of net new digital media ARR. Creativity and design have never been important. A couple of points; the first is mobile. What we've been doing with the mobile applications and having mobile be an on-ramp especially in international as well as key emerging markets. What we've seen with the Lightroom system that we've developed photography is such a universal phenomenon and Lightroom's a great product. So we're driving adoption across a couple of dimensions. The first is the number of people who come in from mobile and only buy a mobile subscription through an app store. The people who come in through mobile but then realize that there's more to Adobe's creative offerings and then come in and download a desktop application as well as then adopted. We're seeing significant growth for document cloud also in these international markets as they are migrating from the perpetual version of the product as well as engaging on the web. This is something that we started to talk about which is people just coming from a web; they want to create a PDF; they want to export PDF. That's seeing traction. So and frankly Stock we actually did some really interesting work with Stock. Stock was a primarily a US product but as you have more international content, as you have the search capabilities available, so the services revenue is also increasing. So just across the board as we talk about new customer acquisition, as we talk about focus on engagement, mobile certainly has momentum and services like Adobe Stock both in the US as well as international. And the last thing I'll say is that the DDOM that we have really gives us insight into what's effective in those markets. So rather than have a one-size-fits-all where we spend our money digitally, how we engage with our customers; how do we price the products appropriately. China is again seeing really good growth as it relates to our team offering and creative cloud. And so across the board, it just reflects creativity as important and we're the leader. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. BrentThill: Great. Shantanu just back on the digital experience business, if you plug in your fourth quarter guide, you're going to come in a few points below your full year guide. And I'm just curious I think the Marketo mid-market and some of the other explanations makes sense, but this has been something historically that's been fairly inconsistent. I guess a question is how do you get back to more consistency in making numbers in this business? And if you could just comment as it relates to your [linear] [ph], why it taking so long to get someone in that seat for the new role. Thank you. ShantanuNarayen: Well, couple of questions in there, Brent. And the first one is I would say as I pointed out at the beginning, we're growing our subscription book of business which is a much larger subscription book of business greater in 2019 that we did in 2018. So I think putting that in perspective, I would say clearly with the mid market our motion was perhaps a lot more in the enterprise. We saw tremendous success with Magento in the enterprise and creating a demand generation machine. I think having that aligned organization part of what I've done is I've been running this business is to align all of them quicker. I wish I'd done it even earlier in terms of having a combined Magento and Marketo mid market offering because that demand generation is a machine. So I'm confident that we'll see improvements as a result of those organizational changes. And the Adobe Experience platform when you look at it, Brent, nobody's delivered something like this. It is so innovative. We talked about it being groundbreaking and much like we did with digital marketing which is when we first came out we were decades ahead of the competition. We feel excited about that; customer interest is high; there's an ongoing on-ramp and maybe we were a tad aggressive but when you have the leader and you're driving such innovation, we have to be optimistic about what we are doing for customers. And we experience firsthand what it takes. So we're confident that we will continue to grow that business the way we have. And as it relates to the organization, I think I mentioned this last time as well. I intentionally put that on hold because I needed to get all of those organizations aligned. The product roadmap, the innovation roadmap that exists right now, Brent, is stronger than it's ever been as a result I think of various help over the last six months. What we are doing with delivering new services; the AI and intelligence services that are available; the delivery of the Adobe Experience platform; what we've done with content and commerce. Aligning that and getting that unified that is clearly the sweet spot of where other is helping and where I focused. And I think that would not have happened without somebody doing that directly. And so I'm actually pleased that I did it. And aligned the organization first. So it's in great shape for somebody when they come in. Operator : Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. JenniferLowe: Great. Thank you. And maybe just to follow up on Brent's question little bit because there were a number of different items that came up there both in terms of getting greater product alignment in terms of Marketo and Magento and also organizational alignment. So is it possible to just sort of at a high level give us a sense of how much of this is product related issue of just trying to get the products working together versus just organizational? And as you think about how long this will take to kind of get back to where you'd like to be? Is that something that could happen in a quarter or two? Or could this be a more extended timeline to get all the things working the way you want them to? ShantanuNarayen: So, Jennifer, again multiple questions there. First, let me let me end with that which is in Q4 we expect substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings in that particular business. So let me start off by that. I think when you introduce an upgrade to the analytics which is now available through the Adobe Experience platform; the customer adoption has been good. It doesn't have to do with the product issue. The product is years ahead of the competition as I said. It's a new motion. I mean what we went through, as we went through our digital transformation; people have to get ready for that adoption. And we are seeing that right now; we're seeing the on-ramp. So I would put that less as any product issue definitely not a customer demand issue. And it's just one of those things that you work through and you work through aggressively to ensure that customers get the value that they want. And again in Q4, we expect a substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings based on the pipeline and based on what we would do. Operator : Next we'll hear from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. MarkMoerdler: Thank you and congrats on the quarter also. This quarter even with the integration work in sales expansion driven by Marketo and Magento acquisition, you delivered a really good operating margin. Given what you looking --sounds like you're going to do in terms of the increased mid market focus in other areas, any reason why we shouldn't continue to see that margin continue to move up. Thank you. ShantanuNarayen: Well, Mark, if you look at our sort of guidance for Q4 and look at what the operating margin guidance would be on the revenue that we outlined and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, it's clear that we are continuing to focus on the margin as well. And I think at the beginning of the year we had said you would start to see margins back in the 40%, that's certainly there. However, big picture I would say we really focused on the long-term opportunity and continuing to drive top-line growth. But the margins and the leverage in the model you saw that in Q3 as well across the business. And you are right in that the mid market motions are more marketing and generated by demand through the website and less through direct sales. So that would be better margins than perhaps an enterprise business. Operator : Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities has our next question. JayVleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, I'd like to ask a sequel to the technology question I asked a quarter ago although without the plethora of three-letter acronyms that we talked about at the time. And still however with intent to understand how you're thinking about your technology or platform as a driver to content velocity usage and ultimately retention. So the question tonight is about AEM? Next year is the 10th anniversary of the Day acquisition and as best we can tell you've quintupled or more the revenue from that product. So perhaps you just talk about how you're thinking about the ongoing momentum in AEM? Any fundamental investments or re-architecture you work you need to do or are doing in AEM to continue to drive that as the focal point of DX? And then just a quick clarification in terms of the fixes that you talk about at least for mid-market in DX, are you planning to accelerate or implement any more of the self-service capabilities that we've talked about there besides the inside sales and other things you talked about tonight. ShantanuNarayen: So let me answer the second question first, Jay, which is certainly both the Magento and Marketo we have both self-serve capabilities as well as a ecosystem of partners. As you know with Magento having the open source community help us not just with bringing us leads, but also helping integrate with any point of sale or inventory or supply chain systems. It's a huge advantage and I think we're leveraging that. And also as it relates to Magento, we've already integrated that with our AEM. On AEM, content just continues to be a significant, significant differentiator and I referred to it earlier as the first mile experience that every customer has with a digital enterprise. Some really exciting things underway there. As you know, when we acquired Day Software that was a perpetual business, I think we effectively transitioned it to be a managed services business. We have some really exciting plans underway that we're starting to deliver to customers as it relates to fully SaaS-ifying that and making that even more self-serve in terms of people using that technology. When you think about what's happening with what's called headless content management that's an area of significant investment for us, so that people can automate their content production. AEM assets which is the assets product, there's a lot of excitement for that for content velocity as you pointed out. We talked a little bit less about AEM forms, but AEM forms also is a way in which people want to use AEM technology, so AEM has really become a platform; it's your web infrastructure which really exciting for us is there isn't a digital event that happens. Whether it's debate, companies introducing product launches, sports events that aren't completely run sort of on Adobe technology. And that's really exciting to see when we see these spikes in our traffic; we know what's happening in virtually every online event. And AEM is at the core of that. AEM had a strong quarter; it continues to be a way in which people are re-platforming their web and so stay tuned for more. But hopefully that gives you a glimpse of some of the things that we're doing. The move to SaaS; the move towards headless content and asset management are maybe three of the ones I'd identified. Operator : Our next question will come from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. HeatherBellini: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to go back to a couple questions that were asked previously. One just thinking through the digital experience and some of the comments you made, can you give us a sense is it- is there anything to do from a competitive standpoint here? Is it really all go-to-market? And I'm just wondering kind of who you're seeing most frequently and if that's changed? And then I think to Jen's question kind of talking about margins, I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about OpEx growth? And based on your comments and your guide for the Q4 and as such the full year, when we think about parsing your comment about investing for growth and margin, how should we be thinking about the pace of OpEx growth going forward? I mean you guys have been 20% or higher for the last few years. Obviously, there's M&A included in that, but should we be expecting just given the opportunities that are ahead of you kind of similar type growth rates as we start to think about the period ahead. Thank you. ShantanuNarayen: Sure. So let me answer the first question, while there may be some point solutions that have point competitors or products that are there in the market that do similar technology for the vast majority of what we offer in digital experience, we are the undisputed leaders. And really as we talk about the innovation for new things like Adobe Experience platform, the real-time CDP, what we are doing with intelligence services, Heather, were, there really isn't anybody else who's offering capabilities similar to what we have in the market. I think as it relates to M&A if that was a question, there is nothing major that we look at and feel like is a gap currently in our portfolio. I think the combination of Magento and Marketo and what we've done with the Adobe Experience platform that gives us without a doubt the leading platform and a significant portfolio to continue to drive growth. I think what we are doing on the document side with the verbs and having the ability for people to embed PDFs or think of it as a PDF service, we're pretty excited about the opportunity associated with that. And we talk about creative. So hopefully that gives you a flavor as we talk about the $100 billion addressable market that's really driving our growth at this point. HeatherBellini: And then question on OpEx right, OpEx growth. JohnMurphy: Yes. Well, again on all-expense really, I mean I think when we look at margins in general where our goal is to continue to invest in top-line growth, but then obviously drive efficiencies both and how we look at our COGS and how we're looking at the rest of the P&L. And so you see that here in Q3 we are able to vary through a lot of like relentless fiscal discipline contribute to the lower OpEx in Q3 than probably was modeled and it came through and obviously in the EPS performance. And you'll see that again in Q4 as we've modeled it out. You see the operating margin expand again in Q4 based upon our targets. So we're diligently focused on that from time to time like we did with the acquisitions. We found opportunities to invest in growth and we'll do that, but the idea is to really always focus on growing our earnings as fast if not faster than revenue. Operator : Our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. SaketKalia: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. John maybe for you and I apologize for the background noise by the way. Adobe continues to do a good job on generating new creative ARR. And so as you think about next year understanding that we aren't giving guidance yet, can you just talk about so the puts and takes to how ARR may look next year, particularly with some of the benefit of pricing that we got in fiscal 2019? JohnMurphy: When I look at ARR in more philosophically because obviously we have Analyst Day coming up where we'll actually talk a lot about next year. We've laid out many, many times the different drivers that we have and Shantanu covered a number of them when he talked about that earlier to the earlier question. So we have international markets. We've got new products. We've got single apps and mobile on-ramp that are really driving new users to the platform. And that's our -- one of our biggest growth areas. And that's still a focus for us. Yes, we have, I think other folks have asked about promotions before as well. And we use those; we've seen through our DDOM model that they're very effective in driving new users and then converting those to paid users. So overall we've got a number of vectors that we believe we can continue to grow ARR in the future and beyond. Operator : Alek Zukin with RBC Capital Markets has our next question. AleksandrZukin: Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just the first one about the -- if it's possible to unpack kind of the -- where the greater magnitude of the bookings kind of headwinds came from, whether it was more the mid-market Marketo side or whether it was the Analytics side. And then just maybe one for John about the cash flow, outperformance in the quarter was a bit below our numbers. Was there -- were there any onetime issues there that should self-correct? ShantanuNarayen: Yes. Alek, as it relates to the bookings I would in order a sort of priority first talk about the analytics as it's moving to the Adobe Experience Manager, so the combination of analytics and audience manager sort of moving to experience platform with the real-time CDP. And then to a lesser extent the Marketo mid-market. So that's sort of how I would look at it as people are transitioning and upgrading to the Adobe Experience platform. JohnMurphy: And on cash flow, we're actually pretty happy with the performance, but we did have someone times in the quarter. We ended up taking advantage of some favorable vendor pricing by doing a couple large prepayments. And then also we had some timing of some tax payments in the quarter as well. So those impacted that, but excluding those items would've been well above a $1 billion in the quarter. Operator : Next we'll hear from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. SterlingAuty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned the softness in the Marketo bookings, specifically mid-market. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of that business is usually targeted towards mid market? And is there a different kind of product set or requirement than what you're currently offering that you think you need to deliver to get it back on track? ShantanuNarayen: Sterling, I think first to put it in perspective we saw growth. We're talking about the acceleration and mid market the way we did it for Magento in terms of sort of growing it across the enterprise. And so I think it's really all about having the demand generation machine, which is easier to fix in terms of getting that sort of motion going again in the company. And in terms of it being self-serve, I mean the product is actually applicable already across the mid-market and enterprise. So there are no product issues there. It really has been as I said the natural inclination was to go in the enterprise. And so continuing to accelerate the mid-market in addition to enterprise like we're focusing on Magento. And having that as an aligned organization so we can leverage our marketing is the two changes we've made. SterlingAuty: And the general split enterprise versus mid-market in that business? ShantanuNarayen: We have such good market share across both of those segments as the leading B2B segment; it really is well penetrated across both. If there's any --this probably more penetration in the mid market and the smaller size of the large enterprises than the large enterprise, Sterling, if I were to give you some color on their current penetration within the enterprise. Operator : Our next question will come from Kas Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. KasthuriRangan: Hi, thank you very much. Shantanu, I just want to clarify, generally when you put out a newly integrator platform, the enterprise market is one that's a little bit more demanding and so they are the ones that are likely to delay purchasing, but here it appears that it's more on the mid-market side. So I'm just curious to get a little bit more color. What else could do you need to see in the product by which the customer base can move forward with confidence? And I've got to believe that just based on the new guidance for Q4 that we're not expecting a snapback in marketing or what used to be called marketing cloud bookings. So therefore should we expect whatever you expected for this year to actually happen next year, while not being specific about a growth rate. Thank you so much. ShantanuNarayen: So, Kas, first with respect to the bookings, let me again reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks, which is we would expect the overall subscription book of business for all of the experienced cloud across mid market, across enterprise and across all solutions to be greater than 20%. So I wanted to make sure that that was understood despite what we saw in Q3. I think as it relates to your first question, the integrated platform that is really aimed more at the enterprise and that's the natural migration of analytics and audience manager customers. I think the mid-market is specifically as it relates to Marketo, so I just wanted to clarify that. And so there are no issues with respect to adoption in the enterprise, if anything as I said we were maybe a tad aggressive with how quickly they would adopt it, but we do expect to see substantial bookings in Q4 quarter-over-quarter. KasthuriRangan: Got it. And the outlook for this combined newly integrated platform going into next year. What are the things that you could do or customers can do that they could not do with the previous product? Just trying to understand qualitatively how this changes things for Adobe. That's it. Congrats. ShantanuNarayen: Well, I think what we've been through, Kash, with our own move to digital, the ability to have a real-time platform where you can actually activate what happens to customers across multiple channels, it doesn't exist. I mean the first generation of dealing with these customers is a record in a database that is completely inadequate in terms of how people can engage with customers. So this is absolutely groundbreaking in terms of what can be done. So think of it as you know how many times have you gone to a website; you've bought a product and then the ad for that product continues to dog you for weeks. And maybe sometimes to add insult to injury, it actually says there's a discount now available for that product. That's sort of the thing that we're addressing or when you call in to a customer support and you've done something in a retail store or you've done something online and it has no idea about who you are and what you did. So I think this real-time CDP; the other massive movement that you know is happening is between known and unknown and the movement towards that with browsers. So we're the first to convert what was our leading position with DMP or data management into real time CDP or a customer data platform. So this is the ability to have one single unified view of a customer across multiple channels, understand how you acquire them; understand how you engage with them. So that's really what I think is an imperative for every company doing digital transformation. So that's our opportunity and our lead. Operator : Our next question will come from Walter Pritchard with Citi. WalterPritchard: Hi. Sorry for the background noise here. John, just question for you on pricing as a driver. I've noticed in the past you have outlined in this quarter, you outlined the different -- some of the different drivers in the script. And I didn't see pricing there. I'm wondering sort of how pricing both the expiration of the promotional pricing as well as some of the pricing actions you taking over the last 18-months are faring as drivers of the creative business compared to what you've seen in recent quarters. Thanks. JohnMurphy: Sure, Walter. Yes, pricing is certainly is a lever; it's not one that we've ever used really as a driver for an annual price increase to increase ARR for instance. One of the things that we look at is the value that we're providing to the customers. And when we provide the value and we see that value resonate with customers then we price it accordingly. What we saw this year, of course, was the price increase that we did I should say last year for North America and then this year internationally in Australia and Japan, we seen those price increases be well accepted. We've customers who stay on the platform and the value was resonating. So it's something that we'll look at. It's not a core driver, but something that is one of the many levers that we can use to grow. Operator : Our final question will come from Chris Eberle with Nomura Instinet. ChrisEberle: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. I just wanted to touch on advertising really quickly. We had noticed that back in August Google had shut out Adobe PSP from their ad exchange. Can you talk about if that had any effect at all or maybe just kind of remind us the size of that business down, if it's material at all? Thanks. ShantanuNarayen: So the easy answer to that it really had no impact. That was one day in one part of Europe as a result of customer who used it inappropriately and we were backup and running. So that really had no issue. I mean the advertising business for us is important part of the Experience Cloud business. It allows the CMOs to have real attribution associated with their marketing spend. It helps with customer acquisition as the on ramp to a digital business. So it plays a strategic role and we have good offering and that it cuts across all of the different channels that people are looking to acquire customers on namely TV, search, display and video.  So I think in particular where we are strongest right now is certainly in helping people with the new media type such as video and TV. So that's it as it relates to the ad business. I mean given that was the last question; I continue to believe that Adobe is not just driving but we are creating large market opportunities. We were pleased with our fiscal performance in Q3. And I am particularly pleased with the product road map and innovation that we are delivering across all three clouds to what is increasingly and incredibly diverse set of customers. Our strategy empowering people to create and helping businesses transform is certainly working. And we are executing against that strategy. Design and creativity have never been important. You've seen the strength in both the creative as well as the document business. And digital transformation and digitization continues to be an incredible opportunity. Clearly, FY19 will be another record year with strong cash flow and margin expansion. And as a plug, particularly excited about the innovation that we are going to showcase at MAX. It's going to be our largest Creative Event. And I hope to see you join us in LA for both MAX as well as our FA meeting. Thank you for joining us today.  End of Q& A Operator : This concludes our call. Thanks everyone.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. Fiscal 2019 was a phenomenal year for Adobe as we exceeded $11 billion in revenue, a significant milestone for the company. Our record revenue and EPS performance in 2019 makes us one of the largest, most diversified, and profitable software companies in the world. Total Adobe revenue was $11.17 billion in FY 2019, which represents 24% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY 2019 was $6, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $7.87. We closed the year with another record quarter, delivering Q4 revenue of $2.99 billion, representing 21% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.74, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.29. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is significantly expanding our customer universe, from students to business communicators to creative professionals to the world\u2019s largest multinational corporations. Ground-breaking innovation in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud is accelerating our opportunity and momentum. Creative Cloud empowers all voices from the most demanding professional to next gen creators; enables the cutting edge of creativity across all media types; makes the creative process more productive and collaborative; and delivers Adobe magic with Sensei. We continue to invest in multiple new growth drivers, which has expanded the total addressable market for Creative Cloud to approximately $31 billion by 2022. Innovation is at the heart of Creative Cloud\u2019s growth. This year at MAX, we announced the next generation of Creative Cloud, with goals of deepening customer engagement, continuing to attract new customers, and investing in adjacent opportunities to fuel future growth.  Key announcements at MAX included : Delivering additional value to existing subscribers through feature enhancements to our flagship creative tools, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, Illustrator and InDesign, as well as a complete redesign of our Creative Cloud desktop app; enabling collaboration via multi-surface systems with the launch of Photoshop on iPad, Fresco on Windows, and a preview of Illustrator on iPad; extending category leadership with new innovations in Adobe XD, including live co-editing and fully integrated Creative Cloud Libraries; launching new products such as Adobe Aero, the industry\u2019s first tool that allows designers to build and share AR experiences; expanding our mobile offering with the introduction of Photoshop Camera, a consumer app that will bring Photoshop technology directly to the moment of capture; and Delivering Adobe magic to enable creatives to work faster and smarter than ever before with new Adobe Sensei-powered features. Adobe\u2019s heritage is built on providing trusted creative solutions, and we have a responsibility to play a role in addressing content authenticity. At MAX, we announced an initiative in partnership with The New York Times Company and Twitter to develop an industry standard for digital content attribution, and we\u2019re inviting other companies to join to create a long-term shared solution. With Document Cloud, Adobe is enabling the paper-to-digital transformation that is underway at organizations and enterprises around the world. With trillions of PDFs created every year and billions of people viewing PDF documents, we\u2019ve expanded our ambitions in this space, and estimate the total addressable market for Document Cloud will grow to approximately $13 billion by 2022. Our Document Cloud strategy is to enable all common document actions, what we call Acrobat verbs, including editing, sharing, scanning and signing to be frictionless across mobile and web by leveraging the ubiquitous PDF format. We make this possible through desktop and mobile applications, single-click web functionality in browsers, and with a rich set of APIs that can be embedded in third-party applications. Our Document Cloud ecosystem continues to grow. At BoxWorks, we introduced a new Acrobat web experience, which includes capabilities to modify, organize, sign and collaborate on PDFs directly within Box. At Microsoft Ignite, we announced new advancements in Adobe Sign to simplify the e-signature process, and we deepened integrations between Adobe Sign and Microsoft Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure. In Q4, we drove strong revenue growth across both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Digital Media revenue was $2.08 billion. Net new Digital Media ARR was a record $539 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q4 grew to $8.40 billion. Global interest and subscription adoption were strong throughout the quarter and accelerated after Adobe MAX. Demand for mobile offerings and overall web traffic continued to grow. We are attracting new customers, with over 50% of our cumulative subscribers being new to our Creative Cloud franchise. With 23 million students having access to Adobe Spark, we\u2019re spearheading the development of critical creative skills for the next generation. Document Cloud growth is being driven by new customer acquisition, migration from Acrobat perpetual licenses to subscriptions, and the monetization of an ever-increasing universe of Document Cloud mobile app users. Digital Media enterprise adoption continues to expand with outstanding seasonal Q4 performance. Finally, we drove record demand for subscriptions during the last week of the quarter, culminating in our biggest ever Black Friday on Adobe.com. In the experience economy, every business must be a digital business and Adobe Experience Cloud is the industry leader for powering digital businesses. The ever-increasing demand for data and insights, content and personalization, customer journey management, commerce and advertising is expanding our total addressable market for Experience Cloud to $84 billion by 2022. We\u2019re leveraging our relationships with Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Digital Officers to drive Customer Experience Management (CXM) across the enterprise. With Adobe Experience Platform we are becoming mission critical to the Chief Information Officer. We\u2019ve extended our offerings and go-to-market across both B2B and B2C and are expanding our footprint in the mid-market segment. We\u2019re rapidly evolving our CXM product strategy to deliver generational technology platforms, launch innovative new services and introduce enhancements to our market-leading applications. Adobe Experience Platform is the industry\u2019s first purpose-built CXM platform. With real-time customer profiles, continuous intelligence, and an open and extensible architecture, Adobe Experience Platform makes delivering personalized customer experiences at scale a reality. At Adobe, we\u2019ve leveraged our highly successful data-driven operating model, or DDOM, into a transformation playbook for our customers. We\u2019re helping enterprises rearchitect their technology, people and processes to drive business growth. We have a unique and valuable perspective as a company that has used its own technology to transform its business. Our leadership in Customer Experience Management is reflected in the industry recognition we received in Q4, including being named the top leader in Forrester\u2019s Digital Intelligence Platforms Wave report, achieving the best scores across both \u2018Ability to Execute\u2019 and \u2018Completeness of Vision.\u2019 Adobe was named a leader by Gartner and Forrester in the categories of Enterprise Marketing Software Suites, Digital Asset Management and CRM Lead Management. If you\u2019ve watched TV, listened to the radio or read the news this past week, you could not have avoided references to Adobe\u2019s Holiday Shopping predictions report, which leverages Adobe Sensei to identify retail trends and insights from trillions of data points flowing through Adobe Analytics and Adobe Commerce Cloud. Adobe\u2019s data showed that Cyber Monday reached a record $9.4 billion in online sales, and we predict online holiday spending will surpass $140 billion this year. Key Digital Experience transactions in the quarter included Goldman Sachs, Marriott, McDonald\u2019s, and Qualcomm. Interest in the Adobe Experience Platform and our new Real-Time Customer Data Platform is strong and we successfully closed business across key verticals, including financial services, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, telecommunications, and travel and hospitality. Key wins included 3M, Coca-Cola, Synopsys, Tommy Bahama, and Verizon. As a result of the strong Q4, we exceeded 20% subscription bookings growth during FY 2019.  Our performance in FY 2019 was driven by the significant contributions of our global employees. They are Adobe\u2019s greatest asset and we pride ourselves on our progressive and inclusive employee policies. This year, we reaffirmed global pay parity across our workforce, and in September, we became the first company to announce our commitment to opportunity parity, which looks at fairness in internal promotions and horizontal movement. We are proud to once again be included on Fortune\u2019s list of the \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d and one of the \u201cBest Employers for New Grads\u201d by Forbes. We\u2019re pleased to have been recognized by Newsweek as one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Responsible Companies\u201d and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. We were honored to receive the Hope Award from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for our ongoing work to further their mission of keeping every child safe. Adobe\u2019s vision, our compelling strategy, our large and loyal customer base, and our relentless focus on these opportunities position us well for the next decade of growth. Adobe is the clear frontrunner in the categories we serve : creativity, digital documents, and customer experience management. Our best days remain ahead of us and we look forward to a phenomenal 2020. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2019 results. Starting with our annual results, in FY 2019 Adobe achieved record revenue of $11.17 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $6, and non-GAAP EPS was $7.87. This performance is the result of strong execution against our expanding strategy resulting in noteworthy achievements, including: Digital Media segment revenue of $7.71 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth; creative revenue of $6.48 billion, representing 21% year-over-year growth; Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $1.22 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth; exiting the year with $8.4 billion of Digital Media ARR, an annual increase of $1.69 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $3.21 billion, representing 31% year-over-year growth; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $2.67 billion, representing 37% year-over-year growth; Growing Digital Experience subscription bookings by greater than 20%; Generating $4.42 billion in operating cash flow during the year; Growing Remaining Performance Obligation, or RPO, to approximately $9.82 billion; and returning $2.7 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of FY 2019, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.99 billion, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.74 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.29. Business and financial highlights in Q4 included : Digital Media revenue of $2.08 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth; net new Digital Media ARR of $539 million; Digital Experience revenue of $859 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth; record cash flow from operations of $1.38 billion; increasing RPO by more than $1 billion; and repurchasing 2.8 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth in Q4. The addition of $539 million net new Digital Media ARR grew the total to $8.40 billion. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 20% year-over-year and we increased Creative ARR by $445 million in Q4. Driving this performance was continued strength with acquisition, upsell and retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions, as well as the adoption of Creative Cloud services. Key Q4 Creative growth drivers included : new user growth, fueled by demand generation initiatives including targeted campaigns and promotions, an increase in mobile app users, and year-end seasonal strength; end of November strength coming from interest driven by the recent Adobe MAX conference and follow-on targeted campaigns that helped drive record performance during the last week of the quarter; continued strength with single app adoption, particularly with our imaging and video offerings; a strong finish to the year in the enterprise with renewals, upsell and enterprise services adoption; continued momentum with creative services including Adobe Stock, where revenue again grew greater than 30% year-over-year; and Improvements in retention across all our offerings. Adobe Document Cloud revenue growth accelerated once again in Q4. We achieved record Document Cloud revenue of $339 million, which represents 31% year-over-year growth, and we added $94 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. Document Cloud performance during Q4 and the year was driven by : Acrobat subscription demand across all customer segments; The conversion of free mobile app users to paid subscriptions for services such as Create PDF Online; Document Cloud services adoption, including Adobe Sign revenue, which grew greater than 25% year-over-year in Q4; and Year-end strength in perpetual and OEM licensing. In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record quarterly revenue of $859 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth in Q4. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $726 million, growing 31% year-over-year. With strong Q4 bookings, we achieved greater than 20% subscription bookings growth for the year. For the year, we achieved $3.21 billion of Digital Experience revenue, which represents 31% year-over-year growth. Key Q4 highlights include : Strong year-over-year growth in our Content & Commerce solutions, led by Adobe Experience Manager and success with cross-selling and up-selling Magento; Adoption of Adobe Experience Platform, Audience Manager and Real-Time CDP in our Data & Insights solutions; and momentum in our Marketo business, including in the mid-market segment, which helped fuel growth in our Customer Journey Management solutions. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $5.8 million. We had $11.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY 2019, versus $10.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY 2019; thus, the net sequential currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $5 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $39.6 million. The $11.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY 2019 versus the $30.5 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY 2018 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $58.5 million. We experienced strong global demand, but FX reduced reported year-over-year revenue growth, particularly in EMEA. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 11% on both a GAAP basis and a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 49 days in the year-ago quarter, and 44 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation or \u201cRPO\u201d was $9.82 billion exiting Q4, which compares to $8.77 billion exiting Q3. Normal seasonality and strong year-end performance contributed to the more than $1 billion increase in RPO during Q4. Deferred revenue exiting Q4 was $3.50 billion. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $4.18 billion, and cash flow from operations was $1.38 billion in the quarter. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares at a cost of $771 million. During fiscal 2019, we repurchased approximately 9.9 million shares, returning $2.7 billion of cash to stockholders. We currently have $5.1 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018, which goes through 2021. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year and revalue ARR at year-end for current currency rates. FX rate changes between December of 2018 and this year have resulted in a $66 million decrease in Digital Media ARR. This decreases our FY 2020 beginning Digital Media ARR balance to $8.33 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated investor data sheet, and ARR results will be measured against this amount during FY 2020. We are providing the following fiscal year 2020 targets : Total Adobe revenue of approximately $13.15 billion; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.55 billion; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 16%; Digital Experience subscription revenue year-over-year growth of approximately 18%; Digital Experience subscription bookings year-over-year growth of greater than 20%; tax rate of approximately 11% on a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 486 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $7.40; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $9.75. For Q1 FY 2020 we are targeting : Revenue of approximately $3.04 billion; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $360 million; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 15%; net non-operating expense of approximately $20 million; tax rate of approximately 5% on a GAAP basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 489 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.76; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.23. We expect Digital Media net new ARR in FY 2020 to grow sequentially from Q1 to Q2, dip in Q3 and have a strong seasonal finish in Q4. As a reminder, Q1 FY 2019 benefitted from a positive one-time $20 million ARR adjustment due to the adoption of ASC 606. We anticipate total Adobe revenue to grow by approximately 17% year-over-year in the first half of FY 2020, followed by approximately 18% year-over-year growth in the second half of the year. In summary, we finished fiscal 2019 strong with record performance in Q4. Based on our category leadership and strong momentum exiting 2019, we remain bullish about fiscal 2020 and beyond.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Hi, good afternoon. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could take a deeper dive in the continued strength in Digital Media ARR, including the better-than-expected Q1 guide, what's driving this continued outperformance on your side? Shantanu Narayen : Happy to, Brent. I mean, I think at the financial analyst meeting, we tried to outline all of the growth drivers that we have in that business. And as you remember, even at the FA meeting, we actually updated targets as a result of this trend that we were seeing in the quarter. And clearly that strength continued. So, a couple of things that come to mind. New customer acquisition just continues to be strong across all geographies. I think the new product introductions that we were doing. Strength in Acrobat across both our offerings was clearly a strength. We saw a very strong seasonal enterprise at the end of the quarter. The stock business just continues to do well. When you have a $539 million quarter, it's hard to point to one thing, Brent. And I think that, again, we've talked a lot about our DDOM. I'll also highlight the campaigns that we run really targeted personalized campaigns, tapping into was clearly a tremendous online season was also another reason for the continued success. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : And next will be Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question. And really nice quarter. I wanted to ask John a question about operating margins. You guys continue to see a really nice bounce back from the M&A impacts that you saw in \u2013 during FY 2019 into Q4. When we think about FY 2020, should we continue to see that continued operating margin leverage? Is there more sort of accounting impact that's coming out, that will push margins higher? Number one. And number two, for Q1, the EPS guide seems to imply operating margins down from Q4 to Q1. And absent the acquisition, we tend not to see that historically. So, what would lead sort of Q1 operating margins to be lower versus the Q4 levels? John Murphy : Yes, sure. Thanks, Keith. Well, when we think about FY 2020, our full year guide shows that FY 2020 margins do expand year-over-year. And so, as we think about kind of the first half, second half, we'd expect that margins would continue to show greater than 40% each quarter, but have larger margins in the second half like we did this past year. There's some seasonal expenses that obviously hit Q1 different from others in last year, of course, we had more expenses related to the acquisitions that kind of dramatized that downward, taking the operating margin in Q1 of FY 2019. Operator : And our next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Diana Chang : Hi. It's Diana Chang on for Kirk Materne. Thanks for taking my question. First Shantanu, maybe now that you've been running the Experience Cloud for almost a year, what are some of the bigger factors in terms of like seeing this business potentially could outperform in 2020 next year. And maybe secondly, just like when thinking about the Experience Cloud business, can you discuss like how demand varies when you think about like the different geographies. And is it fair to say that the share from like point products or platform is further ahead in the U.S.? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Well, multiple questions there. So, let me try and parse all of that. First, I would say, it's been a really good year for the Experience Cloud in terms of the product innovation, delivering the Experience Cloud, looking at experience manager and moving that to the cloud, innovative new services that we're delivering intelligent services using our AI and machine learning. When I take a step back and look at what's happened during the year, I feel really good about the amount of innovation that's happening. And the second thing I feel really good about is the alignment across Magento, Marketo and just call it, the core DX business in terms of having a more unified and aligned go-to-market, which has not only helped our results, but it's also helped the operating expense associated with that business. And so, we just continue to have a really differentiated offering. The need for people to engage digitally with customers is not just a U.S. phenomenon. It's a global phenomenon. And so that feels really good. And so, I mean, overall, we had a very strong Q4 as we mentioned the Adobe Experience Platform adoption among various verticals. It's such a unique and differentiated product that exists in the marketplace. We're the only company at scale that has the ability to create this unified profile. So overall, I feel really good on that business. We also have tremendous opportunities in 2020. We just continue to scale that business to be delivering it, not just across geographies and the mid-market segment. We talked about how creating an aligned mid-market-focused segment. We saw a rebound as it related to Marketo. Magento continues to do well. And I know, typically, people ask me, what's the update on the hiring front. There's good news that we will hopefully be able to share with you in the first week of January. But it feels good. We made a lot of progress in that business. Opportunity is great, and we will continue to drive innovation. Diana Chang : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : And moving on to Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. I think this is a question for John. I just wanted to drill into the comment you made that the revenue growth in the first half of the year would be 17% versus 18% in the back half, but that's a pretty bold statement to make with six months before you're actually in that 18% growth. So, is that purely a function of the expectation that the strength that you're seeing in Digital Experience booking starts to convert to revenue, and you see that part of the business pick up a bit? Or are there other factors at play that we should be thoughtful about as we think of the shape of the year? Thanks. John Murphy : Yes. I mean, I think what we wanted to try to do because we didn't provide any Q1 guidance when we're at MAX on [our payday]. And so, what we wanted to do was to provide color of how you could think about modeling the full year. And obviously, with the full year guide, you obviously with the total year growth is. But we do expect, obviously, the bookings that we've achieved in FY 2019 to convert into revenue in 2020 and obviously the first half bookings to begin to convert into revenue in the second half. So, the momentum that we're seeing coming out of Q4 is really what we're trying to reflect on when that converts. Shantanu Narayen : Maybe just to add a few more color, Jennifer, I mean, I think when we at the FA meeting, we were really trying to give annual guidance, and what we were trying to do is just give you a little bit of color. And to add to what John said, as you think about the Q4 to Q1 transition, what typically happens in Q4 in the Digital Experience business is, you get a bunch of really good professional services billing as people are preparing our products to get ready for the holiday season, you see a little bit of a rush on the advertising cloud associated with that. There was a little bit of strength also. Acrobat had strength across the board, but there was some additional strength as it related to perpetual and OEM licensing. And so, I think what we were just trying to do is provide you a little bit of color as it related to how you would, in your models, look at both revenue as well as EPS, as well as Digital Media ARR for the rest of the year. So, that was our goal. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question come from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Shantanu, can you remind us what is the monetization model for some of the mobile device apps, specifically thinking about now that Photoshop on iPad has been out there for a while. And at MAX, you talked through Illustrator for iPad. How do you monetize that? And how much of a needle mover can something like Illustrator be to either fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2021. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Sterling, there are multiple ways in which we monetize our mobile. The first is this multi-system approach that we've taken, maybe using a product like Lightroom, for example. I mean, it's clear when people have images, they want to manage their images across multiple devices. And so, we take a system approach towards that pricing, but it changes quite dramatically, what you could see in terms of the engagement and retention associated with it. So, first in terms of value provided, that's quite significant. The second thing is, we actually have mobile-only offerings as well. And so, you could have a mobile-only offering, whether it's Photoshop Express, whether it's what we do with our Photoshop on iPad. And so, we have one price for \u2013 across multiple devices, and where we have one price for mobile-only offering. And the mobile-only offering, I think in the past, we've alluded to the number of ID\u2019s that are being created. And that's also becoming a really nice revenue stream for us and growing. And the third thing I would say is, what we've done a really good job on the Acrobat side is where you have Reader and people have one-time usage, where they're trying to do things with respect to PDF. That's also become a fairly significant monetization model. So, there are multiple monetization models that's attracting new customers, different price points, different segments. And I think it just enables our positioning as the one-stop shop to be very valid and very relevant for all of these customers. So, now long term, we continue to be excited and bullish about the growth there. Sterling Auty : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, it's been just over a year when you introduced the phrase, retention is the new growth. And I was wondering how you would rank that among the various sources of growth in fiscal 2019, particularly given the multiple investments you've been making internally and in people to drive retention. And related to that, picking up on a theme from the latest MAX, might it be possible to think of an additional growth driver that we could call perhaps frictionless is the new growth. In other words, picking up on content-as-a-service, PDF services, DX integrations and the frictionless scheme that you talked about at MAX as an additional driver over many years? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Jay, I think both of those continue to be really important strategic objectives for the company as it relates to retention as the book of business gets larger and larger, both in terms of ensuring that they're getting value for the products, as well as from an upsell perspective and being able to upsell them. And you'd be amazed how productive the retention team has been in terms of really understanding what's the right offer, what's the right way to continue to make sure that they get value out of it. The incredible work that's being done even as it relates to payment methods and just making sure that, that is a way to both attract and retain new customers to the platform. So, retention is a very big area of focus, and I continue to believe that it is an area of growth within the enterprise with named user deployment, what we are doing associated with making it really easy for people to adopt our technology. So that, again, is a way in which we are increasing both the ARPU, as well as the number of users in the enterprise. And so, real good focus with some significant results. On the frictionless, I think you clearly see that customers, when they do a search, and if they want to do a search for create PDF, for example, they want that to be immediately fulfilled and get instant gratification. And so, the reason and the thesis behind frictionless is when people are doing something, how can we, within one or two clicks, enable them to do it as well as, at that point, ensure that it's a monetization opportunity for us. And so, I think that'll continue to be both in the document space, as well as in the creative space as we have done with Spark, where you do a Google search and you want to create a flyer, and we want to be able to fulfill that very easily. So, I think it's important and I think expansion opportunity for us on frictionless. So, we're doing well in both cases, and it will continue to be an area of focus. I know you didn't ask it, but you are aware that even on the API side, making sure that all of our stuff is available as APIs is another way to just extend this reach through the partner ecosystem as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks, Shantanu. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Kash Rangan : Hi, happy holidays team Adobe. Thanks for the wonderful gift. Shantanu, I had a question. We started this fiscal year with expectations for 25% bookings in Digital Experience, and we had a bit of a reset in Q4. Are we at the bottom of the curve and its execution starting to improve? Or execution is back up to the point that you had targeted earlier and that you're just playing a little bit conservative with respect to revenue growth outcome for fiscal 2020? And then once we get through a couple more quarters, you'd be in a position to re-examine the target for Digital Experience. That's it. Congratulations again. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Kash, and happy holidays to you as well. I mean, I would say, we were really pleased with the momentum that we saw for the business in Q4. As I said earlier, I'm also really pleased with the amount of innovation that the product team has been able to do with all of the new delivery. And the opportunity, as we\u2019ve identified north of $80 billion addressable opportunity in 2022, just continues to be the area of focus for us. And so, we will continue to execute. I'm not giving you different targets from the one that John just gave, but we're not opportunity constraint in that particular business. Kash Rangan : Wonderful. Congrats. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : And moving on to Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Yao Tsung Chu : Hi, everyone. This is Yao Tsung Chu on for Brad Zelnick. Congrats on another solid quarter. I want to take a question in slightly different route. As you're going into more mobile-centric offerings with stuff like Photoshop for iPad and Photoshop Camera, you run into a lot more mobile native or next-generation competition, whether it's Instagram or even some new apps like VSCO, it's fundamentally a very different landscape. Can you speak to the philosophy on growth in the mobile realm, how you approach user acquisition, retention and primarily how you see Adobe differentiating for what is a very different use case on a different screen? John Murphy : It's no different in many ways from what we have done on the desktop. I mean, we have the world's best product teams and technologies in that space. And we actually have. I mean, when you see what we've done with Acrobat on PDF on the mobile. What we have done with Photoshop Express, tens of millions of users, the fact that we have hundreds of millions of mobile IDs, I think you think about the brand that Adobe has, you think about the depth of technology that we have in those spaces, I'd encourage you to try out a product like Fresco, which whether it's for oil paint, whether it's for water colors, I mean, there's nothing like that on the market with respect to the amount of precision and detail that we provide in that space. And so, we just have to continue to focus on innovating, but given our brand, given the tremendous funnel of traffic that we see to adobe.com, and as we keep pointing out the data-driven operating model that we have to be able to convert it, I feel very good about what we are doing in the mobile arena as well. Yao Tsung Chu : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Thanks. Shantanu, I'm just wondering, if you look at the Acrobat business adopting the cloud piece, and you sort of compare with the transition from perpetual installed base to subscription installed base. Where are we? Are we in the third inning? Fifth inning? Seventh inning? Any characterization you can give us around where that is. That seems like it's been a pretty strong driver. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Walter, the PDF business just continues to do really well. We're attracting new customers to the platform. Sign as a business is doing really well. The new services, the mobile funnel continues to do well. As you know, we've feathered that business so that we continue to have a perpetual offering and an OEM licensing offering, those continue to do well. I mean, the reality is that automating inefficient paper-based processes and just the whole collaboration, and sharing and editing of documents is a massive opportunity. And PDF has become the lingua franca for how things happen on the Internet and the PDF brand, I mean, going back to the earlier question. The team has done an incredible job of innovating in that particular space, it's really early. As a cricket fan, we don't have three innings in cricket, but it's still very early as it relates to where we are in that space. Operator : And our next question will come from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Tom Roderick : Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I know there's been a couple of questions on Experience Cloud already, but Shantanu, I wanted to just ask you specifically as you spend some time going back through the Marketo pipeline. And last quarter, there was a discussion about mid-market and perhaps having focused more exclusively on the high-end of the market. Can you just kind of go back and talk a little bit more about how you're seeing that mid-market opportunity for Marketo? How you want to deploy resources and how you think about the mix between mid-market and enterprise for that side of the business? It sounds like you had a great fourth quarter that bounced back nicely. So, would love to hear what you did and what you want to do going forward in go to market. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Great, Tom. And I think the reason why we believe in the mid-market opportunity across content management across commerce, across what we are doing with the Marketo business and taking leads all the way to making them revenue for a company is that having an easy-to-use self-serve product serves not just the mid-market customer well, but it also serves the enterprise customer well. And I think tongue-in-cheek I have always said, every business starts at a $0 billion business. And so, you want to make sure that you get a huge base of customers who are growing early. And so, that's the reason for the importance of the business. I think over the last few quarters, the demand generation team has done such a good job. A lot of the mid-market demand generation is actually created through marketing activities and then it's actually \u2013 it has a very different touch perspective. And so, having that, it's actually a more efficient process for us to do. And by investing a little bit more in demand generation in the last few quarters, we've seen that bounce back well. The product has always been good, the best product in the market. And I think just both inspecting that business and making sure that we invest appropriately and have the right leadership, all of that's really helped with that particular space. Having a depth of offering also, given what we have with experience manager and given what we have with Magento for an end-to-end solution, also really helps in that base. So, we're excited about it. Tom Roderick : Outstanding. Congratulations. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Mark for Pat. Thank you so much for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about customer data platform, and maybe what are some customer feedback? And what's your focus for next year? Shantanu Narayen : I'm not sure I heard the question. Could you just repeat the question, please? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about customer data platform, CDP, and what are some customer feedback from there? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I mean, as part of our prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that the Adobe Experience Platform is really the only scalable platform that allows people to have this unified profile. As people are thinking about what they have to do, they have to deal with both known users and unknown users. And I think the combination of what we had with audience manager and the real-time CDP aspects of how we differentiate our solution makes it unique. And so, every business has to think about its core segmentation. Every business has to think about what's the way in which they are creating this unified profile. And so, we're excited about our offering in that space. That's a clear leader. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : And our next question comes from James Rutherford with Stephens. James Rutherford : Hi, thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Just as a follow-up to Tom's question earlier, it sounds like you're having nice success with the mid-market realignment on Marketo and Magento, and that's great to see. I was just curious what your ambitions are to bring some of the other core Adobe DX solutions like AEM, Campaign, Audience Manager and others down into the mid-market as well. And what it might require in terms of changes to product or packaging to really make a big debt in that particular size of the market? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I'll touch on one, maybe in a little bit of detail, which is the Adobe Experience Manager. We have, over the last year, really innovated. We have an offering that's a completely cloud-based offering that enables you to do it. You can do headless content management. It's so far ahead of the competition. So, I think that hopefully gives you a glimpse into the fact that we do believe it's an opportunity as we move to the cloud and make these all SaaS-based services, I think making that self-help. In the content management space, in particular, as people are creating these micro sites, and they want to get it up and running quickly, but they want to use the same publishing paradigm that they use for their larger sites. That's another reason, but the new AEM product that we have that's cloud-based. The number of customers who've been able to get up and running really quickly, I think, shows the kind of innovation. Take Adobe itself, for example, as we move our cloud-based AEM implementation, it really adds significant value. And as I said earlier, it's not just about the mid-market, that same technology actually translates well into enterprises seeing value from our products sooner rather than later. Mike Saviage : Justin, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : And that question will come from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Ken Wong : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. This question is for you, John. I know you guys don't discuss RPO much, but the uptick in Q4 was really strong. Maybe if you can give us a little insight into what drove that? And then to the extent that you could shed a little color on maybe what seasonality of RPO might look like next year, that would be great? John Murphy : Yes, sure. The performance of RPO, and as we go forward, you'll start to get the year-over-year compare in FY 2020, it's following along with revenue growth. And it's \u2013 essentially, when we look at before, deferred and unbilled that also as an indicator of the health of the business going forward. Now, we would suggest you look at the RPO as an indicator of what to expect in terms of it growing along with revenue. That has normal seasonality that we typically have seen across each of the quarters as well, so there's nothing unique about that. Shantanu Narayen : And given that was the last question, what's exciting to us was at our Analyst Day at MAX, we shared the strategy on the three large opportunities that we had ahead of us; unleashing creativity, accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses and how it represented a TAM of approximately $128 billion in 2022. It's nice to be the leader in those categories and continue to drive product innovation, as well as GTM alignment and execution, so that we can continue on this growth agenda that we have as a company, but at the same time, we also continue to be focused on increasing cash flow, as well as delivering great value to our shareholders.  Clearly, pleased with our fiscal performance in Q4. FY 2020 should be another record year with strong profitability and cash flow. And I'm really excited about the progress that we made across all three clouds on product, GTM, as well as organizational alignment, and we look forward to sharing that progress with you over the course of next year. I wanted to wish you all happy holidays. Thank you for joining us today. Mike Saviage : And this concludes our call. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days and is the property of Adobe. The call audio and the webcast archive may not be rerecorded or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. We delivered another record quarter in Q1, achieving $3.09 billion in revenue representing 19% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.96 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.27. Our strategy of unleashing creativity for all, accelerating document productivity, and powering digital businesses continues to drive strong top and bottomline performance. Adobe\u2019s unique advantage of enabling everyone from students to creative professionals to small businesses and large enterprises, to create and deliver exceptional digital experiences is enabling our customers\u2019 success and fueling our business momentum. With Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud, we are growing across all geographies and industries and appealing to a broader set of customers than ever before. In our Digital Media business, we achieved record revenue in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q1. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR was $400 million and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q1 grew to $8.73 billion. Q1 Creative revenue was $1.82 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. The desire to create rich and expressive experiences is universal. Adobe is giving everyone, including newer customer segments like business communicators and social media creators the inspiration and tools to tell their story. We are proud of the impact our flagship digital imaging solutions have had in shaping culture and creative expression. This year, Photoshop turns 30 years old. Photoshop has helped push the limits of creativity across a broad range of creative disciplines from photography to graphic design. It is truly the heart of the creative world, and we continue to develop a steady stream of innovative new Photoshop capabilities and applications across surfaces. Demand for our mobile applications like Photoshop on iPad, Lightroom, and Photoshop Express continues to grow. With more than 35 million new Adobe IDs in Q1, mobile is proving to be a strong pipeline for paid mobile only, as well as desktop subscriptions. Film has always had the incredible power to connect us through compelling stories, and Adobe continues to be the leader in video production software. At the recent Sundance Film Festival, more than 80% of the films created used Creative Cloud. Now more than ever, we believe every voice needs to be heard. As part of our efforts to empower diverse voices and support the next-generation of film makers, Adobe launched the inaugural Women at Sundance Adobe Fellowship and renewed our commitment to the Sundance Ignite program, which supports young film makers. This quarter, Adobe Character Animator took home an Emmy for breaking new ground in television animation. This recognition reflects our continued ability to create innovative applications and establish new categories. Adobe Spark, our easy-to-use application for creating social graphics, videos, and web pages, is now a top destination for hundreds of basic creative tasks. We are seeing great momentum with Spark, with organic search alone contributing more than 1 million new registered users per quarter. Business communicators and social marketers are increasingly turning to Spark to help them engage with their audiences in compelling ways. Creativity is a fundamental skill in the digital age and we remain committed to building STEAM skills for the next generation. We recently announced a one-of-a-kind partnership with Teach for America to provide educator training, workshops and tools to put creativity front-and-center in the classroom. Together, in this first phase, our goal is to reach 15,000 teachers and 500,000 students in the U.S. who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access to creative tools or programs. Our efforts to improve digital literacy extend across the globe. While visiting India recently, I had the opportunity to meet with students who were finalists in an Adobe creativity competition. In conjunction with the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s birth, students from 20,000 schools were encouraged to depict how Gandhi\u2019s values can help our modern world prosper. I was inspired and moved by students\u2019 messages of humanity and the brilliant ways they chose to tell their stories using Creative Cloud. With Adobe Document Cloud, we are accelerating document productivity, modernizing how people work with documents across all devices. Document Cloud revenue in Q1 was $351 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $1.15 billion. This momentum is being driven by strong customer acquisition and the expanding portfolio of PDF mobile and web applications. Key wins in the quarter included Equifax, Gannett, Shell, and Cummins. Acrobat continues to be the gold standard for creating, editing, scanning, signing, and sharing digital documents. As more people are working on the go, our mobile app usage continues to rise. More than 600 million people have installed Acrobat on their mobile devices. As digital transformation continues at organizations across the globe, Adobe Sign continues to power paper to digital work flows across all industries, including the majority of Fortune 100 companies. This quarter, we extended the reach of Adobe Sign with an enhanced integration with SharePoint that enables people to easily create and sign digital forms. We recently launched the ability to convert to and from PDF via one-click access on the web, providing a seamless on-ramp to PDF services and an Acrobat subscription. We are providing PDF functionality through APIs and expanding integrations with partners. Our recent integration with Google Drive gives its more than 1 billion users instant access to Acrobat\u2019s best-in-class tools to create, view, annotate, modify, and share PDFs without leaving Google Drive. In our Digital Experience business, we achieved revenue of $858 million in Q1, which represents 15% year-over-year growth. Now, more than ever, every business across B2C and B2B, and mid-market to enterprise must be a digital business, driving opportunity for Adobe Experience Cloud. The industry\u2019s most comprehensive offering, Adobe Experience Cloud features innovative applications and services built on the Adobe Experience Platform and leveraging Adobe Sensei\u2019s AI and machine learning framework. Key wins this quarter included Intuit, PayPal, Bank of America, CommonSpirit Health, Travelzoo, State of Oklahoma, Kohl\u2019s, National Instruments, Toyota Motor, and Accenture. Only Adobe has data from trillions of transactions, tens of millions of products and thousands of retailers which gives us the unique ability to assess the global digital economy in real-time. Building on the success of our annual Holiday Shopping report, we are developing an economic index to help companies get a better understanding of local and global trends, so they can anticipate changes and manage their businesses effectively in this dynamic market. A great experience starts with compelling content and is informed by data and insights. Harnessing the power of Adobe Experience Platform to stitch together siloed data across the enterprise, our recently released Customer Journey Analytics service gives our customers a set of analytics tools that provides a complete picture of the customer journey, online and offline. We are continuing to drive strong performance with Adobe Experience Manager for omnichannel content delivery. This quarter, we launched Adobe Experience Manager as a cloud service enabling brands to go live with personalized campaigns and experiences across any channel, device or mobile app in days instead of months. It provides agility and flexibility for enterprises and mid-sized companies with brands like Under Armour, Coca-Cola and Morningstar becoming early customers. Adobe Commerce Cloud enables our customers to make every moment personal and every experience shoppable. With new functionality that enables merchants to natively add high-quality media assets to their websites and create personalized recommendations, we drove more than 50% year-over-year bookings growth. For the third consecutive year, our industry leadership was validated in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms and achieved the strongest position in Completeness of Vision. The Digital Experience opportunity is immense, our roadmap is robust and we are excited to have Anil Chakravarthy lead this business. Anil brings a powerful combination of business and product leadership, and his impact is already being felt. We are proud to have created a unique employee culture that embraces diversity and inclusion, and supports the communities in which we live and work. This commitment has made Adobe one of Fortune\u2019s 100 Best Companies for the past 20 years. This quarter, we were honored for our sustainability efforts on the CDP A List for climate change for the fourth consecutive year and we were included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, recognizing our transparency in gender reporting and advancing women\u2019s equality in the workplace. While Q1 was a typically strong quarter, I know what\u2019s top-of-mind for all of us is navigating the impact of COVID-19. The well-being of our employees and customers is our number one priority. In addition to encouraging employees in impacted regions to work from home for the next two weeks, we are restricting travel and canceling in-person events. In keeping with that strategy, we made the tough decision to cancel the in-person Adobe Summit in Las Vegas and replace it with a digital event at the end of the month. We are proactively engaging digitally with our current customers to support their businesses and continuing to drive enterprise pipeline globally. We are fortunate that the company\u2019s revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our move to a subscription-based business model. We have seen little to no impact on adobe.com for Creative Cloud and Document Cloud demand thus far, and we will continue to acquire and engage customers digitally. In my conversations with business leaders across the globe, it is evident that investments in digital will continue to be critical, but dealing with the implications of COVID-19 is the immediate priority. As a result, we expect some enterprises will delay bookings, postpone services implementation and reduce expenses. We will be using Adobe digital solutions to mitigate impact and to engage with our customers. While the situation is concerning and there\u2019s tremendous uncertainty, the long-term fundamentals of our business remain undiminished. Adobe is at the center of three massive market opportunities across creativity, digital documents, and customer experience management, which will fuel growth in the near- and long-term. Businesses must transform to deliver a personalized digital relationship with every customer. The paper-to-digital revolution continues. Creativity and design have never been more relevant. We will continue to lead in these categories and manage the company for the long run, while we navigate through this environment. At times like this, the best companies like Adobe continue to innovate, drive increased focus and emerge stronger than ever before. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. In the first quarter of FY\u201920, Adobe achieved record revenue of $3.09 billion, which represents 19% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.96 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.27. Our earnings per share results include a charge related to the cancellation of corporate events including Adobe Summit due to the COVID-19 situation, which lowered both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by $0.07 in the quarter. Business and financial highlights in Q1 included Digital Media revenue of $2.17 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $400 million, a record for Q1, Digital Experience revenue of $858 million, generating strong cash flow from operations of $1.32 billion, growing Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO to $9.91 billion and repurchasing 2.4 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 22% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. The addition of $400 million net new Digital Media ARR grew the total exiting the quarter to $8.73 billion. Creative revenue grew 22% year-over-year and we increased Creative ARR by $329 million. Q1 Creative growth driver included strong new user growth starting early in the quarter with Cyber Monday followed by continued customer acquisition throughout the quarter. Single app adoption as we target new users who are more inclined to adopt Creative Cloud through the use of a specialized application such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere and Acrobat. Mobile app subscriptions including adoption of Photoshop on the iPad, continued momentum with creative services including Adobe Stock, where revenue again grew by 30% year-over-year and continued focus on engagement and retention. Strong Adobe Document Cloud revenue growth continued in Q1. We achieved record Document Cloud revenue of $351 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth and we added $71 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. Document Cloud performance during Q1 was driven by consumer adoption of mobile apps, PDF services and Acrobat subscriptions, conversion of free mobile app users to paid subscriptions for services such as Create PDF Online, strong performance with enterprise customers including new logos and renewals and Document Cloud services adoption including continued momentum with Adobe Sign revenue which grew greater than 20% year-over-year in Q1. In Digital Media, the COVID-19 situation did not impact our overall business on adobe.com in Q1. However, we did experience weakness in China, which is primarily a channel-based reseller market.  In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved quarterly revenue of $858 million, which represents 15% year-over-year growth in Q1. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $739 million, growing 21% year-over-year and we grew our Digital Experience bookings by greater than 20% year-over-year. Q1 Digital Experience highlights include success with our Content and Commerce solutions, where we drove notable adoption of Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Commerce Cloud. During the quarter, we continued to focus on closing Adobe Experience Platform opportunities while growing the pipeline. Our strategy and value proposition continued to resonate with customers who wish to increase their digital engagement with their customers. In Digital Experience, the impact of the COVID-19 situation in Q1 was some unanticipated deal slippage during the last 10 days of the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $1 million. We had $7 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY\u201920 versus $12 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY\u201919, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $4 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $27 million, with $7 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY\u201920 versus the $9 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY\u201919 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $29 million. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q1 was minus 4% on a GAAP basis and 10% on a non-GAAP basis. Both rates were lower than targeted due to a larger than expected deduction associated with the vesting of stock-based compensation. The reduction of the quarterly tax rate benefited GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by $0.17 and $0.03, respectively, in the quarter. Our trade DSO was 41 days, which compares to 46 days in the year ago quarter and 47 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO grew by 22% year-over-year to $9.91 billion exiting Q1, which compares to $9.82 billion exiting Q4. The sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was consistent with normal seasonality. Deferred revenue exiting Q1 was $3.61 billion. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.17 billion and cash flow from operations was $1.32 billion in the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares at a cost of $795 million. We currently have $4.25 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority, which goes through 2021. Turning to our financial targets, I would like to review two areas as you think about modeling the rest of our fiscal year. First, our Q1 tax rates came in lower than planned as I discussed earlier and we now anticipate both our GAAP and non-GAAP rates to be lower than we originally targeted for the full year. We continue to focus on managing costs and optimizing Adobe\u2019s international structure to deliver more value to our customers and investors. We anticipate making changes to our international structure during Q2 and Q4 this year that will better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates, while allowing us to remain tax efficient.  We now anticipate our GAAP quarterly tax rates to be minus 10%, 10% and minus 85% in Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. The changes to our international structure do not impact our non-GAAP tax rates and we expect our non-GAAP quarterly tax rate to be 10% in Q2, Q3 and Q4. The second area is the consideration of business impact we could see because of COVID-19. We have factored into our Q2 targets the expected impact of the global uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 situation as we understand it to date. While our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, we do expect to be impacted in the following areas, enterprises deferring bookings decisions, delaying consulting services implementations and reducing marketing spend, consumers reducing spending in countries more adversely impacted by the COVID-19 situation, and software license revenue driven by channel partners. These impacts are expected to be more prominent in countries and industries most affected by the crisis. In Q2 FY\u201920, we are targeting revenue of approximately $3.175 billion, Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $385 million, Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 12%, net non-operating expense of approximately $14 million, tax rate of approximately minus 10% on a GAAP basis and 10% on a non-GAAP basis, share count of approximately 486 million shares, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.10 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.35. In summary, we continue to believe we are well-positioned as a market leader in large growing categories. The benefits of running a real-time business and the high percentage of our revenue that is recurring enables us to monitor and take action in how we drive revenue or control costs, all of which should enable us to deliver solid results as the world navigates the COVID-19 situation. Finally, I want to share with you the news that Mike Saviage has decided to retire from Adobe later this year. As the Head of Investor Relations, Mike has been an important champion of Adobe\u2019s growth and transformation story over the past three decades. We will be appointing an internal replacement and Mike will be on board for the next few months to help us transition the new leader. I want to thank Mike for his many contributions to Adobe and wish him well on his retirement. I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike Saviage : Thanks, John, and thank you for those comments. As we announced last week, we have shifted Adobe Summit, our Annual Digital Experience user conference, to be an online event and virtual conference starting on Tuesday, March 31st. As the event draws closer, we will provide instructions on the summit.adobe.com website for how to access online keynote presentations and educational sessions along with the timing of them. If you wish to listen to a playback of today\u2019s conference call, a webcast archive of the call will be available on our IR site later today. Alternatively, can you listen to a phone replay by calling 888-203-1112, use conference ID number 4347041. International callers should dial 719-457-0820. The phone playback service will be available beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today and ending at 5 p.m. Pacific Time on March 19, 2020. We will now be happy to take your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thanks. Good afternoon, Mike. Congrats on three decades. I am very happy for you. Shantanu, just on the Creative business, there are many questions around obviously no one knows how long the current situation is going to last, but many are kind of asking how insulated you believe the Creative business is. The guidance for this next quarter was encouraging and probably a little bit better than most thought. So if you could just walk through how you are thinking about that business over the next several quarters? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Brent. Clearly, I think, let me start out by saying that, we would all acknowledge that the situation is pretty unprecedented. And so, as it relates to the Creative business, maybe I will give you color not just for Q1, but also actually for the first few days of March and I will talk about that in the context of the customers that we serve. And maybe again, as sort of a preview to what John talked about, let me just tell you a little bit about the options that we considered. I mean, clearly, given the situation we could have sort of chosen to give no forward-looking guidance, we could have provided a range given the uncertainty or what we thought was most appropriate was given we have fairly good visibility on a direct basis, to guide based on a number and then provide more color. On Creative Cloud specifically, Brent, and on Document Cloud, in the direct-to-consumer on adobe.com, we saw actually little to no impact on Q1 on adobe.com across all geographies for both Creative and Document Cloud products; and thus far, it\u2019s early in Q2, the overall traffic and conversion pattern have actually continued. In China, where we have a little bit more of an indirect route to market for CC and DC, which is through resellers, we know that the business is small but we saw some impact in Q1, and as you saw, despite that, we had pretty awesome overall ARR for Digital Media in Q1. In South Korea, we have actually seen relatively stable business in our Digital Media business today. In Italy, what we saw was that as the situation worsened, we saw some impact in the reseller business, but we actually appear to have seen some additional strength on adobe.com, and the fact that I guess, we have multiple routes to market there sort of helps ameliorate that. So, I mean, in sort of conclusion, we are continuing to monitor. We think that clearly long-term the Creative Expression business continues to be really strong. And specifically as it relates to Q2, absent the COVID situation, we would have probably again had sequential increase to Digital Media ARR where we\u2019re trying to factor what we have seen a little bit of the uncertainty in the reseller impact and enterprise. And even in revenue, we have a little perpetual revenue. So, I know that was a little bit of a long answer, but hopefully that gives color in terms of all of the work that\u2019s gone in over the last 10 days. We have already done a couple of business reviews, and this is as of what we know today, while there\u2019s uncertainty, that\u2019s our best estimate of how we think this plays out in Q2. Brent Thill : Thanks for all the color. Operator : We will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Mike, it\u2019s been great working with you. You are way too young to be retiring, but that\u2019s your business. Shantanu, thank you so much for kind of giving that detail on how you guys are thinking about the outlook, I think, it definitely helps investors understand how you are thinking about it and that you are imparting some conservatism into the guidance for kind of what\u2019s going on out there. I was hoping to get some view from John on how you guys are thinking about the expense side of the equation? How aggressively that you will sort of look to match sort of the expense growth rates, is that kind of what you are seeing in the environment. Is there -- are you going to be looking to kind of protect the margins and protect the contribution margins in the business as the demand fluctuates? John Murphy : Sure. Thanks, Keith. As we think about our ability to understand our business, we have got a great ability through our DDOM model our data driven operating model to understand how we can actually drive growth, while still expanding margins and protecting the profitability of the company. And that thesis hasn\u2019t changed. We are still a growth company and we do focus on the profitability of the company. So, we are able to shift our expenses and our spending and our investments to appropriately capture the opportunity, but at the same time be able to hit our goals of expanding operating margin as we set out at Analyst Day this year. Shantanu Narayen : And Keith, maybe I will add a couple more things, I mean, I think, we have always done a good job of balancing the topline and bottomline. I have no doubt that companies like Adobe actually will emerge stronger as a result of this. And what John has already instituted is we are looking at every expense associated with it. There\u2019s certainly some areas where we have great online solutions to help our customers, where we will be investing more and there are other areas where we will be far more prudent as it relates to what happens. And maybe, John, you can also specifically comment on what happened in Q1 as it relates to that one-time charge just so that everybody understands that? John Murphy : Yeah. So when we decided to cancel the in-person corporate events that caused us to pull in the expenses into Q1. So we made that decision before we finished Q1. So we took that charge. Its $40 million associated with that. The -- typically much of that expense would be in Q2 and would be offset actually by revenue we would get through registration fees for participants, as well as sponsorship dollars as well. So the way we have approached it is obviously the sponsors, the participants, we will not be taking that money in, so we pulled all that expense forward. So that one-time charge that you had in Q1 associated with this, all this activity was obviously a significant impact. Our margin would have been 41.6% otherwise had we not had to take that charge. Keith Weiss : Super helpful. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much for all the details, Shantanu. You talked about how things finished up in the February quarter. I am more curious about your guidance for the May quarter. What are the assumptions especially as it relates to the geography that we are all most concerned about that could potentially worsen from a COVID perspective. What kind of growth rates and what kind of U-shaped or V-shaped recovery are you assuming for your two businesses in the U.S? Thank you so much and stay safe everybody. Shantanu Narayen : Well, Kash, I think, we would all agree that the situation is rapidly evolving. I was interesting just even watching after the 1 o\u2019clock the six or seven announcements that went out. And so, clearly, we are trying to give you the best color that we have as of today and not sure that I can predict or anybody can actually predict what happens. But, I think, we gave you color in Digital Media, which is we continue to expect to see the notion of both creativity and accelerating document productivity, and where there\u2019s a direct engagement with customers, to continue to invest in engaging with them digitally and continuing to drive our business, because there is clear value associated with that. I think maybe just similarly, I can give you a little color on the Enterprise. I mean, as you know, with Enterprise selling, the end of the quarter represents a fairly large chunk of business for most people. And while that does not have impact on revenue and you never expect to close your entire pipeline, I think, as we said in the prepared remarks as well, Kash, we saw some unanticipated slippage at the end of the quarter. And so the way we have tried to think about it for Q2, I have had a ton of conversations from CEOs across all industries, and I think, the two themes that are absolutely consistent, the first theme is everybody is first and foremost making sure that they take care of the well-being of their employees. They are all dealing with travel restrictions. They are all dealing with the outbreak. The second thing that they all tell me is that, hey, this if anything will accentuate the need to engage digitally not just internal to the corporation to keep the corporation going, but externally, in order to engage with customers. But given what\u2019s happening with travel, we just expect that there is going to be some delays associated with it, we have tried to factor that in. And the way I would describe that is absent any COVID, we would have certainly seen Digital Experience being targeted higher than what we targeted. So I think we have tried to factor it in. And maybe just a little bit more color on that, Kash, when you look at the revenue components for our business, there are three components. There\u2019s the revenue that comes off of bookings, bookings translating into revenue. There\u2019s usage based Advertising Cloud revenue that goes into that. And there\u2019s delivery based revenue when services are delivered and implemented. We suspect that the services will go out a little bit. The importance remains, but as people are concerned about people traveling that will perhaps slow down a little bit and depending on the industry or vertical, that will be different. Some of it may be more immediate in terms of the bounce back some of it may be a little bit more detailed.  And so what we know is that we expect bookings will probably take a little longer. We think services delivery may go a little bit longer. We feel like the Advertising Cloud might be impacted. Those are all factored into how we thought about it. If the world falls apart, that could certainly change. But we will continue to monitor it. What I have not heard from anybody is any issue associated with keeping digital front and center, because, I think, this demonstrates more than ever before if you can\u2019t engage with your customers digitally, you are dead in the water. So hopefully that helps. Kash Rangan : Absolutely. Thank you so much. Operator : We will take our next question from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. So, Shantanu, I am just curious if anything with COVID-19 would actually impact any new product introductions in terms of feature functionality or any changes that maybe you would have considered in the near-term around pricing in any of the geographies? Shantanu Narayen : Sterling, not to the best, I mean, we are excited. We will be doing our first digital summit. So Anil Chakravarthy is busy. I mean all the exciting things that we were going to announce in person. The plan is to announce it actually virtually coming up, a couple of exciting things there. I mean, the Adobe Experience Manager that we just introduced, which is a cloud based approach, that\u2019s significantly, again, I think, as we said reduces the time for people to do to through self-serve and get new websites, and campaigns up and running. So on the Experience side, it was really going to be an event where we describe everything that\u2019s on. Now with the Creative Cloud space as well, I mean, I think, if there\u2019s one group that works more from home and has more flexible work policy, it tends to be the product team. So, I think, overall navigating what it means for nobody to be in offices, Sterling. But I think we are actually as well placed as anybody in terms of doing it. The one other thing I will mention is, we are actually for universities, given how much universities closure that there is. We are making available our creative and other tools available for people for this online training. And so, I think, while the situation is crazy, I think, there are a whole bunch of our solutions, whether it\u2019s all the documents that are going to be shared right now, what\u2019s going to happen with signatures, whether what you are going to do with respect to helping people engage digitally. So nothing yet that\u2019s changed. It all depends on how long the situation continues from my perspective, Sterling. Sterling Auty : And Mike, congratulations, it\u2019s been one hell of a run. You have done a great job as IR. So congratulations and enjoy your retirement. Mike Saviage : Thanks, Sterling. Operator : We will take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here and I echo my congrats to you as well, Mike, on your retirement. Shantanu, maybe for you, just thinking a little higher level, can you just talk a little bit about bringing on Anil Chakravarthy on to the team and maybe what some of his longer term goals are in the Digital Experience business? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Saket, I mean, I think, we are clearly the undisputed leader and have the most comprehensive offering as it relates to and we created the digital marketing category. I think as we focused on what we call as generational technology platform development. We recognized that the ability to create this unified profile and to really make sure that your first party data, you are taking more advantage of it, were two massive opportunities that every enterprise was going to have to figure out how to take advantage of, much like Adobe did with our DDOM. Anil\u2019s background as it relates to what he had done both at Informatica and prior to that and the fact that as CEO he had the ability to look across the entire business. Both of those are going to be extremely important for us as we continue to invest in product and as we continue to focus on ensuring that the CIO and the people who engage with data, which is an area that he is completely familiar with are ones that we continue to invest in and differentiate our solution. It\u2019s early. As I said, his presence is already being felt. But what he has been really up to is going and meeting with a number of customers. I may have to ground him for a little while right now, but he also actually had the ability to go meet with all the product people. So I think both on the product and the customer stuff, just continuing to make sure that we extend our lead and have a unified leader. Those were really the two reasons for having him on-board. Saket Kalia : Great. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. A shorter-term question, Shantanu and for you, John, as well, I noticed that you had a small sequential decrease from Q4 [Audio Gap] Shantanu Narayen : \u2026 opportunity, we have tailwinds, we have growth in three areas. I think what you saw was really concerted effort again by John to rationalize as we had done these M&A\u2019s and to make sure that we are not duplicating functions. And so, I think, as part of every annual planning process, we first prune to make sure that we are investing in the right areas, and I think, we did a really good job of looking at that. So for somebody like you who follows us and sees that sort of ebb and flow, it\u2019s just a continuous process that we do. We have opportunities. I mean, we are going to continue I think again based on the question that I think Keith asked. We will be prudent about how we look at this stuff. But even if you look at our targets for Q2, I think, you will see that we are one of the companies that\u2019s best positioned in the entire industry opportunities and we are going to continue to hire, but we will be prudent and we will continue to monitor this. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks, Shantanu. Operator : We will take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Yeah. Thanks very much. And I guess at the outset, I\u2019d say, thanks very much for the guidance with COVID and I realize things are moving quickly, but even just the color you have given today I think will help us think through this as it continues to evolve. My question, Shantanu, would be on the Experience Cloud, obviously, a year later, I think, you have integrated the acquisitions, if you weren\u2019t talking about COVID right now. How is your feeling about just sort of the integration of the product and the setup for that business as we head into calendar 2020? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. I think, Kirk, what we would have said absent COVID was good Q1, greater than 20% increase in the book of business, revenue growing nicely, highlighting the progress that we would have made. I think I shared a number of customers we have had the Experience Platform customers go live. I would have talked about cloud AEM. I think we touched on Adobe Commerce and that\u2019s only because I wouldn\u2019t have had time to talk about what we are doing with B2B and B2C. How we have integrated Marketo into that. And so, I think, that fundamental customer demand for digital and for engagement, nothing changes. And so that\u2019s what I would have said if it weren\u2019t for this situation with Q1. In effect, what John and I would have been here, talking about record performance in Q1, continued momentum from Q4, robust cash flows, strong EPS performance, and I think, all of you guys would have been saying why aren\u2019t you raising targets if it weren\u2019t for COVID and so, I think, I continue to feel good about the long-term opportunity. Kirk Materne : That\u2019s great. Thanks. And Mike, congrats on your retirement. Mike Saviage : Thanks, Kirk. Operator : We will take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much, and Mike, I got to echo my congrats. I always thought maybe I would be able to retire before you but not with how the markets have been performing over the last few weeks, for sure. I think I am going to be working a long time. But anyway, Shantanu, thank you so much for all the color you provided on Digital Media so far, but just want to understand its resiliency. Because realistically, if we think about your end markets it includes a lot of small businesses and hobbyists, where there may be more stress or not thought of as much as top of wallet item? Are you may be able to share what that represents as the percentage of the overall ARR, even ballpark if you can? And what are the leading indicators are that you see through your DDOM to be able to see things like engagement, renewal rates, maybe even by SKU as it relates to this segment of the market? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : You are right, Brad, in that the real blessing of that business is how broad and how diverse it is and how our tools, whether they be on the creative side or whether they be on the document side are as pervasive and market leaders as they are. We tried to give the color even during this current situation and the impact, and as we said on adobe.com, there\u2019s been little to no impact. We have become really good at how we engage with these customers. And the thing that also gives us long-term confidence in that, Brad, is the different price points. And so you have to think about it with respect to the different price points that we have and we have got really good at understanding where the mobile offerings need to be. With all these people being at home, they will have to do some things and hopefully expressing their creativity we just have to continue to help them do that. And so, yeah, we are not saying that we are completely going to be unimpacted, but so far and just looking at what we have seen thus far, these tools and creativity and the importance of design, nothing that\u2019s happened in the last few weeks diminishes the importance of that. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much, Shantanu and be healthy everyone. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Brad. Operator : We will take our next question from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please go ahead. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you and I would like to echo the congrats to Mike on a well deserved retirement after a pretty impressive run. So just looking at the slipped deals that were discussed in the call, obviously, it\u2019s sort of unprecedented times and there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces there. But is there any sort of commonality to the deals that seemed to slip in terms of size, whether those were new versus up-sell transactions, whether they were sort of just logistical issues that cropped up? I am just trying to get a better sense of where it\u2019s just tougher to get business done at this point? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : There weren\u2019t really any patterns, Jennifer. I mean, I think, there was a couple of -- if people were at home and you expect that to have people in the office to close. So just some examples of in certain countries where people were maybe not at work, I mean, you followed Enterprise Software for a long time. There are a number of stakeholders that are required. We do use Adobe Signature to close them. But I would say, it\u2019s what little bit more of just getting the stakeholders involved. And I would actually attribute it to a large degree to the preoccupation correctly of dealing with employees and employees\u2019 well-being. I am sure this is true of your company as well. Everybody\u2019s just dealing with are employees safe, how do we make sure, all of that. So I would attribute it more to that, and we will just have to continue to monitor what happens. But the conversations that I am having and we are so -- one of the things we are doing is actually proactively reaching out to every single customer of what is the right way to engage with them digitally in terms of saying, here\u2019s how we can help. I think all of you are probably seeing more communication. I should acknowledge that a number of the deals that slipped actually did close in the time that was past it, but it\u2019s uncertain times. So hopefully that gives you some color into what we were observing. Jennifer Lowe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will hear next from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. Two questions, one, just on Sign, you talked pretty positively about this business for a number of quarters. I am wondering if you could update us on what is the strongest demand drivers there, are they kind of direct deals out selling as part of larger engagements or is it more transactional attached to Acrobat and especially the mid-market low end? Shantanu Narayen : I think, Walter, it\u2019s actually all across the map. We had a good quarter as it related to Sign revenue. And make no mistake, the Reader distribution and wanting to do stuff with PDF and work flows associated with PDF, that\u2019s a big part of that business. We have talked about how we are going to make those APIs available as well so that people can embed it. We talked a little about the integration with Google, but it\u2019s all across. I mean, as an ingredient service or as we talk about it, Sign is certainly part of the solution across all those segments. As a complete offering with respect to what we have with PDF across Acrobat and in the enterprise and with Adobe Experience Manager. But it really is across the board. And I think you are going to see more demand for those services right now because physical signatures are going to be less easy to manage than electronic signatures. Walter Pritchard : Got it. And then just John, I am not sure if you are breaking this out but I guess we are getting this question quite a bit. On the DX business with the transactional piece where you broke out those three pieces, any way to give us, let us know if that\u2019s the smallest of the piece or any range in terms of revenue exposure from transactional in DX would be helpful? John Murphy : Yeah. No. If you go back to the Analyst Meeting, we broke out each of those three components for you. And so you can see that it\u2019s actually roughly 20% of the business, 20%, 25% of the total DX business in terms of Ad Cloud and Professional Services piece. Walter Pritchard : Okay. That hasn\u2019t changed? John Murphy : No. Walter Pritchard : Okay. Thank you very much. Mike Saviage : Operator, we are coming up on the top of the hour. We will take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. We will take our last question from Keith Bachman with BMO. Please go ahead. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you very much. Shantanu, I just wanted to revisit a little bit on the Experience revenue. You are guiding the current quarter, the second quarter rather to 12% year-over-year growth. Back in December, you talked about the growth potential for 2020 being plus or minus 16%. How should we think about the rest of the year in the Digital Experience segment, given macro\u2019s really tough and the COVID virus is making it challenging, but also including any kind of competitive comments that you want to make surrounding it? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. I think, what we see, frankly, right now is the color associated with what\u2019s happening in Q2. As you know, in December we provide targets based on the product roadmap. And from my perspective, Q1 execution and performance was terrific. And while we are giving you as much color as we know for Q2 as of today, given the unprecedented times, we are really not going to comment on the second half. We will continue to monitor. None of this changes long-term trends and so that\u2019s how we think about it. John Murphy : And maybe I could just add in there, because we did give a lot of in the prepared remarks about updating tax rates for the year because of the fluctuation. And I know in terms of modeling the folks have been asking what do we think about beyond FY\u201920 and so as we I said at the Analyst Meeting we expected an increase in FY\u201921. And so based on these changes that I had highlighted in my prepared remarks on the tax rates, you can kind of expect FY\u201921 to be roughly a 17% non-GAAP rate, 19% on a GAAP basis. Shantanu Narayen : And since that was the last question, let me also echo, I think, all of your sentiments, which is thank Mike for his outstanding contributions to Adobe. I have certainly observed firsthand his passion for the business and his IR leadership has been invaluable to me as a partner as we have transformed the company. I told him that we have been doing this call together since 2001 and I will certainly miss him and wish him well. But with his help, we will make sure that we have a smooth transition. So thank you, Mike. As it relates to the business, Q1 was strong, we will continue to execute on our strategy and focus on the three large opportunities ahead of us, unleashing creativity, accelerating document productivity, empowering digital businesses. And I don\u2019t think that the recent situation changes the relevance or importance of any of this for our customers and it will only magnify the need to go digital with more urgency. Given the situation is fluid we tried to give you as much insight into what\u2019s happening in our business. The demand for Creative Document and Enterprise is strong. But the impact as we said of COVID will probably be felt a little bit more in the short-term in the enterprise business. But again, we believe that we are better positioned than most to continue to innovate, to drive both top and bottomline, and emerge stronger and more mission critical. We really hope you guys will join us for our digital summit and much like a number of you have said, stay safe and thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our call.",

I would like to turn the conference over to our Vice President of Investor Relations, Jonathan Vaas. Please go ahead, sir. Jonathan Vaas : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today from their home offices are Shantanu Narayen, Adobe\u2019s President and CEO; John Murphy, Executive Vice President and CFO, as well as Mike Saviage, who in March announced his retirement as Adobe\u2019s Head of Investor Relations and is continuing to assist with the transition. On this call we will discuss Adobe\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2020 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of the press release, which crossed the wire approximately 1 hour ago. We have also posted PDFs of our prepared remarks and an updated datasheet on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, including our financial targets and product plans is based on information as of today, June 11 and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainty and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure in our press release we issued today, as well as Adobe\u2019s SEC filings. On this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the two are available in our earnings release and on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website. Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days. The call audio and the webcast may not be re-recorded or otherwise reproduced or distributed without Adobe\u2019s prior written permission. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Jonathan and good afternoon. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. Adobe\u2019s second quarter coincided with what we hope was the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Around the world, people shifted their attention to their health and their families. Businesses focused on protecting their employees, financial stability and continuing to serve their customers. Unfortunately, millions of people have lost their jobs and small and medium-sized businesses have been hit particularly hard. Through this crisis, Adobe\u2019s focus remains on employee health and safety, serving our customers and on ensuring business continuity. We took early and decisive action to direct our teams to work from home, suspend travel and cancel in-person events through 2020 to flatten the curve. To support the communities in which we live and work we have donated over $5 million and 22,000 hours of virtual volunteer time to COVID-19 relief organizations. We are also proud to be part of the coalition that developed the COVID-19 Testing Data Response Platform, providing test screening, appointments and insights for public health officials and government. We immediately instituted work streams to control discretionary expenses and evaluate our strategic priorities to double down on those that will drive the greatest growth and profitability for the long-term. Through all of this, the resiliency and flexibility of our employees has been awe-inspiring. I am proud of how our employees transitioned to this new reality. Adobe is the digital experiences company, with millions of global customers relying on our products every day to create the world\u2019s content, automate critical document processes and engage with their customers digitally. Adobe\u2019s leadership in three large and growing categories, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud, is driving our performance. Adobe drove strong Q2 performance across Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud, and Adobe Experience Cloud. We delivered $3.13 billion in revenue in Q2, representing 14% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter, was $2.27 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.45. In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q2. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $443 million and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q2 grew to $9.17 billion. Q2 Creative revenue was $1.87 billion, which represents 17% year-over-year growth. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $352 million. The past couple of months have shown us that in times of uncertainty people are turning to creative expression to learn, cope and make an impact. Adobe Creative Cloud is the center of this new creative renaissance, unleashing creativity for all and empowering millions of people around the world to tell their stories. As schools faced physical closures and moved online, we focused our attention on enabling them to create from home. We immediately provisioned 30 million students at home with Creative Cloud and provided teachers distance learning support. In Q2, we saw historic highs in adobe.com traffic across both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Demand for our professional video products was particularly high with strong engagement for Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. We continue to see steady growth from social content creators using Premiere Rush, which saw a 75% increase in monthly active users quarter-over-quarter. Mobile traffic, member sign-ups and monetization continues to accelerate. Adobe Fresco has seen a greater than 40% increase in downloads since the start of 2020. Photoshop Express has surpassed 20 million in monthly active users. Our teams are gearing up for a significant Creative Cloud update later this month featuring exciting new product innovation as well as new capabilities designed to facilitate collaboration between creators, particularly important in this environment. We are excited to make Photoshop Camera generally available on iOS and Android this week, bringing the magic of Photoshop to the point of capture. Photoshop Camera is a fun and easy consumer app targeted at social creators, an increasingly important segment for Adobe. At Adobe, we believe everyone is a creator and we need to make products suitable for different skill levels. Adobe Spark, available both on the web and as a mobile app, is targeted at the large group of communicators who need to create social graphics, web pages and short videos for their business, school or community. As part of the strategic review of our Creative business, we have decided to increase our investment in two exciting areas, providing new solutions that address the unmet needs of the communicator segment and ensuring that the web browser is a first-class authoring platform. We are proud of the role we play in inspiring the global creative community. With our Honor Heroes campaign, we galvanized our community to create artwork honoring essential workers on the frontlines. We created an Adobe Fresco-compatible Digital Coloring Book and launched a creative campaign with musician Marshmello challenging fans to create a video for his latest single, Be Kind. Document Cloud revenue in Q2 was a record $360 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $1.24 billion. With Adobe Document Cloud, we are accelerating document productivity, enabling our customers to engage, transact and collaborate seamlessly in a remote work environment. As we did with Creative Cloud, we implemented several programs to support our customers. This included making our web-based PDF services on adobe.com free and implementing a Government Rapid Response program to assist local governments by providing extended trials for Adobe Document Cloud. The shift to remote work has driven a surge in demand for digital documents, with use of web-based PDF services, up nearly 40% quarter-over-quarter and the number of documents shared in Acrobat, increasing 50% year-over-year. We continued to drive strong adoption for Adobe Sign, our cloud-based electronic signature solution, with usage increasing 175% since the start of our fiscal year. Mobile usage exploded with Acrobat Reader installations increasing 43% year-over-year and Adobe Scan installations up 66% year-over-year. We are proud of the role our technology is playing in enabling our government customers to accelerate their transition to digital. The City of Seattle\u2019s digital workplace division deployed Adobe Sign across its departments when the city quickly shifted to telework. The State of Utah is using Adobe Acrobat and Sign as part of its telework initiative to facilitate emergency response and streamline communication across the state. As part of the strategic review of our Document business, we are increasing investment in Adobe Sign and our PDF services on the web and availability of PDF functionality through APIs to capitalize on the wholesale shift to remote work and digital-first document processes. In our Digital Experience business, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $826 million for the quarter. As outlined at our last earnings call, we saw anticipated delays in enterprise bookings and consulting services implementations as companies prioritized employee and financial well-being. The extreme economic challenges that enterprise customers in certain verticals experienced as well as weakness in our commercial segment that targets small and medium sized businesses also adversely impacted bookings. In addition, the significant global decline in advertising spending impacted our Advertising Cloud revenue. Despite the short-term challenges, the mandate to digitally transform has taken on heightened urgency. Enterprises continue to recognize Adobe\u2019s leadership in Customer Experience Management. Key customer wins in the quarter included IBM, Walgreens, Safeway, Astellas Pharma, and Allianz. We are dedicated to our customers\u2019 success and proud to see the impact our technology is having. Government organizations such as the U.S. Census Bureau are relying on Adobe Experience Cloud to modernize citizen experiences. 3M and Verizon are reaping the benefits of the Adobe Experience Platform and we now cumulatively have over 10 billion active customer profiles running on Adobe Experience Platform. Adobe Experience Cloud was named a leader with the highest position among 19 vendors in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Multi-channel Marketing Hubs as well as a leader by Forrester in the B2B and B2C Commerce Suites Wave reports. We successfully transitioned Adobe Summit to an exclusively digital event, where we debuted new Adobe Experience Cloud innovation, including Intelligent Services, Customer Journey Analytics and the Customer Experience Management Playbook. The Adobe Summit Live virtual experience enabled us to engage a far larger audience than an in-person event and set the bar for virtual events. Cumulatively, we have engaged with more than 0.5 million visitors. While it was difficult to imagine only conducting business with CMOs and CIOs virtually, a side benefit of everyone working at home is that we are able to schedule and engage with far more customers across multiple continents. In all these discussions with business leaders, it is clear that investments in digital and specifically customer experience are more important than ever. As a result of the strategic review of our Digital Experience business, it is clear that we have an unparalleled value proposition and market leading solutions across content and commerce, customer journey management and customer data and insights, all powered by the Adobe Experience Platform. To further our lead, we are increasing our investment in AI and machine learning, next-generation applications and services on the Adobe Experience Platform, and accelerated integration of our content and commerce offerings. Our current advertising offerings consist of Advertising Cloud software solutions as well as Advertising Cloud transaction-driven solutions. We will continue to offer our Advertising Cloud software solutions to our Digital Experience customers, but this will not be an area of growth moving forward. CMOs want a single source of reporting and attribution for their advertising investment, which we can uniquely offer through the combination of Advertising Cloud and the Adobe Experience Cloud. We have decided to accelerate our previously stated strategy of eliminating the low-margin Advertising Cloud transaction-driven offerings. These offerings are no longer core to our overall value proposition of delivering on customer experience management nor contributing to our subscription-based bookings and revenue and in fact are extremely resource intensive. The impact of this strategic shift was evident in our Q2 revenue, cost of goods sold and gross margin results and will be factored into future Digital Experience targets. Earlier this year, we hired Anil Chakravarthy to drive the immense enterprise opportunity. Over the past few months, Anil continued to expand his charter with responsibility for strategy, product engineering and marketing, consulting and customer success for the Digital Experience business. Coincident with the long-planned retirement of Matt Thompson, Adobe\u2019s Executive Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations, Anil will now be adding responsibility for the entire Worldwide Enterprise Field organization. Over the past 13 years, Matt has played a pivotal role in the company\u2019s transformation to a subscription software model in the Digital Media business as well as the creation of the Digital Marketing category. He has built a world class go-to-market organization and championed customer centricity. I will miss our partnership and wish Matt well in his retirement. Matt has built a deep management bench and I am confident that this combined organization will thrive under Anil\u2019s leadership. Adobe is the market leader in customer experience management and we have invested in deep product integration, platform innovation and a robust ecosystem. We are well positioned to execute on the growing total addressable market for CXM. At Adobe, we are guided by our belief that it\u2019s not only what we do, but how we do it that is core to our success. We believe that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment and we are outraged at the senseless violence against the Black community in the U.S. This is a painful reminder of the injustice and systematic racism that exists in our country. We can and must do better and we are committed to doing so at Adobe. Great companies are defined by how they lead through adversity. We have successfully navigated several crises and have always used them as a catalyst to make strategic and structural change to emerge stronger. I am particularly proud of how our employees embraced the current challenges and rallied to ensure that innovation, customer centricity and adherence to our core values remains front and center. Our employees, broad and diverse portfolio of products, strong balance sheet and rigorous operating cadence put us in a rarified atmosphere among companies of our size and scale. We will emerge stronger than ever. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. In the second quarter of FY \u201820, Adobe achieved record revenue of $3.13 billion, which represents 14% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $2.27 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.45. Business and financial highlights in Q2 included Digital Media revenue of $2.23 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $443 million, Digital Experience revenue of $826 million, expanding profitability with strong earnings per share, cash flows from operations of $1.18 billion, and repurchasing approximately 2.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter. Adobe\u2019s strong second quarter performance demonstrates our continued top and bottom line growth despite an ongoing global pandemic. We are well positioned to navigate the continuing crisis given our resilient business model and a healthy balance sheet. In the work-from-home and distance learning environment, our strategy of fueling content creation, digital workflows and digital transformation is more relevant than ever, as digital engagement continues to underpin the global economy. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 18% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2. On an FX adjusted basis using rates in effect as of the start of our Q2, Digital Media revenue grew 19% year-over-year. During Q2 we added $443 million of net new Digital Media ARR, our strongest Q2 on record. Total Digital Media ARR exiting the quarter was $9.17 billion. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 17% year-over-year and we increased Creative ARR by $352 million. During the second quarter, we saw increased demand for our solutions on Adobe.com amid the work-from-home environment, and usage of our products spiked notably during the quarter. Q2 Creative growth drivers included strong new user growth across all geographies, including single app adoption by individuals, adoption of our professional video products, including single-app Premiere Pro subscriptions as engagement from communicators and Youtubers increased significantly, strength in migrating students and trial users to paid subscriptions, significant unit growth for paid mobile subscriptions and continued focus on targeted campaigns using insights from our data driven operating model, which drove significant growth in web traffic during the quarter. Adobe Document Cloud delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth. We achieved record Document Cloud revenue of $360 million, which represents 22% year-over-year growth, and we added $91 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. As with our Creative business, Document Cloud benefited from tailwinds associated with knowledge workers and communicators working from home, and we had a particularly strong quarter driving new business for Adobe Sign, with net new ARR more than doubling year-over-year. Document Cloud performance during Q2 was driven by strength on Adobe.com across the individual and SMB segments, significant growth in consumer adoption of mobile apps and PDF services, shortened deal cycles for enterprise Acrobat and Sign customers as the imperative to translate paper processes to digital accelerates across the globe, increased pipeline and improved execution in the government segment, particularly for our Sign solution and conversion of free mobile app users and our Reader install base to paid subscriptions. Across Digital Media consistent with our expectations, we experienced some weakness for the SMB offerings in the reseller channel and Adobe.com. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, our primary focus is to grow software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of products. Our Adobe Experience Cloud revenue includes subscription revenue, which includes revenues from Advertising Cloud, professional services revenue, and other, which includes perpetual, OEM and support revenue. In Q2, we achieved quarterly Digital Experience revenue of $826 million, which represents 5% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $707 million, representing 8% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue, excluding Advertising Cloud revenue, grew 18% year-over-year. As outlined on our Q1 earnings call, our Advertising Cloud revenue was negatively impacted given the COVID-19 situation. As we saw the extent of the global decline in advertising spend, we made the strategic decision mid-quarter to cease pursuing transaction-driven Advertising Cloud deals. Together this resulted in a shortfall of approximately $50 million relative to our targeted Q2 revenue. A significant portion of the revenue from the transaction-driven Advertising Cloud offerings is recognized on a gross basis, with the related cost of media purchased recognized as cost of goods sold, resulting in low gross margin percentages for these offerings. While the discontinuation of these offerings will negatively impact revenue, it will enable us to drive improvements to our overall gross margins, DSO and the profitability of our Digital Experience segment, as already evident in this quarter\u2019s results. We now expect approximately $200 million total Advertising Cloud revenue for the full fiscal year, with $70 million for the second half, decelerating from the first half of the year. As comparison, we achieved $360 million in Advertising Cloud revenue in fiscal 2019 and our original 2020 targets assumed that Advertising Cloud would grow at rates consistent with the overall subscription revenue for Digital Experience. In Q2, our professional services revenue in Digital Experience declined approximately 8% year-over-year. While there were some delays in converting consulting backlog to revenue early in Q2, we saw progress in implementations as the quarter progressed. Through a challenging quarter we continued to build pipeline and saw strength in our content and commerce offerings, particularly in the enterprise segment. As with consulting, we saw some momentum late in the quarter in our commercial segment that targets small and medium businesses. Across Adobe as we navigate the economic downturn we are managing the business carefully to drive growth and profitability. We reduced discretionary spending and delivered a strong operating margin. Our operating expense declined sequentially quarter-over-quarter as a result of a reduction in the pace of hiring, savings across travel and entertainment and in-person event cancellations. Having completed our strategic review and reprioritization, we will now turn our focus to investing appropriately for continued long-term growth. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $18 million. We had $5 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201820 versus $7 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201820. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $20 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $37 million. The $5 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY20, versus the $9 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201819 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $41 million. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q2 was minus 10% on a GAAP basis and 10% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with our Q2 targets. Our trade DSO was 40 days, which compares to 42 days in the year-ago quarter, and 41 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO grew by 19% year-over-year to $9.92 billion exiting Q2 and was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Adobe.com cloud offerings, typically billed monthly, are reported as unbilled backlog, whereas channel offerings billed annually up front are reported as deferred revenue. The strength in acquisition from Adobe.com during the quarter drove a mix-shift from deferred revenue to unbilled backlog. We exited Q2 with $3.46 billion in deferred revenue. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $4.35 billion, and cash flows from operations was $1.18 billion in the quarter. Consistent with macroeconomic trends, we saw some increase in customer requests for billing concessions. We continue to be focused on working with our customers to ensure their success while managing our cash flows. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $850 million. We currently have $3.4 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018, which goes through 2021. In light of the macroeconomic environment and the strategic shifts for Advertising Cloud, we are withdrawing the annual fiscal 2020 targets. Our targets factor current macroeconomic conditions, continued impacts of the pandemic and typical Q3 seasonality across the summer months of June, July and August. For Q3, we are targeting revenue of approximately $3.15 billion, Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 16%, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $340 million, Digital Experience segment revenue flat year-over-year, Digital Experience subscription revenue growing 5% year-over-year or 14% when excluding Advertising Cloud revenue, tax rate of approximately 10% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, share count of approximately 485 million shares, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.78 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.40. We expect typical seasonal strength in Q4 across our Digital Media and Digital Experience business. We expect our operating expenses to increase in line with growth rates in previous years as we continue to invest for growth. In summary, our resilient business model, healthy balance sheet and data driven operating model enabled us to successfully navigate this unprecedented macroeconomic environment. We are extremely proud of how our employees have continued to innovate and remain productive. Our long-term opportunity remains robust given digital technologies will increasingly drive the global economy. I will now turn the call back over to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, John. As we announced last month, we have shifted Adobe MAX, our annual creativity conference, to be an online event this October. Information about the event can be found online at max.adobe.com. We plan to host a virtual financial analyst meeting later in the fall. Invitations will be sent to our analyst and investor email list this summer. If you wish to listen to a playback of today\u2019s conference call, a webcast archive of the call will be available on Adobe\u2019s IR site later today. You can also listen to a phone replay by calling the numbers shown above. The phone playback service will be available beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today and ending at 5 p.m. Pacific Time on June 18. We would now be happy to take your questions and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Shantanu, for the third quarter of Digital Experience, you are guiding to flat revenue growth and I think many are just curious given the digital tailwinds, why such a steep headwind on this business? And also, as follow-up, if you could just talk to the field changes with Matt\u2019s departure and Anil picking up, just assurance around the field that there won\u2019t be any major changes that would be great? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Brent. Happy to answer both of the questions. I mean first as it relates to Digital Experience, I think as we said, while we saw a little bit of slowness in interest at the beginning of the quarter, we certainly as people dealt with the employee issues as well as financial stability, the interest and demand in digital experience absolutely continues to grow stronger. With respect to Matt and Anil\u2019s transition, we really don\u2019t expect any issue. Matt has been planning for this for a long time; Anil has certainly in his role as CEO at Informatica managed a field. There is a deep bench, Matt is available for a transition and he is certainly going to remain a friend of the company. And so I would not anticipate any issues whatsoever with respect to the field transition because the next layer is completely in place and has tremendous experience with Adobe. I think as it relates to the revenue expectations for Q3, Brent, I think maybe I can touch a little bit on what we said with the Advertising Cloud again just to make sure everybody understands that which is the opportunity, if you take a step back around both Digital Experience and Customer Experience Management, there is no question that it\u2019s larger than prior to this pandemic. And as you know Brent, we have an unbelievably unique portfolio of products and so what we did was we said, let\u2019s take the opportunity to really prioritize the largest growth vectors as well as look at profitability. Content and commerce had a great quarter, customer experience orchestration continues to be really important. Analytics and InSight is really important. And Advertising Cloud as it relates to the solutions that we have for attribution and InSight, they add a significant amount of value for our customers. However, again as we said given in Advertising Cloud, they are two separate businesses, the software driven and the transaction driven. We did take the opportunity to accelerate our moving away from the lower margin transaction business, something as you remember, we actually signaled at our Analyst Meeting last year. And so when you take out the revenue impact associated with that you will find that the strength of the business continues. As it relates to bookings, in Q2 we achieved \u2013 the book of business for subscription bookings was greater than 15%. That in this current climate I would say it was excellent performance. And so we continue to feel really positive about the business, but hopefully that gives some color. And the last thing I\u2019ll say is even if you think about our Q2, Brent, when we guided to $3.175 billion and we said that we had $50 million in advertising revenue that we decisively decided to stop pursuing, with the numbers that we posted you could see that we had a really good quarter. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Next, we will hear from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thanks. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and very nice job on the quarter. Shifting focus to the Digital Media side of the equation, John, in your comments you talked about seeing some weakness in the commercial and SMB side of the equation, frankly with $443 million in net new AR addition, it doesn\u2019t really show through in terms of the numbers. So it\u2019s pretty remarkable that you saw kind of strength even with the weakness, but can you walk us through kind of the puts and takes on that, like what were the areas that were weaker and sort of what were the areas that had such strong outperformance that you guys were able to even with that exceed your like 380 target? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, maybe I will start as well, Keith. And then John can certainly add. I mean overall clearly when you think about the creative and the document business, working from home, shelter in place, and the ability to both create and tell their story as well as what is happening with the documents, you are right, I mean we had guided to about $385 million, it\u2019s a record for a Q2 for us in our business, so it was strong. I think what we were trying to also give color was the different routes to market. And when you think about the routes to market certainly adobe.com, the traffic right through the quarter was very strong. Because as you know, we have a data driven operating model, we use the effective marketing tools to continue to drive visit our acquisition across the globe. I think small and medium businesses we would all say it was probably the most impacted as you think about our customer segment. And therefore, through the channel what we were trying to indicate was the revenue was lower than we would have normally seen. We fully expect that that business is going to come back as that segment continues to get strong, but document cloud, sign, video, single apps, all did really strong Keith as it relates to what happened on adobe.com. So it was more a route to market and there is probably some aspect of folks who typically transacted through the channel who are also probably coming to adobe.com as a result. Keith Weiss : Got it. Excellent. John Murphy : I wouldn\u2019t add anything. Shantanu covered all the points there. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you very much guys. Operator : Next, we will hear from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. Actually I wanted to follow-up on Keith\u2019s question a little bit, maybe get a bit more granular because we certainly heard about some of the things that work in your favor this quarter, you put that in contrast of guidance which seems to imply things being down sequentially pretty significantly. How \u2013 I know these things are hard to parse out, but maybe just looking at the linearity of net new ARR as you move through the quarter, with their sort of upswing and then sort of slowdown in demand as you kind of saw surge as people move to shelter in place and work from home and that drove a specific level of demand that you don\u2019t expect to continue in Q3, because it seems like a lot of these things are durable. So I\u2019m just curious if you have any way of parsing out what might have been sort of a point in time around shifts in how people work and maybe consumer demand attached to being at home relative to things which seem like they \u2013 they should be favorable durable shifts for the business? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Jennifer again, I think as the shelter-in-place, work at home began, when we last spoke to you it was I think 10 days into the quarter and we said that we had actually seen limited impact of COVID and then we did see an increase as it related to the traffic, which actually continued quite high right through the quarter. So we continue to see the strength in that particular business. On the acquisition side, it\u2019s early, but the first few days of the quarter again we continue to see the strength in Q3. I think as you know and have followed us for a while Q3 tends to be our seasonally weak quarter. We have such a great insight into the business as it relates to the data driven operating model. So while the overall against the addressable market is certainly a durable trend. I think we are factoring in normal seasonality. We are not assuming that things will get better as it relates to the small and medium business. But overall, whether it\u2019s the Document Cloud or the Creative Cloud, we continue to feel good. I think if there was one thing that we probably overestimated the impact of COVID as it related to the consumer space. And now I think that number of you are like wow, that was great outperformance and we, if you look at our Q3 numbers as well it will clearly demonstrate continued momentum in that business. Jennifer Lowe : Okay, thank you. Operator : Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital has our next question. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Thanks guys here for taking my questions and hope all is well. Shantanu, maybe for you, can you just talk about the bigger picture, with the decision on Advertising Cloud? It seems like the margin benefit of slightly lower focus in the transactional part of the ad cloud kind of has an interesting byproduct with the margin. And so perhaps the bigger question is, do you feel the team is perhaps going to balance profitability a little bit more with growth in the DX business than it has in the past? Shantanu Narayen : Well, first Saket, unlike other companies in the enterprise space, we have never pursued revenue, that is not good profitable revenue which I know other companies do. And so I know I would say what we did really well in the quarter, let\u2019s say, how do we take a step back, understand strategically, what are the, really long-term growth opportunities and how is the business going to get transformed as a result of what we saw. In that particular context, when every company on the planet, whether it\u2019s a small and medium, or large business is saying how do I engage digitally with customers, it\u2019s clear that the content and commerce associated with our offerings, what we can do around customer journey, orchestration and the core analytics and insight is really where all of these built on experience platform is where we are unparalleled in terms of the unique differentiation. On the advertising side, they really were two businesses, and this is something that we have talked about, which is there is a software driven business that shows how attribution works that really can benefit from the Adobe Analytics InSight in terms of making sure you are spending that money well and so that we will continue to offer, but we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to be a huge growth opportunity. It was the transaction business, which is very resource-intensive and that one we had always signaled that we were going to be reducing that business, but we certainly used pandemic as a catalyst to say let\u2019s make a change right now, so we can double down our resources on what really represent durable, long-term opportunities. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on strategically, why waste the crisis in terms of making the changes that you know you can make to be a stronger company. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Great, thank you so much and congrats to you all on the great quarter. My question is for John, John, in your prepared remarks you stated that coming away from the strategic review, we will now turn our focus to investing appropriately for continued long-term growth. Can you expand on what exactly you mean by that? And how is that any different than what Adobe has always done? John Murphy : Yes, that\u2019s an interesting question, Brad. I think when we look at Q2 because of the pandemic, we obviously benefited in earnings and our margin related to expenses that basically slowed down because we couldn\u2019t hire the way we would typically hire. We couldn\u2019t travel the way we wanted to travel and certainly the cancellation of the in-person events. And we certainly are growth-oriented company. So the point really was to say, hey, we are going to invest in growth going forward. We have got great opportunities in front of us that Shantanu laid out. And so the operating margin that we achieved in Q2 is one that I would pencil line as a trend line is really what I was trying to get to. And we got great opportunities to invest for growth and we have proven as we continue to grow revenue, we continue to grow profitability in the long run. Shantanu Narayen : And Brad, maybe just to add a little bit to what John added. I mean we actually took very decisive action at the beginning of the quarter, because we did not know how widespread how long the pandemic would be to make sure that we controlled our expenses. When you look at the opportunities that we have on the Document Cloud, when you look at the opportunities that we have with Experience Platform, the ability to continue on variable market and to make sure that we are acquiring the right customers that will deliver the right long-term value, I think that\u2019s really important for us to continue to make sure that we are opening up the company back to the long-term opportunities that we have because going to be an even more unique place than the smaller company. So, to your point earlier, Brad, it is something that we always do. I think John was also referring to the early actions that we took and saying, hey, we understand our business and so it\u2019s time to really focus on the long-term opportunities that will continue to drive both top and bottom line growth. Brad Zelnick : Thanks again. Operator : We will now hear from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking my question and again congrats on the quarter, given all the moving parts it was a tough thing to work your way through. Document Cloud and Sign were really strong this quarter, and you mentioned COVID-19 was a tailwind. Can you give us some color about how you think about those tailwinds going forward? Do they abate as people start to move back? Do they continue as they move back? Any color would be much appreciated. As a quick follow-up, can you give any color on how much of revenues now came through adobe.com versus traditionally? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Mark, I think this is similar to the question that Jennifer asked which is everybody is going to go back to business as usual. I mean if you take, Adobe as a company and how we also think about reentry, I think the new normal is going to be people working in remote locations, engaging more digitally, making sure that digitization continues to be a really important phenomenon. So I think as it relates to the document, as, Mark, we have been excited about it. We always talked about the move from perpetual to subscriptions. We had talked about PDF services on the web and as we said that\u2019s all substantial growth making sure PDF API functionality is available for anybody who wants to document as part of any system that they are trying to accomplish. And so we don\u2019t think that abates. We think that these will just continue to be secular tailwind trends that we will benefit from. And I think that again going back maybe to Brad\u2019s question is the reason why we feel optimistic given everything that we\u2019ve seen to make sure that we continue to capitalize on those particular opportunity. And so the document business has always been a growth, it just accelerated and we think that that\u2019s a trend that will be durable. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. So I want to stay in the same topic, in terms of the Document Cloud. So Shantanu given that this might be the new normal, and maybe demand is getting pulled forward, are you applying more resources to that area from our sales capacity perspective either verticalizing even further, just \u2013 what are you doing, I guess to capture maybe what is the pull forward and it turns out, people are thinking about the digitization of documents? And then John, just on a related topic your bookings impact Document ARR, Document Cloud ARR been up 30%, I think the last two quarters. It seems to be an upward bias perhaps on revenue in that segment. Is that a fair assumption going forward? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Kirk, your first question to good one. And again, going back to what we were able to do during this, we have made it so that the offerings that we have that combine the strength of what we are doing on Adobe Sign with the strength that we have on content in the Digital Experience business and what we were delivering with forms, whether that was for the public sector, we have our entire field organization now out there evangelizing what we can do on the document side. So that gives you one example of a significant shift as it relates to making sure that we have our entire organization aligned around the go-to-market. I think in terms of partnerships and partnerships that we have done on the document side and Sign and API functionality. We\u2019ve always talked about the opportunity that we have with Microsoft and the integration. We also announced a really strategic partnership with ServiceNow. If you think what ServiceNow is able to do, which is really change how workflows happened in an enterprise every single one of those workflows then needs the statement of record as it relates to PDF but then makes that a tangible. So again, that one we have been able to do. So really great question and that\u2019s one of the ways in which we are able to pivot like a nimble small company rather than \u2013 and use our brand rather than weight. And so that\u2019s an example of the entire DX field organization also now has an offering associated with Sign that they can take into every one of our customers. John Murphy : And I think on the \u2013 in terms of a bias towards Document Cloud revenue growth versus Creative, both are just huge opportunities and we continue to see growth opportunities coming for both. Certainly, obviously the pandemic kind of \u2013 may be accentuated the move to digital document workflows and e-signatures. But as we talked about, we see some of these smaller business has come back, we certainly expect them to come back in the creative side as well because content creation is not going away as it\u2019s imperative going forward for these businesses. So I think we just are excited about the opportunity in both of those files and all the solution associated with them. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Operator : Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities has our next question. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, John, does the strategic mix shift in DX improve the feasibility of you getting back to a 65% or better gross margin in DX, which is where you were before the TubeMogul acquisition? And perhaps as part of your overall strategy, you could also talk about the role of increasing self-serve, which we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls. Additionally at Summit, Adobe had some very interesting things to say about some new initiatives and technologies such as scalable content, optimized personalization, pervasive commerce, which is really interesting one, and then of course applications and intelligent services. So maybe talk about the latter in terms of how are you thinking about resources for those and incremental business opportunities in those? Shantanu Narayen : As always Jay that was three questions mirrored in one, but I appreciate all of them. I think as it relates to the COGS I think and the gross margin, you have actually seen that improve even as you look at the data sheet that you have for Q2. So I think it\u2019s something like $35 million or something on quarter-over-quarter. So I think you see the improvement in the COGS. We are constantly looking at our COGS and we want to make sure we improve. I think your question around Summit and the excitement that we have around all the things that we announced is another reason why when you have that differentiated solution that\u2019s really where I think our value add to a customer is so much higher, and there is a lot of interest, there\u2019s a lot of interest as people look at it and say, all of this data that they are now drowning in how can they use Adobe\u2019s intelligent services so that it automatically personalizes whatever is required for a user across multiple channels. So you are right, I mean Summit for us was very interesting and that we were able to transact with a lot more folks, we got a lot more awareness out, we were able to, actually advance what we would do with Summit that were globally rolled out. I would say it\u2019s probably a little less mature pipeline and that\u2019s one thing that you miss the ability to move that forward. But all of that\u2019s now we expect that trend as we move into the second half in 2021 because that is going to be top of mind. So that\u2019s a little bit of how we\u2019re looking at it. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. First off, I want to just congratulate my friend, Brent Thill on his 25 years of being a software analyst. Shantanu in case you do not know, that\u2019s my value add for you today. But my question for you Shantanu as far as Adobe, what are the lessons learned by Adobe in this quarter operating virtually as a company? And what are the windows of \u2013 or snippets of insight you could offer to us about go to market, of product development, partnership, marketing, the things that you were able to accomplish virtually and as a result, how much of it is here to stay as you look into 2021 and beyond? And the kind of savings, costs, expenses, whatever it is of revenue opportunities, how should we frame Adobe post pandemic? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Kash, I mean it\u2019s something that we are all focused on a lot as a company. I mean first I will reiterate in fact that overnight as a company 20,000 employees all around the world were productive. I mean in my internal note to the company, as part of this earnings I said I was just blown away. We had our first ever virtual close, the IT organization, in terms of how they\u2019ve made sure that we are all productive through video conferences. I would actually say when you look at existing projects, most people would say that their productivity is actually greater than 100% because they are saving on travel, they are saving on the ability to be very productive without too many meetings and so I think as it relates to the new normal on the product engineering side, it\u2019s been phenomenally successful. I think we need a little bit more focus on what happens with respect to creating new projects, so that one of the brainstorming that happens as it relates to the virtual white boarding. So that\u2019s something that we will continue to focus on. On the dealing with customers which was the other part, so internally we feel very good. On the dealing with customers, I think that went through a little bit of a slow phase as customers were first thinking about their internal, but frankly right now I mean sometimes you feel like you\u2019ve conquered time and space because you can have meetings with people across four continents on the same day, makes for a long day Kash, but it actually feels really good that we\u2019re now engaging with customers. So we just feel that our ability to attract talent also wherever they might live that\u2019s going to improve. And so net, net, I would say, for a company like Adobe internally, our productivity is overall higher, but even more important, I think it serves at such an inflection point because every single company is now going to say, hey, I need to go talk to Adobe, whether it\u2019s about creative, whether it\u2019s about documents or whether about Digital Experience. So I think the macro tailwinds is probably going to be the longer lasting benefit to a company like Adobe and certainly, Brent congratulations on 25 years. I mean, the two of you have been great sort of followers of the company and very insightful. So congratulations. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman : Hi, thank you very much. Shantanu, I want to direct this to you. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about the growth of Creative, Creative being both people or units as well as price mix and suggested that the growth of users, has been a greater contributor to the net growth rates of creative. And I just wanted to see given the pandemic over the next few quarters, is that still true? And how are you thinking about potential price increases when you\u2019re normally introduced new products with the Creative Suite? And then also just wanted to sneak in one to see if you can give us an update on Magento and traction and integration and any kind of anecdotes on run rates associated with that property? Thanks very much. Shantanu Narayen : I think on your first question, there is no question that the creative market and everybody who has a story to tell, it is only getting larger. I mean, as we said we were proud of $30 million provisioned, also for education, which is going to be I think a great base for us to build on, and I wouldn\u2019t say it is one segment or the other. I think really Keith, it\u2019s all of the different segments. Mobile did very well, we have different price points, we have Spark for communicators. And again it is our vision is very clear. It is a one-stop shop for everything from inspiration to monetization. So expect us to continue to see more offerings, more price points, and using our DDOM frankly to both acquire them as well as to make sure that we serve them appropriately. I\u2019m glad you asked the question on commerce. Commerce usage has certainly gone up very dramatically in terms of how we\u2019ve seen the enterprise adoption of our commerce solutions was very strong in the quarter. I think it\u2019s important for all of you to also remember that the way we do that is it\u2019s typically licensed base with a band of how many transactions. So it\u2019s really not about \u2013 the transaction doesn\u2019t immediately result in revenue, but whether it\u2019s a true-up or whether it\u2019s an increased band that they will have to go. So, new customer acquisition was good in that. Usage as certainly gone up, it is almost like you\u2019re having Black Friday or Cyber Monday every day, but we will continue to hopefully see that as we talk about renewals, how they get into higher bands. Jonathan Vaas : Operator, we are coming up on the top of the hour. We\u2019ll take one more question please. Operator : Your question will come from Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Alex Zukin : Shantanu, thank you guys for squeezing me in and congrats to Brent for his 25 years. I guess maybe, Shantanu, can you talk a little bit about as you look at the linearity of the quarter, particularly the Digital Experience business kind of taking out the Advertising Cloud piece, where are we in terms of sales cycle normalization in your mind? And then maybe as a, just a quick follow-up on the margins, given the new positive tailwind to gross margin from some of these initiatives, is it fair to say that the new operating margin profile should be somewhere between the 1Q and 2Q levels? Shantanu Narayen : John, certainly you can add on the margin, I think Alex, as it relates to the linearity during the quarter I think the month of March and this is probably true for most of the businesses that was where the real impact was felt and then April actually became worse. I think as we got into May, people started to engage a lot more we saw signs of improvement. I think John touched on that as well. And so I think that\u2019s the way I would highlight it for a month, month and half, everybody knew Digital was an imperative, but they had other fires that they were fighting. And then as it related to March, I mean, May, sorry, it all started to open up and we are having far more conversations with customers. So hopefully that gives you some feeling about linearity, which is why we are optimistic about moving forward as we have that pipeline. How we will deal with. And the operating margin will be between the Q1 and Q2 levels. If you think about it, you\u2019re not going to see any big change dramatically, but as John said, I think we will continue to invest in. And I realized we ran a little bit long with the prepared remarks, and so we may not be able to get all of the questions, but let me again say I am really proud. I am proud of what the company was able to accomplish in Q2. And I\u2019m even more excited about what the future growth opportunities are for Adobe because there is no question that digital is going to be even more of a driver of the economy. It\u2019s going to amplify the urgency for individuals to be creative and collaborators, it\u2019s going to improve the urgency for enterprises to engage digitally and when you think about the portfolio of products that we have, learning is no longer \u2013 learning to be creative will no longer be a luxury, dealing with electronic documents is going to be the way business is transacted, the PDF platform and ecosystem is thriving, and on the DX side, engaging digitally with customers is going to be mission critical irrespective of the size of the business. And so we are proud of our unique business model, growth is a priority for us, but we will always focus as we have with great cash flow and high profitability. I\u2019m proud again as I said that we used this crisis to further refine our strategy and align the organization on what truly matters, which is sustained innovation and delighting our customers. Please stay safe, stay healthy. And thank you very much for joining us today. Jonathan Vaas : This concludes our call. Thanks everyone.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon. I hope all of you are safe and taking good care. The ongoing pandemic continues to result in a challenging environment everywhere around the world. People are seeking new ways to communicate, learn and conduct business virtually. Content creation and consumption are exploding in a world where connecting visually has become even more essential. Students are adapting to learning remotely instead of in a classroom. Entire industries, from media and entertainment to pharma, retail, automotive and financial services, have had to pivot overnight to digital operations to engage with customers and ensure business continuity. Electronic workflows and signatures are the only way to efficiently complete business transactions. The world has changed in a way that none of us could have foreseen. This reality has created new tailwinds for Adobe. Our mission to change the world through Digital Experiences has never been more critical. Our strategy of unleashing creativity for all, accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses is more relevant than ever and driving our strong performance across every geography and audience. Adobe had an outstanding third quarter. We saw strength across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. We achieved $3.23 billion in revenue in Q3, representing 14% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.97, representing 22% year-over-year growth, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.57, representing 25% year-over-year growth. In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q3, achieving $2.34 billion in revenue, representing 19% year-over-year growth. Net new Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR was $458 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to $9.63 billion. We believe that everyone has a story to tell and our goal is to give all creators, from students to social media influencers, business communicators and creative professionals, the ability to create and amplify their stories. Creation and consumption across phones, tablets and desktops is exploding. Web content, mobile application creation, imaging, video, animation, screen design, AR and 3D are all surging in this new era of digital storytelling and business transformation. Enabling the capture, authoring and collaboration across each of these categories and inspiring our global communities, Creative Cloud is driving this massive content revolution. Q3 Creative Cloud performance was outstanding, with net new Creative Cloud ARR of $360 million and revenue of $1.96 billion. Driving our Q3 Creative Cloud performance was record traffic to Adobe.com, our acquisition engine, using proprietary models for attribution and optimization; strength in our Creative Cloud single-app and complete offerings across all geographies; growth in our creative mobile apps, delivering discrete revenue as well as a funnel to our multi-surface Creative Cloud offerings; improvement in retention, driven by increased engagement and product usage among individuals, teams and enterprises; outstanding performance in the imaging and video categories with Photoshop, Lightroom and Premiere Pro; and strong performance in the education segment across students, educators and institutions. Adobe MAX, the world\u2019s largest creativity conference, will be hosted virtually in October. In addition to showcasing exciting new Creative Cloud products and services, our programming includes 56 hours of around-the-world content and features incredible creators like actor Keanu Reeves, photographer Annie Leibovitz and award-winning filmmaker Ava DuVernay. We expect a record turnout and are thrilled to already have over 200,000 registrations. With Adobe Document Cloud, we\u2019ve reinvented how people create, edit, share and sign digital documents with Acrobat and PDF. While digital documents have always helped small, mid-sized and large businesses realize productivity and efficiency gains, they have now become central to businesses operating remotely. Supported with a rich set of APIs, Adobe Document Cloud enables seamless workflows and collaboration across devices. Q3 Document Cloud performance was exceptional, with net new Document Cloud ARR of $98 million and record revenue of $375 million. Q3 highlights included strong growth in gross new ARR coming from the Adobe Reader funnel; significant gains in Acrobat web monthly average use; Acrobat Mobile installs up 33% year-to-date; significant momentum with Adobe Sign, including our announcement to pursue FedRAMP Moderate status; key customer wins, including Citi, PwC, Pepsi, HSBC, Merkle and J-Power; and the release of the Adobe Document Cloud Resource Hub for Education, a one-stop destination outlining how Document Cloud can assist with remote learning. The shelter-in-place requirements instituted across the globe created a heightened sense of urgency among all companies to accelerate their digital transformation. Overnight, small, mid-sized and large B2C and B2B companies shifted every aspect of their customer relationships, from acquisition all the way through renewals, to digital. As a company that\u2019s been through its own digital transformation, we have a deep understanding of what it takes to be a digital business and that experience makes us the ideal partner to help other companies do the same. Over the past decade, we have put the right technology, processes and people in place to precisely and persistently measure and manage performance every day at scale across each of our businesses. We developed a cross-company, real-time, data-driven operating model that leverages all of our Experience Cloud technology. The CXM playbook, which relies on continuous product, platform and process innovation, has fundamentally changed the way we run our Company and today we are helping our customers build their own CXM playbooks. The industry\u2019s most comprehensive offering, Adobe Experience Cloud features industry-leading applications and services built on the Adobe Experience Platform, leveraging Adobe Sensei, our AI and Machine Learning framework. Digital Experience revenue was $838 million in Q3. Subscription revenue excluding Advertising Cloud grew 14% year-over-year. Q3 highlights include increased adoption of Adobe Experience Platform and the launch of new capabilities that allow marketers to accelerate data collection across channels to enable faster, personalized experiences based on real-time insights; general availability of Data Governance capabilities in the Real-time Customer Data Platform; early traction with our Customer Journey Analytics service, which provides customers a complete view of the Customer Journey, online and offline; acceleration in the deployment of our Adobe Experience Manager Cloud Service; significant quarter-over-quarter growth for Commerce offerings; Working with our Advertising Cloud customers to wind-down our transaction-based offerings; key customer wins, included Eli Lilly, Truist, Nike, Lowe\u2019s, Shell, Lloyds and the U.S. Department of Commerce; a partnership with IBM and Red Hat to enable Experience Cloud deployment in hybrid cloud environments that further strengthens real-time data security for enterprises in regulated industries; and recognition as a Leader in six Gartner Magic Quadrant and Forrester Wave reports. In the Gartner Magic Quadrant for CRM Lead Management, Adobe was the leader, achieving the best scores across Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision. Adobe\u2019s record results would not be possible without the ongoing contributions and unwavering dedication of our employees around the world. They have demonstrated incredible resilience by quickly pivoting to a remote work environment without missing a beat. I am proud and grateful. Great companies are defined by how they manage through difficult times. Our strong corporate culture, focus on innovation, exceptional customers and partners, and always doing right by our communities, drives us and our success. We are excited about the tremendous opportunity ahead of us and look forward to continuing our strong momentum in 2020 and beyond. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. Adobe delivered outstanding performance in Q3, highlighted by strong net new Digital Media ARR, Digital Experience subscription revenue growth and record operating cash flows. Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, the ongoing remote work and learning-from-home environment provided an opportunity to offset normal Q3 Summer seasonality. Our success was driven by Adobe\u2019s unique ability to draw insights across our business in real-time utilizing our data-driven operating model. This enables us to understand demand for our solutions, make strategic investments to capitalize on the highest returns, and drive engagement and conversion across our channels, most notably our web properties. Throughout the quarter, we generated sustained levels of traffic and demand across our Adobe.com offerings, including during the summer holidays where purchasing patterns have historically softened. Utilizing our proprietary attribution technologies, we made variable marketing investments that enabled us to attract and engage new customers, delivering the strongest Q3 on record for Adobe, while at the same time maintaining fiscal discipline to accelerate earnings growth. As a result, in Q3 Adobe achieved record revenue of $3.23 billion, which represents 14% year-over-year growth. On a constant currency basis, total Adobe revenue grew 15% year-over-year. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.97 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.57. Business and financial highlights included Digital Media revenue of $2.34 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $458 million; Digital Experience revenue of $838 million; record cash flow from operations of $1.44 billion; remaining performance obligation of $10.34 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 1.5 million shares of our stock during the quarter. Adobe\u2019s strong third quarter performance shows the continued momentum across our cloud businesses. From knowledge workers to creative professionals, from small businesses to large enterprises, people are driven to engage digitally and are seeking tools that enable them to communicate more proficiently across digital platforms. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 19% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. On a constant-currency basis, Digital Media grew 20% year-over-year, and we exited the quarter with $9.63 billion of Digital Media ARR. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. We achieved Creative revenue of $1.96 billion, which represents 19% year-over-year growth, and we added $360 million of net new Creative ARR. Our Creative growth in Q3 was driven by investing to acquire new users across all geographies and segments; continuing our relentless focus on engagement to drive retention and renewal of existing customers; successfully closing enterprise term licenses with educational institutions, as well as growing our education business through individual subscriptions by students; driving awareness and licensing of our professional video products; focusing on converting free mobile app users to paid mobile subscriptions, including strong growth in Lightroom Mobile; and utilizing insights from our data-driven operating model to run targeted campaigns and promotions. Adobe Document Cloud delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth. We achieved Document Cloud revenue of $375 million, which represents 22% year-over-year growth, and we added a record $98 million of net new Document Cloud ARR. As with our Creative business, Document Cloud is benefiting from the changing nature of work and the continued importance of digital document solutions, as individuals, enterprises and governments look to pivot away from paper-based dependencies to digital workflows. Our Document Cloud growth in Q3 was driven by investing and driving awareness in our Acrobat web business; continuing to build momentum with our mobile monetization efforts with Acrobat Reader; increasing demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all geos; and building, progressing and closing pipeline for our enterprise offerings, with particular strength in Adobe Sign, which grew enterprise bookings more than 200% year-over-year. While we saw some recovery in the SMB segment during Q3 across Digital Media, smaller businesses continue to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment. We expect this to continue to impact our Team offering across the reseller channel and on Adobe.com. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q3, we achieved revenue of $838 million, which represents 2% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $729 million, representing 7% year-over-year growth. Excluding Advertising Cloud, Digital Experience subscription revenue grew 14% year-over-year. We continue to wind down the transaction-driven ad network business in Advertising Cloud. During Q3, enterprise sales and services implementations settled into a new normal of virtual engagements. We drove strong pipeline and customer acquisition across our Digital Experience solutions, as the digital transformation imperative continues to resonate with our customers. We saw acceleration of our Commerce business, and we drove increased adoption of our AEM Cloud Service and Adobe Experience Platform, which we expect to be growth drivers over the next decade. We saw particular strength with the number of transactions greater than $1 million in new annual subscription value that we closed in the quarter. While enterprises and smaller businesses continue to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment, spending in customer experience management is reemerging as the primary imperative to enable businesses to engage with their customers and ignite growth. Overall, while our focus is on investing for profitable growth, particularly in research and development, we drove significant savings from travel and entertainment and facilities operations as our employees work from home. After ensuring that our current resources are focused on the key priorities, we expect to ramp our hiring in Q4 and FY21 to capitalize on our large addressable markets. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $15 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the sequential currency increase to revenue was $10 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the year-over-year currency decrease to revenue was $25 million. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q3 was 10% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, in line with our targets. Our trade DSO was 37 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter, and 40 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO grew by 18% year-over-year to $10.34 billion exiting Q3 and grew sequentially by 4% quarter-over-quarter. Deferred revenue exiting the quarter was $3.45 billion. As I mentioned last quarter, our Adobe.com offerings, typically billed monthly, are reported as unbilled backlog, whereas channel offerings billed annually up front are reported as deferred revenue. The strength in acquisition on Adobe.com during the quarter continues to drive a mix-shift from deferred revenue to unbilled backlog. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $5.26 billion, and cash flows from operations in Q3 were a record $1.44 billion. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of $617 million. We currently have $2.9 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018, which goes through 2021. For Q4, factoring current macroeconomic conditions, typical year-end seasonal strength and the strategic shift related to our Advertising Cloud business, we are targeting : total Adobe revenue of approximately $3.35 billion; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 18%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $540 million; Digital Experience segment revenue approximately flat year-over-year; Digital Experience subscription revenue growing approximately 1% year-over-year, or 12% when excluding Advertising Cloud revenue; tax rate of approximately minus 90% on a GAAP basis and 10% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 485 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $4.29; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.64. The GAAP tax rate is benefitting from planned changes to optimize our international structure in Q4 to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates, as we discussed during our Q1 call earlier this year. In summary, we expect a strong Q4 to conclude another year of record revenues and earnings for Adobe. Through these times, the resilience of our employees and our business model have been evident. As our market-leading solutions continue to resonate with individuals and enterprises across the globe, we remain excited about the growth opportunities ahead. Back to you, Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, John. As we announced earlier this year, Adobe MAX, our annual creativity conference, will be an online event this October. Information about the event can be found at max.adobe.com. Today we also announced that Adobe will host its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call and financial analyst meeting online on December 10th, where we will provide an overview of the Company\u2019s strategy and financial targets for fiscal year 2021. Invitations will be sent to our analyst and investor list in the coming weeks. If you wish to listen to a playback of today\u2019s conference call, a webcast archive will be available on Adobe\u2019s IR site later today. You can also listen to a phone replay by calling the numbers shown above. The phone playback service will be available beginning at 5 pm Pacific Time today and ending at 5 premium Pacific Time on September 22nd. We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Shantanu, something maybe to start the day -- or my question\u2019s actually just going to be around the Experience Cloud business. Obviously, you guys are divesting the Advertising Cloud part of that. But, just in terms of the commentary, it seems like the pipeline's building nicely, RPO was up nicely in the quarter, yet revenue guidance for next quarter is down a little bit. I was wondering if you could just square that up, because it sounds like your enthusiasm for that opportunity still remains very-high. But, I think, some people might be wondering, why maybe is revenue not sort of matching up with that? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, happy to. And as you pointed out, I mean, firstly, digital transformation is a massive addressable opportunity. And it's clear that we are the leaders. We had a great quarter. Bookings grew north of 15%. As you saw, we had good revenue. We successfully have introduced brand new products, which we believe are going to be the growth drivers from what we did with the Adobe Experience Platform, what we did with Customer Journey Analytics, the Customer Data Platform, as well as what we are doing around both, Commerce as well as the Adobe Experience Cloud in the Cloud Service. So, the business and the interest frankly, because there isn't a small and medium business or large enterprise that isn't interested in how digital can help them deal with the current health situation. So, bookings have been strong, business has been strong. I think, as it relates to revenue, you have to continue to think about the wind-down of the Advertising Cloud business, which continues to happen. We expect bookings to be strong. And then, the other issue for us is really, as the macroeconomic environment, you think about the spending patterns, but net-net for us, we thought the business did really well. It was a great rebound, from what we had expected in Q2, which was both on the consulting side as well as on the net ASP, we thought it would be slightly slow. So, we're really excited. And we're in the sweet spot of what is clearly a growth business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Saket Kalia : Shantanu, maybe just to stay on the Digital Experience business. Zooming out a little bit strategically, I think Anil Chakravarthy is still getting settled in as leader of the DX business and field operations. I guess, the question is, what are some of his objectives, particularly in the DX business that you're most excited about for next year? Shantanu Narayen : So, Saket, first, I will say this, his has been the fastest ramp that I have seen of any executive that we've got. So, he is doing an absolutely fantastic job, and a great addition to what you know is already a very strong management team that I'm blessed with at Adobe. Maybe I would say three things. The first is on the product side, he's really got his hands around the platform and the innovation associated with the platform, the delivery of Customer Journey Analytics. We had a great quarter with the Adobe Experience Platform and a number of customers adopting it, what we are doing around CDP and the real-time nature of what we can do as well as intelligent services that are leveraging Adobe Sensei. So, on the product and innovation making sure that we have this platform that we integrate all our products is really added a lot of value there. But that will continue to be the area where I think we can completely differentiate ourselves relative to anybody else. Because while others are talking about providing this unified profile, as you know, we have tens of billions profiles already in Adobe Experience Platform. I think, the second area is with the unified organization really focusing on the customers and the customer centricity and what we are doing with partners. The structure for U.S. and international is set up. And he is focused on aggressively evangelizing both, our vision as well as the differentiation in the marketplace. And one side benefit, Saket, of everybody working from home is we can engage with customers so much better, and routine day consists of significant customer engagement. So, that's clearly the area that he's focused on, because he needs to be out there as the leader of this. And third, I would say, the culture. Adobe's culture has always been a unique point and focus on talent and hiring, and where there is significant opportunity, making sure that we have the best talent. So, he's already been able to recruit some key people as additions to his management team. But, there is a lot to do and there is a lot that he's done. And so, we're very excited about having him onboard. Saket Kalia : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Shantanu, Q4, the Digital Media guide well above the Street. You\u2019ve clearly seen a lot of great tailwinds in that business. I'm curious if you could just kind of unpack the drivers and what you're seeing for the upside surprise relative to Street numbers? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Brent, I'm surprised you didn't talk about the Q3 upside as well. I mean, we just saw [Multiple Speakers]. Fair enough. We saw tremendous performance. I mean, as you see, what's happening in both creativity and document productivity, Brent, I mean, the business is just firing on all cylinders. And that has to do both with products, as well as, frankly, with services. We didn't maybe comment specifically on the services, but the services, the stock business just continues to do well, there's no question we're gaining market share. The sign business has grown very successfully. But if you continue to think about, I think, what's driving that business, the first is, we sharpened our focus on usage and engagement. And the usage and engagement that we did really help improve retention rates back to the pre-COVID levels. So, that focus will just continue. We have a very large book of business. The education, education had a good quarter. So, we have continued focus on education. Individual apps, we talked about Lightroom, Photoshop and Premiere Pro as areas where there is a lot of interest in our business. And also, the sophistication of what we talked about, namely the marketing attribution, and models, it just helps us spend money so efficiently and sustain the durability of the acquisition of new customers and trends. So, as you pointed out, when we look at the second half performance, it just demonstrates how both, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud frankly are the preeminent platforms. And we should continue to see good strength from our Q3 back into Q4. So, we're excited. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Kash Rangan : Nice to go right after Brent here. Thank you so much, and congratulations on your quarter. Shantanu, you talked about how the pandemic has actually resulted in better customer engagement. But, as we come out of the pandemic, if there's ever such a thing called coming out of this pandemic if we got vaccine, how does the business perform? And do you feel that this actually lengthens the cycle for the transformation, or do you think we could be in a pocket, halo effect where things get pulled in a little bit, because we\u2019ve got all this time to do more work and there is a bit of catch up and then of course a longer term secular trajectory Digital Transformation is unchanged? I mean, how are we to think about for the environment? Environment is actually unusually supportive of your result -- not only your results but all of the software companies, so that you might get a little bit of pull back if we enter into a normal economy. Sorry to word it that way, but just curious to get your thoughts. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Kash, we've been talking about the trends that are going to be tailwinds across each of our businesses, whether it was Creativity, Document Productivity or a specifically to your question, Digital Transformation. The genie's not going to vote back in the bottle. I mean, we've certainly seen, as you point out, an inflection in the business, as it relates to the demand in digital transformation. But, my perspective on this business is, it's just going to gain importance. I think, as the macroeconomic environment improves, the spending will actually open up in terms of what people spend. And we've been touching on customer experience management as a imperative and a priority for enterprise spend for a while, and I don't think that changes. So, I think everybody's recognizing that not having a commerce website, not being able to engage digitally with customers -- and I think the two areas where we're seeing the most excitement is this unified profile. Because people now absolutely recognize where you have a physical presence and you have a digital presence, you have to absolutely create a unified experience, and that I think is only going to accelerate. So you will see more physical perhaps once the vaccine is present. But, that's not going to change the need to provide this unified experience. And on the marketing spend side, more and more is going to go digital and people will want to run more of these digital campaigns with customers. So, I think the basic trends of personalization of unified profile of customer experience management are only going to continue once the pandemic. And I actually feel like that should hopefully signal an improvement in the macroeconomic environment for everybody. I think, a lot of what's happened right now is people want to spend in digital, but their spending ability may be limited. And as that spending ability opens up as the economy improves, I don't think it changes the priority. I think, it frankly opens up spending. Kash Rangan : Very insightful. Thank you very much. Congrats. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Kash. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much, and congrats on the really strong Q3. John, my question is for you. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the variable marketing investments that enabled Adobe to attract and engage new customers, which clearly worked well. Can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of ROI trends on marketing spend and reasons to believe they may or perhaps may not be sustainable? Thanks. John Murphy : Sure. Thanks again, Brad for the question. I think, when we look at our capabilities with DDOM or data-driven operating model, the level of precision, which we\u2019re able to see performance in our business real time really allows us to surgically invest where we know we can be successful. And so, you can see that in the performance obviously in our books in Q3 and where we think we can drive a metric in Q4. So, we have a lot of confidence in investing for appropriate return. And also looking at the breadth of the different markets we're trying to attract to the platform's both CC and BC. So, we monitor that very carefully. We don't just throw money at in variable marketing just to see where it lands. We're actually measuring very completely every dollar that we invest in that space. Shantanu Narayen : And Brad, maybe if I were to add just a little bit on top of that, what you have to do is again, harking back to what we said is the overall addressable market opportunity for all of our businesses and on the Creative and Document Cloud route as we talk about a greater than $30 billion addressable opportunity. This sophistication just helps us target all those people with more efficiency. And, as John said, the constant changing nature of where that marketing goes, we definitely view that as a differentiation for us in terms of what product, what service, what geography across what channel. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. I wanted to touch on the gross margin within the Digital Experience business. And as talked about earlier, my understanding was that as the Ad Cloud winds down, there should be a gross margin benefit attached to that. But, if I look at the GAAP gross margins in Digital Experience, they\u2019re actually down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. So, sort of related to that first, how should we think about the costs associated with Ad Cloud rolling off the cost of goods sold line, over the coming quarters? And secondly, how should we think about the margin profile of that business once that wind down has happened? Shantanu Narayen : I can add, and then Jennifer, John, certainly feel free. I mean, overall, on that business, I think there was a slight performance in what we saw in the Ad Cloud revenue in the quarter. So, that might account for what you are referring to. I think, big picture, we just look at it and say, this is a growth business. What we've been able to do by aligning is to make sure that we're focused on the highest priority growth objectives. And so, it's still a growth business that's a real focus for us. But, as it relates to the overall margins, I mean, the Company performed exceedingly well. I would argue, maybe we were a little conservative, frankly, because we were unclear of the macroeconomic environment in terms of hiring, but we're certainly going to be opening up the hiring in research and development to continue to do differentiate ourselves. And on the Digital Experience, now that we've consolidated the organization, we've eliminated all the inefficiencies. We made the strategic change on Advertising Cloud. Now, we feel like it's all going to be profitable growth as we invest in the Digital Experience business. John Murphy : Quarter-over-quarter, it\u2019s really a part of the overall performance of Ad Cloud as we had been transparent for customers, we helped them transition to other services, but we also helped them run campaigns that were scheduled. In addition, the volume of activity across our other products did actually increase some of our cloud -- specially our cloud costs or third party cloud costs. So, that's something that we are marking very closely so that we can leverage the volume and negotiate our contracts appropriately and drive efficiencies across our clouds. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, the Company has often spoken in the past, for instance, at Summit presentations, that you've identified about four dozen used cases for DX. And the question is, setting aside Ad Cloud and whatever part of that mix they may have accounted for, what trends or evolutions have you been seeing in the number or mix of use cases within DX? And then, related to that perhaps you could also update us on the applications and intelligence services that you previewed back at Summit earlier this year, at how that might flow into the various use cases and more importantly, the DX growth that you're anticipating? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Jay, I think what's been consistent in the business and areas that continue to show both, growth as well as interest from customers is first and foremost content and data. And so, I think when we think about what's happening with content, the use case of people increasingly moving to cloud services on the Adobe Experience Manager side, creating new mobile applications than engaging directly with customers, I think that just continues to be an area of significant growth. On the data side, as we have added more capabilities, both to Adobe Analytics, as well as with the Adobe Experience Platform of being able to say what is the insight that people are getting, I mean, we're all looking at data, even more stringently in this environment. And so, the use case associated with going from collecting that data to getting insights on that data, the demand for that particular area of our solutions, including in intelligent services, whereas as you know, we have intelligence services that are associated with each of the solutions. That's an area of increase. I would say, the third area is this unified profile and just being able to get all of the data, that's clearly a trend, Jay. Because people recognize that they have all these silos. And that was even more accentuated by what's happening in the health. So, the need and desire to get this unified profile, so that they can serve the customer adequately, that use case. And when we are talking about Customer Journey Analytics, how you do the equivalent of what we have done with DDOM, I think that's the use case that's clearly resonating with customers. Commerce, I would say, the commerce use case and how you have to find different models, whether it's a subscription based business model of transacting with customers, whether it's loyalty based business model, so I think the commerce and using commerce to accomplish new business models, I think that use case has also increased. And the last thing I would say is between B2B and B2C? We've talked about that distinction blurring. But, I think all B2B companies, still stating how can we both work directly and engage with customers as well as through a network of partners, I hear that over and over again. So whether you're a company providing goods through a distribution channel, whether you're a car manufacturer, all of them recognize that they have to bridge this gap between being deemed a B2B company and a B2C company. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Sterling Auty : You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the SMB segment showed some improvement in the quarter. Can you just give us maybe from a high level, how much does the business have at this point to SMB? And even into that prosumer area where maybe some of the stimulus being talked about would have a bigger impact. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Sterling, we looked at both those trends quite a bit as we went through the quarter. And, I would say, as it relates to the stimulus, when the first package came out, this was early, we saw appreciable difference in sort of the payment successes and what happened with the individual subscribers. So, we saw a correlation associated with that, subsequent ones have not. And as I said, the engagement work that we did helped us get retention back up to the levels that we had pre-COVID. So, I don't know whether that was a initial catalyst. But to us, it just demonstrated the increased importance of the solutions that we provide. As it relates to the small and medium business segment, again, that is through the team offering a lot of that happens through the channel. And Q3 we saw some strengthen that. So, I don't know that we've broken out Sterling, what percentages exactly on individual versus team versus enterprise. It is a big part of our business because small and medium businesses certainly use both our creative and document tools, but we were pleased with what we expected. As it relates to our Q3 targets, we're still going to be a little cautious about seeing the rebound in that SMB. So, we're not necessarily expecting significant new acquisition in that, but we were pleased with what we saw in Q2. And long-term, we just continue to think that our solutions help them become a digital enterprise, which is going to become more important. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Alex Zukin : So, maybe a combo question for Shantanu and for John. Shantanu, you're seeing kind of now two straight quarters of all time highs for traffic on Adobe.com. And according to our data, it would actually appear the trend is only accelerating. So, I guess the question is back to that durability, kind of what's driving that acceleration? And how would you think about the durability of that 20-plus-percent Digital Media ARR growth trends as you sit here today? And then ultimately, maybe John remind us, what kind of rules should we remember in our models, as DM ARR stays above 20%? Is that -- what kind of churn assumptions we should think about when looking at Digital Media revenue growth next year? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Alex, as it relates to the overall macro demand, it's just the amount of content that's being created is just absolutely exploding and it actually doesn't matter whether you're, as we talked about, an individual who has a story that they want to tell a small and medium business who has to transact businesses online, and therefore has to create the appropriate content, whether it's a large enterprise that is increasingly engaging digital, and therefore wants the appropriate personalized content. And I think that trend will only continue to speak well for Adobe. We look at some other trends like the number of people engaging with us on Behance, which is our community. We're getting more part of Behance being used than ever before. What we are doing with Spark, which is allowing prosumers and others who have a task-based offering to come. So, we just continue to think that the amount of content being created and the amount of content being consumed is only going to go up. And we have the premier offering in that space, not only from the product side, but from also the DDOM side. And so, I think it really continues to augur well for us. And, we will certainly give you more color as we come up to fiscal '21 on what we expect moving forward. But, we're excited about the opportunity. John Murphy : Yes. In regards to your comments and we touched and Shantanu said, the efforts that we\u2019re putting to engaging our customers and making sure that they are using the right product for the right use case has really driven retention efforts really well in that engagement. And of course, the fact that we'll be able to see a return to kind of pre-COVID levels is indicative of people seeing value in the products that they\u2019re using. Alex Zukin : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Stan Zlotsky : Perfect. Thank you so much, guys. This is Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. A quick question for John. Very strong margins in Q3, record margins on operating margin side. What should we keep in mind as far as margins as we head into Q4, and what's embedded in the EPS guidance for the quarter? Thank you. John Murphy : Sure. Thanks, Stan. When we entered Q3 and really looked at really focusing our resources on the top priorities. Once we got through that activity and we felt really comfortable with the performance that we were seeing, we realized that we probably being a little conservative were slower out of the gate ramping our hiring. We're committed to ramping our hiring now going into Q4 and into FY21to really drive the opportunities that we see to drive performance in these opportunities. So, we're investing in R&D and you'll see that kind of manifest in our Q4 hiring and into FY21. And we do believe that some of the other OpEx savings that we\u2019ve had, onetime savings around travel and facilities and in-person events are going to change as we start to reopen our offices when it's safe. And so, we don't expect the level -- the lack of spending in those areas in Q3 to be sustainable going forward. So, that is something to consider when you look at the operating margin performance in Q3. Stan Zlotsky : Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Hi. I'm wondering, John, or Shantanu, if you could talk about retention, and you highlighted out of your prepared remarks around improvement in retention. And maybe just directionally, you talked a little bit about some headwinds there a quarter ago, where you are now versus retention in sort of the steady state? How much you dipped down, and if it varies much by the various segments of your Digital Media business? Shantanu Narayen : I think, Walter, maybe looking at it now in retrospect, I don't know if -- when COVID first hit, whether there was a shock to the system and therefore people reacted. And I think that has settled down, as we said in -- a couple of times. It's definitely gone back to the pre-COVID levels. I think, I would also give our team tremendous credit for what we've done around engagement. I mean, the good news for us, Walter, is we have such a variety and portfolio of products that we can use. And, let's take Acrobat where we haven't spent -- we haven't got as many questions. I mean, from everything we can do around Acrobat on the web, to what we can do with the Reader funnel to Acrobat. And so, we really just are a world class machine on both the acquisition and increasingly on the engagement retention. So, my best guess is there was a little bit of a shock to the system. That has definitely stabilized, that provided the impetus for us to really focus on engaging more with customers and delivering the value. And last but not least, I think it just shows how mission critical these products are. And so, again, it's very different by offering to the second part of your question. But, within enterprises, within creative pros, we just continue to see a really good retention and really good acquisition. Walter Pritchard : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Shantanu, you mentioned that the education vertical had a good quarter, and I think there was some uncertainty around health of spending here, given all the change institutions have had to go through. I guess, since we're in back-to-school mode right now, though, obviously a much more virtual bend to it. Can you talk about what you've seen out of the education vertical in terms of demand and usage patterns and how that works typically in back-to-school season, and kind of what insights that gives you as we progress through the school year? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Derrick. And again, I mean, first, let me acknowledge that I think for both parents of young kids as well as those who have college going kids, I mean, there is still a quite a bit of uncertainty of what happens. But, as it relates to the strength, I mean, we saw strength, both in terms of students, educators, as well as in institutions. And so, we saw strength across the board. Part of what I would attribute that to is, when it first struck and everybody was from home, if you have a young kid or a college going kid, you want to continue to invest in making sure that they have access to the best software. I think, we did a good job of provisioning Creative Cloud and ensuring that they have access to Creative Cloud. And then, we pretty actively went out with our field organization, both in terms of licensing products, as well as the enterprise type licenses that you can have for institutions to demonstrate it. And the last thing I would say is, we are seeing more and more curricula in these institutions also add so much more on creativity as part of their curricula. So, I think that's a trend that is also helping our business. Derrick Wood : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Mr. Wong, please unmute if you\u2019re muted. Ken Wong : Oh, sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. John, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, seeing an acceleration of Adobe Commerce. Just when thinking about how you guys licensed the product, when should we expect to see that benefit revenue? Is that something you're already capturing or is that down the line at renewal time? John Murphy : Yes, it really is both. Thanks, Ken, for your question. So, we certainly saw commerce revenue perform this quarter and certainly the bookings associated with the demand for commerce offerings increase this quarter. So, we just see the momentum there. People are really resonating with the product. They're seeing that it's a great add-on as well when they're looking at some of our other solutions in digital transformation in the segment. So, we think there's a nice tailwind there in commerce. Shantanu Narayen : And to your second question Ken -- I mean, John, we certainly have bands. And since we have bands and we don't charge based on necessarily the immediate transaction, what happens is as people come up for renewal, which was the second part of your question, Ken, yes, the intention is that they both true-up as appropriate and/or move to a higher band. Ken Wong : Great. Thanks, guys. Jonathan Vaas : Operator, we're coming up on the top of the hour. We'll take two more quick questions. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Thank you, and congrats on the strong quarter. I was impressed in the comment on the 200% year-over-year growth in enterprise bookings driven by Adobe Sign. Can you give more color? Is this growth in full Document Cloud, is this a portion of that? Any color on the percentage of document sign -- Document Cloud that is now from enterprise agreements? I appreciate it. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Mark. And as you point out, and we didn't get too many questions, I mean, the Document Cloud really had a very strong business. And at the macro level, the strength of Acrobat, all the verbs that we have including Sign, the frictionless Acrobat web and the platform APIs, we're really convinced we have the right platform for document creation, sharing, signing, exporting and scanning. I mean, scan also, the number of installs of scan, what we are seeing on mobile, so across all of our PDF solutions. When we are talking about the business as it related to Sign, Sign actually grew faster than the Document Cloud business. And the 200% statistic that we gave has to do with Sign standalone. The way we are going to market, we introduced Sign also in the channel just very recently. So, while that's early, we're seeing good traction with Sign in the channel. The primary route to market is either through Acrobat for individuals or through the enterprises. In the enterprises, we are seeing two forms of traction. The first is where people are using Sign as the core sign solution for all of their business processes. I think, some of the partnerships that we've announced as well with Microsoft as well as with ServiceNow, we expect to see that continue to grow. And in addition to that, we've actually seen some really good traction with our document experience -- experience document sellers also demonstrating how the combination of Adobe Experience Manager, which is the core website, plus what you can do around forms and signs for business processes, how that's growing. So, across the board, we saw some really good strength in that business. Operator : We'll take our last question from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman : Hi, Shantanu. It's Keith. And I wanted to follow up on that and stay with the Document Cloud. Over the last 11 quarters, Document Cloud ARR growth is, the low is kind of 31%, the high is 36%. And even in a challenging last two quarters, the May and August quarters, it's been towards the high end of the range. And my question is, as the economy improves, could you talk a little bit about the durability? In other words, can ARR growth continue in that 34% to 35% range as you look out over the next couple of quarters? And B, also just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, how you see your competitive offering or solution set stacking up, so to speak, against your primary competitor? Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Keith. I mean, first, as it relates to the sustainability and durability of the Document Cloud business, it wasn't an accident that at our last analyst meeting, we talked about Document Cloud being a separate, huge standalone opportunity and accelerating document productivity. That's why we spend as much time as we have on that. Traditionally, people, Keith, used to talk about the business moving from perpetual to subscription. It has so far exceeded all of that opportunity to really focus on creating brand new customer acquisition. The web as a funnel represents a huge growth opportunity for us. I've talked also about when you think about what's happening with organic searches and the ability for people to want to share information and how that's going to be a driver of the funnel. We're excited about the API economy and what we can do to make sure that any PDF that's created anywhere or any PDF that's scanned or signed that it uses Adobe technology. And so, at the end of the day, we just look at what we have with documents and the fact that we have PDF and the fact that we have reader ubiquity as a completely differentiated solution with respect to anybody else. And this business is such a large opportunity. This is not a zero-sum game. This is something that we just continue to believe is going to fuel our business for a long time. We frankly think we're in the catbird seat, and we have the best combined offering. We have great partnerships in this space. We're innovating so much on mobile, what we've done with this feature that we call liquid mode with AI to be able to make PDFs responsive. And so, I think while the pandemic, to the question that somebody else also asked, has perhaps accelerated this movement towards electronic documents, I don't think people are going to go back because they all see the benefits and the efficiencies of being documents. So, that's how we think about that business. And we'll certainly be happy to share a lot more at our earnings call. Since that was the last question, I do hope, Keith, that both you as well as others will attend MAX because we do intend to unveil the next generation of creative innovation at MAX. As I said, we have over 200,000 people already. But net-net, I would say Q3 was an outstanding quarter. I feel really good about the strategy that we have and the contributions of our employees who have executed incredibly well in what is truly a difficult environment. We all believe that digital is going to be mission-critical. It's going to be a driver of the economy globally. And between Creative, Document and Enterprise, we have three large markets that are growth markets where our innovation agenda is stronger. I will say, we're really pleased with how we rallied around reprioritizing to get the most critical initiatives to proceed with the right urgency. And as John mentioned, we feel very well positioned to invest in growth initiatives that will continue to drive what we aspire to be, which is a growth company that also delivers great profitability. But, stay safe, stay healthy. We really appreciate all of you joining us today. And we look forward to seeing you at MAX. Over to you, Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : This concludes the call. Thanks, everyone.",

    "content": "\ufeff Jonathan Vaas : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Welcome to the Adobe Q4 Earnings and 2020 Financial Analyst Meeting. I'm Jonathan Vaas, VP of Investor Relations for Adobe. You should have a copy of the press release we filed this morning as well as our investor relations datasheet. We've got a great program planned for you today, which is in many ways similar to what we've done in the past, and in a few ways different. This year marks my 10th analyst meeting at Adobe. The first was the year we had just launched Creative Cloud. And it's amazing to reflect on how that business has grown since then.  For my first nine analyst meetings, I was one of the many employees helping behind the scenes. And this year, I have the privilege of introducing the executive speakers as the head of Adobe's Investor Relations program, a role I assumed earlier this year, just after we had made the shift to working remotely. I've really enjoyed all of the conversations with investors and analysts about Adobe's business this year, and I look forward to meeting many of you in person at some point.  That leads to the other way today's program is a little bit different than what we've done in the past. This is our first virtual analyst meeting. I, for one, will really miss the opportunity to meet many of you and chat after the event, but we've also been learning this year about the power of communicating digitally and seeing that we are able to meet to reach a broader audience with a webcast than we might with an in person event.  Due to the format, we've streamlined the planned presentation today. But a long form slide deck has been posted to Adobe's IR site that has all of the detailed information you're used to seeing.  Let's take a look at the agenda. Shantanu will kick things off today by talking a bit about the quarter and fiscal year we just completed and then moving over to Adobe's vision and strategy for the future. Abhay will then talk about the company's vision from a technology lens. Scott will highlight our Creative Cloud strategy. Anil will go over our Experience Cloud strategy, and Gloria will talk about our strategy related to our people, as well as other Adobe stakeholders. Finally, John will provide a detailed financial summary and share Adobe's growth strategy. And then we'll go to live Q&A.  Before we get started, as a reminder, some of the information we'll be providing today includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ from these statements, and we encourage you to review the risk factors in our SEC filings for more information. Additionally, we'll be providing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations between the two can be found on Adobe's Investor Relations website.  I will now pass it over to Adobe's President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you, Jonathan. I'd also like to add my welcome. Thank you for joining our annual financial analyst meeting. Today's format is a little different than what we are used to. But to make the most of this year's medium, we'll use the time today to cover strategy, business momentum, as well as our financial performance. We posted the complete deck similar to what we've done in prior years. But rather than speak to every slide, we'll have the management team share their highlights in their areas. And we've always saved some time for Q&A at the end of our presentations.  First and most importantly, I hope you're all staying safe and healthy. It's really tragic to see the recent spate of casualties, but the progress in vaccines gives us all hope that the worst will soon be behind us.  And clearly, none of us could have predicted how everything would change overnight, and the world as we know it would change so dramatically. Digital has even more become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained. This new reality has only increased the importance and relevance of our solutions and accelerated the tailwinds that benefit our business. This combined with our business fundamentals, unparalleled innovation, and world class execution continues to drive our growth.  2020 was another momentous year for Adobe. And like all companies, our primary focus has been to protect the health and safety of our employees and continue to serve our customers.  We took swift and decisive action to direct our employees to work from home, suspend travel and cancel in-person events. And we focused on helping our customers make their own transition to digital overnight.  For example, we provisioned 30 million students with Creative Cloud, so that they could create from home. We implemented the government rapid response program to assist local governments.  With our Honor Heroes campaign, we galvanized our community to create artwork honoring the true heroes \u2013 essential workers. And we set the bar high for digital events with Adobe Summit, as well as Adobe Max. In fact, Adobe Max garnered 21 million views.  We continue to harness the trillions of transactions powered by the Adobe Experience cloud to provide a unique real-time perspective on the economy with the Adobe Digital Economy Index. And we pioneered new areas such as the Content Authenticity Initiative, which provides attribution functionality that creators can attach to their work to create more transparency around how content has been posted and edited.  Our leadership extends to not only what we do, but how we do it. And we're proud of the continued industry recognition that we receive. We continue to be a top riser on the Interbrand Global Best Brands of the Year for the fifth year in a row. We're consistently named one of the best places to work by both Fortune and Glassdoor.  And in an area that's becoming increasingly important to US investors, we're a leader whether it's in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index or the Bloomberg Equality Index.  But it's a product company at our core. It is our innovation engine that I'm most proud of as we continue to fire on all cylinders. With Creative Cloud, we continue to remain the clear leader in a category that's exploding. We delivered significant product innovation that extended our applications to multiple surfaces. We added greater collaboration capabilities to all of our leading applications. And we continue to break ground in new categories, while improving engagement as well as customer satisfaction.  The Document Cloud continues to have huge demand in this digital environment, with PDF and Adobe Sign all being mission critical across many businesses. We delivered more capabilities, or verbs as we refer to it, across desktop, web, mobile, and through our frictionless PDF services.  And with Experience Cloud, we continue to build out the world's most comprehensive customer experience management portfolio. And the new capabilities in the Adobe Experience platform have now been expanded to include real-time customer profiles. We delivered new services, intelligence services to further the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in organizations. We delivered new solutions like Customer Journey Analytics, which unifies cross channel data. And I'm excited that we recently closed the acquisition of Workfront, which is a leading work management solution for marketers.  On the financial side, after crossing the $10 billion mark in 2019, we haven't missed a beat. And as you can see from our targets, we expect to exceed the $15 billion mark in 2021.  And we're incredibly pleased to drive both top and bottom line growth, while generating cash and continuing to return to shareholders. In fact, in 2020, we achieved $12.87 billion in revenue, which represents 15% year-over-year growth. In Q4, we surpassed $10 billion in digital media ARR, which is a significant milestone for us as a company.  With the strong financial discipline that you've all been accustomed to, we continue to generate impressive cash flows from operations and generated over $5 billion in fiscal 2020. And we continue to focus on earnings per share with the earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis of $10.10, which represents 28% year-over-year growth.  I truly believe that these financial accomplishments set us apart from all other software companies, and the best is yet to come.  Adobe's mission is to change the world through digital experiences. And it has never been more relevant as people seek new ways to communicate, learn, and conduct businesses virtually.  The benefits of our innovation help billions across the globe. And the impact is experienced across every aspect of society. It motivates our employees to focus on having more impact and to invent the future.  When you think about the macro trends that we all experience, every industry is experiencing a tectonic shift towards all things digital. And I believe that the events of this year have only accelerated. The genie is not going to go back into the bottle.  And even regulated industries that have traditionally been slower to embrace digital have certainly picked up the pace this year. We have industries like healthcare that are transforming, whether it's through personalized medicine, telehealth and new ways, frankly, to engage patients.  On the creative side, it continues to be the golden age of design and creativity, and design continues to be a key competitive advantage because everyone at their heart is a creator. They want to express themselves across new devices with new modalities. And creativity is so essential to how we connect, how we cope, and how we learn.  Education has also been reimagined because digital is central to how students learn today, whether it's through remote education, as well as by unlocking new forms of creative storytelling. And digital is also breaking longstanding barriers to access to education, which is something great because it's making it more accessible.  The way we work will never be the same again. And it's great to see how the PC has experienced a tremendous revival as the computing workhorse. Documents are at the center of how work gets done. Paper to digital transformation is only accelerating, and every business process is going digital because every business is now a digital business.  Digital has become the primary way for all businesses to engage with their customers. And it's true that customer expectations are also at an all-time high because ecommerce is exploding. In fact, an annual holiday report that's powered by Adobe Analytics predicts that online holiday spending will reach $189 billion, which represents 33% year-over-year growth. And underpinning all of this is a massive shift towards artificial intelligence and machine learning, which will only further these forces at play.  At Adobe, our strategy is at the nexus of this digital revolution. And through technology, we believe we're transforming work, learn and play. We're relentlessly focused on looking around the corner. How do we drive towards the next big market opportunity to solve customer pain points and anticipate their needs?  We've pioneered and we're leading three massive growing categories \u2013 creativity, digital documents, and customer experience management. And we're relentless about expanding the customer segments we serve, adding more addressable market opportunity because we want to empower everyone, from the student to the small business owner to the largest enterprise in the world.  And I believe we win by creating pathbreaking technology platforms that will lead the industry for decades, and today work across the entire computing paradigm from the largest clouds to the smallest devices, and are built with a service oriented architecture that also enables us to have new monetization models.  In fact, our three industry leading cloud offerings are more mission critical than ever before across every geography and audience. With Creative Cloud, we're unleashing creativity for all giving anyone anywhere the tools to express their creativity. With Document Cloud, we're accelerating document productivity, modernizing how people view, share and engage with digital documents. And with Experience Cloud, we're powering digital businesses of all sizes, giving them everything that they need to design and deliver great customer experiences.  And underpinning our three clouds is the magic and power of Adobe Sensei, a significant differentiator for Adobe and an enabler to more rapid innovation.  As it relates to the creative business, everywhere we look, whether it's entertainment, education or the enterprise, content is fueling the digital economy. And that's driving an explosion of creators, tools and assets that all represent tailwinds for our business. The reality is that creativity is for everyone, from the students submitting their next school assignment to the creative professional making an ad. Everybody has a story to tell. And when you look at the categories, whether it's web content or mobile application, creation, imaging, video, animation, screen design, augmented reality, AR, 3D, they're all surging in this era of digital storytelling.  Creativity is essential because more than ever before, this year has shown us the power of creativity in enabling people to express themselves to connect and to cope. We believe that creativity is one of the fundamental skills in the 21st century. And as machines get faster and smarter, skills that are uniquely human like creativity will become increasingly more essential.  Creativity is also now multiplayer. Because whatever your skill level, today's creative process is becoming more iterative and collaborative. And all creative professionals must manage these multiple work streams across increasingly remote and dispersed teams, requiring seamless, cloud-based enabled collaboration and workflows that drive this productivity. Social communities like Behance that we have and Live tutorials are also providing new ways to learn and to be inspired. For us, Adobe Creative Cloud's vision is to be the one-stop shop, from inspiration to monetization. You'll hear from Scott later, but let me expand a little bit on our strategy. First, we want to advance every creative category. And we're a category leader in core creative categories, including photography, design, video, illustration, and layout. And we're expanding our leadership in new and emerging categories, including screen design and immersive meeting media, like 3D, VR and AR. And what this strategy has enabled us to do is to acquire new creators through single lab offerings, and then demonstrate the benefits of the entire Creative Cloud offering over time.  We're focused on building multi-surface systems, building solutions for every surface and system because we want to enable anybody to create wherever and whenever inspiration strikes. We truly believe that these devices are not just consumption devices anymore, but every device should also be a creation device. We're focused on adding collaboration services because we can ensure that content can be seamlessly managed in the cloud and accessed from any device. And what this enables us to do on the business side is to increase engagement, but also to acquire new stakeholders and expand our customer base with these new monetization opportunities. We want to engage and inspire the community. And our vibrant communities, which are a critical driver of both acquisition and engagement, are succeeding. In fact, we've grown to over 25 million members on Behance, which represents a huge opportunity for further upsell into the broader Creative Cloud ecosystem. And programs like Adobe Live enable us to provide forums for creators and to promote active use and learning.  We've always maintained that retention is the new growth, and that is more relevant than ever before as we've crossed $10 billion in digital media annualized recurring revenue from our current subscribers. At the end of the day, we're focused on democratizing creativity, enabling anyone from a student to a social media influencer, from a professional photographer, filmmaker and designer to express their creativity.  And we delivered on new applications like Photoshop and Illustrator on tablets, consumer apps like Photoshop Camera and easy-to-use storytelling apps like Premiere Rush and Spark, which are all attracting new users and expanding our base.  But in addition to this tremendous product innovation, we have a data-driven operating model which is enabling our ability to capture this expansive opportunity because we have a tremendously sophisticated understanding of our customer and we're able to serve up personalized experiences and offers at every part of this digital funnel and journey. And what this enables us to do is unlock engagement, as well as provides us with new upsell opportunities.  And when you put this all together, mapping the products and services that we're targeting across these expansive segments and adjusting for factors like non-genuine usage, the Creative Cloud total addressable market is projected to be approximately $41 billion in 2023. $20 billion of that addressable market is coming from creative pros, which includes Creative Cloud apps, and new services like Adobe Stock. $21 billion of the addressable market opportunity is coming from the broader communicator and consumer segments, which includes products like Spark and Premiere Rush, as well as the non pro users of Creative Cloud, as well as Stock. And our aspiration to unleash creativity will continue to be this north star that we will execute against for many years to come.  Among the key growth drivers that I'd like to highlight for this business include the ability to acquire new customers through category single applications for screen design, video and 3D, using mobile increasingly as a funnel through the creation of mobile IDs through mobile monetization services, as well as upsell to the multi-surface systems and new services such as Adobe Stock, as well as continued global acquisition and expansion.  Turning to our second growth opportunity. It's clear and obvious that digital documents are now mission critical in powering the modern business. And we have seen this massive acceleration as businesses all shifted to remote work overnight.  The truth is that artificial intelligence and machine learning, the cloud and mobile are all redefining the notion of productivity. It's reshaping how we work. It's enabling greater flexibility. And it's requiring more collaboration across global dispersed teams.  And artificial intelligence is only amplifying this productivity. We're seeing a massive adoption of paper to digital processes and workflows. And the paper-based tasks of the past are all now being moved digital.  And the other aspect that's happening, the cloud ecosystems are driving a new business opportunity, what we call the API economy, which is revolutionizing how apps and services are both being built, as well as being monetized. What drives this is the fact that PDF continues to be the lingua franca for how things happen on the Internet. We have over 2 billion mobile and desktop devices that have had Reader or Acrobat installed. In fact, we have 300 billion PDFs that are opened in Document Cloud applications over the last 12 months.  And so, strategically as we think about the opportunity, the first is to expand what we call our Sensei-powered Acrobat verbs and it's to enable all document actions, editing, sharing, scanning and signing. It's to unlock the value that exists in trillions of PDFs that have been created by deciphering these unstructured PDFs and making them truly responsive on mobile devices. In fact, one of the innovations we're particularly proud of is called liquid mode in the Acrobat Reader, which both deciphers and automatically reformats text, images and tables for quick navigation and consumption, and is powered by Adobe Sensei.  We think mobile fuels this new business opportunity because PDF usage has absolutely exploded across mobile devices. Making this Acrobat experience more frictionless across mobile and web is truly leveraging the ubiquitous PDF format that we have. And we're expanding both the free and paid mobile customer base.  We're also increasingly capturing the PDF demand with Acrobat Web because what we are doing is converting the massive demand for PDF web, such as create and edit through search through our frictionless services. With every business going digital, the third aspect of the strategy is to enable the paper to digital transformation through services that we have, like Acrobat and Adobe Sign, but also to leverage what we deliver through the Adobe Experience platform and the Adobe Experience Manager, as well as Adobe Experience Manager Forms.  And we want to unleash an entirely new PDF ecosystem with documents services, which provides APIs to third-party developers, and they will then find new and exciting ways to use PDF and we will be able to monetize those services.  So, let me expand on just a few of these opportunities. There are about 50 million searches for PDF actions every month. And what we want to enable is, through a single click, best-in-class Web experience, deliver quick access to actions that the customer wants, and allow them to deliver and discover a more comprehensive set of Acrobat offerings. This is similar to what we've done with the successful Reader upsell motion, which is to drive engagement around PDF, to enable people to complete their tasks, and then upsell people from the free product to Acrobat subscriptions.  The other aspect of our Document Cloud strategy is to deliver a unified Document Cloud platform. This includes Acrobat, AEM Forms and Adobe Sign, which are central to the way work is getting done today.  And we have a tremendous go-to-market advantage because it's the sophistication of our data-driven operating model that gives us a really incredible understanding of our customers, how to reach them, how to serve them effectively, and we have the ability to truly optimize everything on the funnel from acquisition, all the way through retention.  We're continuing to expand the Sign scale and reach into fast growing new verticals, with significant go-to-market partnerships, including with Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow, and Notarize. And we will continue to invest in the brand equity associated with PDF as the lingua franca of the Internet. We're incredibly excited about the second growth pillar, the Document Cloud strategy and the broader addressable market that it represents. And we expect the addressable market to grow to $21 billion in 2023.  We're benefiting from the move to subscriptions, we're benefiting from visitor acquisition, we're benefiting from mobile, and the PDF mobile opportunity itself represents approximately $11 billion of this addressable market.  And on the document services platform, we're driving growth with electronic signatures and new embedded services, which we believe represents $10 billion in addressable opportunity. Our third growth initiative is all about customer experience management. And we continue to believe that it represents a massive opportunity with the acceleration that we all see and digital transformation.  Because the reality is that today every business is a digital business. And the imperative for digital customer engagement has never been greater. Because every business has to understand their customers and deliver personalized experiences. Because all of us, as consumers, we buy experiences, not just products.  The reality today is that customers are expecting this engaged personalized digital experience, and we want these interactions to feel easy and efficient. They need to be well designed, they need to be context aware, and they need to be seamless across channels and secure and delivered at the exact microsecond at which we expect it.  And delivering a next generation platform to deliver and drive this experience is easier said than done because it requires businesses to completely merge content, data and artificial intelligence to deliver this compelling, relevant personalized experience in real time. And the truth is that companies must design for this brilliance, but wire for intelligence. Adobe created the digital marketing category. And we're now the leader in a much broader opportunity \u2013 the customer experience management category. Our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive set of applications and services grouped in solution areas such as content and commerce, customer journey management, customer data and insights. And now with the closing of our Workfront acquisition, work management. And Anil Chakravarthy will spend a little bit more time talking about our strategy. The second aspect is to deliver this next generation technology platform, Adobe Experience platform, which provides the underlying infrastructure to make CXM a reality and is years ahead of anything that any competitor has provided. Because it truly brings together hundreds of data points to create this unified customer profile that companies can activate to deliver the personalized experience at scale.  Our vision is also to deliver an industry-leading marketing system of record. With the Workfront acquisition now being closed, we have the leading growth management product for marketers.  And while, unlike most companies, most of our growth is organic, we do use inorganic opportunities strategically, and we have an incredibly successful track record of acquiring, growing and scaling these companies. We have a longstanding set of partners and an ecosystem with Workfront with over 1,000 joint customers. And Workfront is already equipped with APIs for not just Experience Cloud, but also Creative Cloud, which represents opportunities to further leverage and deliver synergies across our businesses.  One of the key assets that we have is the ability to deliver a scaled go-to-market, cutting across the entire C suite, given the affinity that both customer CIOs and CMOS have for Adobe. Because all businesses are now working to rearchitect their systems around the customer, which requires this strong partnership between the chief marketing officer and the chief information officer.  And this enables us to scale our go-to-market across the entire C suite, which is driving higher value contracts as well as services. And we continue to have an explosive partner ecosystem that believes in our vision, and is delivering unique expertise to our joint customers.  Our total addressable market, when we think about it for the Adobe Experience Cloud, is estimated to be approximately $85 billion in 2023. And that's comprised of customer data and insights, which continues to be a huge opportunity because intelligence is increasingly the lifeblood of every organization. So, this represents an approximately $26 billion addressable opportunity. The explosion of content and commerce where we're the absolute leader is driving a $44 billion opportunity. And customer journey management, which includes products like campaign and email marketing, as well as B2B marketing and demand generation, which includes account-based marketing and lead management, is expected to be a $15 billion opportunity. As we've said before, these are large and growing categories, which are top of mind for every business.  To summarize, we believe that we have the right strategy that's being applied to an exceptional opportunity that is approximately $147 billion in 2023. We have a proven capability to both create and continuously lead these categories. We're thinking bigger about our businesses and the customers that we serve, from consumers and students to communicators and the creative professionals and the entire C suite. We have leading products, services and platforms to unleash creativity, accelerate document productivity, and to power digital businesses.  Our secret sauce is the over 20,000 talented employees that we have that are all rallied around our mission and the impact that they can have. We have a revered brand all across the globe. We have world class financial discipline that's driving both top and bottom line growth with an impressive margin. This is truly an expansive opportunity. And we're well positioned to capture it.  I certainly believe that Adobe's best days are ahead of us. We expect to cross $15 billion in revenue next year. We have a huge addressable market, industry-leading applications, services and platform and an unparalleled innovation engine.  Let me just quickly touch on some growth drivers that we believe will continue to propel this momentum on the Creative Cloud. In addition to our leading applications across every category, mobile as a funnel as well as our product monetization opportunity is huge. Services such as Stock are becoming meaningful parts of the ARR growth. New categories like video, Web services, as well as 3D and on.  On the Document Cloud side, the continued adoption of web-based PDF services, mobile-based PDF services and Acrobat subscriptions, the ability to deliver Adobe Sign to target both the small and medium business as well as the larger enterprise through both seat expansion as well as through document workflows.  And on the Experience Cloud, continuing to deliver this next generation technology platform delivering Sensei intelligence services, the ability to leverage a partner ecosystem and to cross and upsell in both mid-market and commercial as well as to drive new logo growth and to continue to make sure that we deliver value, drive customer success and maintain retention. And now, what I'd like to do is to have a Abhay Parasnis, both our CTO as well as somebody who has recently taken on responsibility as Chief Product officer for Document Cloud, to talk about our technology vision. Abhay? Abhay Parasnis : Thanks, Shantanu. Good morning, everyone. It's great to talk to all of you again. Shantanu talked about the broader opportunity and strategic imperatives for Adobe. I would like to take next few minutes to talk about our technology vision and share my excitement for the road ahead.  Being a product company at our core, we have always taken a long-term view of building deep technology platforms that are highly defensible and drive industry breakthroughs. With everything going on this year, I'm especially proud of the sheer breadth and depth of innovations our teams have delivered. Illustrator on iPad and Neural Filters in Photoshop, liquid mode and Acrobat Web in Document Cloud, and AEM cloud and real-time CDP and Experience Cloud are just few examples of innovations we have delivered.  And this incredible pace of innovation is only exceeded by the massive scale at which we operate today. With trillions of activations served from Experience Cloud to hundreds of millions of mobile app downloads and more than 2 billion devices running Reader and Acrobat software today, we truly have unmatched scale from cloud to the edge.  Now, a key aspect of our technology strategy is to develop a consistent architectural viewpoint across all of our products. We think of this unified architecture at three levels. Multi service experiences for our apps, a rich portfolio of services and API's, and our Sensei AI stack built on shared content and data platforms. Everything we do across our three clouds is guided by this unified technology vision and gives us a significant strategic advantage. Increasingly, we are thinking beyond discrete app silos to delivering new modalities and fluid multi surface experiences across desktop, mobile and Web.  For example, in Creative Cloud, we are adding modern Web and collaboration technologies to core imaging and video workflows in applications like Photoshop and Premiere, evolving them into complete creative systems.  Similarly, in Document Cloud, we are taking the best-in-class PDF runtimes on PCs and bringing them to both Web and mobile platforms for a consistent multi-surface PDF experience.  And in Experience Cloud, we are uniquely focused on a new kind of customer experience, one that's real time and hyper-personalized across every single touch point.  At the services tier, we are not only building an increasingly rich portfolio of services, but we are focused on three cross cutting themes. First, we are embedding collaboration deeply at the core of all our applications, converting our best-in-class single user apps like Photoshop or Acrobat to multi-user collaborative solutions. And because we uniquely understand our file types and workflows, we can enable a much richer contextual collaboration for users, as opposed to a generic file sharing or communication platform.  Second, using the shared content and data platforms, we are enabling unique cross cloud use cases, going from creators to knowledge workers to marketers. This is something that only Adobe can deliver.  Lastly, we are increasingly focused on the API economy opportunity by exposing our services via open APIs to developers and ISVs in the ecosystem. You will see us aggressively focus on this new vector.  Last, but not the least, I've talked to all of you about Adobe Sensei, our generational bet on AI. Sensei is already having a profound impact with our teams delivering hundreds of Sensei-powered features across our three clouds.  We started Sensei with AI features delivered within existing apps. But by leveraging our unique understanding of our users' workflows and usage patterns, we have built a specialized Sensei platform, one that's focused on creativity, documents and customer experience domains. With this platform in place, we are now positioned to push the limits with completely new kinds of AI first apps. Liquid Mode in Document Cloud is one great example of this. This was a multi-year journey and required us to solve some unique and hard problems. Using the latest techniques in AI, machine learning and computer vision, we trained Sensei to deeply understand the trillions of PDS that exists in the world. And then using that intelligence, we are able to generate structure out of unstructured PDFs that are across the world. Initially, we are using this to create a delightful experience on mobile devices, but the possibilities ahead are truly exciting, with document intelligence breakthroughs in areas like semantic understanding or document summarization. And like Liquid Mode in Doc Cloud, we are also working on unique Sensei services for creative intelligence and experience intelligence.  Sensei is a key R&D priority with long-term strategic advantage, one that's letting us build truly differentiated capabilities and delight customers with Sensei-powered Adobe magic.  As our customers rely on Adobe for ever-more mission critical needs, we are laser focused on engineering excellence and getting the basics right every single day. We are one of the first SaaS companies that has built a multi-cloud foundation, enabling us to deliver across various public, private and hybrid cloud environments. And doing so with high levels of operational excellence as well as cost efficacy.  Also, with Adobe's Common Controls framework, we are able to meet enterprise expectations for security, compliance, and privacy requirements, as well as global regulatory landscape.  Lastly, we continue to play a thought leadership role in the industry with various standards and other efforts like our Content Authenticity Initiative and Open Data Initiative.  In closing, the opportunity ahead for Adobe is truly exciting. From future of creativity to reimagining documents to opportunity to completely rewired customer experience. We have a world class engineering team with a deep culture of innovation and investments in foundational technology platforms that enable us to deliver with speed and scale.  I have never been more confident about Adobe's technology agenda, and I'm super excited about our ability to go invent the future.  Now, let me hand over to Scott Belsky, Chief Product officer for Creative Cloud, to talk about Creative Cloud strategy. Over to you, Scott. Scott Belsky : Thanks, Abhay. So, while I've outlined more details of our Creative Cloud strategy in the deck, I'm excited to share a quick summary right now. Big picture, we are seeing tremendous growth momentum in Creative Cloud because creativity has never been more important than it is now. And we saw this at our most recent Max conference, which has become the premier global creativity conference. That's blew away all previous records with over 21 million views worldwide.  Why is creativity so critical right now? Well, for starters, everyone wants to stand out \u2013 at work, at school, on social and even in their family projects. And creative expression is how they do it.  Within the enterprise, companies more and more recognize that creativity is this competitive advantage. And employees want to stand out, whether it is with their presentations, how they visualize data, or become more active stakeholders in their own product and marketing experiences.  In the workplace of the future, creativity is how people will thrive, and frankly, keep their jobs as AI takes over more and more of these productivity focused roles.  All of these shifts up-level the role of creativity and create a tremendous opportunity for Creative Cloud and a responsibility for us to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of new creators. So, let's take a look at the five pillars of our strategy for Creative Cloud. First, we are innovating to advance every creative category. Our professional customers want to push the boundaries of their fields and achieve more in less time. One way we're enabling this is through Adobe Sensei, which Abhay talked about, our artificial intelligence engine. In Photoshop, for instance, we recently launched Neural Filters, a new platform powered by Sensei that allows customers to make sweeping changes with just a scroll of a slider. These Neural Filters are truly magical. You can turn night into day and literally turn a frown into a smile.  And neural filters are just one example of our Sensei-powered breakthroughs. At Max, we launched dozens of new Sensei features across our creative categories, and we're helping customers explore new mediums, like 3D and immersive, with tools such as Substance, Dimension and Arrow.  The pandemic has forced many teams to turn to 3D tools as they can render an image or video rather than have an in-person shoot. One great example is Ben & Jerry's, who levered our 3D and immersive products to execute a critical campaign about getting ice cream delivered during the pandemic.  They found what many companies are finding that 3D rendered images are indistinguishable from traditional photos and they're far more efficient and actually less expensive to produce. So, we expect a surging interest in that field to continue, especially as new mediums like augmented reality go mainstream.  These innovations add value for creative professionals and help ensure that Creative Cloud remains the logical choice for modern teams struggling with content velocity, our way of talking about the insatiable need for more formats and more platforms and just more content more personalized every day. And we're committed to extending their creativity in new directions. The next pillar of our strategy for Creative Cloud is a continued transformation of our category-leading products to become cloud-based multi-surface systems. Creativity is no longer confined to the desktop. And we made a lot of progress in extending our flagship products across more surfaces.  Over the last year, we've brought Photoshop and Illustrator to the iPad, and we launched Adobe Fresco, the industry's most powerful drawing and painting app on Windows and Apple tablets last year, and brought it to the phone this year.  Customers tell us that the portability of iPad apps unlocks huge advantages. Designers for [indiscernible] Japanese theme parks, for instance, use illustrator on the iPad to sketch out new features while they're actually inside the park. It really lets them see how the design will actually fit in in-person in-place.  So, here's what we've learned from this evolution from product to service from multi-system platform expansion. We know that customers who use our products across multiple devices have higher satisfaction and better retention, and we know that offering a more modern interface on mobile devices is inviting for new customers and is an effective way to bring new customers into Creative Cloud from the mobile app stores.  So, we're continuing to extend our applications on to new surfaces, including the Web, which will engage an even broader set of customers and unlock another level of possibility for Creative Cloud. Another major part of our strategy is the development and seamless integration of powerful services that enable collaboration. No doubt, we've entered a new era of creativity that is deeply, deeply collaborative.  The next generation of our customers grew up in the age of Google Docs. They expect everything to be collaborative by default. And we've enabled this through our investments in Creative Cloud services over the last few years. We launched Creative Cloud Libraries, which helps teams share creative ingredients from fonts and colors to vectors and images.  We rolled out Cloud Documents, which allows customers to easily share their work with collaborators and stakeholders. And with services like stock and fonts funds integrated at the point of need within our products, we're ensuring that teams have all the content they need to start a project without ever leaving Creative Cloud.  Finally, we're making it much easier for stakeholders to review and share comments directly in our desktop products. All of these collaborative features make Creative Cloud the single source of truth for creative assets, ensuring greater lifetime value. These services also unlock new business opportunities and expand our footprint by engaging stakeholders beyond the traditional creative team, whether it be for review purposes, copywriting, or leveraging templates for social media marketing.  Another area of focus is engagement and community inspiration. We're bringing many kinds of new customers into Creative Cloud these days. But to keep them, we have to ensure that they are engaged, that they're learning new skills, and that they're continuously inspired to try new tools and techniques. We're improving engagement by reimagining the new user journey, providing a more personalized experience for every customer that is infused with community and educational content. And we become very, very data driven as we optimize these flows.  We're providing many more ways for people to learn new skills. Traffic to Adobe Live, our rich offering of live streams, by Behance members using our products and tutorials has doubled this year. And we have doubled our content in response. And the engagement with these live streams is truly remarkable. Over the last year, the average watch time is more than an hour and 20 minutes.  We've also enabled live streaming in our iPad apps, so that any customer can easily go live from within the product and share the URL on social networks. Others can click the link and learn by looking over the shoulder of an experienced creator and download the app to give it a try as well.  And we personalize learning experiences within our products. And as the more we personalize, the better we meet each customer exactly where they are. And because the greatest inspiration, of course, comes from seeing what others are creating, we're doing more to convene a global community of creatives. We've built a new community set of features in products like Lightroom. And Behance, our global creative community near and dear to my heart, has grown to 25 million members with over 1 million people visiting the site every single day. All of these efforts not only grow the top of the funnel, but also make it more likely that these new customers will be successful, inspired and engaged.  Finally, let's talk about democratizing creativity, which Shantanu mentioned in the beginning. We want to empower the world to create with a new generation of web and mobile products that are freemium and easy to use, and that leverage Adobe's core technology.  When anyone searches the web, to edit a photo or make a flyer, we will present easy-to-use Web apps that help them complete their project and encourage them to go further to take it to the next level.  On mobile, Photoshop Express, Premiere Rush and Adobe Spark empower everyday consumers to create content that stands out on social media. In the year ahead, we're bringing these products closer together to enable customers to work across them and to extend their work to the web. And we're doing this in a way only Adobe can. We're bringing powerful time saving features, many powered by Sensei to these mobile and Web apps.  We're also prioritizing interoperability with the rest of Creative Cloud, so that more casual creators can work together with creative professionals, and so that they can take their work to the next level in an app like Photoshop or Illustrator when they're ready to do so. I'm excited to share more on these product investments in the year ahead. So, to sum it up, our view of our market is expanding to $41 billion in TAM in 2023 because the importance of creativity is growing fast and the number of creators worldwide is exploding.  Our work over the next few years will ensure that Creative Cloud stays at the cutting edge of creativity in new mediums, that it supports the growth of collaborative creativity, and that it welcomes new generations of creators, with a new generation of tools and with the learning, inspiration and community that will keep people engaged and successful. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to my colleague Anil, who oversees the digital experience business to talk about Experience Cloud. Anil? Anil Chakravarthy : [Technical Difficulty] also responsible for our worldwide field organization.  I want to give you some context and color on the Experience Cloud strategy that Shantanu outlined. You should have the full presentation that we have provided. In the first half of 2020, when COVID hit, we saw businesses focus on their employee safety and wellbeing and ensuring business continuity. We pivoted and worked with our customers to navigate that new normal.  In the second half, we saw businesses doubling down on customer experience management in response to heightened customer expectations. Customers are digital first now. And from every business, they expect engaging and personalized experiences. And this has put more pressure than ever on businesses to accelerate their digital engagement. It's also accentuated how hard it is for businesses to deliver a great experience to their customers across all touchpoints.  In the current environment, that has been no small feat. Businesses need to account for external factors like privacy regulations and data sovereignty, and master internal challenges like fragmented customer data and manual inefficient processes.  So, it's become clear that companies need a next generation technology platform for customer experience management. And this has created a massive $85 billion market opportunity for CXM, and Adobe is uniquely positioned to address this.  Our mission is more relevant than ever. And our strategy of powering digital businesses is resonating with brands across industries and around the world.  Now we saw that in spades in 2020. 93% of our top 100 customers have three or more Experience Cloud solutions, and our average ARR with them has grown to $8 million, nearly three times what it was in 2015. Let me highlight one of those top customers, Verizon. Over the last five years, Verizon has standardized on Adobe for CXM across their consumer, business and media groups. The Adobe Experience platform provides real time responses in 250 milliseconds at cloud scale across billions of profiles.  Verizon is leveraging AEP to deliver personalized communications, optimize customer journeys, increase conversions, and create customer loyalty. As a result, our ARR from Verizon has grown 700% over the last five years. This is a great example of the growth trends we see across our customer base.  Turning to our strategy for Experience Cloud. It's based on Adobe's own successful transformation journey. We've taken the principles and insights from our data driven operating model and created a customizable playbook that any customer can use to power their digital business with next generation customer experience management.  We have five pillars in our strategy, as Shantanu outlined. First, it's a comprehensive set of applications and services for customer data and insights, content and commerce and customer journey management.  Now these apps and services are delivered on an integrated Adobe Experience platform. AEP is a next gen platform to deliver real-time personalization at scale, with nearly 17 trillion segment evaluations per day, leveraging first party data, cloud scale, powered by Adobe Sensei, and extended by our open ecosystem of partners and developers.  Now, we do the hard work of delivering the best of both worlds to our customers, comprehensive apps and services, integrated on to a common cloud scale platform. I've been in the world of data for a long time now. And it's clear to me that AEP is years ahead of our competitors in capabilities and production deployments.  Third, we're excited about our recent acquisition of Workfront, and we've heard great feedback from customers and partners. We're laying a strong foundation for a marketing system of record that will enable our customers to have greater efficiency and agility in executing their campaigns and to optimize their campaigns with real time insights.  Fourth part of our strategy, we've been a trusted partner to CMOs since we created the digital marketing category and now we are trusted partners to CIOs as well. And in mid-2020, we combined our worldwide field operations and digital experience into a single organization that I lead, and that has enabled us to scale our go-to-market to address the needs of enterprises from mid-market customers to the largest brands in the world. Finally, we work really closely with our global ecosystem of over 2,800 SIs and technology partners to drive business value and sustained growth.  So, in closing, I'm incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Experience Cloud is a growth business, and we will combine our go-to-market and product organization to be well positioned to fire on all cylinders.  When you look at our products, our platform, our innovation powered by Adobe Sensei, our customer relationships, our brand and the investments we're making, Adobe is the clear leader in customer experience management. And we are in the best position to help businesses deliver personalized, engaging digital experiences to all of their customers. Thank you. And now, let me bring up our Chief People Officer, Gloria Chen. Gloria Chen : Thanks, Anil. And hello, everyone. A year ago, as Chief Strategy Officer, I spoke to you about Adobe's growth story, our total addressable market, and the tremendous opportunities across our business. As you've heard today, our strategy is more expansive than ever. And I'm confident in our ability to succeed because of our proven track record of transformation, something I've seen firsthand multiple times in my 20 plus years at the company.  And I believe our secret sauce has been the combination of a winning strategy, great people, and an exceptional purpose-driven culture. My pivot from corporate strategy to employee strategy earlier this year was a natural move. People are our greatest asset. And as Chief People Officer, I'm excited to be carrying the torch for our values, our history of progressive people centered benefits and programs and our commitment to the growth and development of over 22,000 employees around the world, now including Workfront, who joined us earlier this week.  Increasingly, companies are viewed by employees, customers and stakeholders as an extension of their identity, values and community. In 2020, our core values were on full display, being genuine, exceptional, innovative, and involved.  As we responded to COVID, we put the health and safety of our people first. We increased communications, rolled out work from home benefits, and encouraged scheduling flexibility. We took care of our communities, providing customers with flexibility and students with free Creative Cloud licenses. And our employees really stepped up this year, with 70% engaging in volunteerism online. Our employees have responded with gratitude and pride in our approach and are more engaged and productive than ever.  As a people-centered company, we've always focused on fostering an inclusive culture, what we call Adobe For All. Because we believe that when employees can be their authentic selves, they do their best work. And when we have diverse teams, we're more innovative and reflective of the customers we serve.  For employees to feel supported in and outside of work, we invest in learning and development programs, community networks, and family friendly benefits. We're a leader in pay parity across gender and ethnicity and we're examining opportunity parity for fairness in promotions and horizontal movement.  We're building current and future talent pipeline, investing in young artists in underserved communities, university partnerships, and mid-career rescaling and apprenticeships.  This year's events made it clear that while we've made progress, there's more that we can do. As a company, we're about action, not words. And together with our Black Employee Network, we've launched the Taking Action Initiative focused on community, advocacy and growth.  And during our global Adobe For All week, we outlined aspirational goals to increase representation. Across our recruiting and development programs, our campaign celebrating women and black creators and our efforts to ensure that our products are inclusive, we are driving change aligned to our core values.  Another topic that's been top of mind for everyone is the future of work after the pandemic. So, let's talk briefly about that. This year, we learned that there's so much that we're able to do effectively while we work from home. We've launched new products, produce global customer events and onboarded hundreds of interns and employees around the world. Digital transformation is here. And we'll continue to reimagine customer and employee experience as a company. At the same time, we continue to believe that in real life experiences are critical to nurturing culture and trust, learning and development and innovation. Each team will need to strike the right balance for them, but in general, we will be giving most employees the flexibility to work from home part of the time and making this the default as opposed to the exception.  As for fully remote workers, this is something we already have today, especially amongst sales and consulting staff. Broadly expanding remote work is a significant decision that is not just about individual preference, but also has implications for collaboration, cohesion and culture.  We have more to learn here, and so we'll be starting by updating our criteria for remote work in the coming months and iterating thoughtfully, as we always do. This is clearly a journey, one that we expect will continue to evolve.  As I reflect on the year, it's been a privilege for me to contribute to Adobe in this new capacity. Our employees achieved this record year through their dedication, camaraderie and resilience. 2020 has shown us the power of Adobe's values in action, and I'm confident that Adobe's best days are ahead of us.  And now, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, John Murphy. John Murphy : Thanks, Gloria. Based on what has been shared this morning, it's clear there are tremendous opportunities for Adobe. Now, I'd like to give you a view of our business momentum and how we drive our growth going forward. Today's presentation will cover both Q4 and fiscal year 2020 results.  Before we jump into the numbers, in Q4, we made a change to our segment reporting to align with the way we manage our digital experience business in light of the Advertising Cloud shift we made earlier this year. We created a new segment called Publishing and Advertising, combining Advertising Cloud with the existing Publishing segment. As a result of this change, our digital experience subscription book of business now aligns exactly to the components that make up our Digital Experience subscription revenue. And it's great to have those aligned as that's where we're strategically driving segment growth.  This reporting change is reflected in the numbers we will show for Q4 and FY 2020. And we've revised our financial information from FY 2018 to present day to maintain compatibility. Now, let's turn to our Q4 performance. Adobe achieved record revenue of $3.42 billion, which represents 14% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $4.64. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.81.  Business and financial highlights in Q4 include Digital Media revenue of $2.5 billion, which represents 20% year-over-year growth, record net new Digital Media ARR of $548 million, Digital experience revenue of $819 million, which represents 10% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue grew 14% year-over-year.  We had record cash flow from operations of $1.78 billion, and we exited with remaining performance obligation or RPO of $11.34 billion.  And we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter.  Overall, this is a really strong performance in Q4. Now for some Q4 financial highlights and growth drivers for each of our strategic businesses. In Q4, Adobe achieved $2.08 billion in Creative revenue, representing 20% year-over-year growth and added $425 million of net new Creative ARR. We exited the year with $8.72 billion in Creative ARR, which is also 20% growth year-over-year.  Creative ARR growth drivers include acquisition of new users across all geographies and segments, single app and CC complete subscriptions and strong performance in the imaging, video and stock categories.  Adobe Document Cloud achieved $411 million in Q4 revenue, growing 21% year-over-year. We added a record $123 million of Document Cloud ARR in the quarter, and Document Cloud ARR exiting the year was $1.46 billion, growing 35% year-over-year. Document cloud ARR growth drivers include strong demand for Acrobat subscriptions, as well as demand coming through the Reader funnel and on mobile, and a significant momentum in Sign. In Q4, we also benefitted from greater-than-expected perpetual revenue in our Document Cloud offering. Digital Experience achieved segment revenue of $819 million in Q4, representing 10% year-over-year growth, and subscription revenue of $696 million, representing 14% year-over-year growth. The growth drivers for Experience Cloud in Q4 included accelerating adoption of Adobe Experience Cloud platform and app services, content and commerce momentum, particularly with our AEM cloud service offering and continued recovery in the mid-market segment, as well as success signing up deals of greater than $1 million in annual deal value.  For the full 2020 fiscal year, Adobe achieved record revenue of $12.87 billion, which represents 15% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $10.83 and non-GAAP EPS was $10.10.  Contributing to our strong execution in FY 2020 was Digital Media segment revenue of $9.23 billion, representing 20% year-over-year growth; Creative revenue of $7.74 billion, representing 19% year-over-year growth; Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $1.5 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth, exiting the year with $10.18 billion of Digital Media ARR, an annual increase of $1.85 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $3.13 billion, following the segment reporting change, representing 12% year-over-year growth; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $2.66 billion represents 17% year-over-year growth.  We generated $5.73 billion in operating cash flows during the year, and we grew RPO by $1.52 billion and returned $3 billion in cash to our stockholders through our stock repurchase program.  Next, let me provide more information around our strategic cloud businesses. We'll begin with our Digital Media segment, starting with Creative Cloud. We've highlighted a number of areas where we drove tremendous momentum in the Creative business. We continue attracting new customers with approximately 75% of our subscribers in fiscal 2020 being new to our Creative Cloud franchise. Over 45 million students have access to Adobe Spark, nearly doubling since last year, showing how we're developing creative skills for the next generation.  Mobile continues to be an important funnel for us, with over 300 million mobile IDs created cumulatively, and over 80% year-over-year growth in mobile units as mobile monetization has become an important driver of ARR growth. Premiere Pro, Adobe Stock service growth and new media types are an important customer acquisition vehicle for us. Turning to revenue and ARR. We've seen another record year with our Creative Cloud. The Creative Cloud view shows an incredibly healthy business at scale, with sustained revenue growth over the last several years. We continue to see significant user acquisition across creative professionals, communicators, and consumers and revenue growth from services such as Adobe Stock continues to be strong.  Key creative growth drivers exiting fiscal 2020 include new user growth fueled by organic traffic which remains elevated, as well as targeted campaigns and promotions. Demand for single apps, particularly our video and photography offerings, strong retention and engagement, which held at pre COVID levels exiting the year, expansion into emerging markets, the gradual recovery in the SMB segment, driving demand for our team offering including through the reseller channel; and ETLAs with educational institutions.  This is such a great slide because it shows a mix of our Creative revenue in FY 2017 and FY 2020. Today, over 97% of our Creative revenue is subscription based revenue, while the business has grown 85%. Much of our success here comes from a deep understanding of our customers, which continues to drive higher retention for us. As Scott and Abhay shared, this growth is also driven by our vast innovation engine across products and services as we expand into new markets. When you look at the makeup of ARR, a majority of the revenue continues to come from all app subscriptions across individual team and enterprise, while a growing portion comes from single app subscriptions consistent with our strategy of expanding our market opportunity as we attract new users in the consumer and communicator categories. With most comprehensive set of creative offerings against every design, category and service, we're using single on apps mobile as a proven on-ramp for new subscribers, while we continue to grow our all apps business across all segments, and as an upsell opportunity for single app and mobile users.  The strength of Creative Cloud is derived from our diversified and resilient business, with offerings tailored for everyone from individuals to small businesses, education and enterprises.  We also have a deep understanding of how our customers want to engage with us. And you can see here the slight mix shift towards individual offerings through Adobe.com, while we continue to grow our team and ETLA offerings. Next, we're going to move on to Document Cloud. This business is thriving and has contributed significantly to the company's success this year, with over 70% of our channel units now being subscriptions and over 75% of subscribers in fiscal 2020 being new to the Acrobat franchise.  As with the Creative business, our mobile strategy is driving Adobe ID creation at the top of the funnel. While mobile monetization is contributing to ARR growth, our focus on acquiring new customers coupled with our shift from perpetual base to subscriptions is working.  The Document Cloud strategy of accelerating document productivity, going from paper to digital is really resonating in remote work environment. The Adobe Sign business has seen a growth inflection this year. In fact, we saw this inflection point before the pandemic hit, and we expect this trend to continue into FY 2021.  As Gloria shared, we envision businesses with people working in flexible ways. Things will not default back to the way they were. To borrow Shantanu's phrase, the genie will not go back in the bottle. There's just an explosive opportunity for new user growth as we continue to capitalize on work from home or flexible work. We have multiple growth initiatives, including web-based PDF, Sign as a service and the API economy that gives this business more legs.  Turning to revenue and ARR. Document Cloud is another Adobe business that has powered past the billion dollar mark, approaching $1.5 billion in both revenue and ARR. It's just a tremendous opportunity ahead for us. The key Document Cloud growth drivers exiting fiscal 2020 include new user acquisition of Acrobat subscriptions across all customer segments, monetization of our Reader install base on mobile, demand for our subscription offerings across all geos and enterprise adoption, including strength in Adobe Sign. Keep in mind that we also offer Acrobat and PDF services through CC individual and all app subscriptions, which is another driver of growth in this business.  Here you can see the phenomenal growth we're driven on subscriptions. While the non-recurring perpetual revenue accounts for a small portion of our revenue, it's in line with our strategy. This represents a continuing opportunity to transition that install base over to subscriptions. And you can see that the total business has nearly doubled in the last three years and as we transitioned more of the business to recurring revenue sources.  Unlike Creative Cloud, for Document Cloud, we continue to offer perpetual as a vehicle to have people come to the franchise. We have the flexibility of our offerings, given the breadth of our customer base, which has switched primarily to subscription.  Looking at Digital Media as a whole, including both Creative and Document Cloud ARR, you have a view that any CFO would love to see. It's showing the stacking effects of recurring subscription revenue up into the right, ending the year with over $10 billion of annualized recurring revenue. When you think of the revenue base when we launched Creative Cloud less than a decade ago, it's amazing to see how we have expanded the market opportunity while transitioning nearly all the revenue from perpetual to recurring. This shows you the power and durability of our subscription model.  Numbers like this don't happen without an extremely sophisticated system, our data-driven operating model, which is purpose built to acquire more customers across geographies and to engage and drive higher retention. DDON, as we call it, is our weapon for finding and understanding the personalized offerings for our customers. The best part about DDON is that we use our own software, Adobe Experience platform, to drive this. Which brings me to the Digital Experience segment. Let's take a deeper look at Adobe's Digital Experience business. First of all, we're very excited to close the Workfront acquisition earlier this week, and we welcome the Workfront team to Adobe.  When it comes to M&A at Adobe, we look at the technology and the people. Adobe has a great track record and history of acquiring companies, driving synergies and accelerating growth. With Workfront, we're focused on our ability to accelerate growth through the marketing use case. As Anil shared, what's particularly exciting for us is that we have the opportunity to create an industry-leading marketing system of record. We're confident that our shareholders and customers will get maximum value, and this is a huge opportunity to accelerate subscription revenue growth for years to come.  Workfront represents a sizable addressable market for Digital Experience. The targets we're providing for FY 2021 and Q1 are inclusive of Workfront. And we are looking forward to hitting the ground running integrating the business in our Digital Experience segment and expanding our opportunity with customer experience management.  Digital Experience is a category we created a little over a decade ago, bridging from content creation all the way to marketing, execution, measurement, optimization, and monetization. This year, we achieved $3.13 billion in segment revenue. But more importantly, we have seen digital transformation and customer experience management resonating with our enterprise customers.  More than ever before, for enterprises to succeed and provide the sort of personalized real time experiences our customers expect, they require a technology partner that can help them transform their businesses the way we've reinvented our own digital media business with our data-driven operating model and focus on customer experience management. In my conversations with my peers across the C suite, it's clear no matter their industry, they recognize the value in the digital transformation investment. And you can see the momentum here when you look at the makeup of our top 100 customers and accounts, where, in 2020, approximately 93% of those customers are using three or more of our solutions and the average ARR has more than doubled over the last five years.  We've talked a lot about our focus on growing subscription SaaS revenue in this business. And you can see here how our focus on driving subscription revenue has driven segment growth over a multi-year period. The growth in our Digital Experience business has been driven across subscription offerings, with particular strength in enterprise adoption of content and commerce offerings, including AEM cloud service. Our Adobe Experience platform is gaining tremendous traction with a number of referenceable customers, such as Verizon, creating momentum. And we're also seeing continued recovery in the mid-market following the macroeconomic challenges we saw there early in the pandemic.  Looking at the business by revenue type. Since 2018, we've held the services and other categories relatively flat, as we said we would, as we have focused on growing the recurring subscription SaaS revenue, which has grown at a 29% CAGR since 2018.  In order to accomplish this, we've continued our strategy of leveraging the partner ecosystem that Anil talked about earlier, relying on those partners to implement our solutions and provide services to help our enterprise customers realize the value we are delivering. Here's a view of the revenue mix by category across our three strategic growth pillars of customer journey management, content and commerce, and data and insights. These are all market leading solutions that are fundamental to customer experience management, which we built on a common data and content platform.  The growth of these businesses is driven by customer demands to help maintain a digital presence and transact online, deliver personalized experiences to their customers and unify and activate their data. With an $85 billion market opportunity, we are investing to drive long-term growth in these categories. And our comprehensive set of solutions and innovations in platform puts us years ahead of the competition and solving these challenges for the enterprise. Now, let's focus a little more on the income statement and cash flow and our capital allocation strategy. There's another slide most of you folks would love to see which is revenue growth and margin expansion, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, with non-GAAP operating margin well over 40% for the year. Contributing to our margin expansion has been the sustainable revenue growth that we have worked on for decades, the operating leverage in our subscription model and our strategic decision to exit the transactional Advertising Cloud business, as well as actions taken in response to the COVID pandemic and related cost savings associated with travel and reduced facilities operations. When we get to our FY 2021 targets, I'll provide some color on how you should think about those savings in those categories specifically going forward.  Here you can see the balance of RPO, which were 15% year-over-year exiting fiscal 2020. This represents contracted business that is committed to flow into revenue in the future, making our revenue sources extremely predictable. The components of RPO are deferred revenue and unbilled backlog. And as we noted earlier this year, we've seen a mix shift from deferred revenue to unbilled backlog in fiscal 2020 as more of our digital media business has come through Adobe.com, where subscriptions are billed monthly rather than invoiced annually in advance, meaning they don't hit deferred revenue the way a lot of our channel and enterprise business would. As a result, the strength in acquisition of adobe.com continues to drive the mix shift from deferred revenue to unbilled backlog.  Moving to cash flow. In fiscal 2020, we saw an acceleration of our operating cash flow growth, achieving a record $5.73 billion for the year. In terms of uses of cash, we continue to prioritize investment in growing the business, both organically as well as through inorganic opportunities like the acquisition of Workfront. And, as always, we focus on returning capital to shareholders through our stock repurchase program.  Exiting FY 2020, we had approximately $6 billion of cash and short-term investments as well as an unused billion dollar credit facility. This is a healthy liquidity position with an investment grade credit rating and plenty of debt capacity. And as I mentioned, we have a long track record of making sure we return excess cash to our shareholders through structured repurchases.  On that point, you can see how we've continued increasing our investment in stock repurchases, reducing the share count over time. Today, we're announcing a new $15 billion repurchase authority in addition to the amount remaining under our current authority, which will run through the end of fiscal 2024, demonstrating our commitment to accelerating return of capital to investors.  Now, I'd like to cover how you should think about financial strategy and our addressable markets, which underpin our preliminary targets for FY 2021.  Let's start with our strategy. I'm going to touch on a few things on this slide. Adobe has a unique financial profile that we've discussed that drives our strategy. We invest for top line growth and our operational discipline drives margin expansion and earnings growth over the long term.  With a diversified portfolio of leading products and services, we are investing to drive continued top line growth and expand into new categories with a massive market opportunity that's in front of us.  What accelerates our growth are going to be investments that we've made in new businesses such as Adobe Stock, Sign and our mobile applications, which have contributed over $500 million of ARR growth since 2017. With data driven dynamic planning capabilities, we exercise disciplined spend management principles, we focus on margin expansion and long-term earnings growth. We focus on integrating acquisitions quickly to ensure the same organic operating discipline is embedded in newly acquired businesses. And strict management of our balance sheet, prudent use of debt financing and cash has driven exceptional operating cash flow growth for many years, affording Adobe the opportunity to continue to invest in our existing businesses and capture promising inorganic growth opportunities and return capital to shareholders.  As you've heard earlier in today's presentations, we have updated our addressable markets. And you can see that we are excited to capture the opportunity ahead through the extensive list of growth drivers and product innovations across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. With Creative Cloud, we're driving continued growth through broader customer segments by reaching beyond creative professionals to communicators and consumers and by engaging and inspiring our creative community to drive customer lifetime value. With document cloud, we see growth inflection through acquiring and monetizing new customers across desktop, mobile and web.  And finally, we continue to leverage and build upon our data driven operating model to manage the business in real time. All this leads to a $62 billion addressable market for digital media in 2023.  Likewise, with the most comprehensive set of solutions for customer experience management applications and services and the addition of Workfront, our addressable market for Digital Experience has grown. We expect to drive multi-year growth of the data and insights category with our scaled next generation customer data platform. The segment change we made in Q4 reflects the way we manage our business and our strategic focus. The Digital Experience organization is optimized to drive subscription and SaaS revenue growth, while gaining share of an $85 billion addressable market for Digital Experience.  Before getting into our fiscal 2021 targets, I'm going to walk through some of the assumptions we've built in. We expect to see continued gradual macroeconomic improvement during the year. And as such, we're modeling continued recovery for the small and medium businesses into FY 2021, which was a segment that was hit particularly hard earlier in the pandemic and then showed signs of improvement during Q3 and Q4.  We anticipate an increase in our effective tax rate due to additional taxes on our foreign operations following the changes we made to our international trading structure in FY 2020. Our FY 2020 tax rate included one-time benefits to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from these changes. These deductible assets will be amortized over multi-year period, lowering our cash tax rate over that time. Targets include initial estimates associated with our acquisition of Workfront. These estimates involve numerous assumptions given the purchase accounting process has not been completed. The purchase accounting is expected to result in an increased amortization of intangible assets and significant deferred revenue haircut, resulting in an expected contribution of about $25 million to Q1 revenue.  And as you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during the fiscal year and revalue ARR at year-end for current currency rates. FX changes between December of 2019 and this year have resulted in a $77 million increase in Digital Media ARR. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated investor datasheet. ARR results this year will be measured against this amount during FY 2021.  The cost savings associated with the current remote work environment will continue into the first half of FY 2021.  In terms of OpEx growth, we will be investing in top line growth opportunities and our hiring is expected to return to an ordinary pace, particularly for R&D and sales and marketing roles. And we expect T&E and facilities expenses to ramp in the second half as things open back up.  Lastly, FY 2021 is a 53-week fiscal year for us, with the additional week falling in Q1. As we noted in the press release, we estimate the extra week will benefit Q1 with approximately $240 million in additional revenue over a 13-week quarter, as well as an additional $25 million in net new Digital Media ARR.  So, without further ado, here are the targets we are providing for fiscal year 2021. Total Adobe revenue of approximately $15.15 billion. Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%. Net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.75 billion. Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%. Digital Experience subscription revenue year-over-year growth of approximately 22%. A tax rate of approximately 19% on a GAAP basis and 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Share counts of approximately 482 million shares. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $8.57 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $11.20. For Q1 of 2021, we are targeting a revenue of approximately $3.75 billion, with Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 26%, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $410 million, Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, Digital Experience year-over-year subscription revenue growth of approximately 22%, tax rate of approximately 15.5% on a GAAP basis and 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Share accounts of approximately 484 million shares, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.19 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.78.  In terms of seasonality, while 2020 was not a typical year given the pandemic, resulting in a particularly strong Q3 with everybody working from home as we spoke about last quarter, we're assuming things have been back for the summer of 2021. And we would expect Digital Media net new ARR in FY 2021 to grow sequentially from Q1 to Q2, dip seasonally in Q3 as we have experienced in the past and have a strong finish to Q4 as we typically do.  And in terms of EPS growth, we expect strong growth in Q1 followed by more modest growth in quarters two, three and four as we lap the COVID related savings from FY 2020 as well as resulting from a higher effective tax rates in fiscal 2021. To wrap up, Adobe saw a record performance in FY 2020, something we're all proud about, and the business momentum is strong as we look towards FY 2021. And we continue to be a market leader delivering growth and expanding margin at scale. In fact, record profit and cash flow.  We have a large expanding market opportunity as we've shared and we're driving category creation and expansion, innovations and growing customer universe, targeting over $15 billion in revenue over the next 12 months. And we are just going to operate with a proven track record for driving long term top line and bottom line growth. Now, we're going to go to a short video and then Jonathan will kick off the Q&A. [Video Presentation] Jonathan Vaas : What a great video. I certainly can't imagine staying productive without Adobe Sign and Adobe Acrobat. Thanks, John. A - Jonathan Vaas : We are now going to move to live Q&A with all six of our executive speakers. For those of you who wish to ask a question, please go ahead and queue up now with our conference call operator, if you haven't done so already. And when you ask a question, please remember to mute your webcast to avoid any feedback. And due to the format, there may be a few seconds of latency. So please keep any interjections to a minimum.  With that, operator, we'll take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Brent Thill of Jefferies, please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thank you for the great overview today. Shantanu, there have been some investor questions just on the current quarter around Digital Media and the percentage of upside relative to plan was a little lower than some had thought. And many are asking, is there anything to consider in the Digital Media business for the quarter?  And then, maybe more importantly, looking into next year in Digital Experience, it seems like you're seeing some great momentum. Maybe Anil can talk about what is driving that increased confidence, momentum in that business? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I'm happy to answer both questions and give you some color. First, as it related to Digital Media, we had record Q4 performance in Digital Media, $548 million in net new ARR, which is just phenomenal performance. I would say both Q3 and Q4 were very strong. And certainly, I think when you look at the back half of the year, as it relates to Digital Media, it was incredible performance. And when you look at our Q1 targets, as well as when you look at the targets for the entire fiscal 2021, as you know, these are the highest targets that we have given at the beginning of the year. And so, the growth drivers that we see in digital media just continue unabated. Everything from acquiring customers, upselling them, I think we tried, therefore, to give you real color between the individual apps and the full apps. And our data driven operating model allows us to be pretty sophisticated. And so, relative even to our targets for Q4, as far as we're concerned, it was a beat, which showed the momentum that we had in the business. So, Digital Media ARR, nothing. We continue to believe in the expansion of the total addressable market and really pleased with our performance. As it relates to Digital Experience as well, I think the momentum there, what happened was, clearly in Q2 and Q3, as all companies were dealing with the pandemic, what was top of mind was customer continuity and safety of the employees. As soon as that pivoted, everybody was talking about digital as the only way out of the pandemic. And so, they started to look at who were the clear leaders in customer experience management and the conversations really accelerated for us. That was the momentum. The Adobe Experience platform being a clear leader, which is why as you look at our expectations for 2021 and what we believe will continue to be accelerating beyond that, we're pleased. And net-net, we're really excited about our 2021 targets. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Jonathan, no disrespect to Mike, but I think your 10th year, you've delivered a great event. So, thank you for that. And it's clear that the best is yet to come from Adobe. I have one question from Shantanu and another for John.  For Shantanu. Shantanu, I'm struggling a bit to reconcile the optimism of expressed by the growth rates in what are \u2013 no doubt \u2013 very large, very exciting markets in which you participate and in many cases lead, but your growth expectations and current run rates would suggest you expect to lose share across the board. So, just curious if you think it's a fair observation and what I might be missing.  And for John. John, I wanted to ask about slide 112 in the deck, which you presented about Creative Cloud. How should we think about conversion of single app to all apps? And what are some levers here to highlight the value of the entire Creative Cloud suite? And maybe just related to that, what's the non-genuine usage opportunity that's left? Thank you so much, guys. Shantanu Narayen : I'll start off with that. And like you said, we appreciate the leadership that Jonathan has showed in helping pull together what is hopefully the only virtual event that we do and we can get back to more normalcy next year.  I think as it relates to the opportunities that we have in the market and how we're thinking about it, we're certainly the market leaders and in each one of the categories that we're talking about.  First, while we don't think it's a zero sum game, we're actually continuing to be the leader in each one of those categories. So, I don't know specifically how you're looking at it and feeling like we're not, but we are actually gaining market share. And we've become the true end-to-end leader, whether it's on the creative side as it relates to entire category of applications. Certainly, I think in digital experience, you're going to see a consolidation of where all of these solutions are done, the experience platform, what we said around customer data and insights.  So, we're very excited about our prospects in each one of them. We continue to believe that we will be number one and will continue to gain market share. So, that's really the way that we look at it in terms of the expansion opportunity ahead of us. John Murphy : And in terms of Creative Cloud and conversion of single apps to all apps, as we said, we've got so many opportunities to attract different customers and different types of customers to the platform. And we're definitely growing our communicator segment and the consumer segment. But as we've seen, particularly during the pandemic and the work from home, the need to create and use digital solutions to do that is really touching so many different segments of customers. So, the value there for us, obviously, seen in the growth of ARR overall, is fantastic and gives us an opportunity to continue to monetize access to that base of customers over time.  We haven't sized the non-genuine environment in a very long time. It's probably a sizable opportunity. But we chip away at that when we have a very good entry price point for our single apps for customers that may be using non genuine product. And so, as they see the innovations that are available with our cloud based solutions and our mobile solutions, it's certainly a way that attracts people that may not have even realized they're using non-genuine product to actually use the most up-to-date innovative products that we have.  So, it's really an important aspect for us, Brad, in terms of addressing all of the different segments that we can address and attract more and more people to the franchise. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mark Moerdler, Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Congratulations on the quarter. Adobe's been very thoughtful and measured in modeling your TAM in the past. And as you've written, the TAM has been a really good leading indicator of future growth. I think most would find the large year-over-year TAM expansion, specifically for Creative Cloud, is a bit surprising. Can you give us some more color on what you're modeling in that's driving such a big TAM expansion? Why you feel so confident what's changed? Any color would be appreciated. Shantanu Narayen : As you know, and you've followed us for a while, we take our addressable market very seriously, unlike some companies who just throw the kitchen sink in what they believe is their addressable market. And so, let me touch a little bit on when you look at digital media and the TAM, some of the growth vectors. With mobile. Firstly, mobile has become \u2013 we talked about the 300 million IDs that we've already created. And mobile has become a pretty impressive funnel in terms of both attracting new customers to the platform, the ways in which we are monetizing the mobile only services, but how that also serves as an on-ramp. And this was one that, until we had real offerings in the mobile space and the ability to have these multi surface \u2013 we also have storage options in terms of some of our products across multiple surfaces. So, that's clearly one of the drivers that is continuing to grow.  I think as the nature of our products, target the communicators in addition to the creative pros and the consumers, all of these applications as well, we feel like that's another part of the addressable opportunity. Certainly, what we've seen with Stock, the busines is doing really well and this notion of content- authoring paradigm where people start to author the content using a piece of content, we think that that also drives further acceleration in that particular business the amount of stakeholders who've seen us deliver more and more collaboration services and the collaboration services allow us to also monetize that. On the Document side and on the Creative side, what we've targeted with respect to the web, that's why I gave you some insight as to the magnitude of how much people are doing PDF searches on the web and what kind of an industry that's become, that same sort of task-based approach is certainly true in Creative. That's a brand new opportunity. And the confidence that we have in being able to convert all of that traffic and all of that acquisition funnel into monetization models gives us a lot of confidence. And so, when you look at the services, whether it's Stock or Sign, what's happening with respect to document workflows \u2013 and I think, as we said during the prepared presentation, the fact is this digital inflection point, it's only going to increase in terms of the number of people who use it. And that's why we also touched on regulated industries, which in the past may have been a little bit more slow or less enthusiastic about digital, there's no opportunity left for them.  So, all of that really adds up to why the TAM continues to build for us. Operator : We can now take our next question from Alex Zukin of RBC. Alex Zukin : Congrats on a wonderful quarter and a great analyst presentation. Shantanu, I wanted to ask you kind of similar to the previous question, how should we think about the headwinds and tailwinds in the business as we come out of the pandemic? Where are you most enthusiastic about the growth vectors in both Digital Media and Experience? John, I think, obviously, investors are pleasantly surprised at some of the modest margin leverage you're showing for next year, given the one-time T&E savings from this year, coupled with what's likely a dilutive acquisition. So, I guess, how should we think about the impact on margins of the durable efficiencies around go-to-market post-COVID and the trade-off between operating leverage and growth? Shantanu Narayen : From my perspective, Alex, definitely, it's the tailwinds that's the story of the company. And it's across all three businesses. I think on the Creative side, this notion of more content creation and more content consumption across all of the media types is certainly driving more usage of our particular products. Global expansion, we didn't talk about that as well. But global just continues to be, as digitization becomes a phenomenon, a tailwind in our business.  I think the Document side is probably going to see the biggest tailwinds as it relates to what happens. Part of the reason on making sure that we had Gloria touch on how we thought about remote work and what was happening as we think about our own business and how we think about remote work. So, I see significant tailwinds in the Document business, both as it relates to the usage of electronic documents, as well as the automation of business workflows. And that drives Digital Experience. And Digital Experience, which one of us is now going to go back and stand in line for a driver's license or for a permit to do anything else? And so, I think you're just going to see more and more \u2013 if anything, the pandemic and the health crisis has raised the urgency. And I think John alluded to this, which is every CFO and every C level executive that I talk to, what's top of mind right now is digital transformation. So, they're all saying, okay, vaccines are on the way, once the vaccines come, we're not going back to business as usual. And whether you're in travel or hospitality or whether you're in some of the other industries that have unfortunately been impacted a little bit more, digital engagement is the only way around it. So, net-net, I really don't look at our businesses and feel like they're headwinds associated with the business. We will continue to be dependent on the macroeconomic environment, which has actually continued to be fairly robust. And so, we're excited about our prospects. And I think the solutions that we deliver become, frankly, more important, rather than less important. John Murphy : On the margin question, Alex, I think when we think about how we target growth \u2013 we are a growth company, and so we want to continue to invest in growth. And we've been able to demonstrate over time that, as we drive growth, we're able to expand more margins over time. You think about our original targets for FY 2020, we still had expanding margin coming out against FY 2019. And while we're really pleased to deliver this level of operating margin in Q4, we do expect 2021 to have operating margins down from our Q4 high, but still expanding over FY 2020. So, we're definitely committed to that.  The reason for that is that we'll be lapping much of the COVID related savings, and we'd expect to realize some of those savings in the first half. But as the gradual phased reentry happens later, in the latter half of the year, we expect to be able to invest because that's going to drive growth. And we want to continue to strike the right balance between investing for growth and benefiting from those continued first half savings. Not to mention, we will be impacted by the deferred revenue haircut for the Workfront acquisition. But even so, we're still going to be expanding our margin in FY 2021 over FY 2020. Alex Zukin : Congrats, again, on another great job. Operator : We can now take our next question from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Jennifer Lowe : Two for me. First, maybe asking the opposite question of the ones that Brad asked earlier. But looking at the composition of ARR by full suite versus single app, given all the discussion around single app as an on-ramp and an attractive landing point for communicators and consumers and you seem to be seeing a lot of momentum there, why hasn't single app grown as a percentage of that mix? And as you continue to lean into that sales motion, could it be more 50/50 over time? Or is the expectation that, in communicators and consumers, they'll ultimately be full and it just stays balanced? I just need color there. And then secondly, for John, Alex mentioned that the presumption is Workfront is dilutive. But I'm just curious if we could get a little bit more color. So, we've got the Q1 revenue impact. But is there any more color to add around either margin impacting Q1 or what's baked into the full year guide for Workfront? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Jennifer, I'll take the one on the single app. And as you know, you have to look at both the units view as well as the ARR view. And the units view continues to grow. But remember, that also is an area where, as we ramp them to the platform, it's the single apps. That's the way in which we acquire them. But we're doing a better and better job of being able to convert them into the full app.  So, I think what you have to just recognize is that the single app pricing and ARPU is a little bit lower. And so, that same pie chart that we showed, that's the revenue look or the ARR look associated with it. And when you look at the units look, clearly, it will show a different picture in terms of the higher proportion of what's happening through single apps. And so, that's a model that all the way back to Creative Suite, we know how to do that, attract new customers to the platform and drive that in. So, that's the answer to your question around single apps and the full app model, and it's actually working for us. John Murphy : Jennifer, in terms of Workfront, the Workfront acquisition, it's just closed, so we don't have the full purchase accounting completed yet. We are expecting a significant deferred revenue haircut as is fairly typical with these acquisitions. And as a result, there'll be slight dilution. But as you can see in our full-year targets, we're still targeting significant margin expansion over FY 020. And that just kind of shows the leverage in our operating model, our ability to continue to invest for growth, and still expand our margins and our earnings. Operator : We can now take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Shantanu, you noted the closing this week of the Workfront acquisition. And it also happens to be this week the 15th anniversary of the Macromedia acquisition. And it's pretty evident what the long term value of that acquisition has been in terms of the impact on the company. And the question, therefore, for Adobe today is, do you think that the long-term lasting value of the foundational technologies that you have or investing in DX can have a 10 year or more lasting value for Adobe or do you think that perhaps the half-life, so to say, of foundational or critical technologies might be shorter? And if so, what are the implications there for R&D spending and the like?  And then secondly, a recurring theme from the company this year, particularly in summit, has been application and intelligence services and Abhay referred to this. Looking ahead over the next number of years, what do you think the contribution from those discrete new services might be? aside from the incumbents of Sign and Stock, I'm asking really more about the newer ones that you have in mind. And are those services something that you might begin to disclose more specifically over time as they become material? Shantanu Narayen : Jay, let me take both. December is not only, as you point out, the anniversary of the Macromedia acquisition in 2005, I can even have the privilege of going back and say, December was also when we did an acquisition for GoLive in 1998. That was one of my first acquisitions. And that sort of embarked us on the web journey as well, which has clearly proven to be also one of those seminal moments.  But more seriously, I think when we look at what we've done with Workfront, we've always had \u2013 and understood the technology component of what it means to deliver these services, but the amount of spend, the amount of ability to drive efficiency as it relates to the internal workflows and processes associated with it \u2013 because it's not just about the campaign itself, it's about the creation of the campaign. And we've talked about this expression, content velocity, for a while. And so, when people want the ability to create these campaigns and personalize it and get this out and global, it's not just about the technology platform, but it's also very much about the work management associated with it, which is why we're excited about Workfront and what it does for us.  I think as a company, they perhaps focused \u2013 or defocused and spent a little bit more time on the broader opportunity. And we just think focusing on content and focusing on creation, while I think most people are correctly pointing to what we can do as it relates to what happens on the marketing side, the fact is that we also have a significant number of customers who use Workfront in conjunction with the Creative Cloud. And you've written about our desire to continue to integrate the Creative Cloud, as well as the Experience Cloud with that entire content creation, management, monetization measurement opportunity that we have, and I think this can be a significant accelerant to that as well. So, you have seminal products, whether it was Macromedia, whether it was Day Software when we talked about content that actually created these significant opportunities for us in terms of platforms and now tying that together, the glue, which is why when you look at one of the slides in the deck and how Anil describes where Workfront is, it's really the glue that actually ties together all of our marketing application.  So, I think to your point, we feel like that could be a really significant enabler of increasing more people into the entire marketing campaign workflow. And in addition to that, really providing more integration capabilities across each of our solutions. I think to your second point associated with services, what is phenomenal about both our creative business and our document business is actually the breadth of our offering. I think this is related to some of the questions. We have mobile offerings, we have services offerings, we have single apps offerings, we have full offerings, we have freemium offerings. And I think as the business scales, I understand the need from investors to say, hey, how can you give us color? That's part of the reason why John was giving a little bit more color on how material the combination of mobile and Stock and Sign have given. So I know we will continue to figure out how we can provide more insight, but I think it's to answer the question of the incredible momentum that we're seeing around both the Creative Cloud and the Document Cloud, what's underlying it. And there's very, very significant amount of depth associated with that entire business which is what's fueling our business.  And I've been reminded that it's also close to the eighth anniversary of when Scott and Behance joined us in 2012. So, Scott, it's good to have you onboard as well. But thanks for the question, Jay. Operator : We can now take our next question from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Shantanu, I was wondering if you can just double click a little bit on the Experience Cloud business just in terms of the three pillars there, customer data, content and customer journey. And is there one area in particular, or maybe two, that you're particularly excited about as we head into calendar 2021 or are those just big opportunities for all of them? But just kind of curious of your thoughts on those kind of pillars and where you see each of those positioned for next year. And then, John, just on the Workfront acquisition, I realize you gave us the $25 million in revenue for the first quarter. I assume it's fair to assume \u2013 I assume it's fair that that would ramp from there, given the purchase write-down. I know you probably don't want to give a full-year number on revenue, but I assume that should scale from that starting point throughout the rest of the year. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Kirk, whenever I get asked questions \u2013 at least you didn't ask me the question that I can never answer, which is one of my favorite products because as products in the portfolio, I don't distinguish between them. Maybe the ones that I would highlight is the momentum that we've seen around the Adobe Experience Manager cloud version, that has been really phenomenal. And so, we've seen some really good success. As we moved, everybody is again thinking about content, how they improve their agility. And so, I think the content and commerce, which represents a large opportunity and the fact that we've integrated how you can create a content site and enable commerce for it, whether it's in B2C or B2B, we're seeing just a tremendous demand for it. Because every company that didn't have the ability to transact business online was seeing a fair amount of headwinds in the pandemic. So, content and commerce, we continue to believe is one of the underpinnings of our business and continue to be a driver associated with it.  And the second one that I'll talk about is where experience platform, a big part of it is reported within the data and insights and what we are seeing associated with now all of this data coming back in the unified profile. So, I think that is really one of the areas that we've also seen significant momentum in Q3 and in Q4. People want to know how they can create that profile, how they can deliver it. So, if they were two out of the three, though, we say all three of them are growth opportunities, I'd probably prioritize it like that, Kirk. John Murphy : Absolutely. You're correct. The $25 million that we are targeting for Workfront in the first quarter, of course, depending on what the purchase accounting pans out to be, we have kind of modeled out for a year or two based on our estimates on the deferred revenue haircut. So, we are expecting between $140 million and $150 million. But, again, really dependent upon when we finalize the purchase accounting later this quarter. But it will ramp. Shantanu Narayen : And big picture on that, Kirk, certainly, our expectations for the Workfront acquisition, net of all the accounting things that John alluded to, that they would be accretive to the growth profile of the company in terms of where the opportunity is and what we expect to do with that business. So, I just want to make sure we separate how internally we're looking at the growth and what we're driving towards is our plan, relative to what will be reported, as John mentioned, on the accounting side. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Keith Bachman of BMO. Keith Bachman : I'll ask Shantanu directly to you. One is a consistent question from me. As the Document Cloud continues to put up very strong numbers in terms of ARR and you're guiding the growth of the Document Cloud TAM opportunity, again, between 2022 and 2023 at 60% growth, which is far higher than the ARR growth. So, I just wanted to see what you think the conclusion should be to the current run rate of ARR growth, call it, mid-30s and a pretty significant growth of the TAM? Does that suggest that the growth rate can actually accelerate?  And then, I'll just ask my second question. Thanks very much for the disclosure surrounding the Creative Cloud, including the users and the dollar TAM. Very helpful and interesting. Where would you rank order, so to speak, the growth potential being driven by the consumers, communicators or creative pros as we think about our model over the next couple of years? Thanks very much. Shantanu Narayen : I think there were two questions in there. I think the first one as it relates to where we are \u2013 ensuring that our document products are being adopted, remember the document products get adopted both as part of the Document Cloud and what are reported in the Document Cloud ARR. But also Acrobat is a huge part of what we report within the Creative Cloud and what's happening within the Creative Cloud.  So, the growth that we're seeing in documents is reflected in both, because in many ways, what we see is that the adoption of PDF as a collaborative medium as well as for workflow in the creative segment is also extremely large. So I think of it as really fueling two large growth opportunities. But certainly, I think the acceleration that we've seen in that business and the continued focus and investment that we're going to make in that business gives us a lot of confidence of being able to continuously grow the document business from our perspective. I think as you look at which customer segments, much like Jennifer's question, as it related to ARR, the numbers associated with it versus the ARR could have potentially different answers. And certainly, I think on the consumer side, what we are seeing with the mobile ID creation, what we're seeing in imaging, maybe which appeals primarily as a new category to the consumers, the communicators is a large space, it's always been a big part of the halo. And so, the numbers are probably in terms of new customer acquisition, largest in consumers, then in communicators, then in creative pros. But the opportunity to drive ARR continues to be across all three because of the different price points, as well as, in many cases, the way we upsell into those particular customer segments. So, that's the way we look at it.  Again, I've done this enough where I know people want a simple m multiplied by n in order to be able to do it. But I think what actually makes us so differentiated and such a sustainable business is really the fact that we have these breadth and depth of offerings and the DDON that we've talked to you about, where we know how to personalize each offering.  And it's also different by geography. Maybe that's one of the things that I should mention. And it's different, for example, in education. Education had a phenomenal year, and that seeing that next generation of creative professionals, but in many cases, whether it's a K-12 license or a license for an entire educational institution, the ARR may be small. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color as to how we think about each of those segments.  But the nice thing is now we have a product folio that cuts across all of them. Operator : We can now take our next question from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Ken Wong : Just one for me. I wanted to just touch on the slides you guys put up there with the \u2013future expansion where the average ARR from the top 100 customers went from $3 million to $8 million, which is very impressive. Just wondering what kind of headroom do you think you have with that top 100 as more adopt your kind of full CDP. And then also, how far down the customer list could you possibly maybe see a similar $3 million to $8 million type uplift from your customer base. Shantanu Narayen : I think one of the impressive things, Ken, that Anil has done is really focused on what he calls the transformational accounts, which is, in many ways, I think has he has taken on responsibility for the entire product, as well as on the go-to-market. I think an analysis showed that while we were getting significant traction with a number of customers that we had, it's really this focus on transformational accounts and creating a good go-to-market has demonstrated that there's massive headroom associated with this with our customers. I think the Verizon example was a good example to articulate and show how each of our products.  And the second part of that, honestly, is the fact that we're also far better at demonstrating what the ROI is. And again, Anil, I think, touched on the ROI associated with the Experience Cloud. So, as you take the ROI as well as you take the focus that we have on these transformational accounts, you add the ability to do Workfront, we just continue to think that there's massive opportunity. That's the beachhead. But that doesn't mean in any way, shape or form that there's a limited set of transformational accounts. Rather, it's the recipe to continue to deliver value, become strategic to these customers, and drive significant ARR. And as it relates to the breadth and depth of that customer base, again, going back to the question that I think was asked around Experience Cloud and what's driving it, the AEM cloud service is not just a service that can apply to large enterprises who maybe want to create new websites as it relates to campaigns, the fact that it's easily provisioned and easily on ramp actually makes it a very appropriate solution for what we refer to as commercial or mid-market or small and medium business customers, and integrating things like analytics into it and commerce into it with the Magento service enables us to really say, we could be your one-stop shop for getting a Web presence, as well as for transacting commerce on the web. So, clearly, the aspirations are to enable people to have a quick and one-stop on-ramp. Operator : We can now take our next question from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Walter Pritchard : I have two questions. One for John and one for Abhay. John, one of the slides, you talked about 75% of the individual subscribers new to Creative Cloud franchise in fiscal 2020. Can you clarify the other 25%? Are they coming from mobile apps that were the prior year? Where's the other 25% coming from? I think the disclosure in the past was a little bit different. I'm just trying to frame that. And then, I have follow-up. John Murphy : They're coming from a couple different places. Certainly, mobile, as we talked about before, is a huge on-ramp for us. And we've been having so many new Adobe IDs created on mobile. We also have perpetual, is the other part of that as well. So, definitely strong performance across both of those in Q4. Shantanu Narayen : And then for Abhay, if he's still on, just around \u2013 you talked about opening up more APIs. And I know in Sign, one of your competitors there is quite strong, leveraging that. Could you talk about where you expect to see sort of the tangible revenue impact as you embark on that effort and productize some of that that you're building around API based access for products? Abhay Parasnis : I think at a macro level, and we shared a little bit, both Shantanu talked about in the Document Cloud strategy and I covered, across all our businesses, but especially in Document Cloud, PDF has always been a very vibrant ecosystem play, as you know, for us where it's connected into a lot of ISVs and solutions across industry verticals, line of business applications. And so, what we are starting to now do is opening up APIs and working with three kinds of players. There are large ISVs, like Microsoft, Workday, ServiceNow where we are connecting our applications and APIs directly into their ecosystems and applications and have kind of joint attached motion there. But then we are also opening it up for the broader developer ecosystem. And as you know, even on our DX enterprise business, we have products like Magento and ecosystems of large developers who connect to our platforms, whether it's AEM, Magento. And we are opening up our APIs around signatures, PDF to that kind of long tail of developers. So, I would say, large ISVs like Microsoft, ServiceNow, Workday that we have announced partnerships around and integrating, and then a broad long tail developer reach play, where they are embedding our APIs and services for more inline into their applications and taking it to market.  The last thing I'll say, and kind of we shared also, is AI. The other piece of the API strategy is also opening up our intelligence services around Sensei platform and exposing those also beyond our applications for developers and ISVs, which are very unique and differentiated. So, that's the other component of that. Operator : We can now take our next question from Derrick Wood of Cowen and Company. Derrick Wood : Two questions from me. Shantanu, maybe I'd start on kind of doubling down on the communicators market and just curious about who some of the more popular personas are out there and maybe how COVID has been a catalyst and what you guys are doing to kind of lean into that market more.  And then for John, on the Digital Experience side, seems like there's a lot of margin leverage to be driven out of that business, restructuring on the Ad Cloud side is one step. Sounds like maybe more revenue leverage out of AEPs and other. But can you just talk about some of the things you guys are doing to drive better leverage on both the gross and operating margin as we look over the next year or two? Shantanu Narayen : Let me start. As it relates to the communicators, what I think most people don't maybe fully appreciate is what is happening on the Web with respect to wanting to do certain creative tasks and being able to fulfill those tasks with what we are doing around search engine and everything associated with the actions that people want to do. They want to remove the background for a picture, they want to post it for social media. And just the communicators that we refer to are also what were perhaps referred to in the past as knowledge workers because we just fundamentally believe that every piece of printed material or presented material benefits from this more interactive graphics rich. And so, what we are seeing is the ability for people to say, I want a single click ability to finish my task. And then once they finish that task, expose me to all of the other riches that exists in Adobe's creative product. So, I think that's a big driver of what the communicator has. We certainly see that with Spark. We see that across Lightroom as people want to share their images. But we also see it in our category-leading applications. Video is the other place where the usage of video in virtually every piece of communication is rapidly accelerating. So, hopefully, that gives you a couple of examples of where the communicator organic demand is coming from. John Murphy : And Derek, in relation to digital experience, looking at the TAM, we have such a great opportunity. And as you've seen, we expect acceleration. And then, with Workfront, even further acceleration. Workfront had stumbled there [ph] before we actually acquired them a little bit. But we know that the demand is there for that solution. And coupled with our capabilities, we know we can actually accelerate that back. So, there's definitely revenue leverage in the digital experience business.  And as we said, the way we realigned the Digital Experience business by moving ad cloud out of that segment because we're operating it a bit differently, we wanted to make sure that we're operating the Digital Experience business the way a healthy SaaS company should view it. We have aspirations for very strong margins there. If you think about healthy SaaS companies growing their margins, the rule of 40. So, we're definitely excited about that.  The other thing we're doing is we're going to continue to invest, as we said, in hiring, not only in R&D, but also in sales capacity because we're not opportunity constrained. We just definitely need to take advantage of the ability to capture all this opportunity, particularly now, the way that we've aligned the solutions within Digital Experience and they're resonating with our customers. And then of course, with Workfront, we can accelerate it even more. Jonathan Vaas : Operator, let's take two more questions and then we'll do a brief wrap up. Thank you. Operator : We can now take our next question from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Sterling Auty : Shantanu, how would you characterize, in the digital marketing, advertising, Adobe Experience area, with all the products ranging from the original Omniture, all the way through to Marketo, and all the homegrown solutions as well, where are you in the evolution of taking that entire stack into a fully integrated Kubernetes-enabled, cloud-delivered platform? Are you complete? Is there still phases left to deliver? And how might that investment impact gross margins moving forward? Shantanu Narayen : Sterling, when we have the kind of innovation opportunity ahead of us, let me first start off by saying we've made tremendous progress. So, the delivery of the Adobe Experience platform was a momentous milestone, Sterling, not just because we delivered all this new functionality, but we started to have, whether it's Adobe campaign functionality integrated into the experience platform to be able to do customer journey, whether it was the Adobe analytics, what you refer to as the Omniture functionality and being able to get insight of all of that data. And so, the progress that we've made in being able to drive all of these solutions into a common platform, it's never done.  To some degree \u2013 I remember that people would ask me, how much innovation do you have on the creative products. And here we are decades later. And the list of what we can do with these products dwarfs what we ever had 20 years ago. So, as I think about the Experience platform and I think about what every enterprise has to do to rewire it, I think we're in a fantastic position, given the engineering efforts over the last few years to have this integrated platform that nobody else has. It runs on cloud. I think you've seen with the progress and success that we've had around Microsoft and what we've done with Microsoft on Azure, it's certainly cloud aware. The announcement that we made with IBM, with the ability for all of these to also run in a hybrid cloud, where people, whether it's for regulatory reasons or other reasons, want to run it on their private cloud network, we've made progress and there's clearly interest on companies like VMware and IBM to partner with us on that.  So, I'm really confident about the architectural thing. But the way we look at it is you're constantly architecting for new architectures. You're constantly doing work in AI and ML and providing more and more insights. Some of the ways in which we've actually added tremendous value is in the reporting and the analysis and the insight that each one of these has been doing.  But the breadth and depth of our offerings, I think there's still significant headroom of what we can do. Because the way you have to think about it is, if we believe that with DDOM we're one of the most mature companies in terms of having a digital funnel and how we operate that's driven our success, we're pioneers not just in delivering technology, but in how we've moved it. And that movement for every company now, rethinking their business process, rethinking their computer architecture, we're at such an early stage that we're going to have to keep innovating around that space.  And so, we think of it right now as an overall growth opportunity. We have made, as you saw, the strategic decisions around how we think about margin in that particular business. And so, we will continue to see margins expand in that business. But I think what you should be most excited about as an investor is the fact that we're investing in this immense opportunity and extending our lead. And so, I think that's the way we think about it. You look at the overall margins of the company again, and I think John alluded to this, despite investing in Workfront, despite investing in sales capacity, despite saying that we will accelerate growth, we're showing you margin expansion for the entire company.  So, we know how to do this, which is drive top line growth and bottom line growth at an impressive margin. So, that's how at least I think about it. Operator : We'll now take our final question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Stan Zlotsky : This is actually Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. Two questions from our end. If we look at the Creative Cloud and the progression of the pie chart that you guys put up there from 2017 to 2020, we can see that there's a fairly pronounced shift in ARR from team to individual. And maybe just following up on the question that Jennifer asked earlier, as we move into 2021 and beyond, how should we think about the progression of the shift moving forward? Will we see more continuous push from individual? Or are we starting to reach a more normalized equilibrium within those two categories? And then a very quick follow-up. Shantanu Narayen : Well, I think what you should see and what you will expect is, first and foremost, the pie expanding. And as it relates to the total addressable market, the main thing that you have to think about is this is market expansion, we're growing the value associated with our customers. I think at steady state, at some point in the prior business, which may be a predictor, it was closer to 50/50. But the thing that, again, I will reemphasize is that a lot of that is we drive into individual and then convert into the entire offering. And so, that's it. And so, big picture, I would focus more on the growth of the pie, the exact mix between those two. We look at both of them and feel like they're growing really well. And I'm happy to answer your second question as well, Stan. Stan Zlotsky : Just digging into the slightly rejiggering of your reporting segments and increasingly the new Publishing and Advertising segment. What are you seeing behind the scenes in your business? And how should we think about the print and publishing segment? Obviously, it's a very small part of the overall revenue component. But why create this dedicated segment and pull out the advertising from Experience Cloud? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : What we were trying to do was give you more insight and color into how we were running the different businesses and I think that's a key part of it. I think the print business, which was, a lot of you know, the genesis of the company. It's a business that continues to do well, but it wasn't a growth category as much as a high profitability category. We talked about in the Advertising Cloud, getting out of a lot of the transaction based revenue that we were seeing. And [technical difficulty] investors should take is [technical difficulty] pure play what is being reported as part of the Digital Experience segment that there's a clear alignment between what you see on bookings and what you see on revenue. As you've seen, the consulting services has been proactively driven down as a percentage of the revenue as we have a thriving ecosystem. I think the advertising cloud will not be a growth opportunity for us. There are some strategic partners who like the fact that we can continue to deliver it. But I would take that as a signal of we're really focused on the large growth opportunities where we have a differentiated solution. And it's purely subscription based revenue because that's in alignment with how we think about the largest opportunities. And so, we're focused as a company on making sure that we do it.  I'm actually really pleased with how we transitioned that and how we communicated to customers. And so, this focus on the software as a service component of all of our businesses, we believe that that drives top line growth, we believe that that drives margin, and we believe that that's consistent with where we want to be as a company. Shantanu Narayen : And given that was the last question, I want to, again, first and foremost thank you all for joining us today in what was this virtual format. I really hope you share the passion that we feel for the mission, the tremendous market opportunity ahead of us, the depth that we have in our technology platforms, and really the significant customer value that we're delivering and providing. We really believe that the global brand, the customer base that we have, the ubiquity of our software, and the dedicated employees provides a real competitive advantage. That, frankly, is the envy of the industry.  From my perspective, 2020 was an amazing year. We expect the momentum to continue in 2021 and beyond. And I certainly believe that our best years are ahead of us. As a number of you said, let me also wish you all a healthy, safe holiday season. And we really look forward to continuing to share the momentum and the story that we have in the new year.  So, thank you for joining us. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, Shantanu. And thanks again to everyone on the phone and on the webcast for joining us today. As Shantanu mentioned earlier, I also hope that we'll have an opportunity next fall to do this in person again. But we're really pleased that you joined us for the virtual event. Stay safe out there. Happy holidays to everyone. We look forward to seeing you at the Q1 call in March. And I'm sure I will be speaking to many of you very soon. This concludes the event.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon. I hope you are all well and staying safe. It is hard to believe that it has been over a year since the pandemic began and the world changed forever. During this unprecedented time, we have gone from a world with digital to a digital-first world. Digital experiences have played a vital role in making every aspect of our lives possible, from keeping families and co-workers connected, to enabling new ways of learning, to powering digital commerce and ensuring continuity of essential business operations. Overnight, we have transitioned to a global digital economy. Adobe's mission is to change the world through digital experiences. At Adobe, we are helping fuel the digital economy with our continuous innovation, our large and diverse set of global customers and partners and the unique expertise we have garnered from undergoing our own digital transformation. Our strategy of unleashing creativity, accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses is mission-critical and driving our top and bottom line growth. Adobe had an outstanding first quarter with strong results across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. We achieved $3.91 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 26% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.61, representing 33% year-over-year growth, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.14, representing 38% year-over-year growth. In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q1, achieving $2.86 billion in revenue, representing 32% year-over-year growth. Net new Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR was $435 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q1 grew to $10.69 billion. This past year, we have seen the tremendous power creativity has to inspire, connect and entertain us. Whether it is a student uploading his video assignment, a social media influencer advocating for change, or a small business owner designing her first website, everyone has a story to tell. Creative Cloud remains a market leader in core creative categories, including imaging, design, video, screen design and illustration, and we are expanding that leadership into emerging media types like 3D and AR. Creation and consumption across phones, tablets and desktops is exploding. We're building solutions for every surface and platform, enabling customers of every skill level to create whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. Our Behance community has grown to 25 million people and programs like Adobe Live provide ongoing forums for creatives to engage as a global community. In November, we turned Adobe MAX, our annual creativity conference, into a global digital event culminating in 10 million livestreams. Creative Cloud has truly become the world's creative engine, and our future opportunities are endless. Q1 Creative Cloud performance was strong, with net new Creative Cloud ARR of $337 million and revenue of $2.38 billion. Q1 highlights include : strength in our student offering, enabling next-gen creators to tell their stories in the midst of an unprecedented remote learning environment; momentum in our Teams offering, demonstrating the increased demand for collaboration solutions globally; growth in our core creative categories, including imaging, led by Photoshop and Lightroom; demand for Premiere Pro, the leader in the exploding video category, and the overwhelming favorite at the Sundance Film Festival for the third year in a row, with 68% of films using it; significant growth in our creative mobile applications, including Lightroom mobile and Photoshop Express; an increase in demand for Creative Cloud services like Adobe Stock, which helped fill the void created when live photography and video shoots had to be postponed; and all of this results in record traffic to Adobe.com, our world-class acquisition and growth engine, and our hub for customer engagement across all surfaces. We continue to deliver groundbreaking product innovation, including Neural Filters and Super Resolution features in Photoshop that harness the power of AI and machine learning to simplify complex workflows and enhance images in seconds, extending our applications to multiple surfaces with Illustrator on the iPad and Fresco on the iPhone and building collaboration capabilities with Creative Cloud libraries. In support of our commitment to digital citizenship, we are leading the Content Authenticity Initiative, now with over 150 members, to set the standard for transparency and attribution across the content ecosystem. We recently founded the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity to advance broad adoption of content authenticity standards. This year has shown us the mission-critical role that digital documents increasingly play in powering a modern business of any size. In a world where work needs to be done from anywhere and with anyone, digital workflows have become the critical underpinning to drive productivity and efficiency across global teams. With Document Cloud, we're accelerating document productivity, redefining how people view, edit, share, scan and sign documents across desktops, web, mobile and through frictionless PDF services. Through our document services, we're unleashing the PDF ecosystem with APIs for third-party developers to customize the digital document experience. Q1 Document Cloud performance was stellar, with net new Document Cloud ARR of $98 million and record revenue of $480 million. Q1 highlights include : outstanding Acrobat growth across all routes to market; significant traffic increases to our Acrobat Web experience, which delivers the ability to successfully complete PDF verb functionality in the browser, driven by best-in-class search engine optimization; powerful new Acrobat capabilities to accomplish converting, protecting and merging PDFs in the browser, furthering our strategy to make the PDF experience frictionless across devices and platforms; demand for our Acrobat Mobile and Adobe Scan apps; strong momentum for Adobe Sign, which is enabling critical e-signature workflows in businesses and government institutions around the world; delivery of an enhanced PDF reading experience with Acrobat Liquid Mode, which leverages Adobe Sensei to automatically reformat PDFs for quick and easy consumption; and key customer wins, including Amazon, Aon Services, Bank of America, Federal Aviation Administration, Merck and National Australia Bank. The pandemic accelerated the need for digital transformation among businesses of all sizes across both B2C and B2B. Small and midsized businesses had to quickly set up digital storefronts, enterprises that had not yet made substantial digital investments took the leap and those with significant digital footprints doubled down further. As the world begins to reopen, digital businesses will be the winners. Only companies that have a deep understanding of their customers' preferences and the ability to personalize experiences at every stage of the customer journey will survive and thrive. Adobe created the customer experience management category 10 years ago that we continue to lead. Experience Cloud, built on a next-gen open platform, is the most comprehensive solution for content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys, and most recently, marketing workflow. Through our acquisition of Workfront, Adobe has a unique opportunity to create a unified marketing system of record, bringing workflow management, efficiency and productivity gains to marketing teams challenged with siloed applications. Over a 1,000 shared customers are already benefitting from the integration and synergies between Experience Cloud and Workfront. Experience Cloud revenue was $934 million in Q1 with subscription revenue of $812 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Q1 highlights include momentum for Adobe Experience Platform, which continues to be the platform of choice for enterprise customers to deliver real-time personalization at scale; increasing demand for our commerce offerings. The Adobe Digital Index predicts that the pandemic has permanently boosted online spend by 20%, and 2022 will be the first $1 trillion year in e-commerce; solid performance in the Workfront business, demonstrating the need for a unified marketing workflow solution to drive productivity across global teams; enhancements in Customer Journey Analytics, delivering advanced anomaly detection, contribution analysis and intelligent alerts that identify hidden data patterns to more precisely understand customer behavior; powering the digital modernization of government agencies across state, county and city levels in all 50 U.S. states. Governments are revamping their online presence, making websites and apps easier to navigate; ensuring content is personalized and updated in real-time and creating intuitive forms that work on any device. Key customer wins, including Abbott Labs, Deutsche Post, Coca-Cola, FedEx, Kaiser Permanente, Mondelez, State of Illinois and Sydney Water Corporation; and industry analyst recognition in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms and the Forrester Agile Content Management Systems Wave report. This is the fourth year in a row that Adobe was placed as a leader in the DXP Magic Quadrant and the sixth consecutive time Forrester has recognized Adobe's industry leadership in their CMS-focused Wave reports. Adobe Summit, our annual digital experience conference, will be hosted virtually at the end of April across the globe. In addition to unveiling exciting new technology innovation in Experience Cloud, we will have customers and inspirational leaders from companies that have been on the front lines, including Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer; and Rajesh Subramaniam, President and COO of FedEx. Adobe's fortitude is rooted in an unwavering focus on our employees, groundbreaking innovation and our purpose, which is to harness the best of Adobe to make a significant impact in the world. At Adobe, it's not only about what we do, but how we do it. I am proud of our continued industry recognition, including being named to multiple lists celebrating Adobe as a great and equitable place to work for all, and being recognized on Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies List, Fortune's Most Admired Companies List and the CDP's Climate Change A-list. I am especially thankful to our 23,000 employees around the globe, whose dedication and talents delivered extraordinary results across every dimension of our business during these unprecedented times. Q1 was a record quarter for Adobe. As a result of our outstanding performance, tremendous opportunity across our business and continued confidence in our global execution, we are raising our annual targets. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. Q1 was a fantastic start to the year for Adobe, with strong financial results across all of our businesses. We accelerated revenue growth, expanded operating margins, and continued to drive demand across our portfolio of products and services, which are clearly resonating with enterprises and individuals in a world where digital has become the default. Harnessing the power of data, we continue to utilize our data-driven operating model DDOM to drive traffic to Adobe.com, generate demand for our products, acquire new customers and increase engagement. We are investing in massive market opportunities, delivering innovations across our products, and Workfront had a great first quarter as part of the Adobe family. As a result, in Q1 Adobe achieved record revenue of $3.91 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Recall that Q1 was a 14-week quarter for us versus the typical 13-week quarter. Business and financial highlights included : GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.61 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.14; Digital Media revenue of $2.86 billion; Net new Digital Media ARR of $435 million; Digital Experience revenue of $934 million; Cash flows from operations of $1.77 billion; Remaining Performance Obligation of $11.61 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 1.9 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In Q1 we saw continuing recovery in the business environment both in the U.S. and internationally, particularly with small and medium businesses, which contributed to our strong financial performance in the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 32% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1, and we exited the quarter with $10.69 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.38 billion, which represents 31% year-over-year growth, and we added $337 million of net new Creative ARR. Our Creative growth in Q1 was driven by strong consumer demand for our Creative solutions on Adobe.com; driving improvements in usage, retention and engagement across our products; growth in our mobile business, through app store subscriptions and top-of-funnel awareness; continued recovery in the SMB segment, which we target with our Creative Cloud for Teams offering; and investing in targeted campaigns and promotions to drive awareness and acquire new users, including in emerging markets. Adobe Document Cloud delivered another quarter of accelerated revenue growth. We achieved Document Cloud revenue of $480 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth, and we added $98 million of net new Document Cloud ARR. Documents are the currency of business, and the imperative for digitization has never been greater. Our Document Cloud growth in Q1 was driven by increasing demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all geos; strong enterprise term licensing with institutions; utilizing DDOM insights to drive improved conversion on Adobe.com; success in the reseller channel, both for subscriptions and our perpetual offering, including seat growth in the SMB segment; and strength in Adobe Sign, which grew revenue more than 50% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q1 we achieved revenue of $934 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $812 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Our Q1 results continue to validate the strength of our industry-leading Customer Experience Management or CXM solutions. Large enterprises across industries and geographies are standardizing on Adobe to manage customer interactions, gain actionable insights and unify their customer data with Adobe Experience Platform. In our Commerce business we continued to sign large deals with new customers and drive upsells at renewal points, enabling every business to transact online. Optimizing customer journeys across all channels in a digital-first world is critical to enterprises, and we see momentum with our larger customers adopting our complete Experience Cloud offering to drive omni-channel personalization at scale. We are driving the global CXM mandate across B2B and B2C, from large enterprises to midsized companies, across multiple verticals. Recent wins included expanding our reach in the public sector, where we are enabling critical constituent-facing services, and adoption in the midmarket of our new AEM Cloud Service, Adobe Commerce and Marketo Engage. Lastly, we are off to a fast start in integrating Workfront and driving the strategic value proposition of combining best-in-class workflow technology with Adobe's leading CXM and Creative solutions. Workfront contributed $38 million of revenue in Q1 after purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue. We continue to drive savings from travel and entertainment and facilities operations as our employees work from home. We are expanding investment in hiring globally, particularly for R&D and sales and marketing roles, in order to capitalize on our large addressable markets. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $37 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the sequential currency increase to revenue was $34 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $62 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the year-over-year currency increase to revenue was $44 million. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 12% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis. The tax rate came in lower than expected primarily due to a favorable tax ruling in the quarter which allowed us to reduce our withholding taxes and receive refunds for certain prior payments, and to a lesser extent, larger than expected tax benefits associated with share-based payments, and favorable resolutions of other income tax matters. Our trade DSO was 38 days, which compares to 41 days in the year-ago quarter, and 37 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation grew by 17% year-over-year to $11.61 billion exiting Q1. Deferred Revenue exiting the quarter was $4.29 billion, growing 19% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.96 billion, which is sequentially down quarter-over-quarter due to the acquisition of Workfront. Cash flows from operations in Q1 were $1.77 billion. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $888 million. We currently have $1.1 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018, which we expect to be exhausted by the end of this fiscal year. In December 2020 we announced that our Board authorized an additional $15 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal year 2024, which will be funded from future cash flow generation. For Q2, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $3.72 billion; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 21%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $450 million; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 18%; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 20%; tax rate of approximately 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 482 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.09; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.81. In light of Adobe's strong Q1 business performance and the momentum reflected in our second quarter targets, we are increasing our annual targets for fiscal 2021. We are now targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $15.45 billion; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 22%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.8 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 20%; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 23%; tax rate of approximately 17.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 481 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $9.13; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $11.85. In Digital Media ARR, we expect a return to normal pre-COVID summer seasonality, which can lead to sequentially lower net new ARR in Q3, followed by year-end strength in Q4. We expect operating margin to be relatively flat from Q2 to Q3 and then dip slightly in Q4 as we get back to spending on travel and reoccupying our facilities. In summary, Q1 was a great start, and we expect fiscal 2021 to be another record year. Combining our strength in customer acquisition and engagement, our leading technologies and talented employee base, Adobe is poised to continue our track record of impressive top- and bottom-line growth. Lastly, as reported in our press release earlier today, I have expressed my intent to retire this year. It is a very difficult decision for me because I love Adobe. And you may ask why now? I have been very fortunate in my career and I still have the passion and energy to fully dedicate myself to my philanthropic interests as well as prioritize my family and friends. We have navigated our way extremely well during the pandemic and our Q1 results and raised targets are evidence that the company is on solid footing. So I feel comfortable that this is the right time for me. Our highly tenured finance and operations team is top notch and I plan on helping Shantanu through a transition period as the company launches a search for my successor. Now, I'll turn it back to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : John has played a critical role in Adobe's strong performance for which I am deeply grateful. John and the entire finance and operations organization have helped drive top and bottom line growth with a relentless focus on shareholder value. In addition to his accomplishments as CFO, John embodies Adobe's values, always operating with the highest integrity and ethical standards. John will work with me to ensure a smooth transition and I'm happy that John will be able to focus on his family and philanthropic pursuits and wish him all the best. Adobe's global brand, unparalleled innovation, broad spectrum of customers and partners, and dedicated employees provide an unmatched competitive advantage. I remain bullish that technology will continue to transform work, learn and play, resulting in a brighter future for all of us. I will now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Hello. Thank you very much, and congratulations on a spectacular quarter. Shantanu, my question, again, naggingly, annoyingly, is about Creative TAM. You've been very consistent in talking about how large the TAM for Creative is. I think goes back to 10 years prior. Can you talk -- and you mentioned today on this call that it's seemingly endless in terms of the opportunity. Can you expand on that? Why is that the case? There is a view, not that I share, that once the economy opens up that the creative folks are going to get out and enjoy their summer vacations and do less creative stuff, so we take a bit of a back step on digital transformation. I don't know how you feel about that, but if you can just talk to that tactical opening of the economy and if that might impede digital transformation or maybe not, and then talk about why your confidence in the TAM of Creative is even greater than it was, say, five years back? Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Happy to do that, Kash, and it's good to have you back on our calls now at Goldman. So first, let me just say that, when you think about content and design, there is no question that it's fueling the global economy and the way we segment our business as we think about what we are doing for Creative pros, what we are doing for communicators, and what we are doing for consumers.  And first to, I think, just share some numbers associated with that, I think we've said there are 49 million Creative professionals who use our products to make a living. There are 700 million communicators, and approximately 4 billion consumers. And so when you think about the TAM, whether that's $20 billion for the Creative pros, $15 billion for communicators, or $6 billion for consumers in 2023, I mean, that represents a $41 billion addressable market opportunity given the importance of design. So it's a massive opportunity. What gives us confidence? I think when we think about strategically what we are trying to do, certainly, the first thing we're trying to do is advance every Creative category. And I'll just give you one example, Kash. I mean, what's happening with immersive media and when you think about 3D to 2D and being able to do all these virtual shoots as the amount of content, that's an emerging business. I had a really great quarter that continues on what we had said about video being one of the growth initiatives for us. So, I think the new media types and advancing it is certainly critical. I think multi-surface systems, what we can do associated with making sure mobile, mobile has been a really good growth opportunity for us. And the way we look at that, it's both as a result of the funnel that it provides for both mobile and desktop, but also as part of a system, so people can create whenever they want. So even if they are going to be out in summer, as you say, they'll have access to all of our Creative tools wherever they go. The third one I would say is what we are doing with collaboration and the team and everything associated with allowing people to collaborate. Services, I mean, Stock had another great quarter. We grew that business approximately 30% year-over-year, and the notion of just continuing to make sure that we do creativity for all, I think, the world is going to be in a place where Creative expression is going to dominate everything associated with education and productivity. So all of that gives us really high confidence associated with the opportunity and our execution. And then, if you think about it for Q1, really just quickly, I mean, Q1 was a record quarter. We continued to see really great demand on the web associated with what's happening, and the absolute ARR was strong again. And this is, as you point out, despite the recovery being complete. And so we just feel like we're in an absolutely sweet spot as it relates to what people want to do with our tools and services. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. Congratulations. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Kash. Operator : Our next question will come from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Jennifer Lowe : Great, thank you. Maybe just following along sort of the commentary on recovery. One of the things that stood out to me is the strength that you saw in SMB this quarter. So maybe two questions on that. First, are you kind of back to pre-COVID levels at this point in terms of SMB momentum? Or is there still more to gain there? And then secondly, just specific on Experience Cloud, I know even pre-COVID there were some execution challenges that you were experiencing in the SMB space. So have those execution challenges been sort of fully addressed and you're seeing some of those more mid-market oriented products that you've acquired executing the way you'd like them to? That's it for me. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, first, I think as it relates to the SMB segment, as we mentioned, both in the Document Cloud and Creative Cloud and to your question specifically around Experience Cloud, we did see continued momentum and growth. So I still think that when you think about what's happening in the world, it's still not fully back, right, to normal and we're still in a sort of a pandemic situation. So I clearly think there's upside. And every day you have good news in certain geographies and unfortunately not so good news. And so that only augurs well for us as we look at our business moving forward. But if I take a big picture view associated with Experience Cloud, which was the second part of your question, digital transformation, just talking to all the CEOs that I'm talking to, those who've already invested in digital are absolutely doubling down because they recognize that this is the way to further differentiate. And those who are not are clearly investing in the people, technology and processes to be in this market, whether it's transformational accounts at the enterprise level that Anil talked about at the Financial Analyst Meeting or whether it's at the small and medium business, your question associated with what we are able to do to enable them to have a digital storefront, which is an absolute necessity for doing business today. There's a lot of interest and demand in both of those. I know a lot of you, as I read your reports, the checks that you're doing, you're hearing the interest in our solutions and the talk from both the customers and the partners is high. And so we are going to see more demand for this. We had a good quarter. If you look at how we are targeting DX, we clearly expect acceleration of revenue without -- with and without Workfront, Q3 over Q2 and Q4 over Q3. So we're really excited and I think we're in the sweet spot on all three of our growth areas. Jennifer Lowe : Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Mark Moerdler of Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter and a great start to the year. John, we're going to miss you, but completely understand the desire to spend more time with family and philanthropy. So enjoy it. Two quarters ago, you called out your increased focus on driving Experience Cloud margin improvement. Can you give us an update on where you are in driving Experience Cloud margin improvement? And any sense what you think about long-term margins could be for what Experience Cloud is today versus the future? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Well, Mark, I'll let John speak to his decision after this as well. But I think the decision to be made associated with reducing our focus on the transaction-based advertising revenue, if you look at everything that's happening associated with that business, there are other companies in that space. I think that was a good way to do it, what we've done with the Experience platform. And with Anil coming in, taking a soup to nuts approach associated with that entire P&L and the business opportunity, he's been able to align and simplify and improve it. And so, I mean, you don't accomplish the kinds of margins that we accomplished in the year without a focus across all of our businesses. And so we have an incredibly good leverage model, but there's more. I mean, Digital Experience is still in that area where we're growing revenue, I mean 20% is what we've targeted for the entire year. We had 27% of subscription revenue in Q1. And so it really is one of those areas that's a growth opportunity and you will see that translate into the bottom line over time. But, John, maybe I'll have you also add to that. John Murphy : Yes, no; absolutely. I think the continued focus that we have both on gross margin and on operating margin in the businesses is key. And Mark, thanks for the words. I'm definitely going to miss you guys as well, but I will be here for a while during the transition. You can imagine it was a difficult decision to make. You think about these things for a while. But I decided even last year during the pandemic, and you kind of refocus on some priorities. And so I'm really fortunate for the great career I've had and thankful to Shantanu and Adobe to allow me this opportunity to pursue my passions. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. I appreciate it and congrats. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Brent Thill of Jefferies. Brent Thill : Good afternoon, Shantanu. You had mentioned a couple of years ago at Summit that the customer data platform architecture was a revolutionary architecture and was going to bring some really interesting opportunities to Adobe. It sounds like some of those customers are going live now. And I'm just curious to get your perspective on where you're at on that journey and what you're starting to see in Experience Cloud with CDP coming online? Shantanu Narayen : Brent, we have seen some -- quite a bit of success. I think we have some really blue chip customers that we talked about -- the conversations that I'm having with each of these customers. And people talk about Customer 360. We're the only major company that has anything out there of this scale to be able to do real-time personalization at scale. We have billions of profiles that are already going through this. Absolutely blue chip customers, whether it's financial services, whether it's in other online like retail -- what we are doing with telecommunications. And so not only do we have that, but it has really served as a basis for what we've done with the customer journey analytics. So, if you take a step back and the big areas that we talked about content, commerce, data insights and audiences, which is such a key part -- I think that becomes even more important with what's happening in the spooky world so that you can have access to all your first party data and profiles. So, I think the decision to invest in that was right. The success that we're seeing in the marketplace and the leadership, I think, positions us incredibly well, Brent. And you'll hear a lot more about that at Summit, certainly. I think the Workfront acquisition also has had the unique opportunity to be able to add to what we have in terms of our solutions and get workflow also and attribution associated with it. So I feel really good. But I feel really good about the infrastructure with CDP. And we focus a lot more on the real-time nature of what we can do with personalization as the key differentiation. But some great customer wins. Brent Thill : Just a quick follow-up for John. On the 20% growth you're now guiding, just back to Jen's question. Does that assume a full recovery for SMB or is that still contemplating that there's still some improvement that you could squeeze out of that segment of the market? John Murphy : Thanks, Brent. Yes, no, for sure it really reflects a continued recovery. But it's not -- we don't expect to be back to pre-COVID levels. I think as we saw as we exited FY '20, that momentum and kind of recovery was just gradual and continual recovery. And we're into the benefit of that. Brent Thill : Okay, thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Hey Brent, you followed us for a significant amount of time. We don't bank on anything dramatically changing. We look at the demand that we have and current trends. We're not macroeconomic experts. And so as the recovery happens more, but we're not banking on it. Just to be clear. Brent Thill : Thanks, gentlemen. Operator : And we'll go now to Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Hi, thanks very much. Shantanu, I was just kind of curious. As we come out of the pandemic, your businesses has executed incredibly well. Are there parts of the business though that would benefit from getting back in front of the customer base? I'm thinking about sort of the Experience Cloud business in particular. You guys have, obviously, been able to execute really well in a virtual world. But I do wonder if there's areas whether it's Experience Cloud, maybe in the education market, areas like that, where being able to get out and talk to the customers again would actually be beneficial. I was just curious if you had any thoughts on that. Shantanu Narayen : I think so. I mean the world has done a pretty amazing job of pivoting to working at home and being able to do as much as you can. And I've talked about the fact that being able to visit with customers all across the globe without travel is in many ways a real ability to scale. But I also am one who believes that being in front of the customers and getting the partners that we have together and accelerating the rollout and sharing best practices and that social part is only going to help. I don't think the world is going back to everybody being in the office, but I do believe that it will be an accelerant. Because people's desire to also invest more as the economic situation improves can only be another tailwind for us. And so we've done a pretty incredible job. I mean when you look at our numbers. But there's no question in my mind. I mean if we can go travel and if we can meet with those customers and do it, there's only upside associated with that. Kirk Materne : And then, maybe just one quick one for. Shantanu Narayen : What we notice that we can do as well as -- sorry, both in terms of what we can do as well as their own confidence, right, in continuing to expand their investments. Kirk Materne : Thanks for that. And then just maybe a quick one for John. John, on the Workfront revenue came in a little bit higher than your initial expectations. Was that just mainly around sort of deferred accounting? I realize you probably took a fairly conservative view on that given you had to close the acquisition, you talked to us in December. But it sounds like you got off to a good start. Is there any uplift maybe in the bookings or revenue just in terms of the combination or is that mainly just sort of a factor of accounting? Thanks. John Murphy : Yes, thanks, Ken. No, the Workfront actually really did have great performance. So outside of the accounting adjustments for purchase accounting, we saw momentum in the business. And we had kind of suggested maybe about $140 million, $150 million in Workfront revenue impacting FY '21, but we think it'll be a bit more than that given the performance because the combined offering is really resonating with our customer base. That was really the, from the business case of doing this acquisition to begin with. We'll take the next question, operator. Operator : We'll go to that next question and that will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, for you first. At the Analyst Meeting in December, the company had some very interesting things to say about your technology and where you were investing. You referred, for example, in the case of Creative to what you called a deeply collaborative shared system. In the case of Doc Cloud, you referred to intelligence applied to PDF, as with Liquid Mode; all of that in the context of your applications and intelligent services. The question is, could you foresee the role for or need for new configurations or a new kind of segmentation of the product line, new SKUs, new packaging, anything of that sort particularly as you become more domain-specific oriented? And then for John, over the last three quarters you've had a very steep almost V-shaped recovery in your job openings from almost none back in June/July, to now over 1,000 and up four months in a row year-over-year. Could you talk about that in terms of your onboarding and the context of how you were thinking about OpEx growth for the year? Shantanu Narayen : Jay, maybe I'll take your question and since they haven't been asked many questions yet on Document Cloud, I'll use Document Cloud with the technology lens to answer your question. I mean first, Liquid Mode, I was on the road. I was traveling on the road last week and the entire preparation for this I was doing on a mobile device with Liquid Mode. And I will tell you, Liquid Mode for me was an absolute lifesaver in terms of being able to look at all these documents and do everything collaboratively on the road. So an unabashed plug for those who haven't tried Liquid Mode or haven't tried Adobe Scan to really see how it changes. And the way we think about it is when you apply that kind of AI to fundamentally change the nature and understanding the structure and semantics of documents, it opens up so many different possibilities on the segmentation. I mean we now have revenue that we drive through Reader and Reader distribution and upsells because we understand what people are trying to do and understand the intent. We're driving revenue through search engine optimization that we do on PDF because we have a one-click way of having them do more and more PDF functionality. We have a new revenue monetization model associated with APIs and being able to have people use PDF and embed that in their particular workflows. And we've always had Acrobat Sign, had a great quarter. Again, I think John may have mention that we grew 50%. And so to your point, I mean AI and technology and being able to make that available and accessible in different ways is not just serving the customers better but it's clearly providing us new opportunities to monetize it that previously did not exist. And so I think you'll continue to see that in the innovation roadmap whether it's Summit or MAX. You'll see some really cool things which will not just push the envelope for our Creative pros but also make it way more accessible, productive and fun for communicators and consumers. John? John Murphy : Yes, in regards to the job openings, the headcount growth, when we entered the pandemic last year, we did pause hiring initiatives we talked about to really focus our resources on our highest priorities, and we did that and successfully navigated the pandemic and really came out taking advantage of the opportunities in front of us. And so with that, of course, we talked about it in Q3 that we were going to start to ramp hiring. And so we have done that and we continue to look to invest, as I said, in R&D and sales capacity as well as variable marketing. In terms of the impact on OpEx, we had originally planned for margin expansion in FY '21 over FY '20, and we've updated targets actually indicating even greater margin expansion even though it accounts for our phased reentry as we come back to traveling, as we reopen our facilities. So for us, it's the ability to grow the top line and the leverage in our operating model allows us to be able to do that. So for us, margin expansion is really all driven off of revenue growth and ultimately we can perform both very well on the top line and on the bottom line. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Operator : And next, we will go to Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey. Thanks for taking my question here, guys, and congrats, John, on the well-deserved retirement. Shantanu, maybe for you on the Creative business, can you just talk about the product pipeline to that growing individual user base for the rest of 2021? Broad brushes, of course. And how you feel about Adobe's ability to help them grow or progress in their journey to higher-end Creative Cloud apps? And, John, if I can just fit in one housekeeping question that maybe might be helpful, I was wondering if you can just quantify how much the extra week added to total revenue and net new ARR in the quarter? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Saket, I mean, maybe I'll speak to that and I'll also give you my color on sort of what happened with ARR. But first as it relates to how we're expanding both the user base and acquisitions, I mean, the net new ARR, when you look at it, it's primarily all new net new ARR in terms of customer acquisition. And whether it's the mobile-only applications that we are providing, whether it's the web-based ability to do things in the browser, whether it's collaboration, that's certainly the way in which we are expanding our offering. And frankly, the way we do it is that anybody who uses one of our on-ramp products whether it's an individual category apps that is then using the entire CC all apps or whether it's the consumer app where they start to get exposed to things like maybe layers in Photoshop or a timeline in Premiere Rush, they have the ability to then be upsold as well as to become more productive by going to Premiere or Photoshop. So it's very much been a part of our strategy all along, which is how do you attract customers to the platform and how do you think about then making sure that as they grow in their Creative endeavors that we have the right on-ramp whether it's an offer that we provide at the right time, whether it's engagement that we do with Adobe CreativeLive. I mean, CreativeLive has really become in that community of Behance a great way for people to continue to grow and learn. And I think there are a whole cottage industry also of people who've done training and learning and education on Creative products. So that's the strategy, which is meet the customer where they are whether it's on a surface or whether it's a degree of specialization, and then make sure that as they expand their Creative pursuits that we're the right product for that. And so if you think about it, I mean, digital media ARR, what really happens is it's not -- while revenue may be more representative of the number of weeks in a quarter, and so if you take the 14 weeks over 13 weeks, you can argue that it was probably eight points of revenue that was extra as a result of the 14 week. But ARR is not as cyclical because ARR when you have an enterprise part of the business, it's probably going to be back-end loaded by most enterprise much like enterprise. So that's why we look at the Q1 ARR, which was a record for Creative, as a really solid performance. So, hopefully that gives you a flavor. Revenue for Creative is little bit more dependent on the number of weeks, but ARR is sort of you have these things that we do, which are cyclical, and that drives the strong growth that we saw across both Creative and Documents. Saket Kalia : Very helpful, Shantanu. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Ken Wong : Great, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dive in a little bit on the Digital Experience business. Would love some color behind the confidence in the 23% DX sub growth. Is this purely just improving macro or are you guys seeing better deal flows, bigger deals, specific products that are contributing to this uptick? And any help there would be fantastic. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, I think the confidence comes from first, the performance in Q1. As we said, we had 27% subscription revenue growth. I think the confidence comes from the conversations that we're all having with companies all across the globe, from the pipeline that we have, from what we know in terms of Summit. And again, as in their response to the previous question that was asked, this is not banking on any macroeconomic environment changes for the rest of the year. So it's based on what we know today and the interest. Commerce is an area that is seeing a fair amount of interest, the real-time customer data platform. The experience platform is seeing a significant amount of interest. Workfront, as we said, and John mentioned that it's not the deferred revenue. It's the performance as well that's driving the upside in that particular business. Customer journey analytics and being able to address this in a multichannel, that's seeing a lot of interest. I think you're going to see some new products also in terms of how we evolve our campaign product and analytics product to be more business performance related. And frankly, to a large extent, Ken, all of this is also predicated on how we run our business, right? And our DDOM and understanding what it takes to run an online business, and we're world class at that, and we're building products for ourselves. And so that gives us a lot of confidence that it will help every other customer out there. Ken Wong : Great, thanks a lot for that insight. Operator : And next we will go to Sterling Auty of J.P. Morgan. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. First, John, congratulations on a wonderful tenure as CFO of Adobe. Just one question from my side, you touched upon Adobe Sign and the 50% growth that you saw on the quarter. It seems like meaningful acceleration from what we saw year or so ago, where I think that business was growing about 25%. I'm going to take a stab, any sense would you be willing to quantify and size the Adobe Sign business at this point? And then second, in terms of the accelerating growth, I think you mentioned government. But what are you particularly seeing that's driving the uptake of that e-signature business? Shantanu Narayen : I think our key differentiating there, Sterling, is the fact that PDF as a format continues to be the format the people are using for automating these workflows. I think the fact that we have Adobe Reader, which is the operating environment in which all of the workflows are happening, I think we've done a better job with awareness, frankly, of what we have and that, hopefully, some of you have seen the incredibly new Creative campaigns that we're running associated with that. We're actually getting a fair amount of wins from other competitive products that people might have been using in terms of moving over to Adobe. The partnerships that we have with Microsoft and ServiceNow in terms of being embedded, whether it's in SharePoint or Outlook or partnering with ServiceNow. So, I think we're executing on the product side. I think we have some key differentiation, and this is not a zero-sum game. It's such a large opportunity, and I think the work-from-home has also certainly benefited us and everybody else in that space. So all of those I think are reasons why Sign just continues to be a real growth opportunity for us. The last thing I would mention is the ability to embed our Sign stuff within other people's offerings as well. I think we made some good progress on that one as well so all of these give us confidence. And to your question, Sterling, we don't break it up because it's hard, right? Sometimes you have an enterprise deal where you have all of them using Acrobat and Sign. And so even on the individual case, you have the ability to use a certain amount of Sign capability with an Acrobat. And so I think our strength is in the combined offering. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman : Hi, thank you very much. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could give an update on the Commerce Cloud. And I'll break it into two parts. A, could you talk a little bit about growth rates and profiles? In other words, are you moving into larger situations with more scalable demands? And, B, could you talk a little bit about you moved through acquisition into the commerce area, and it fits into the DDOM model. And yet you're still partnering on the services side of the equation of the service cloud. I just wanted to see if you could juxtapose your strategies surrounding willingness to move into commerce via M&A and any thoughts on is partnering still the right strategy for the services side? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, at the end of the day, Keith, we are a software company. And so I think -- actually just to give you a little bit of an update on numbers -- the beauty of when we acquired Magento and put it in the Commerce Cloud was first it was B2B and B2C. That was an attractive area for us. Second, it was physical goods and digital growth. That was an interesting opportunity for us. I think the third thing that was important for us was the fact that we had the ability to have both a large ecosystem of partners who were implementing this as well as an open-source community that was able to extend the functionality and, in effect, the extended R&D model. On the partner side, I think we've gone something from 2,800 or so partners that they had to well over 4,000. So the interest in partnering with us on the Commerce Cloud is high. And our model, as we've always said, this goes back also to the earlier question that somebody had on the P&L associated with Digital Experience. Our model is software, and we're happy actually to have a large ecosystem of partners that work with it. And maybe the last thing I would say on that particular front is that we're really continuing to expand what we do on the Merchant Services offering. So partners like PayPal and what we can do in conjunction with them and other credit card and other partners. I think that's going to also be a good area of continued growth for us. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thank you, Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Jonathan Vaas : Operator, we'll take two more questions and then wrap up. Thanks. Operator : Certainly. And next we will go to Derrick Wood of Cowen & Company. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks. Question on Document Cloud and maybe the first part for John. It looks like perpetual is quite strong, and I suspect that came from strength in the ETLA activity. But can you talk to how you're thinking about perpetual mix as we look through the rest of the year and whether we could see another spike in any given quarter? And then, maybe more for Shantanu. Just kind of a refresher around the strategy within Document Cloud on getting more customers to shift to subscription and how to think about those efforts over the next couple of years. Shantanu Narayen : Awesome. Maybe I'll go with the strategy and then, John, you can certainly add to that, which [indiscernible]. First, from a strategic point of view, if you go to Adobe.com, it's primarily subscription. And so we've done a fantastic job of converting that business to subscription. When you look at it globally and you consider some other markets where a lot of it is going through the resellers, even that has predominantly become subscription. But we'd be crazy not to have people if they do want some perpetual to buy the perpetual and then convert it to subscription because we still know that. So, I think to your Uber point, yes, we did see some strength in perpetual. China, I think, had also a pretty strong quarter as it related to Acrobat. And that may be a little bit more perpetual. Our strategy is clearly moving into the cloud. Our strategy is clearly demonstrating the value of where people see the ongoing innovation that we're providing. But that business, unlike the other business, we just want to attract more and more customers to any one of those offerings. And that's why we've continued to have the Acrobat perpetual offer out there. But it's becoming smaller and smaller. As a part of the business it's definitely becoming smaller and smaller. I know on Adobe.com it's virtually de minimis. Derrick Wood : Great, thanks. Operator : And we will go to our final question, and that will be from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys, for sneaking me in and again my congratulations to John on the retirement, well-deserved. And also, really nice quarter. I wanted to ask you guys about a concern that I hear from investors and kind of get your take on it. While you guys are seeing a recovery on the SMB side of the equation, the fact of the matter is the Digital Media business did really well through all of last year, even in the height of the pandemic. In the upcoming May quarter, you guys saw really good ARR growth, it was up on a year-on-year basis, which exceeded a lot of people's expectations. But now there's a concern that it's a really tough comp ahead that you guys saw work-from-home benefits or benefit that were due to sort of what was going on with the crisis that that might create a difficult compare. Can you talk about whether there is like a difficult compare ahead? And is there a different sort of tone or nature of the business that you're seeing now versus what you saw last year at this time as we were in the crisis? Shantanu Narayen : I think Keith, the question that we ask ourselves is the big shifts that we've seen in terms of how people work, the need to create, the different kinds of media types that exist. Is there anything that's going to fundamentally change when the economy changes? And we don't think so, because we just continue to believe that that importance of all of those areas and the tailwinds that exist in the market will continue to exist. I mean I think in terms of our numbers and you look at what we are doing, we've said, it's -- we've raised the target a little bit from what we had, the $1.75 billion to the $1.8 billion. And this is 10 years into it, driving a record ARR. I would say that that reflects the much larger market opportunity that we've created for ourselves. And so, the way I actually look at it, Keith, is that it's brought more attention to what's possible with our tools. And once people experience the benefits of what they're doing with us, it's going to be hard to go back to not using those kinds of technologies, which is what gives us a lot of interest. Hopefully, and you were certainly there, Keith, at the Analyst Meeting. That's why we tried to lay out completely what we see in terms of communicators and consumers and Creative pros. And I mean the business is doing really well. We're expanding the Digital Media segment revenue for the year, we're expanding revenue. And so that's all based on what we see as demand for what we have created and the tremendous amount of innovation that's ahead of us. So I think all of those give us a lot of confidence in the fundamental nature of the growth opportunities that we're focused on. And since that was the last question, I mean maybe just a couple of points. I would like to, and I know a lot of you did, also publicly thank John. This was I know for John a very personal decision, and I'm happy that he is going to be able to focus on what's important to him which is family and his philanthropic interests, and I'm deeply grateful. And on the overall business, it's hard. It's hard to believe that a year has passed since the pandemic impacted the world, but I think what's really incredible is digital is not just a nice to have right now, it's absolutely mission critical. And most companies would be thrilled to have one area of growth. We have three areas of growth : creativity, storytelling, design, what's happening with the future of work and remote work and the limitations of what you can do with in-person interaction, which will lead to more automation of digital documents and how every business in the planet is going to focus on engaging digitally with their customers, so massive opportunity. I think Q1 was a really strong quarter. We have a compelling strategy, an outstanding innovation roadmap. And I really have to thank all our employees who've pivoted to work from home and executed magnificently in what had been difficult circumstances, and which is why the momentum let us to increase our targets for '21. And as I always say, I think the top line and bottom line performance really set us apart as an investment for people. But stay safe, stay healthy, and we really look forward to having you attend Summit where we will unveil the next generation of enterprise innovation. Thank you for joining us, and I'll pass it back to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Okay. Thanks, Shantanu. And this concludes the call. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And again, everyone, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Jonathan. Adobe had another outstanding quarter as the shift to a digital-first world continues to accelerate. From students to creative professionals to small businesses to the world\u2019s largest global enterprises, digital is transforming how we work, learn and play. Adobe\u2019s mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is working. Fueled by our ground-breaking innovation, proven capability to create and lead categories and our expansive global customer base, our opportunity and momentum has never been greater. In Q2, Adobe achieved $3.84 billion in revenue, representing 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.32 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.03. In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in Q2 in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, achieving $2.79 billion in revenue, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Net new Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR was $518 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q2 grew to $11.21 billion. Over the last year, we have seen the critical role creativity has played in the world. Creative Cloud is empowering everyone, from the most demanding professional, to the high school student, to the next generation of social media creators, to tell their stories. Adobe is the leader in core creative categories such as imaging, design, video and illustration, and we are expanding our leadership in exciting new media types, including screen design and prototyping, 3D and AR. In a world that requires anyone to be able to create from anywhere, we are building products and services for every surface and platform. Our vibrant creative communities continue to be a tremendous source of inspiration and our goal remains to provide access to a larger and increasingly diverse set of creators and design teams, furthering our strategy of unleashing creativity for all. Q2 Creative Cloud performance was strong, with net new Creative Cloud ARR of $405 million and revenue of $2.32 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth. Q2 highlights include, new product innovations, including updates to Lightroom, Photoshop and Illustrator that deliver enhanced creation and collaboration capabilities and greater speed and performance. Next week, we will unveil new innovations for Substance, our 3D solution, designed to improve the creation process with new tools to help assemble, style and sculpt. Increasing engagement and retention across offerings, including greater customer uptake of training, participation in community events and continuous product enhancements derived from insights about customer usage and value. Momentum in our Creative Cloud Teams offering globally, reinforcing the growth in adoption of Creative Cloud within small and medium businesses. Strong customer acquisition in core creative and emerging categories, especially photography and video, supported by exciting marketing campaigns globally for Photoshop and Premiere; and accelerating demand for 3D&I in key verticals such as gaming, automotive, fashion & e-commerce.  Continued growth of mobile traffic, leading to new customer acquisition of mobile offerings, like Lightroom Mobile and Photoshop Express, and a strong funnel for desktop applications, strong growth for Adobe Stock, with an increasingly robust content library and growing submissions that provide sustained earnings for our contributors. Global momentum, with accelerated demand in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Key customer wins, including ByteDance, Netflix, Microsoft and Unity. And new partnerships to inspire the next generation of creators, including one with Netflix that gives emerging creators access to tools, resources and mentorship to bring their stories to life, and another with Khan Academy, designed to provide teachers and students in underserved communities with access to digital tools and learning resources. In this digital-first business environment, seamless document workflows across every device and platform are more important than ever for the modern workforce to collaborate and be productive. Document Cloud is accelerating document productivity by powering the paper-to-digital transformation and enabling all document actions including editing, sharing, scanning and signing to be frictionless across web, desktop and mobile applications. We delivered strong Document Cloud revenue in Q2, with net new Document Cloud ARR of $113 million, and outstanding revenue of $469 million, representing 30% year-over-year growth. Q2 highlights include new product innovations, including new features in Acrobat Liquid Mode that further improve accessibility on mobile devices; new Adobe Scan functionality that enables users to combine, save and store scans more efficiently; and new Sign capabilities in Acrobat to help small and medium-sized businesses improve their digital footprint with easily embeddable forms and digital payments. Strength in Acrobat across all routes to market and offerings, with enterprise bookings growth up over 60% year-over-year; accelerated demand for Sign, with new Sign customers doubling year-over-year and an increasing share of Acrobat users leveraging Sign capabilities; explosive growth in Acrobat Web services, driven by significant improvements in SEO for a new set of customers. In Q2, we drove 30 million visits to frictionless PDF pages and now offer capabilities for over 20 different document verbs; continued growth of mobile traffic, including over 110 million mobile downloads of Adobe Scan and one billion scans to-date, and a greater than 20% year-over-year increase in Acrobat mobile app adoption; momentum across all geographies, with accelerated demand in Europe, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand; and key customer wins, including ADP, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Toyota and Wells Fargo. I am thrilled to welcome back David Wadhwani, who has rejoined Adobe as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer of our Digital Media business. His impressive track record and passion for Adobe and our customers make him the ideal person to lead our Digital Media business through its next phase of growth. Digital transformation has become an imperative for businesses of every size in every industry. According to our recent Adobe Digital Economy Index, e-commerce spending is projected to be $4.2 trillion globally this year, and reach $1 trillion in the U.S. alone in 2022. We predict that U.S. online spending on the upcoming Prime Day will surpass the $10.9 billion mark that Cyber Monday reached in 2020. Across both B2C and B2B, companies around the globe are investing in digital to deliver personalized and engaging customer experiences. Experience Cloud is the most comprehensive solution for content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys and marketing workflow. With unified customer profiles and an open and extensible architecture, Adobe Experience Platform is the clear platform of choice for enterprises to deliver real-time personalization at scale, powering more than 17 trillion audience segment evaluations every day. Experience Cloud revenue was $938 million in Q2, representing 21% year-over-year growth, and subscription revenue was $817 million, representing 25% year-over-year growth. In April, we held our annual digital experience conference, Adobe Summit, virtually. We drove an unprecedented 20 million views of Summit content from individuals around the globe, underscoring the significant interest and demand for customer experience management. Highlights of product announcements include, Adobe Journey Optimizer, which helps marketers optimize the customer journey across outbound and inbound customer touchpoints; Adobe Customer Journey Analytics, which enables brands to integrate and standardize their online and offline data and is years ahead of any competitive offering; the next generation of Adobe\u2019s Real-time Customer Data Platform to help brands optimize their acquisition and engagement strategies in a first-party data world; a preview of a pioneering marketing system of record, built on Workfront technology, designed to manage complex marketing workflows for greater efficiency and agility; and new intelligent commerce capabilities and a strategic partnership with FedEx that will allow every small and medium business to offer expedited shipping capabilities as part of their commerce platform. Beyond Summit, Q2 accomplishments include, strength in core offerings, including explosive bookings growth for Adobe Experience Platform, and associated services like Customer Journey Analytics and Real-time CDP, which combined blew past the $100 million book of business mark in Q2. Success with large multi-solution deals in transformational accounts and improving close rates across geographies, customer segments and product pillars. Building the future workforce by offering college instructors and students' globally free access and curriculum for Adobe Analytics, the industry-leading customer data analytics platform.  Continued industry analyst recognition across all customer experience management segments, including being named a leader in the Forrester Wave for Enterprise Marketing Software Suites, achieving the top spot each of the five times the report has been published and leadership in the Gartner Multichannel Marketing Hubs Magic Quadrant for the fourth year in a row. And key customer wins with brands like Nike, NatWest, NTT Docomo and T-Mobile. We are proud of the tremendous results and momentum across our business. As we plan for a post-pandemic world, we will remain flexible as different regions recover at different times. While offices in Australia and parts of Asia have been open for some time, and conditions in the U.S. and parts of Europe are improving, we will continue to support our employees in places like India and Brazil where the situation remains challenging. Over the last year, we have been building a blueprint for the future of work at Adobe, which will be hybrid and flexible. In the U.S., we will be piloting a return to our San Jose office, starting with a small group of fully vaccinated employees in July. We are committed to leveraging the best of in-person and digital interactions to harness what makes Adobe special, our creativity, innovation and culture, driven by our most important asset, people. I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and resilience during a year that was not only marked by the pandemic, but by violence and racial injustice. I am proud of the progress we have made in advancing our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion. We have made strides in our strategy to accelerate the representation, growth and advancement of the Black community. But as Juneteenth approaches later this week, we know we have so much left to do. As we celebrate Pride Month in June, we are honoring and spotlighting our LGBTQ+ communities both inside and outside of Adobe. These efforts represent Adobe\u2019s longstanding commitment to supporting our diverse employee base and making an impact in the communities where we live and work, a principle our co-founders, John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, instilled in us. In Q2, we lost our beloved co-founder Chuck Geschke. Chuck left an indelible mark on Adobe, the technology industry and the world. While we miss him tremendously, it gives me great comfort knowing that Chuck was so proud of the company that Adobe has become. Adobe\u2019s strong culture, revered brand, innovative product roadmap and the world\u2019s best employees, customers and partners position us for continued success in 2021 and beyond. John? John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. Q2 was an excellent quarter for Adobe, with strong revenue growth, enterprise bookings in Digital Experience and net new ARR in Digital Media, showing how our solutions are resonating with customers of all types in an increasingly digital world. With our data-driven operating model or DDOM, we continue to utilize our own Experience Cloud technology to optimize customer journeys, driving increasing amounts of traffic to Adobe.com to acquire new customers and raise awareness of our products. We continue to invest for growth in sales and marketing, while also increasing headcount in Q2 to drive product innovation. As a result, in Q2 Adobe achieved revenue of $3.84 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. Business and financial highlights included : GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.32 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.03; Digital Media revenue of $2.79 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $518 million; Digital Experience revenue of $938 million; record cash flows from operations of $1.99 billion; RPO of $12.23 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 2.1 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 25% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2, and we exited the quarter with $11.21 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.32 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth, and we added $405 million of net new Creative ARR. Second quarter Creative growth drivers included : strong retention and renewal across all Creative products and customer segments; new user acquisition, driven by global marketing campaigns utilizing our DDOM insights; accelerated recovery in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud for Teams offering; success in enterprise licensing, driven by account expansion at renewal; momentum with our Adobe Stock business, which continues to outpace industry peers in terms of revenue growth; driving subscriptions in the education segment, both with individuals and institutions; and generating net new ARR through app store sales of our mobile and iPad applications. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $469 million, which represents 30% year-over-year growth, and we added $113 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Second quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included : increasing unit demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all geos; strong subscription licensing of our Teams offering in the SMB segment; success in enterprise licensing, with broad seat expansion across enterprise accounts. Accelerated adoption of our Acrobat Web offering, driving top-of-funnel awareness and conversion to paid subscriptions; continued strength with Adobe Sign, which grew ARR greater than 40% year-over-year exiting the quarter; and driving improved conversion on Adobe.com. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q2 we achieved revenue of $938 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $817 million, representing 25% year-over-year growth. On the heels of Adobe Summit, we had success in Q2 generating pipeline and closing strategic customer deals across our portfolio of customer experience management or CXM solutions. Deal volume was sustained throughout the quarter, with several large transactions closing earlier in the quarter, contributing to our revenue performance in Q2. We continue to see broad macroeconomic recovery, including in the commercial segment, and enterprises of all sizes are investing in digital transformation. Business performance in Digital Experience during the quarter was driven by : strong bookings for Adobe Experience Platform or AEP, and native applications built on AEP, including Real-Time CDP and Customer Journey Analytics, which continue to build momentum; recent innovations and partnerships driving awareness and adoption of our Analytics, Commerce and Campaign solutions; continued success with our Workfront offering, as we realize the value of combining a best-in-class workflow solution with our CXM offerings to create an industry-leading marketing system of record; momentum signing up transformational, multi-solution engagements with enterprise customers across geographies; and strengthening customer renewal and expansion rates. Savings from T&E and site operations are continuing as our employees work from home. We are investing in our facilities as we reimagine the future of work, and many of our employees return to offices and business travel during Q3. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $10 million, both before and after applying the net impacts from hedging. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $94 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the year-over-year currency increase to revenue was $78 million. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q2 was 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our trade DSO was 35-days, which compares to 40-days in the year-ago quarter, and 38-days last quarter. RPO grew by 23% year-over-year to $12.23 billion exiting Q2, benefitting from strong enterprise licensing during the quarter. Deferred Revenue exiting the quarter was $4.28 billion, growing 24% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $5.77 billion. Cash flows from operations in Q2 were a record $1.99 billion. We repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $983 million. We currently have $15.1 billion in remaining authority, of which $100 million was granted in May 2018, and $15 billion was granted in December 2020. The following Q3 targets factor current macroeconomic conditions and expected return of summer seasonality associated with the months of June, July and August. Total Adobe revenue of approximately $3.88 billion; digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 22% year-over-year; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $440 million; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 21% year-over-year; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 25% year-over-year; tax rate of approximately 19% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 480 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.27; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3. We are pleased with our first-half performance, and we expect the momentum to continue, with typical Q4 strength. With the momentum we are seeing across creativity, digital documents and customer experience management, we are on track for another record year with a strong first half already in the books. Few companies of our scale can boast 20% plus revenue growth, world-class operating margins and a recurring-revenue model built for long-term growth and profitability. I will now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First we'll go to Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys for taking the question and really nice quarter. I think it's pretty remarkable in a quarter where a lot of investors were worried about a difficult comp, net new ARR growth actually accelerated in the quarter. And I was hoping you could dig into that a little bit. It's obvious you guys are building momentum, there's a broader base of customers that are coming into the Digital Media fold. Can you talk a little bit about who that is and kind of where you're seeing the most success in sort of broadening that scope and enabling that building momentum within this business, which is already quite large and well growing? Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Keith. As you said, it was a really great quarter. And we actually saw great linearity associated with the Digital Media ARR throughout the quarter as well. And as you know, we have this incredible data-driven operating model that allows us to deal with all aspects of the customer funnel from discover, which is done through our marketing attribution all the way through usage and engagement. In terms of the new customers who are coming onto the platform, mobile and communicators is a way we define that Keith are a significant portion of the new customer base. Specialists on the other hand as it relates to 3D&I. Acrobat, as we also mentioned, had a very strong offering. And so I would say the photography and video offerings are really targeting everybody from creative professionals, to communicators, to consumers as is Acrobat. But then we're also seeing some really good adoption of Acrobat across the spectrum. And in our prepared remarks, the last thing I'd say is we also talked about the revival of the Teams business. And as we all know, the small and medium business segment I think was most impacted last year. So, really pleased with it, Keith. So across product offerings, across geographies and across some of the new businesses and services as you said, we saw good strength in Q2. Keith Weiss : Got it. And if I can sneak one in for John on the guide into Q3, the net new ARR guide is about down 15% sequentially. I think there's more than we see seasonally. Is there anything we should be aware of in terms of either kind of one-time items, if you will in Q2, or something we should be looking out for in Q3 that explains that broader than or sort of bigger than normal seasonality, or seasonal decline into Q3? John Murphy : Yeah. Thanks, Keith. When I look at the guide for Q3, it's the largest guide we've done for ARR into Q3. As we talked about last couple of quarters, last year was kind of a really strange year, right, we didn't see the seasonality we typically saw because of the pandemic and everybody being locked down. As things are starting to open up, we're anticipating kind of a return to some of that seasonality that we saw in the past. And so we've factored that into the guide. But we're really excited that we can actually target the highest ARR guide ever in Q3. So overall, great performance and we can see the momentum is still in the business. Keith Weiss : Outstanding, great job, guys. John Murphy : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. So I'll take the other side of the business. On the Digital Experience side. I mean, again, every indicator, whether it was RPO, whether it was the Digital Experience revenue and subscription revenue was strong. Can you talk to what you saw on the quarter, what's changed since the pandemic, and maybe some of the pipelines? And how we should think about that business from here from a growth perspective? Shantanu Narayen : As you point out, Alex, it was a strong quarter. And right through the pandemic, we've been talking about how the interest in our Digital Experience solutions and the belief, when I have conversations with CEOs across every single vertical is that the only way to engage with customers is going to be digital. And I think people are starting to recognize that that investment is an investment that they have to pay. So first, I think from a macro perspective, it's clear that digital transformation and within digital transformation, customer experience management is front and center as something that they want to spend money on. The second thing I would say is, the execution against our new experience platform. And both John and I touched on Customer Journey Analytics and the other services that we're building on top of that, those are clearly resonating with customers, because whether you're B2B or whether you're a B2C, you have to have the ability right now to deliver the personalized experience. So I think the second thing I would say is that the innovation that we're delivering, and the fact that we had summit, and the ability to engage with these customers, certainly I think was an accelerant for the business. The third thing I would say is the ecosystem and the ability of the ecosystem to very quickly ensure that these customers derive value from the investment that we're making. I think that helps both in terms of converting bookings to revenue, but it also helps in terms of growing the book of business with enterprises. So, I would speak to all three of them. I think if you look at our targets as well, in terms of over 20% revenue growth, close to 25% subscription revenue growth that we're seeing in that business, I think we continue to be optimistic that we have the right product that clearly meets a customer need. And, the execution in the company against that business has been strong. Alex Zukin : And maybe just squeezing quick one in for John. On cash flow, well ahead of our estimates here for the second quarter, what's the right way? What's driving that? Is that just as simple as strong collections on larger deals? And thinking through the year, obviously, we're not guiding or updating guidance, but just anything to think through the net new ways to look at the free cash flow margin of the business and the growth of free cash flows? John Murphy : Yeah, sure. Yeah, we certainly were pleased to deliver numbers like that. We had some timing of payments, for sure. And as you saw, our DSO really dropped pretty significantly quarter-to-quarter. So all that really contributed to it, as well as the timing of some large payments [Indiscernible], as well as timing of when we have some dispersions as well. So it's really -- overall just great performance for the company. And sometimes you'll see a little bit of a shift quarter-to-quarter, but we're certainly given the capability of the company and the operating leverage in the model where we are generating a lot of cash right now. Alex Zukin : Got it. Thank you guys. John Murphy : You bet. Operator : And next we'll go to Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open. Saket Kalia : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question here. Shantanu, maybe for you to go back to the Creative business. Can you just anecdotally talk about any difference in product mix, specifically? I guess, as more potential users got back to work, including Creative professionals, did you see any change in the mix of single apps versus all app subscriptions perhaps? Shantanu Narayen : Saket, I think we saw strength across all of the businesses. I would say that the single app business, as you know, is a really great initial funnel for us to drive the business. And so we continue to see new adoption as it relates to the single app. And then, from a revenue perspective, think of it as, the single apps is probably half the business in the quarter. And then, we use that as a funnel to drive to the all apps. So I wouldn't say there was really a dramatic difference between Q1 and Q2, I think we just continue to see the trend of attracting new customers. And then from a revenue point of view, certainly, we believe that the Creative Cloud all apps is where we both derive value for our customers and drive more ARR for us long-term. Saket Kalia : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the Digital Experience side of the business. I think if you, depending on your assumption for Workfront and you kind of normalized for the extra week in the quarter last quarter, it showed a nice kind of reacceleration in that business. Could you just help us understand how you're expecting that pace of reacceleration to play out throughout the rest of the year? And then, kind of where your longer-term aspirational targets on where you'd like to see that growth rate of the business? Shantanu Narayen : Well, Tyler, the way I would first start off by answering that question is by talking about the TAM, where I think we keep talking about how big TAM that is, for the entire business. And so, when you have the kind of $80 billion plus dollar TAM that we have, we just continue to be really optimistic about that business. And, from my perspective, we have the largest delever that we had. And if you look at the DX business, it's about focus on transformational accounts across all deal bands, as well as different segmentation of the market. We tend to think of the corporate market, commercial market and the strategic markets, we're seeing strength across those particular businesses. And as I mentioned earlier to a previous question, the ability to convert bookings into revenue and to upsell them to more, but what we've done with the experience platform and the ability to have all of the new services built on that, it's really very unique in the industry, because that's sort of how we look at it. And so, you should expect to see, again, Q4 be sort of the strongest close that typically happens in enterprise software. And, we're clearly on track to exceed the target for DX for the entire year, when you look at our performance in the first-half and our guide for Q3, and John's comment about expecting Q4 to be seasonally strong. Tyler Radke : Great. And if I could just sneak in another question, I wanted to ask you just broadly, I know, you haven't raised price in a while, and you're obviously pretty sensitive of that during the pandemic. But just as you think of things reopening and obviously some concerns around there, around an inflationary environment, just curious how your conversations regarding prices evolved over the last three months? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : From our perspective, what is most exciting about the Creative Cloud and the Document Cloud business, assuming Tyler that your question is about those two parts of the business is, it's really new customer acquisition, that's really been the driver of that entire business. And we're doing that across different offerings. We're doing that across different geographies. I think the value that we provide to customers, it doesn't matter whether it's an inflationary economy or not, we continue to believe that we're deriving tremendous value for our customers. And so the conversations that happen around Adobe are around the product roadmap and innovation and attracting new customers way more than trying to, at this point, look at a price optimization, and so we have a massive TAM ahead of us. That's really the focus. Tyler Radke : Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Hi, Shantanu, on the digital experience business, many of your SI partners have been commenting that there are capacity constrained that their utilization rates are, in their words through the roof. I'm curious if you're running into constraints on the implementation side, what you're seeing to offset that? Is that more of a random data point? Are you seeing that across the board from some of the SI partners? Shantanu Narayen : I would say, Brent that clearly the demand for our solutions and expertise, whether it's on content and commerce, whether it's around data and insights, whether it's around the new workflow stuff that we've done, what's exciting for us is that there's a lot of demand on the ecosystem to have us help them with training. I think you'll periodically see some of them feel like they're capacity constrained and that's a little bit more as a result of the war for talent. But overall, I think, we will continue to help support them in any way. And I think net-net it\u2019s a good sign for the business. On the product side, we are going to really make sure that we continue to make it easier to provision, easier to use, easier to get value. And we've been seeing some good customer sentiment associated with our work on that front. So hopefully, that's an isolated incident as it relates to that SI partners ability to get it. But it's certainly true as it relates to the overall market and the ability and the interest in our solution. So I think that part is certainly true. Brent Thill : Quick follow-up for John, just on the second-half margins. As things reopen, how are you thinking about this? I mean, you are this quarter about a point away from your all time quarterly high and out margin. Do things have to come back in a little bit over time, given the reinvest in the opening world or not? John Murphy : Yeah. Thanks, Brent. Yeah, we definitely think it will come down slightly in Q3 and Q4, as we open up. I mean, we're continuing to invest, as we talked about, we're hiring in R&D. We're definitely investing in sales and variable marketing to really drive the business and execute against the huge TAMs that we have across all three businesses. So with the momentum that we have in the business world, we will make sure that we capitalize on that momentum and invest to be able to capture it. But certainly, as things are opening up, we'll see those expenses come back online, as we more people, it'll get phased in reentry approach for us through Q3 and Q4. But certainly, business travel will start to pick up as well. Shantanu Narayen : And Brent, maybe I'll just add, when we look at some of the key new categories that we're continuing to invest in, and you're seeing the results associated with it, I mean, to your question about the Real-Time CDP and the associated services, Sign, Stock, Mobile and our mobile offerings, we remarked also about 3D&I and specialist offerings associated with that. And so, it really behooves us to continue to as we always have judiciously, invest in marketing to continue to attract new customers to the platform, which will again, as John said, be seen on the sales and marketing expense. But net-net, I mean, we're really excited about the growth that we're seeing. John Murphy : Yeah, and just to think about Shantanu I mean year-over-year you are going to see margin expansion went even above what our original targets were. Thanks. Operator : And next we'll go to Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. Congratulations to the Adobe team and spectacular results. Shantanu, I want to just go back to Creative TAM, just the topic that continues to fascinate me. I mean, seven, eight years into the transition, the Creative business is as big as it can be $10 billion, nearly 100 and growing 22% to 24%. As you unfold the layers of the Creative market, what is it that you finding that might have surprised you? And could we see that TAM for Creative as the business unfolds even larger than your original expectations? And also as a subtext to that you think address video and how video is shaping up? Now I remember once you said that video could be as largest photo oriented business, any thoughts there would be great. And also if you have any thoughts on what might be David's involvement with the Creative business? And should we expect to see any refinements enhancements modifications of the strategy on the Digital Media front with David coming back on board? Thank you so much. Congrats. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Kash. And I love the way all of you so far have been when we say one question, putting in a three part question. But Kash, I think\u2026 Kash Rangan : You can take any one. Shantanu Narayen : It's okay. I mean, they're all good questions. And so I think first Kash on the $40 billion plus TAM as you know, we have clearly transitioned the business from Creative Cloud focused customer, to just being a Creative Cloud, the communicators, the services that we've added associated with Stock photography and Sign. And, I think we continue to have very exciting opportunities in terms of continuing to expand that TAM. And I think it all stems from design and creativity has never been more important, right. We talked about how it's the golden age of design and creativity. But for you, as a consumer, whether you're interacting with a screen at a terminal or in a retail store, or how you order something, I mean, it's all about content creation. And when you think about how much content we've all consumed in the pandemic at home, it's just gone through the roof.  And we announced the partnership with Netflix, and what we're doing with Khan Academy to make sure content creation is as seamless and productive. So I think that's driving it. And people love to say we want to be in the content and design business to personalize it, as well as a career. So I would say that's the first thing that we're certainly seeing. International expansion, we've talked about how we continue to focus on international markets. And, it originally started with dealing with piracy, but across the small and medium business TAM, as those companies are also creating a marketplace for themselves with our content management solutions, our commerce solutions, content velocity is critical there. So I think all those are clearly tailwinds for the ever increasing TAM. I think we increased it from $31 billion to $41 billion when we talked about it at the Next FA meeting. And we'll certainly update that when we have our Next. I think, as it relates to David, I'm really excited. As I said, David played a significant role in the introduction of Creative Cloud when he was here. And I think the fact that we were able to excite them and recruit them back, just I think speaks to the tremendous opportunity that he also sees for the business. And from my point of view, we have all of these unicorns within the Creative Cloud. And I'm looking to partner with David, whether it's expanding on our enterprise footprint, whether it's continuing to make sure that we get the opportunity around Sign addressed, what we are doing associated with the mobile offerings. I mean, each one of these is a large business by itself and having somebody of his caliber to continue to work with, Scott on the product side and Abhay on the Document Cloud side, it's great to have that kind of bench when we have the kind of opportunity that we have. So hopefully, that answers the question around David as well, Kash. Kash Rangan : Brilliant. Thank you so much. Operator : Next we'll go to Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Shantanu, I thought your comments about Chuck were spot on. I'm sure he'd be very proud to see the performance of the company and directionally where it's headed. I'm kind of curious on the Digital Experience side, in terms of the product roadmap and changes and improvements that you made last year, how those have been resonating with customers currently? And are there any key new innovation milestones that we should be looking for, that could further improve the growth in that business over the coming couple of quarters? Shantanu Narayen : Thanks for your comments on Chuck, Sterling. A number of you I know have written to me, which I appreciate the impact that each one of you also felt when you interacted with Chuck. So, I really have appreciated all of those comments. As it relates to the customer experience management questions, Sterling, I think we're in the really early innings. We have some tremendous ideas ahead of us and with Anil Chakravarthy, I'll touch on a couple. I mean, the Real-Time Customer Data Platform is just really the infrastructure for every engagement that a customer has. We touched on the Journey Optimizer, which is think about optimizing the customer journey across outbound and inbound customer touchpoints, both in physical and electronic. I mean that\u2019s just a massive opportunity in terms of communicating, whether it's by email, whether it's SMS, whether it's any of these new platforms that emerge. The Customer Journey Analytics, my perspective on Customer Journey Analytics is, we used to do the fantastic job on web analytics, but this is increasingly becoming what is the analytics across all of the different online and offline data. And it's the way you run a business. And we're living proof of, when we talk about our DDOM, how we can use that, so I think the Customer Journey Analytics is also in terms of the ideas that we have on its infancy. And maybe the last one I'll touch on, is what we've been previewing in terms of this marketing system of record and workflow. Trillions are being spent in marketing and the process associated with rolling out those campaigns, understanding the efficacy of those campaigns, making those campaigns international. I think that all of that is really, really, ahead of us in terms of what we can do. So we're very excited. And for all of these companies, as they have to transition with what's happening in browsers, and dealing with a first-party data world or dealing with privacy concerns, all of that, frankly, is opportunities for us because we step up and enable them to engage with their customers and focus on their product offering rather than all this other stuff, because we know how to do that well. Sterling Auty : That makes sense. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : One last thing, maybe on that is the B2B. I think we've always -- most people talk about this and think about the B2C business, Sterling, which is, yeah, they understand travel and hospitality, they understand retail, they understand banking, but this is now happening, where it doesn't matter what business you're in. The ability to drive from leads to revenue for a B2B business is also digital. I mean, if you're a company in the pharma industry, and you're not able to go visit doctors, and talk to them about the innovation that you're doing, it\u2019s going to move digital. So I think there's just so much on that particular front. Sterling Auty : Thank you. Operator : And next, we have Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Brad Sills : Oh, great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. And congratulations on a nice quarter here. I just wanted to ask a question on reopening. As you look towards, as we look towards reopening in U.S. and North America and Europe, what impact do you think that's going to have on the Digital Media businesses? It's an accelerant, do you think? Or, and also a Digital Experience what are your thoughts on that? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I think they're really tied to the macro-economic environments. And I think you're seeing that the return to work, the macro-economic environment is coming back stronger than it's been across all of the customer segments. And for us, we don't view ourselves as in terms of the solutions we're providing these digital are not a stay at home or work kind of solution. They're just mission-critical, irrespective of which you have. And so, what I think we'll see is that, as people come back to work, the small and medium businesses will recognize that it's an opportunity for them to engage. So I think you'll see more investment there. I think you'll see certainly, as Europe and other parts of those economy open up that'll help. I think Japan, the level of vaccination is low, so I think as they come back to work, that's only going to lead to more optimism. And so I think when you think about consumer confidence, and you think about businesses want to invest, I think both of those are only going to be helped by a return to normalcy and a return to work. That's sort of my perspective. Brad Sills : Thank you so much, Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : And next we have Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening, Shantanu, you mentioned summit, and it was clear from the conference that there were multiple internal initiatives you're working on that would seem very likely to have important implications for you over the next number of years. And since you didn't refer to them directly, perhaps you could comment on some of those, including, for example, what was referred to as your quote future creative stack, additionally, project Firefly and your API strategy, some very interesting references to your Adobe commerce merchant services, including payments and some other things you're working on?  And then lastly, the build out of ATM is a cloud service globally targeted for this year. So those are some pretty interesting things from the conference of perhaps you could talk about? And then for the follow-up, in answer to an earlier question you referred to \u2018war for talent.\u2019 And in your case, you've had a V-shaped recovery in terms of your own job openings. You added an unusually large number of people in a non-acquisition quarter. Maybe for John, you could talk about whether you think you could or should continue to increase your headcount at the same pace as in Q2. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks for the question, Jay. As you know, I can wax eloquent about product stuff for a long time, but let me touch on at least the two ones that you did. I think as it related to the cloud-based content management, the intent is very straightforward, which is how do you transition anybody who wishes to self-provision a cloud-based content offering. And think about, if you're a small and medium business, or if you're a large company trying to do a product campaign, you need to get a website, you need to get it localized, you need to get it up and running, you need to be able to do commerce. And so the fact that we've got this easy to provision cloud-based content management, which is the leader in the category, but in addition to that, as you mentioned, the APIs now so people can actually embed this APIs that we have for our content management solution directly. So we're very excited about that. We mentioned last quarter that it saw significant adoption. And so I think that will continue to be a driver for the business. I think, as it relates to your other question around what we are doing on the content stack, we've always mentioned that, for us content and data are the two areas where we differentiate ourselves. The asset management problem is still a problem where we have a significant amount of innovation that we're continuing to deliver. And so, we're really excited. I mean, net-net, I think Anil and the product team on the DX side, have outlined a number of initiatives. Other companies talk about a lot of the stuff, but they don't have their products integrated. They don't have the ability to seamlessly provision and so I think that's where we are going to continue to focus. And maybe an underappreciated area Jay is how easy, these are now to set up and provision and for practitioners of this business, to be really able to do it. I think your second question is a very interesting one, which is you're absolutely right, the merchant services ecosystem that Magento has, we've actually done a really good job of building that out. I mean, certainly, companies like PayPal that we've talked about, we've talked about what we can do with FedEx. More recently, there are a number of other such initiatives that are underway, some of which we're not at liberty to talk about, right yet. But I think, dealing with payments, dealing with shipping, dealing with working capital, a lot of interesting ideas where we're very well-positioned to both deliver value as well as to monetize it. John Murphy : And Jay, on the headcount commentary, just to I mean we certainly have a number of positions open, that we're actively recruiting against. But we're committed to investing to be able to capture the larger opportunity. So we're going to continue to hire in for innovation and we're going to continue to invest in sales headcount as well as leverage our ability with variable marketing to really drive performance. So, I don't think this is the time to pull back given the momentum in the business. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thanks, Shantanu. Thanks, John. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Jay. Operator : And next we'll go to Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Keith Bachman : Hi, many thanks. First, I wanted to ask a clarification and then Shantanu a question. John, can you give us the contribution of Workfront this quarter? And then secondly for Shantanu, I wanted to go back to the Experience Cloud. And feedback that we've recently gotten is very positive on the Real-Time CDP and the Customer Journey Analytics, as you mentioned. I'm trying to go back to what's the potential growth rate here. So A, was Experience Cloud you think impacted more during COVID than other parts of the business? Because I'm trying to understand whether there might be a harder snap back. And then B, when you think about the growth potential here, Gartner comes out with some numbers that areas in the Experience Cloud have grown 15%. Your own TAM analysis that you put out suggested the market in \u201823 growth is more like 25%? How do you think about the business between those two potential growth rates? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah, the way I would answer the question, first, on the Workfront stuff, I mean, it becomes -- we, I think, do a great job of talking to you about how it's going on the integration. And it's going really well. We don't break it out after a while, because it's part of so many of these large transformational deals, as well as integrated into other solutions. But Workfront is going really well, it's the basis for a lot of the workflow that we're doing across each of our solutions. And we're on track to beat the targets that we gave for Workfront. So I do want to say that that went well. I think as it relates to the overall TAM, which was your second question, we look at it as it's $80 billion plus, so there's plenty of available and I think a lot of legacy software is going to get rolled out. And so for us, it's not just about what the growth rate is in that market, people are going to recognize that having modern architecture for dealing with consumer engagement is going to become a bigger and bigger imperative. And, frankly, the smart companies are opening up their budgets to start to invest in it sooner rather than later, as we said on B2B and B2C. So, we're really pleased with the 20% plus growth that we're seeing, 25 points of subscription revenue growth, we think is really good. We want to continue to focus on subscription revenue as the true measure of that business. And I think as we continue to deliver on the innovation and product roadmap, I think, we would hope to continue to see those growth rates, even as the business grows much larger. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thank you, Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Jonathan Vaas : Operator, we're coming up on the top of the hour. We'll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open. Gregg Moskowitz : Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Shantanu, the Document Cloud enterprise bookings growth up more than 60% year-over-year, obviously really impressive. What would you primarily attribute that to? And then just for John quickly following another upside quarter with an accelerated recovery in SMB, would you say that you have returned to pre-pandemic levels? Shantanu Narayen : I think as it relates to your first question around Document Cloud, I mean, again, there isn't a business that is not saying, hey, how do we help automate inefficient paper-based processes. And so the value proposition of the PDF file format, the value proposition of Acrobat, as an essential productivity tool for knowledge workers, the availability of Sign, what we're doing with forms and embedded payments, I think it's the combination of all of that, whether you're, again, somebody trying to deliver vaccines for employees, or somebody trying to create a new travel authorization or expense. I mean, documents are the fundamental currency of modern business and automating that only has value. And I think our team has done a good job. We don't go to market saying, here's a Document Cloud solution, or here's an Experience Cloud solution. We go and saying, here's the use case for if you're in travel and hospitality or retail, or financial services, or pharma. And I would say, government and healthcare have also become larger customers of these kinds of solutions, because of the necessity for regulated industries, who previously may have relied on paper to say, you know what we need to get into the modern era and deal with electronic documents. So I would say, those are all the reasons and good execution, clearly on the part of our team, as we're selling increasingly at a much higher level in all of these companies. I'll let John speak and then I'll come for the close, given this is the last question. John Murphy : Great. Thanks, Shantanu. Thanks, Gregg. Yeah, we've been kind of talking about the last couple quarters, the gradual recovery of the SMB segment, which was hit so severely when the pandemic hit last year. And we saw that continue here in Q2, and really kind of reach that pre-pandemic level of conversion, retention, at least for sure in the U.S., and there's just tons of opportunity now as the rest of the world begins to open up as well for that to continue to improve. Gregg Moskowitz : Very helpful. Thank you. John Murphy : You bet. Shantanu Narayen : And thank you all for joining us. I think from my perspective, I'm really pleased with our performance in Q2. It was an outstanding quarter. And to the question that was asked earlier, with many parts of the world returning to some sense of normalcy, that should only be good for our business, because digital is this incredible tailwind where it's just a one way street in terms of people wanting to invest. We do expect, therefore, a slight seasonality associated with our business. But we definitely have an expectation of a strong finish. And if you look at our first-half performance, if you look at our targets for Q3, and the belief in the seasonally strong Q4 finish, that's going to be another outstanding year where we are going to exceed a lot of the targets that we talked about, if not all, at the beginning of the year. We're driving bookings, we're driving revenue performance from bookings as a result of making sure people get value for it. We're driving a lot of new businesses that have become material in the company, and so the breadth of our portfolio is impressive, because digital is not just a nice to have, it's become super critical. And as I've always said, having three areas of explosive growth puts us in really rarefied atmosphere. And growing 20% plus on the top-line growing the bottom line, as impressively as we have with strong cash flow, I think really demonstrates how we're driving value for our customers and value for our shareholders. So, thank you for joining us today and have a great summer. With that, I'll pass it back to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, Shantanu, and thank you everyone for joining. This now concludes the call. Operator : And that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Adobe had another outstanding quarter as people across the globe continue to embrace new ways of storytelling, learning, and customer engagement in our digital-first environment. This quarter we delivered significant new product innovations, announced the exciting acquisition of frame.IO and continued to increase customer engagement across an ever-expanding customer base. We're executing on our strategy of unleashing creativity for all accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses as reflected in our strong performance. In Q3, Adobe achieved 3.94 billion in revenue, representing 22% year-over-year growth.  GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $2.52 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.11. In Q3, we drove record performance in our Digital Media business, achieving 2.87 billion in revenue, representing 23% year-over-year growth. Net new digital media, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was 455 million and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to 11.67 billion.  Creativity has always played a central role in the human experience. Over the last year, we have all witnessed the way creativity has sustained us. We've shared photographs with loved ones on different continents. Taught art classes to students at their kitchen tables, and launched entirely new businesses online.  Building on decades of leadership, Adobe continues to pave the way in core creative categories, including photography and design. while pushing the boundaries across a wide range of emerging categories, such as AR and 3D. Whether it's the latest binge-worthy streaming plus series, a social media video that sparks a movement, or a corporate video, creation and consumption of video is experiencing explosive growth. In August, we announced an agreement to acquire frame.io, a leading cloud-based video collaboration platform. Video editing is rarely a solo activity, and it's traditionally been highly inefficient. Frame.io streamlines the video production process by enabling editors and key projects stakeholders to seamlessly collaborate using cloud-first workflows.  The combination of our leading video editing offerings, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and after-effects with frame.io\u2019s cloud-based review and approval functionality will radically accelerate the creative process and deliver an end-to-end video platform. The addition of frame.io creates an opportunity for Adobe in conjunction with the partner ecosystem to expand beyond video editors to a broader set of customers, teams, and enterprises. We hope to close the frame.io transaction in Q4 and look forward to welcoming the team to Adobe. Next month, we will host Adobe MAX, the world's largest creativity conference. Max has always been the place to be inspired, connect with the creative community and experience the latest Creative Cloud innovations.  Our programming will feature iconic speakers, including Oscar-winning winning writer, director, producer Chloe Zhao, actress Tilda Swinton, and SNL star and executive producer Kenan Thompson. This year's fully digital experience allows us to expand our reach and engage with more people across our global creative community than ever before. Max will be hosted on Adobe\u2019s custom digital event platform built on Adobe Experience Cloud.

I'm confident that Adobe's culture of innovation, category-defining products, strong brand, and the unwavering dedication of our employees will drive our continued business success and a strong close to the fiscal year. John. John Murphy : Thanks, Shantanu. Our financial results, future strong growth across revenue, Digital Media, ARR, digital experience, subscription revenue, RPO, and EPS, demonstrating the power of our category-defining offerings. And a digital-first world, Adobe's market opportunity is larger than ever, and we are investing for sustained growth through product innovation and by driving awareness and demand for our products with customers of all sizes. With our data-driven operating model or DDOM, we continue to leverage our Experience Cloud technology to create personalized experiences for our customers in real-time. Driving traffic to Adobe.com and app stores to acquire new customers. As a result, in Q3, Adobe achieved a record revenue of 3.94 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. Business and financial highlights included GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.52 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.11. Digital media revenue of $2.87 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of 455 million digital experience revenue of 985 million, cash flows from operations of 1.42 billion, RPO of 12.63 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 1.7 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 23% year-over-year growth in Q3 and we exited the quarter with 11.67 billion of Digital Media ARR. As anticipated, with regions beginning to reopen across the globe.  We saw pronounced summer seasonality in Q3. This is consistent with the experience of businesses across industries, as evidenced by data from the Adobe digital index, which showed that June and July marked the highest consumer travel season in two years. This correlated with lower web traffic while individuals enjoyed their summer holidays. We do see continued recovery in the SMB segment associated with the reopening. We achieved Creative revenue of 2.37 billion, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. And we added 348 million of net new Creative ARR. Our strong Q3 results demonstrate continued demand for our offerings and execution driven by our D - Dominant (ph)t sights.  Third Quarter creative growth drivers included strong engagement, retention, and renewal across all creative products and customer segments. New user acquisition for Creative Cloud All Apps that driven by global marketing campaigns. Continued recovery in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud for Teams offering, including through our reseller channel. Driving subscriptions for our flagship products, including our photography and video applications on both desktop and mobile. And the adoption of our 3D and immersive applications, including Adobe substance. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of 493 million, which represents 31% year-over-year. growth.  And we added $107 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Digital documents are essential to the changing nature of work, and we saw the paper to digital transformation continue in Q3 as Document Cloud remained our fastest-growing business. Third-quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included adoption driven by the increase in the need to collaborate and a hybrid work environment. Increasing unit demand for Acrobat subscriptions globally strengthened new licensing and renewal for our Acrobat for teams offering in the SMB segment and continued adoption of our Acrobat web and the Acrobat mobile offerings.  Turning to our Digital Experience segment in Q3, we achieved revenue of $985 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Digital experience subscription revenue was 864 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. We continue to see subscription revenue acceleration in digital experience as large and mid-sized enterprises increased their investments in customer experience management. Business performance and digital experience during the quarter were driven by strong deal volume, including several large Adobe Experience platform deals.  Momentum in Adobe commerce with strong revenue growth and new customer acquisition. Merchant services growth through new strategic partnerships, increasing adoption of our Workfront and Customer Journey Management offerings. Strong customer retention as we focus relentlessly, a value realization for our customers and demand for Adobe's professional services. Operating expenses increased in Q3 as we continue to make strategic investments and increased headcount. We began to reopen our facilities and return to moderate levels of business travel.  The majority of our employees continue to work from home, while the return to business travel is expected to ramp slowly. And we expect to further ramp our hiring in Q4. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, the impact of FX net of accounting for hedging activities caused a sequential currency increase to revenue of $10 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, the impact of FX net of accounting for hedging activities caused the currency increase to revenue of $80 million. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q3 was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis.  The sequential reduction in our GAAP tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in U.S. tax accrued on foreign earnings and tax benefits associated with share-based payment. That's our trade DSO was 36 days, which compares to 37 days in the year-ago quarter and 35 days last quarter. RPO grew by 22% year-over-year to 12.63 billion exiting Q3 benefiting from strong enterprise licensing during the quarter. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was 6.16 billion cash flow from operations in Q3 were 1.42 billion sequentially down from Q2 due to increases in prepaid expenses, income tax payments, and a decrease in accrued expenses.  We repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $1 billion. We currently have $14.1 billion remaining of our $15 billion authority granted in December 2020, Q4 targets factor current macroeconomic conditions, and typical year-end seasonal strength, including an expected increase in back-to-school spending and year-end enterprise licensing strength. Total Adobe revenue of approximately $4.07 billion, digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20% year-over-year, net new digital media ARR, of approximately $550 million digital experienced segment revenue growth of approximately 22% year-over-year.  Digital experienced subscription revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year, a tax rate of approximately 17% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis. the share count of approximately 480 million shares, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.52, and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.18. Given Adobe's year-to-date performance and our Q4, we are clearly on track to exceed our updated annual targets for fiscal 2021 provided in March. With the massive opportunities across creativity, digital documents, and customer experience management, we continue to invest and drive strong business results. I will now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions].We'll take our first question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just -- can we double-click on the seasonality commentary in the quarter? Because if we look at the beat versus guidance on net new digital media ARR, it looks, at the same time you had the weakest beat, but then the strongest guide in the last three years, which kind of speaks to and confirm some of those seasonality comments that you made.  But can we just dive in to get a better sense of exactly what drove that for the Creative Cloud business? And then separately, what you're seeing in the enterprise adoption, particularly around AEP and on the CDP front, that's driving some of the really strong guidance there. Shantanu Narayen : Happy to do that, Alex. So first on your DME question, as it related to the ARR. Overall, we were pleased and I think it really speaks to the strength of our DDOM and the insights that we get associated with the business.  I think going into the quarter, we had expected that the consumer with a little bit more return to normalcy as what's happening in the environment. Now, this may have been a little prior to the Delta Variant that we expected travel to increase and therefore, as a result, as summer seasonality and summer holidays was really sort of a two-year time off from what they had to do.  So as expected, we saw a little bit of less web traffic on that particular front. The SMB was a highlight for us. SMB, which was impacted a little bit more we're continuing to see strengths associated with the SMB.  And to your point about the guide I mean, I think our optimism and the relevance of our products and what's happening with digital as a tailwind really leads us to guide as you pointed out to 550, which would be the largest ever guide that we've given for a Q4.  And if you take a step back relative to the approximately 1750 ARR guide that we had given at the beginning of the year, or the 1.8 billion that we've given in March we're going to exceed easily all of those numbers. So, as it relates to individual categories, imaging continues to do really well, video continues to do well, the Acrobat business, which is reflected both in the Creative Cloud, and the Document Cloud is doing well. MAX is going to be exciting.  So, net-net, I would say that the growth prospects for that particular business and the growth drivers remain intact. But again, very much in line. And this is what we feel good about the insights that we're getting on the business.  So that's to answer your question on DME. And again, remember, we have a seasonally strong quarter, in Q4 for DME, the enterprise deals tend to be a Q4. We also see education start to ramp up in Q4 so that hopefully gives you some color as to what happened in Q3. And what we expect in Q4. And on the DX side to your second question, really pleased with what we saw in the adoption of the Adobe Experience Platform and the applications on top of that, the Adobe Journey optimizer, the customer journey analytics, continued to see strength.  I think we're very unique and differentiated in the platform that we have the real-time nature of what we're doing with personalization. And again there, I think if last year there was a lot of interest in that particular digital transformation and customer experience management. I think people recognize that this needs to be an enterprise spend priority for all of the businesses irrespective of size, which is why both in terms of Q3 performance as well as the Q4 targets, we continue to think that digital experience will also do well. So hopefully that gives you color on both Alex. Alex Zukin : It does. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Shantanu. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Oh, yes. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more in a couple of the bigger experienced platform wins that you had. These existing customers, competitive, I guess, if you had to step back, what's helping you all win these larger deals? I was also impressed with 80% of your clients seem to be using some of the ai powered capabilities, which seems to be a really high uptake rate or take rates. So, we're just kind of curious if you expand on some of the larger enterprises - experience platform deals you had this quarter. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure Kirk and at the end of the day, I think the macro trend that everybody is finding is that a digital presence and commerce and data and insights and analytics is absolutely table stakes for anybody doing business. And so, I think everybody started with a website. Everybody started with the analytics.  But I think where we've delivered the Adobe Experience platform and what we're talking about our personalization, I think that's a key differentiator and whether you're a B2B company or a B2C company, you just have to invest in this particular business and I think the team has done a particularly good job both of messaging and different industries, the healthcare industry, for example, continues to do well and there's more interest associated with that. The consumer businesses are starting to see a little bit of a comeback as there's a little bit more normalcy and so a lot of them -- we're going after existing customers.  We're going after new logos and selling more, but I would say it's the strength of the Experience platform, the ability to have these profiles, the behavioral data they were collecting in real-time. The marketing message associated with telling them that they really need to focus on getting their first-party data to be an asset that they could put on their balance sheet. And the nature of what's happening with digital commerce. I think all of those are trends and then we win the deals, because of the strength of our offering and the fact that we're a really pure play marketing that is significantly differentiated relative to anybody else. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Gregg Moskowitz : Thank you very much for taking the question. Shantanu, I know that you only have three-quarters of that data thus far, but is Workfront driving larger, average deal sizes in DX? Is that something that's already showing through? Shantanu Narayen : Hi, it's a great question, Gregg. And then maybe as I had responded to Kirk as well, I should have talked about the big thing that we're hearing from our customers in that space, Gregg, is they have more and more campaigns. They want to do agility of the campaigns.  These are global and how do they not only have an integrated suite of products, but how do they get the workflow to be more efficient, especially as you're all working in a hybrid, or working from the home environment. So Workfront is definitely helping us, it's helping us with existing customers, it's helping us with deal sizes.  And in many ways, it's the glue both to enable, if you have people, technology, and processes, it's helping with the processes part. But the promise of what we've also said there in terms of this pioneering marketing system of record, that's another area for the interest. And I think this was always a great Company.  I think they were looking to become more general purpose. I think what Anil and the team have done, or really focusing on marketing workflows and solving it for all of the different personas. That's definitely resonating, but all of the large deals that we do Workfront\u2019s, definitely a part of the interest and a part of the bill of materials associated with that. Gregg Moskowitz : Very helpful. Thank you very much. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Gregg. Operator : We Will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys, for taking the question and very nice quarter and maybe digging in a little bit more on the M&A side of the equation, we've definitely heard really good things about Workfront are getting into a lot of deals upfront Perhaps, can you characterize the sort of the performance of Workfront versus your expectations and kind of contribution you're seeing in the quarter. Secondarily with Frame.io, Just for clarification, is that in the forward ARR guys, so is that included in the 550 for Q4? And then perhaps more broadly, just on M&A strategy.  The last two big deals seem to have a common thread in terms of collaboration. Is that just a self-idealist putting together two data points and drawing the trend line, or is that sort of a particular area of focus for Adobe in terms of adding to the portfolio on a go-forward basis? Thank you, guys. Shantanu Narayen : So, Keith, I actually think there were three questions in that, so let me parse each one of the first, I think as it relates to Workfront, we're very clearly targeting a need that exists and we had originally, I think said something like Workfront will do a 140. You're a 150 million in revenue for FY 21.  And then I think we've said that it's on track to significantly beat that and that continues to be the case. As we do these larger deals, Keith, we don't breakout Workfront. And so that's the way we think about the business. But Workfront is definitely appealing to that. Your second question as it relates to two Frame.io. Uh, no, it is not in the ARR (ph.) guide.  I mean clearly until we close the deal, we would not. And so, when that happens, as we said, we expect that to happen in Q4. We'll certainly update you on what happens as it relates to the frame. But we're excited about that and your third question as it relates to collaboration as a team, it's part of what we've been talking about for a while. If you remember what we've done with XD in terms of being able to do live editing.  I think what we've done with the multi-surface applications, where our applications run on mobile devices, or iPads, or tablets, as well as desktops, is just one of those teams that people are working from different locations. People are increasingly working with people, and so I think we have the ability to really provide value for our existing customers and attract new customers. I think with a frame, in particular, we're excited because it expands dramatically.  The potential of the number of people who will become participants in the video workflow. And if they become, I hope you like the videos that we placed at the beginning of the earnings call and it's -- all of that stuff is being done remotely. We're pleased. And as you know, we are always portfolio Keith about the acquisitions and making sure it's a case where we can bring significant value both to our shareholders and to our customers. Keith Weiss : That spend especially the color guys. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Turin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Turrin : Hey, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. On margins -- in the year-to-date, margins are now above 46%. I think you previously referenced the potential for more of a second-half step-down there, so just - how should we think about the margin profile here in our other benefits, you'd point to that could be normalized assuming more of a return to normal. Shantanu Narayen : John, do you want to start and then I can add? John Murphy : Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah. You're right. The margins at 46% this quarter we had indicated that with the more of a reopening across different regions, we would start to see our facilities come online, or business. travel, and come back and certainly continue our hiring ramps with the Delta Variant probably slowed that down a little bit. And so that contributed to the margin expansion you saw in Q3. But the overall was an outstanding quarter for older businesses. and what it says, the long road, the path to margin expansion is really to revenue growth given the leverage in our mode and after the contributions from the revenue performance with quarter continued expense and things, I just talked about that contributed overall to the performance.  But we expect those expenses to come back in a Phase reentering out maybe a little slower than we originally thought when we talked about the second half, but that being said, when I think about our original targets in December, its implied margin expansion. When we did our updated targets in Q1, it was an even larger margin expansion from what we saw. But we're executing against these huge March opportunities, and we'll continue to do that with an eye and I continued top-line growth, such as areas of [Indiscernible] you touched on, which is 3D and immersive Adobe Experience Platform, sign stock mobile, all of that. Shantanu Narayen : Well said, John, and maybe the only other thing I would add is that in I - certainly, I think when you look at some of the TENEO facilities expenses, it's a little lock efficient in terms of what's happening on expenses.  But our big position is when you have a 100 and plus billion-dollar addressable market, I think driving profitable growth is where we're focused on, which is why I think John also referred to we continue to be in the market to hire talent, to make sure that we can continue to address all the market opportunities that we have. And so, where folks, just don't drive profitable growth. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities, please go ahead. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu and John. Shantanu, for you, first as I'm sure you recall over the last number of years, particularly at a conference like MAX, we've talked about the integration, and many ways, the unique integration that you have between Digital Media and the DX business. and you'll recall it's gone by a certain acronym over time. The question is, can you quantify or in some way. Describe the business effect of that combination and even going back to the old days of how this neutrality does in fact, help you drive business through the integration across the two segments. Relatedly, with regard to. DX specifically, you'll recall that over the last number of years, the Company has often referred to you're having about four dozen or so use cases that you were targeting for DX, and that was a number of years ago. So perhaps you could talk about how the number of targeted use cases has increased for DX in the last number of years, particularly now with the introduction of payment services and other new capabilities. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Jay, first I think as it relates to your question around the integration between the clouds, as you know, first, let's even talk about Acrobat, right? Because so much of the Acrobat business is reflected both in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud and so that's one very tangible example of how. We've integrated the clouds.  I think taking a step back, the area that I would say is of most interest to customers right now is what we have referred to in the past also as content velocity, which is people are creating more digital assets.  They're spending more on content and how they both ensured that all of that content seamlessly is distributed, whether it's a marketing campaign, whether it's something that goes on a mobile application, whether it's something that goes on the website. And so, I think that's the hard problem that we've been able to help facilitate for our customers, which is creating all of this content and making sure that it's -- the delivery is accelerated through marketing campaigns is an area of real integration between DME, as well as Dx. And where that shows up also in the revenue is the continued growth of M and M assets, specifically because that's where the assets are really flowing between these two solutions.  So hopefully that gives you a little bit of the flavor. I think to the earlier questions that Gregg and Kurt had asked. I mean, it is also on the workflow, that's when people are looking at it and saying, wow, if my freelancers have created content, how's that now being reflected in the DX. So that's what I would answer your first question.  I think as it relates to the DX use cases, and we should certainly do an update, it's increased very dramatically. And the ones that I would say maybe as a highlight is the B2B use cases, the number of large B2B companies that are coming to us and saying, ''Hey, we recognize that whether it's for lead generation, whether it's for identification of customers, whether it's for even doing commerce, that's been a fairly big driver. '' I would say regulated industries, which if the original push around customer experience management was B2C, and consumer-base companies. Now I think you're seeing way more of those workflows and use cases and in regulated industries, so that's another one that I would do. I would say the global aspect of this, which is you have companies. Whether you're an automotive Company, or you're a fast-food Company and you want to do this Globally, I think that's a use-case that we've seen a fairly dramatic increase, but so hopefully that gives you one. And then this is where the partner ecosystem candidly also is driving so much more.  And so, the partner ecosystem is also building a lot of their value-added solutions on top of our horizontal platform. So-net I would say doesn't matter what business you are, what size you are. Part of DX is relevant to what you need to do in order to engage with your customers. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays. please go ahead. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question here. John may be for you just to -- maybe just to switch gears a bit. I was wondering if you could just talk about seasonality in the Document Cloud business specifically? I think the net new ARR there has historically sort of been up into the right through the year. I guess the question is, are we getting to point in that business where the seasonality could start to look a little bit more like Creative, or are there any things to maybe consider for Document Cloud ARR seasonality this quarter? John Murphy : When we look -- think about the situation we've been in the pandemic and the need for more paper to digital transformation that's impacting, not just enterprises and institutions that have obviously you've seen great growth in, but individuals as well as they're engaging with the services that they use.  As we said, I think when you look at the individual offerings that we have across Creative and Document Cloud, we just saw a little bit lower-traffic there, but that's associated where we believe with individuals enjoying our holidays and its pretty indicative using our own Adobe Digital Index data. That's. So, the gyms a lot over the highest travel months in two years.  So that seasonality is hitting it a little bit, but again, we've got such a strong presence in both institutions, education, all the governments, and enterprises on Document Cloud that we still see great growth and strengthening. It's demonstrated and just the continued growth to that business, which is our fastest-growing business right now. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks. John Murphy : Thanks, Saket. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities Please go ahead. Ken Wong : Great. Thank you for taking my question. This one is for you Shantanu. You guys have a history of bringing your professional tool down to the consumer, you had light edition, you have mobile editions. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the addition of Frame.io, creating additional opportunities the sort of across the customer base, teams, and enterprises, I guess do you envision this as a platform that could be brought down to Consumer prosumers? Or is it still a man (ph.) they going to be in that professional bucket? Shantanu Narayen : Ken? It's a very important area of expansion for us. I mean, I think the Creative has always been a segment that looks to us to deliver mission-critical products that enable them to make a livelihood. But the halo effect of that, when you look at what we talked about at our analyst meetings and you know, how big is communicated business already is as well as the outreach of that even into the consumer business. But stay tuned on that front.  I think as we talk about our product roadmap and the excitement that we have to fulfill this vision of creativity for all and target a broader and broader and broader set of customers with some great solutions using our artificial intelligence and Sensei technology, we have some very exciting things underway. That will start to be served to customers. So, we're very excited about that opportunity, it's a big opportunity. It's already a big business for us.  I mean, when we talk about the fact that we're adding over 0.5 billion of net new ARR as our expectation for Q4. A portion of that is also going to what you would call communicators or prosumers. And we're going to be delivering more and more really phenomenal products, targeted at that customer segment. Ken Wong : Got it. Fantastic. Looking forward to MAX. Thanks, guys. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. Congratulations Shantanu and team, a fantastic quarter. Shantanu, I remember, I think what's the MAX 2019 we talked about video and how that could be as big of an opportunity as photos and I'm curious to get your thoughts on the total available market that is new and incremental to Adobe's Creative business as a result of the acquisition that you made afraid Particularly you used the word dramatically expansive scope of what you could do, meaning collaborators in addition to content creators, can you just talk about what you mean by that, you can just put a final point.  This is means that the greatest term will be then, what Wall Street thinks we just always been the case for the past ten years or so. And secondly, not that it's a negative, but what would the seasonal pattern and in summer joined some side of activity where people don't vacation, et cetera.  Is there at all any risk that digital transformation takes a bit of a backseat as we go shopping, not online, they will go to stores, therefore, e-commerce activity might actually start out on it, but the secular trend is too pretty solid. But jumps on the adjustment have reinforced some adjustment or maybe not, but I just want to get your thoughts on that, Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Kash, I mean, as it relates to your first question around video, I think we've been signaling for a while that video is really one of the exciting expansion opportunities for us and that's really played out. It's played out from the products that we've delivered. Premier and after effects continuing to be the leaders in that category, sadly Photoshop and illustrator used a lot. But if you look at what's happening with all these streaming plus services, right? I mean, there isn't a Company that isn't delivering streaming plus service.  And so, I think the insatiable demand for video among consumers is only requiring more and more companies to have these streaming services and deliver more genre as it relates to video. All of that works right now, I mean, we talked a little bit about what we're doing as a partnership with Netflix as well.  All of that is happening now with people in different locations through a collaborative process. So anytime you can take a creative. idea and make that happen quicker, faster to the right audience. That's only going to be incredibly valuable to our customers. And so, I think that trend is only going to continue. And so, we feel really good about what's happening in that particular space with the video frame, we used to use frame-up. A bunch in the production of our own videos and it's been exciting as we've talked to different people who after the acquisition of frame have come and said; Hey, Adobe, that's such a great product, but we think we can do more with it. So, I think that gives us a lot of optimism around whether it's the scriptwriter, whether it's, the reviewer of that, whether it's a creative agency, just being able to or all the corporate videos that's being done. And so certainly, I think as you add that as enterprise product as well, you can certainly get a lot more TAM associated with it. We will update our TAM's cash as we typically do.  I think Jonathan referred or will talk about how we do our Q4 as well as our 2022. And we'll talk to you about terms on that front, but really excited about that. I think the external partnerships that exist for the frame and how it's plugged in, not just to the Adobe solutions, but other solutions are also an area of strength.  And I think to your second question around shopping and online when we look at our DX business and the success that we had in Q3. I mean, a big part of that is more and more companies are thirdly doing the multi-channel omnichannel, whatever they want to call it.  And I think that's only going to continue to be a driver of our Digital Experience Solutions. Because today that stable stakes and so we just look at it and say whether you're shopping in-store over they are shopping online. You need a solution that treats you like a customer that we know of.  And so, I think that's going to only be an imperative for companies. I mean, one thing we should have probably talked about also is if you look at our Q3 results. I mean, there were stronger than what we had said. There were a couple of non-recurring items as part of that and some of that actually had to do with usage in commerce. And so, we are seeing that usage also ramp up.  So, I just wanted to get that. Also, are there as we talked about shopping online and shopping in a store. And in terms of the demand for our DME solutions, we expect as -- as we said, the seasonal Q4 will be the strength and as education comes back and there's more and more end of the quarter activity, not just within the Adobe, but all companies. That's going to lead to increased demand and acceleration. Kash Rangan : That's fantastic. Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks. Ken. Operator : We'll take our next question from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Derrick Wood : Thanks for taking my question, John, I wanted to come back to the Document Cloud business. Because it looks, perhaps, to me, that there was some outside strength from licensed products that may have been in lieu of revenue coming from ARR products. and I think you can see this with total Document Cloud revenue growth actually accelerating even though total ARR growth decelerated. So is that the right assessment and we'd be looking at total revenue, not ARR and I guess. So, is there any reason for a mix shift towards more licensed products and as you look into Q4, given it's a big ELA, quarter, should we expect that to continue? John Murphy : Yes. No. I mean, we -- well, certainly, yeah. You're going to see strength in ELA as [Indiscernible] and I spoke of in terms of Q4, just to see the expansion in Q3 as well. But we still migrate basic customers as well. So ARR is still going to be important for us and where you want to drive more ARR. I think those strengthen our growth, frankly, over the last -- over a year really has been really impressive.  It's always going to give us this opportunity, to drive healthy subscription growth. But LA is not going to give us outsized revenue in Q4, it's going to be a sizable contribution, but we're driving subscriptions and that's, that's a strategy. And we do still have customers that buy perpetual, and so it will be some fluctuations in that. Derrick Wood : Yes. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Parker Lane with Stifel. Please go ahead. Parker Lane : Hi, thanks for taking my question, Sean, I was wondering if you could talk about the nature of Creative wins in the public sector with organizations like the Department of Interior, what do these types of organizations historically relied upon for Creative needs and hopefully, they're embracing the features of the Creative Cloud versus using maybe a particular application like Photoshop or a distinct set of applications. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : To your point, I think the public sector has always been an important part, but I think it's just the amount of content that people are creating is increasing. And when the amount of content that people are creating, then content management becomes an important issue. Workflow becomes an important issue. And the standardization of the products.  And one of the things we did really well is what we called our named user deployment and how, you know, when we have these enterprise licensing agreements, we offer enterprises the ability to download and distribute within the companies. And the more we do training and evangelism of the products, that leads to adoption. So, I would say there's an element of standardization, there's an element of more content.  I mean, even if you're a public sector Company right now, I mean, what you transact online is becoming dramatically greater than it's ever been because the physical presence is seeing cutback as a result of what's happened in the pandemic. I think all of those are macro trends that are going to continue, but we've also done a really good job of actively making sure we evangelize what these solutions are.  Good fall, we do more training within these enterprises. We allow these named user deployments, as I said, with ten leads to true. Well, ups and the ability to get them into a higher band. So, I think the execution on the sales front associated with going into these enterprises, that's getting better and better. Parker Lane : Great feedback. Thank you. Jonathan Vaas : Operator. We're coming up on the top of the hour. We have time for two more questions. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our second last question from Brad Sills, Bank of America Securities. Brad Sills : Great. Thanks, guys for taking my question here. Just with your view across the broader marketing stack here with Experience Cloud. I'm curious what you're observing with regard to these Customer 360 initiatives. Are you finding customers are taking more of multiproduct deals here to get that view across multiple channels here, e-commerce, marketing automation, CMS? You've got workflow automation in there. Are there any combinations of any of that that you're seeing trending more recently, been in the past? Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : It clearly has been a push for us, Brad, in terms of, you know, what we're doing, which is how do we sell the entire suite offering? And I think every year we give you an update on how. That is actually indeed, how we are selling it.  And so, from our perspective, the marketing stack, what's completely unique about us, is the data and insights that we're getting, the ability to do commerce, and the digital presence. I think as it relates to customers, we have 60 waivers unique and I think we're years ahead of it. Any other large Company that has space is this real-time nature of what we've delivered, it's scalable, we've got billions of profiles.  And so, I think a lot of other companies are talking about how they take something that may be in the record somewhere and do things with it. But for us, it's the activation of that data. And that's where I think most people are really excited about what Adobe has to offer.  And the other thing that I think is really happened, is people recognize that they have to get control of their first-party data. I think a lot of interest used to exist about customer acquisition and third-party data. But I think right. Now it's about dupi have even control of our first-party data.  Do we have control of our behavior? And what is happening on multiple channels? And the fact that that can be very easily answered as it relates to what we have done with the Adobe Experience Platform. Last but not least. I mean, remember we're the only Company that can go in. And say, hey, we have a B2B business and a B2C business.  And when we talk about how we're using this in terms of the playbook on Adobe.com, I think that really opens up a lot of people's ideas as to how they can use this and utilize it. And so, I think the playbook that we delivered for D dom earlier this year and how we talk about what they can do. I think that's what -- that really resonates with customers. Brad Sills : That's great to hear. Thanks, Jonathan. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our final question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Shantanu, the DX DRaaS accelerating from Q2. Can you just walk through the drivers of what you're seeing in terms of that acceleration? And maybe for John, just as it relates to seasonality with Magento and commerce in the Q4, anything to keep in mind there as you just feel like this -- to keep powering through the tougher comps given -- given the [Indiscernible] you're seeing in that business. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Brian, I think what really drove that revenue was both subscriptions as well as the services. As you know, the services, were again, really reliant on a large partner ecosystem. But if over the last 18 months. As we've always talked about, the interest is high. How they are all implementing it.  And so as they continue to implement it, and as they continue to say, we need to invest in these solutions, I think that's driving it, and I think to your point, if you take a step back, we -- I think guided to something like 19% revenue at the beginning of the year, and 22% in subscriptions, we had increased that in March, 22023 respectively, and we just posted 2629 and so and if you look at it for Q4 as well as you point out with the large comps, we continue to be excited about that opportunity.  So, I think there is. This is a front-end center, it's an enterprise priority. And I think since people are staying, we've got to deal with this new reality, there's no time to waste in terms of implementing it.  Again, there were, as we said, a couple of non-recurring items. some of those had to do with usage in commerce and that actually is also indicative that maybe a little bit more depends on the quarter, but it's up to the right as far as we're concerned in terms of the business opportunity in the business. Brent Thill : Thank you. John Murphy : Go ahead. Shantanu Narayen : No, go ahead. Sorry, Jonathan, I didn't hear you. John Murphy : Yeah, no problem. Just going to just kind of over the top on Brent's question on seasonality-related commerce, of course, in Q4 as a strong commerce quarter anyway. Given the holidays, spending trend. And so, we're excited about the opportunity there as well, it's just trying to set us up into the right, I think we have great momentum. Shantanu Narayen : And overall, since that was the last question, I mean, again, I think we were really pleased with our performance in Q3. We do expect a strong end of the year for our business.  As you saw from our targets, it's clear that your win, this unique position that we have three large growth opportunities ahead of us and we're executing well against all three of those and the innovation and the roadmap that exists across all three of those clouds just gives us continued optimism that we will serve our customers well and we feel fortunate. I think the future of work and the fact that it's more hybrid will only continue to emphasize digital as a priority for companies of every size. And so, whether that's an increase in content for personalization, whether that's more automation of digital documents, and whether that's every business thing we need to understand how to do customer experience management.  I believe Adobe is very unique. We position to drive those particular macroeconomic trends. But thank you for joining us today, we look forward to the max, as well as the Q4 earnings call. And with that, I will turn it back over to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, Jonathan here. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. As we mentioned in the press. Released today, we look forward to connecting with you again on Thursday, December 16th, for our Q4 earnings and virtual financial analyst day, we will be sending out more details in the coming weeks. And if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at ir@adobe.com, I look forward to speaking with many of you soon, and we appreciate your interest in Adobe, this concludes the call.",

I will now pass it over to Adobe's Chairman and CEO, Shantanu Narayen. Shantanu Narayen : Good morning, and thanks, Jonathan. Welcome to this Virtual 2022 Financial Analysts Meeting. Adobe had another outstanding year in 2021. I'm incredibly proud of the dedication and resilience of Adobe's 25,000 employees all around the world in delivering breakthrough technologies for our customers. I'd like to start with a recap of the tremendous accomplishments we had across every dimension in 2021. As a product geek at heart, I take immense pride in our team driving hundreds of innovations across Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. Earlier this week, we introduced Creative Cloud Express, to enable anyone to express their ideas simply and beautifully. Creative Cloud Express the start of a brand-new journey to introduce first-time creators to Adobe Creative tools, while adding significant value to all of our current Creative Cloud subscribers. I think it marks a new chapter of creation, collaboration, and sharing on the web, and leverages the unique technology and capabilities of Adobe's flagship products. It also builds on the collaboration capabilities we debuted at MAX, including Illustrator and Photoshop on the web, Creative Cloud Spaces, and Creative Cloud Canvas. With the addition of Frame.io, we're now incorporating review and approval functionality to deliver a powerful collaboration platform for end-to-end video collaboration. And we're continuing to add magic to our flagship applications, and we're enabling them to run natively on new hardware like Apple's M1 chip, as well as Microsoft Windows Surface and Pen. In Document Cloud, Acrobat Web now supports 21 frictionless verbs create, export, extract, and edit for both text and images and PDF. We've seen tremendous growth in Acrobat online, as people tap our powerful, free, browser-based document tools to handle important tasks on the fly, without the need to download any software. In addition, we made outstanding progress with PDF support within both the Chrome as well as Edge browsers. And on the Experience Cloud platform, we extended our real-time customer data platform to B2B customers, bringing together individual and account profiles across systems to give B2B companies a single view of their customer for the very first time. We launched Adobe Journey Optimizer, harnessing over 20 years of industry-leading e-mail, marketing, and cross-channel campaign management expertise to empower brands to design and deliver personalized experiences across the entire customer journey in a single application. With the new acquisition of Adobe Workfront, we're now empowering companies to optimize business outcomes by connecting creative and marketing professionals to manage all creative workflows across the entire marketing lifecycle. In addition, we've advanced our industry leadership in key areas across our portfolio. Clearly underpinning our three clouds is the magic and power of Adobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, a significant differentiator for Adobe and an enabler to more rapid innovation. We continued our investment in the Adobe Experience platform as the foundational platform for strong governance capabilities across our Experience Cloud business, accelerating innovations like real-time customer data platform and Adobe Journey optimizer on a global scale. We take our responsibility in the creative community very seriously. And as part of the content authenticity initiative, we've published a drop specification as an open standard to combat online disinformation. I'm amazed at the resiliency of our employees and we pioneered all new digital event experiences with Adobe Summit and Adobe MAX, extending our reach and engaging millions of people around the world. I'm also tremendously proud of the industry recognition we continue to receive for our brand, our workplace, our culture, and our practices. And just to name a few examples, we were again named a top riser on Interbrand's Best Global brands list. We're named to Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, for the 21st year, People Magazines Company's Companies That Care list for the fifth year, Fast Company's Brands that Matter list. And I think what's more significant for a lot of investors moving forward, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth year, and one that I'm particularly proud of a 100% score for being the best place to work for disability inclusion. When you look at our financial results, it puts us in an incredibly rare position in the industry. Not many companies can drive the top line and bottom line growth with an impressive margin the way we do. And we powered through $15 billion in 2021, and we accomplished some significant milestones in Q4, our first $1 billion digital experience revenue quarter, our first $3 billion digital media, and $2 billion in cash flow; just some incredible financial statistics. Dan Durn, our new CFO, will cover our Q4 as well as our FY'21 results in greater detail. Since he joined Adobe in October, I've really appreciated his experience and partnership, and I look forward to him sharing his perspective as well as having significant impact on Adobe's growth in the decade to come. I'm also delighted to announce that Anil Chakravarthy and David Wadhwani had been promoted to the President of the Digital Experience and Digital Media Businesses, respectively. I value their leadership and contributions, and they will share more color around each of our businesses. While 2021 was awesome, I'm actually most excited about what's to come for 2022 and beyond in the over 20 years that I've been at Adobe. We have this immense market opportunity. We have an incredible technology innovation roadmap and the best leadership team of any company on the planet. And I think what we've done is provided 2022 targets that demonstrate the strength of the underlying business, three incredibly large growing opportunities across our clouds, continued focus on execution based on the current economic climate. I think the one change that we all are experiencing is as the company scales beyond $15 billion, we also have to focus on FX expectations, given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar. But as excited as I am to talk about 2022, today is really sharing about Adobe's tremendous growth story and how we're going to be driving the next decade of growth, because that's really what underpins our growing over $200 billion addressable market opportunity. As you'll hear throughout the day from our leadership team, our growth has anchored across these five key pillars, our proven track record and our focus on creating and leading categories, the ever-increasing expanding set of customers that we serve, from consumers to creative pros to first time creators, to small and medium businesses, to the largest enterprises in the world, our ability to deliver incredible technology platforms that enable whole new classes of applications and accelerate our innovative cadence. The important shift we continue to make from building applications to enabling new business models, app, services, artificial intelligence and platforms, that's paying dividends. And last but not least, an incredible global ecosystem of partners that spans the entire customer lifecycle from experience creation and marketing to delivery and ongoing support. And I think the message for you as investors is across every dimension, across every business, our aspirations are higher, and we're thinking bigger. There's this incredible once-in-a-lifetime expansive opportunity in front of us, and I think we're uniquely positioned to capture it. And now to provide color on the strategy on how we're going to expand markets and categories, I'd like to welcome Ann Lewnes, who recently celebrated her 15th year at Adobe, our incredible Chief Marketing Officer, who's also taken on the additional responsibility for corporate strategy. Ann? Ann Lewnes : Thank you, Shantanu, and good morning everyone. Over the past two years, we've witnessed a profound global shift to all things digital. Everyone, from students to small businesses to the largest global brands has had to make this dramatic pivot. Technology innovation, the proliferation of new devices and platforms, and the increased desire and ability for anyone to create and deliver great digital experiences have all accelerated the move to a truly digital world. And there's no going back. Whether it's through your phone, tablet or PC, it's easy for anyone, anywhere to create, work, learn, connect, shop, unwind, and launch and grow businesses. While there continue to be massive challenges in the world, digital has also empowered us through the democratization of creativity, the development of rich digital experiences, the ability to work and learn from home, to shop and sell products online or to connect with those you love. We are moving society forward. Digital has fundamentally changed everything. According to Adobe Analytics, online spending during the 2021 holiday season is projected to be $200 billion, and total e-commerce spending is projected to reach $1 trillion in 2022. It's clear that digital is a requirement to conducting business today. From your favorite local restaurant to Fortune 500 companies, across every country and every industry, digital is powering today's businesses. Companies or automating mission-critical document processes like HR and legal to drive increased efficiency and agility. At the same time, customers now expect rich personalized digital experiences that are relevant, engaging and consistent across any device. It's well documented that digital first businesses drive greater long-term growth and customer loyalty. And Adobe our own technology has enabled us to transform into a digital first business. Companies like Adobe are measuring every single customer interaction, to understand behavior, intent, and ultimately to drive business impact. We do that by providing personalized digital experiences at scale through adobe.com. across all of our digital channels, and increasingly through our products. Digital has not only changed the way we live in work, but also how we connect with one another. Anyone can create or participate in an online community, whether it's with your family, friends, colleagues, or those with whom you share interests and passions. And with the emergence of the creator economy, it's possible for enterprising content creators to build both a large following and monetize their passions, products or services. Today there are seemingly unlimited number of social platforms and ways to engage with one's desired audience. The ease with which you can share, promote and monetize content, products, and services has enabled a whole new level of connection and commerce. We're also finding new ways to work together even when we're apart through the proliferation of collaboration solutions, like Frame.io, which we acquired in Q4. Adobe's mission to change the world through digital experiences is more important than ever before. The digital world runs on Adobe's tools and platforms, and through our unparalleled innovation, creativity, scale, and advanced data-driven operating model, we are continuing to catalyze the growth of digital. Hundreds of millions of people across the globe use our products every single day, and we're impacting every aspect of society. Adobe continues to be uniquely positioned to lead in this next digital era. Our three industry leading cloud offerings are mission critical across every geography and audience, with Creative Cloud, we're unleashing creativity for all, giving anyone, anywhere the tools to express their creativity. With Document Cloud, we're accelerating document productivity, modernizing how people view, share, and engage with documents and with Experience Cloud we're powering digital businesses of all sizes, giving them everything they need to design and deliver great customer experiences. Underpinning our three clouds is the power of Adobe Sensei, our advanced AI/ML framework that enables us to deliver a steady stream of unparalleled innovation. Over the last year, we've seen the critical role that creativity has played in the world. Creative Cloud is empowering everyone from the high school student to the social media influencer to the most demanding creative professional to tell their story. The Creative Cloud TAM is projected to be approximately $63 billion in 2024, $25 billion of that TAM comes from our core base of creative professionals who purchase Creative Cloud applications and services like Adobe Stock. New growth drivers in this segment include 3D and other immersive experiences, as well as web-first collaboration tools like Frame.io, $13 billion of the TAM is coming from communicators, non-professional creators, including small businesses, students and marketers. As you'll hear from David, many communicators are already using Creative Cloud, and we hope to see even, serve even more of them with products like Creative Cloud Express, which we just launched on Monday. The remaining $7 billion of TAM comes from consumers, including hobbyists and social media users. The biggest growth drivers here are mobile applications in categories like video and imaging, such as Adobe's Photoshop Express. Digital documents are a core to the future of work, PDFs and document workflows empower everyone from individuals to the largest enterprises to be productive anytime, anywhere. We're excited about the Document Cloud strategy and the large addressable market, which is projected to grow to $32 billion by 2024, $10 billion of that TAM is coming from knowledge workers, business professionals who typically use our core Acrobat desktop subscription offerings. Growth is expected to come from the expansion of digital document use cases, e-signatures and increase collaboration capabilities. $8 billion of the TAM is coming from communicators who are using Acrobat web and mobile applications to create, scan, and edit PDF files for both business and personal use. Growth in this segment is projected to come from expanding the premium PDF base and capturing demand from new funnels with offerings designed for web and mobile use cases. Finally, $14 billion of the TAM is coming from enterprises, who are using document services, including Acrobat and e-signature solutions, as well as APIs that developers use to seamlessly integrate with key line of business applications. Growth drivers in this segment include API's to build powerful document workflows, and expanded use cases. Whether it's B2B or B2C, businesses of every size across every category are investing in customer experience management. Adobe Experience Cloud empowers companies to deliver predictive personalized real-time digital experiences across every phase of the customer lifecycle. Our total addressable market for Adobe Experience Cloud is estimated to be $110 billion in 2024, $33 billion of the TAM is coming from the data insights and audiences category, which includes Adobe Experience platform, real time CDP, and Adobe Analytics, including our new customer journey analytics offering. Future growth drivers include the increasing demand for a unified customer profile, and personalization at scale, $49 billion of TAM is coming from the content and commerce category, which includes our Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Commerce offerings. The volume of content needed by businesses to engage customers across every touchpoint is exploding. And the pace at which it must be deployed is accelerating, the need for a seamlessly integrated commerce capability is accelerating at that same pace, $18 billion of the TAM is coming from the customer journeys category, which includes Adobe Campaign, Marketo Engage, and our new Adobe Journey Optimizer. Growth in this segment is expected to come from the continued need for businesses to engage with their customers across an ever increasing array of channels. New to the TAM this year is the $10 billion marketing workflow category, which includes Adobe Workfront acquired last year. Growth here is expected to come from the increasing need for teams to efficiently plan, track and execute marketing campaigns. Adobe has always been relentlessly focused on looking around the corner, inventing new growth opportunities and successfully driving growth within our existing businesses. We have pioneered and are leading three massive categories, creativity, digital documents, and customer experience management. This week, we announced Creative Cloud Express, our exciting new unified web and mobile offering that's perfect for anyone looking to quickly and easily make and share standout content. Creative Cloud Express is great for first time creators and communicators, but will also provide value to our current Creative Cloud subscribers. It's a great example of how we continue to expand our customer base and grow our TAM. We win by creating enduring technology platforms from Sensei to the Adobe Experience platform. They're the foundation for product innovation and our industry leading applications and services. Since transitioning Creative Cloud to a subscription model 10 years ago, we have continued to innovate our business models, building applications, services and platforms to bring value to market faster, better serve new customers, and leverage new monetization models. It would be impossible to do all this alone. We have built a large ecosystem of partners from agencies to solution integrators to ISPs that customize and extend our solutions to the needs of our joint customers. We continue to see massive opportunities from Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud, with the market tailwinds, our world-class innovation and the best employees in the world, we believe we're well positioned for our next decade of growth. And now, I'd like to introduce Anil Chakravarthy, President of our Digital Experience business. [Advertisement] Anil Chakravarthy : Thank you, Ann. Hello everyone. Good to be here with you. And I look forward to sharing more on our momentum, opportunity and strategy for the Digital Experience business. It's really an exciting time for us as Ann shared. Let me begin by discussing a couple of highlights from Q4. We had strong performance across the board. Our segment revenue crossed over a $1 billion for the first time with 23% year-over-year growth. Our subscription revenue grew to $886 million up 27% year-over-year and our subscription bookings in Q4 were up 50% year-over-year. And with that, we were up over 40% year-over-year for full-year FY'21. A lot of that was powered by the success of our Adobe Experience platform, and the native apps that run on it. It's foundational to our Digital Experience business. We invested early in the platform, and have a significant head start having launched the platform in 2019. Our growth has accelerated. Earlier this year, we disclosed that we had passed over $100 million in revenue and at the end of Q4, we surpassed $250 million in book of business. And we've seen a 300% year-over-year growth in customer count. The scale that we're operating in production is massive, over 21 trillion segment evaluations per day and our ecosystem is extremely broad with over 300 partner integrations. And as Shantanu and Ann both mentioned, we have really accelerated our innovation over the past 18 months with new native applications and services powered by Sensei. A great example of this is Major League Baseball; they are leveraging digital to transform experiences for their customers with a focus on reaching that next generation of fans. And this is across all their channels at home, on the go and in menu in the ballpark, they're focused on personalization at scale, delivering that right experience at the right time, via the right channel to all of their fans. And it's not just Major League Baseball, it's clear that every business is a digital business, and customer experience management is critical to business success. The changes in the tailwinds that we have seen during the pandemic are here to stay. And this has contributed to a strong momentum in our Digital Experience business; couple of examples here again, significant growth in average annual recurring revenue across our Top 1125 accounts. We've seen strong growth across all accounts greater than a million dollars in ARR and all of our customers are building long-term partnerships with us. As an example, the combined total contract value of our Top 10 accounts is $760 million, which is three times higher than what it was at the end of FY'19. When we think about customer experience management, it is imperative for every company today to deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers. That's how they reach and engage all their customers across the world. And it's critical for them to do that, to deliver that next level of digital business growth. It's all about personalized experiences that are tailored to the individuals, delivered in real time, and delivered seamlessly across online and offline channels based on first party data, and making sure that they honor customer preference and privacy. And that's what we focus on, our strategy is battle tested and helps companies across the world achieve personalization at scale. We offer customers, the best of both worlds, integrated, AI enabled comprehensives applications, delivered on a real time cloud scale platform. We have strong momentum with Workfront with the ability to unify marketing workflow, and increase marketing agility for all customers. And we are the strategic partner for customer experience management; I hear this from customers all around the world every day. And our ecosystem of partners is expansive with over 4,000 partners as Ann mentioned across ISVs, tech partners, system integrators and agencies. This is how we make this happen for our customers through the Adobe Experience Cloud. We focus on four key categories, content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys and marketing workflow, all delivered on a common platform, which is the Adobe Experience platform. We've had a strong innovation engine over the last 18 months and that's continuing both on the application layer as well as the platform with AI and machine learning capabilities in the platform powered by Adobe Sensei. This is a huge moat for us with the combination of a comprehensive set of applications and an integrated platform. In closing, I am incredibly excited about the opportunity we have for the Digital Experience business. We have strong momentum and we're the clear leader in the Customer Experience Management category. We have a large growth opportunity to help every company deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers around the world. And we have the best technology across our Adobe experience platform and the native applications with the ability grow rapidly as we have shown over the last couple of years. With that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to David to cover the Digital Media business. David? David Wadhwani : Great. Thanks, Anil, and hello everyone. I've been back at Adobe now for about six months and I'm really excited about what I see. As some of you know, I ran the Digital Media business during the transition to Creative Cloud, and while the business has certainly matured since the early days of that transition, some things haven't changed. Our product teams keep delivering incredible innovation and our business continues to show strong momentum. Now, before we dive into what I'm personally excited about for FY'22 and beyond, I want to hit on some Q4 highlights. Our Digital Media business in the quarter delivered $571 million of net new ARR in total. With that Creative Cloud crossed $10 billion in ARR. And we saw continued strength in our Creative Cloud offers, while seeing outside growth for substance, which grew a 100% year-over-year, thanks to increasing demand for 3D and the emerging Metaverse platforms. We also saw outsized growth in our mobile applications, which grew over 55% year-over-year. Our mobile applications have now generated over 400 million mobile IDs to-date. And it's been a great source of new user acquisition for us. On the Document Cloud size we grew ARR of 31% for the year ending at $1.9 billion. A bit of color behind these numbers, we now have 2.5 billion mobile and desktop devices with reader or Acrobat installed on them. We're seeing explosive growth in Acrobat Web, where we saw monthly active users grow over a 100% since last year. And our strategy of integrating Adobe Sign and Acrobat is clearly paying off for us with 85% year-over-year growth in Adobe Sign transactions in Acrobat. In aggregate, we ended the year with approximately 12.2 billion of ARR. And while we posted a great FY'21, we have even more exciting opportunities ahead for us. Let's start by talking a little bit about Creative Cloud. The big picture here is that we're living in a time where content and creativity and design has never been more valued, where content is fueling the global economy, where the digital consumption is exploding, and where virtually every business needs a digital presence. We're living in a world where creative expression is considered a 21st century skill in education. And we're living in a world, where we're seeing emerging 3D and immersive technologies like the Metaverse creating demand for all new types of content. All of this continues to drive incredible tailwinds for Creative Cloud. In particular though, I wanted to spend a minute on the rise of the creator economy, where we're seeing a growing number of individuals, solopreneurs and small business owners, creating businesses from their passions and monetizing their content, their goods, or their services online. The creator economy is already big with nearly a 100 million small businesses on social media. And with the majority of them saying that their online presence is more important to their success than their physical presence. Now despite it being big, it continues to grow at an incredible rate with nearly 4.5 million new businesses minted in the U.S. alone last year, which was a record. This has been a significant contributor to our success and a major contributor to the over 600 million free and paid monthly active users across our Digital Media products, who are not considered creative professionals. And of course this expansive opportunity needs an expand strategy that drives our mission for creativity for all. In the next few minutes, I'll lay out how Adobe can help anyone who wants to express themselves in creative ways from a small business owner to the highest end production house. Adobe has a solution for them because of our investment in five key areas. And since we just launched Creative Cloud Express, I wanted to start by discussing how we empower the world with content first task-based creativity. Let's go ahead and start by looking at a video of Creative Cloud Express and what it can do. [Advertisement] Creative Cloud Express is the result of years of in-market learning from our web and mobile products. And it's built on four key pillars. First, we remove all barriers to adoption. It's free to get started, it doesn't require a desktop download because it's a 100% web and mobile, it doesn't have a learning curve and users can create an account and publish content in minutes. Second, it's got an unparalleled content library. So, novice users can build beautiful images and social media posts, digital flyers and more in minutes. This includes 175 stock images from Adobe Stock, 20,000 fonts and 1,000 of templates and design assets. And it's all powered by a universal search capability that surfaces the right content and recommendations at the right time. Third, it leverages decades of Adobe's product innovation. As you'd expect, we have great workflows with our Creative Cloud applications, but it also include a slew of Sensei-based quick actions that make creating and editing images, videos and PDF easier than ever before. And fourth, we understand that people create content with the intent to distribute it. So Creative Cloud Express has integrations for single click publishing to social media services. And you can expect to see that our recent acquisition of ContentCal will benefit CCX users with even more social planning and publishing capabilities in the very near future. Creative Cloud Express is easy to use and it's easy to get started with, users can have a lot of success with the free tier, but they're also presented with premium features and content for at affordable monthly price. CCX is also entitled with most CC existing plans, which we expect will drive higher engagement and retention in our core Creative Cloud customer base. And the go-to market motion is very familiar to us. We will combine our digital acquisition funnels and our product led growth motion tuned for web and mobile. This gives us an opportunity to continually iterate and optimize user journeys while ramping this business over time. We also plan to leverage our existing footprint across education, reseller, and enterprise to scale the business. We're thrilled to have Creative Cloud Express in market today it's been amazing to see what people can make with it. And we really couldn't be more excited about this moment and what this means for a start of a whole new journey for Adobe. So moving beyond Creative Cloud Express, we also have a lot going on across Creative Cloud as a whole. We're advancing the state-of-art in imaging, video and design and more by building new capabilities across desktop web and mobile. For example, we're introduced Photoshop and Illustrator for web at Adobe MAX, and we released a series of new Sensei driven AI ML capabilities including neural filters and auto masking in Photoshop and auto captioning in premier just to name a few. We also continue to - our focus on democratizing 3D and immersive. Substance 3D now supports end-to-end 3D workflows, users can design parametric 3D assets and designer compose rendering virtual scenes in stager, add texture, color, effects and painter, and create 3D materials with sampler. This enables fully virtual photo shoot saving companies a lot of money and a lot of time and speeds up asset and scene creation for inclusion and games, videos, and the emerging Metaverse platforms. Collaboration is another big area of focus for us. We're putting -- we're integrating collaboration directly into our apps and existing creative workflows. We're very excited about the Frame.io acquisition and see tremendous opportunity across individual corporate and media workflows with that product. We shipped a public beta of share for review work workflows at MAX, and we demoed spaces on canvas, which we believe will enable teams to organize their creative assets and host live working sessions. And last, but certainly not least, we continue to produce content that inspires and educates our users through services like Adobe Live. We help users monetize their work through services like Adobe Stock, and we help them connect and inspire each other through services like Behance, which now is closing in on almost 29 million members. These five strategic pillars work together to ensure that anyone with creative needs can find a solution at Adobe, whether they're a creative professional, trying to keep up with the increasing content demand, or they're a communicator participating in the creator economy or a consumer looking to up their game in photography or a student developing 21st century skills. We use our data driven operating model DDOM to engage them as they express their interests online by perhaps searching for something like compositing in Photoshop or designing a Twitter post. Based on their intent, we then route them to one of our Creative Cloud apps, one of our mobile apps or one of our frictionless web quick actions. We make sure that they have early success and we introduce them to other capabilities in Creative Cloud or Creative Cloud Express before converting them to and engaging them as a paid user. This digital motion combined with our reseller partners, our direct sales teams gives us an amazing global footprint and reach. So in summary, everything is going digital and content is for fueling the digital economy. The result is a massive and growing TAM for Creative Cloud as Ann talked about earlier and our offerings, which now include Creative Cloud Express continue to expand to meet market demand for both professionals and non-professionals. We couldn't be more excited about the opportunity ahead for the creative business. And as you know, the other part of the Digital Media business is of course our Document Cloud, which is also experiencing significant tailwinds. Demand for PDF has never been greater. In fact, web searches for PDF have doubled in the last decade, and we believe the reason for this is that PDF has become the de facto format for unstructured data. PDF has also been the de facto standard for business-to-business collaboration where nowhere is this more pronounced of course them with e-signatures. This makes PDF an essential part of modernizing any business workflow. And Adobe is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend. Our apps are installed on over 2.5 billion devices and we've opened and in our apps. We've opened or created 320 billion PDFs in the last 12 months alone. We continue to be a leading destination for PDF viewing and we saw a 100 million free and paid signups over the last year. And we see that Acrobat can be a gateway to related services. Adobe Sign transactions in Acrobat, as I mentioned earlier, have increased 85% year-over-year, as we continue to deepen the integration between the two offers. Our strategy here is clearly working and we're investing across five key motions to make sure it continues to. First, our document verb strategy has been very effective. We now have 21 verbs market, everything from edit PDF to convert PDF, to rotate PDF, and we're seeing continued -- we're continuing to optimize our digital acquisition and increasing our share of voice across the 80 million PDF related searches that happen every month. Second, we're proliferating e-signatures by integrating them into Acrobat across all services, desktop, web, and mobile. Given our early success here over the last year, you can expect to see us continue bringing these products closer together in the years ahead. Third, we remain committed to making PDF more intelligent for both interacting and reading. Adobe is reinventing mobile PDF viewing with liquid mode. We're accelerating document productivity with automated form field detection, and we're helping transform unstructured data to structured actionable data with our AI, ML based extract function. Fourth, we're unlocking business workflows through our PDF and sign APIs. This empowers developers to build document automation solutions that transform how their businesses work. And fifth we're leveraging our diversified go to market motions to reach anyone with a document need. Our global resellers and inside sales teams give us amazing access to a broad base of business demand. Our enterprise sales team allows us to sell tops down to CIOs, looking to transform their business. And perhaps most importantly, our digital funnel continues to drive individuals' users into our conversion funnels. Knowledge workers, communicators, IT decision makers and developers all have frictionless onboarding pathways. Our data driven operating model helps customers discover Adobe technology when they're searching for PDF related verbs and we engage them in ways that provide quick success on web mobile and desktop before upselling them to premium features, premium features products, services, or APIs that broaden their engagement with Adobe over time. In short, Document Cloud is incredibly well positioned for the years ahead. I hope this gives you a sense of why we're excited about both the creative and document businesses. In summary, both businesses are benefiting from significant tail winds that are underpinning their large and growing TAMs, both businesses are realizing the market benefits by leveraging our amazing brand awareness, our go to market footprint and our incredible pipeline of innovation. And both businesses have the opportunity supercharge their existing data driven operating model by pairing it with a product led growth motion, as our capabilities increasingly are accessed by users on web and mobile. So we're really excited about the year ahead. And with that, I wanted to turn it over to Dan. Dan Durn : Thanks, David, and before I jump in, I also want to thank him for letting me borrow his sweater today. Let me begin by saying how thrilled I am to be here today and be a part of this amazing team at Adobe. Having just been here for a few months, it's obvious what a special company this is, and I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead. Now, let me jump in with Adobe's Q4 results. Adobe achieved revenue of $4.11 billion, a significant milestone, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted EPS was $2.57 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.20. Digital Media segment revenue was $3.01 billion, the business's first $3 billion quarter, which represents 21% year-over-year growth with net new digital media ARR of $571 million. Digital Experience achieved its first billion dollar quarter, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $886 million representing 27% year-over-year growth. We had record cash flows from operations of $2.05 billion in the quarter, and we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our stock. Turning to our three strategic clouds, it was a tremendous finish to the year. In Q4, Adobe achieved $2.48 billion in Creative revenue, and added $430 million of net new Creative ARR. We exited the year with more than $10 billion of ending Creative ARR with strong performance throughout the year. Growth drivers in the quarter included acquisition of new users on adobe.com, strength in our teams offering, seasonal Q4 strength in the enterprise and success co selling frame.io with our Creative Cloud Enterprise offerings. However, while we saw increased demand for offerings during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks, we did not see the traditional spikes we have had in previous years. This is consistent with this year's industry trends in line with e-commerce holiday shopping data from the Adobe Digital Economy Index. Adobe Document Cloud achieved $532 million in Q4, revenue continues to be -- and continues to be our fastest growing business. We added a record $141 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter with ending ARR of $1.93 billion growing 31% year-over-year. Our Integrated Document platform is clearly resonating with customers around the globe. We continue to see momentum with enterprises, small businesses and individuals using web and mobile first tools. In Digital Experience, we achieved our first billion dollar revenue quarter. We're seeing strong demand for our real time experience platform and app services, as large enterprises are making investments in Adobe to drive customer experience management and personalization at scale. We drove record Q4 net subscription bookings and for the full fiscal year, we grew net ASP greater than 40% year-over-year. Let's look quickly at the annual numbers. Adobe's financial performance in the year was outstanding, with both top line acceleration and margin expansion in the year, resulting in more than $7 billion of operating cash flow and remaining performance obligations grew 23% year-over-year to nearly $14 billion, absolutely world class performance. Now let's discuss what a unique investment opportunity Adobe is. These are some of the outstanding qualities of Adobe that have energized me about the opportunity and it's what ultimately brought me here today. There's a fundamental shift towards digitization, that's accelerating around the globe. And I believe Adobe is better positioned than any other company to capitalize on these opportunities. Combining that with Adobe's financial track record, as well as industry defining products and platforms, the result is an immense runway ahead of this company for growth. Let me elaborate a bit more on my view of this opportunity. In the years ahead, there's going to be fundamental shifts in all aspects of our lives, all of them digitally enabled. Digital enablement will increasingly shape and define how we live, how we create, how we communicate, how we collaborate, how companies serve their customers, how companies compete, and how economies function. These changes are both powerful, and pervasive. I call it the digitization of everything. The digitization of everything is accelerating. And I believe what happens in the next 10 years is going to define the rest of the century, similar to what happened in the Industrial Revolution. Except now, digital content and data are going to be the fuel of the digital economy. This is a generational opportunity. And we're talking about unlocking trillions of dollars of economic value in the global economy. When you look at Adobe's foundational strengths, there's very few companies that is leveraged to the digitization of the global economy, as well as we are. From the way people create and communicate to the future of productivity and digital collaboration in a distributed work environment, to the digitization of businesses, driving customer engagement with data driven insights to personalize customer experiences, but do it at massive scale to AI and machine learning. Global trends towards digitization have so many intersections with Adobe's unique strengths. Again, digital content and data are the fuel of the digital economy. And I believe no one is better positioned than Adobe to be the digital enabler of the world. How many companies on the planet have this profile? How many companies have this opportunity, not very many. When I think about our near-term strengths, combined with our long-term opportunities, there's a uniqueness here, that's incredibly exciting. Let's double click on the company's financial performance and take a closer look at what I'm talking about. Starting with revenue growth, you can see consistent sustained revenue growth over the last four years as the company has grown subscription revenues at a 24% CAGR. That has been the strategy continuing to grow while producing a revenue stream that's even more ratable and predictable. I'm incredibly impressed by this team's acumen, what they've been able to accomplish, as well as by the contribution to revenue growth from newer initiatives, including Adobe Stock, Substance 3D, Acrobat Web, Sign, Creative Cloud mobile apps, and the Adobe Experience platform. Underlying this financial performance is an incredibly diverse business, from our broad base of customers to diversified products and platforms, comprehensive business models, and go to market reach that spans across all geographies. With growing and diverse revenue streams, the company's been able to expand profitability over the last four years, while accelerating the top line. Adobe's disciplined execution and investment rigor has enabled the company to balance long-term investments while also focusing on profitability. This time period also includes the integration of several strategic acquisitions Magento, Marketo, Algorithmic, Workfront, Frame.io, it's impressive the way Adobe has managed to combine expanded profitability with strong sustained top line growth and M&A integration. Let's talk about RPO, contractually committed future revenues which make Adobe's future performance incredibly predictable and reliable. Exiting fiscal year 2021, RPO grew 23% on the strength of our Enterprise bookings. RPO consists of deferred revenue and unbilled backlog with the current portion expected to flow into revenue over the next 12 months. It's also important to note that most of our adobe.com subscriptions are billed monthly and don't show up as deferred revenue, the remaining contractual commitments of those subscriptions, which average about six months in length at any given time, are included in unbilled backlog. The cash flow performance really speaks for itself, as you can see the way our operating cash flows have accelerated over the last two fiscal years. Sustained growth and profitability at scale is not easy to achieve. The momentum at Adobe is strong, as evidenced by our first $2 billion quarter of operating cash flows. A strong capital structure with robust investment grade credit rating positions us to continue to drive growth and provides flexibility making access to capital affordable for Adobe. Let's talk about our capital allocation strategy. First, we focus on investing in the business to drive long-term growth. Given the tremendous opportunities in front of us, some of our recent innovative R&D initiatives include our next generation data platform, as well as Creative Cloud Express, which we announced earlier this week. We're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing to scale those businesses globally. Second, our cash and investment balances as well as our debt capacity, enable inorganic growth opportunities. You've seen the way we've accelerated growth and made a creative strategic addition over the last fiscal year with Workfront and Frame.io. Lastly, and importantly, we focus on returning capital to our shareholders. Our stock repurchase program is funded through growth in our operating cash flows, and you can see how successful we've been in driving down the average shares outstanding over the last 4 years. Since 2018, we've returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. Exiting Q4, we have $13.1 billion of remaining stock repurchase authority through the end of our fiscal 2024. The hallmark of a great technology company is consistent innovation in category defining products. Adobe's done that across all its businesses, and we'll dive into each of them next to discuss the performance drivers. First, creative, the company has driven sustained ARR and revenue growth, which accelerated from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. Let me tell you about the underlying data-driven operating model used to drive this performance. It all starts with innovation, and the most comprehensive industry defining portfolio of products. Our brilliant marketing campaigns generate awareness about Adobe's offerings and drive traffic to adobe.com to engage customers to try, buy, use, and renew. It's about taking creators on a journey. First with simpler applications, including our mobile, tablet, and web applications, connecting them with vibrant creative communities, and then providing journeys that empower them to do more as they advance, including services like Adobe Stock, Cloud libraries, and collaboration features. Now, with the addition of Frame.io, and Creative Cloud Express, we're continuing to grow the business by broadening the aperture and reaching new creators and stakeholders that will power the world's content. We continue to drive strong growth for Document Cloud. Again, you see this in sustained revenue growth with ARR growing even faster, as the business shifts to being increasingly subscription based, with approximately 90% of Document Cloud revenues in FY 2021 now being subscription. The main Document Cloud growth driver continues to be new user acquisition. We're seeing strong growth of Acrobat on adobe.com across geographies, growth on the web, as well as in mobile, and seed expansion in the enterprise. PDF and doc that workflows are mission critical to the way people work and collaborate in the digital first world. As Anil mentioned earlier, there's tremendous growth opportunity within our cohort of large customers. As we focus on cross-selling and moving them along the maturity curve towards the transformational adoption of our entire platform instead of customer experience management solutions. The average ARR and total contract value of our largest customers demonstrate how massive this opportunity is. And we grow by adding new logos to our customer base and then expanding within those accounts, a multiyear journey. As impressive as this company's track record is, I believe there's even more growth ahead of us. I fundamentally believe there's a trillion-dollar market cap opportunity in Adobe's future, having crossed the $15 billion mark in revenue, what is the path to $30 billion look like? And then from there, how are we going to get to $45 billion? It starts with an estimated $205 billion TAM, and a huge ecosystem that we built around our market leading products and services. How are we going to get there? We're going to continue to broaden our appeal to a wider universe of customers, engage and retain our current customers across all geographies. We're also going to grow by innovating and investing to enter new categories that further complement and expand our growth trajectory and better enable our customers in the digital era. When we execute on that strategy over the next decade, our scale and success, we'll put Adobe in a class that only a few software companies have achieved. Having passed the $15 billion revenue mark, we're going to start reporting revenues in constant currency given the potential impact of foreign exchange movements. Following the year in which FX was a tailwind to reported revenues. The recent U.S. dollar strength is expected to result in a headwind to our reported revenue and growth rates for fiscal year 2022. Consistent with our annual practice, we've revalued our digital media ARR balance to account for the movements and the FX rates. For operating expenses, we continue to save on travel and facilities in fiscal year 2021. While many of our employees continue to work from home, we expect these expenses to ramp throughout FY 2022. We also plan to invest in increasing headcount in integrating Frame.io. We believe these are critical investments and we're making -- we believe these are critical investments we're making and we're going to focus relentlessly on the organic growth opportunities ahead Lastly, fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year with an extra week in Q1. That week added approximately to $267 million of revenue and $25 million of net new digital media ARR the math around the return to a 52-week fiscal year is expected to be a two-point headwind on our full-year, FY'22 growth rates and a seven-point headwind in Q1. Here's Adobe's fiscal year 2022 annual targets. We show our segment growth targets on an actual and adjusted basis and constant currency factoring for the additional week last year : Total Adobe revenue of approximately $17.9 billion, net new digital media ARR of approximately $1.9 billion, digital media segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year, or 17% on an adjusted basis, digital experience segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis, digital experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 16% year-over-year or 19% on an adjusted basis, tax rate of approximately 17.5% on a GAAP basis and 17% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $10.25 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $13.70. For Q1 of fiscal 2022, we're targeting revenue of approximately $4.23 billion. Net new digital media ARR of approximately $400 million, digital media segment revenue growth of approximately 8% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis, digital experience segment revenue growth of approximately 11% year-over-year or 18% on an adjusted basis, digital experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 20% on an adjusted basis, tax rate of approximately 16% on a GAAP basis and 17% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.63 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.35. I want to conclude by sharing what this company has achieved over the last four years, whether it's revenue growth and profitability, outstanding cash flow generation and shareholder returns, Adobe's track record demonstrates why this company is in a class of its own. I firmly believe that our best days are ahead. Thanks so much for your time today. I'm going to now pass it back to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you, Dan. And thanks and welcome Ann, Anil and David for outlining the opportunities across our three industry leading clouds. As I said earlier, I'm incredibly excited about Adobe's future and our ability to not only lead, but also create new categories. I think if you zoom out a little bit and think about it from a macro perspective, all over the world, it's clear that digital is empowering individuals, transforming businesses and connecting communities. And frankly, digital is going to play a much bigger role in work, life and entertainment going forward. We've seen the rise of the creator economy and the democratization of creativity. Work and education are now hybrid and here to stay in that form. Cloud and web technology advances are powering unprecedented levels of real time collaboration. Document workflows are increasingly going to be automated. And most important mandate for a digital business is more urgent than ever before, as customers now expect digital first experiences that are both contextual as well as personalized. E-commerce growth is building on the record highs achieved during the pandemic. From a technology base, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become indispensable facilitators of our daily lives. And so I think in short, digital technologies are enabling more people to create, collaborate, learn, work, be productive, and make a living than ever before. I love our mission and the ability to change the world through digital experiences, puts us as the nexus of all of these trends. We're incredibly well positioned to drive meaningful impact across every aspect of society and that'll benefit billions of people around the world for years to come. As we think about the company at Adobe, we believe it's not just what we do, but it's also how you do that it really matters. From the very beginning, John Warnock and Charles Geschke, our founders committed to building a company that does the right thing. And the sense of purpose has guided our evolution and growth over the past four decades. I think we're all witnessing the shift in the role that companies have to play in social issues and the expectations that stakeholders and investors have for corporations. As you reflect on how companies have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, it's remarkable. With that stakeholders around the world are looking to the private sector to become more active in social issues. And people are making decisions on the products that they buy and the places that they work based on where companies stand. As our products have become ubiquitous, and we've helped many more companies harness the transformative power of our digital technologies, our responsibility and our commitment to corporate citizenship has also grown dramatically. And I believe that the issues on which Adobe is uniquely positioned to make an impact are on Adobe for all, making sure we create a diverse and inclusive culture for our employee, as well as position that for our customers and partners .On the belief that technology will transform, and in addition to providing technology, we have a responsibility to understand what that means. And I think most important to being able to allow everyone who has a story to tell their story, the notion of creativity for all. The reality is that we've been leaning into these for several areas already. And our efforts are making a real impact across the company and our customer communities for many years. But I think it's this purpose that motivates our employees to focus on having more impact and frankly inventing the future. I love the fact that our strategy has remained relatively consistent for the past decade. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all to accelerate document productivity and to power digital businesses is more mission critical than ever before. I think most companies would be thrilled frankly, to have one of these growth opportunities. And we're fortunate that we have three businesses that are absolutely in the sweet spot of where the world needs technology to play a more important role. We have the right strategy. It's applied to an exceptional and growing opportunity. And so we're no way opportunity constrained. I'm going to end with how I started. I believe that Adobe is uniquely positioned to drive the next decade of growth. We have a proven capability to create and lead categories and we're always looking around the corner to the whitespace that exists that will provide new opportunities for Adobe. We're thinking bigger about every part of our business, how we scale and how we expand the customers that we serve. We continue to focus on innovation, delivering leading products, services, and platforms as we leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning. We're continuously thinking about innovating in business models as well to rapidly deliver more value to a larger set of customers to capitalize on global growth opportunities, and to enable new monetization models that are emerging. And at the end of the day, our technologies support a vibrant and growing ecosystem of partners that create, customize and extend our solutions to meet the unique needs of our joint customers. But at the end of the day, our greatest asset as being an intellectual property company and what's truly driving our growth is our highly engaged global employee base, over 25,000 strong to whom I'm eternally grateful. Thank you again for joining us today. I believe 2021 was a fantastic year, and we clearly expect that momentum to continue in 2022 and beyond. As we look forward to our 40th anniversary next year, Adobe stands in an enviable position, an impressive track record of innovation, category and brand leadership, great financial performance and multiple growth opportunities. Coupled with the expanding market opportunity, the depth of our technology platforms, and the motivated employee base, I certainly believe that Adobe's best days are ahead of us. And with that, we'll roll a video while we assemble the management team for our Q&A. [Advertisement] Okay, are we on for Q&A? Great, I know we're on for Q&A. Before we get started, let me introduce two other members of the Executive team who are also here with us to answer the questions that you might have. Gloria Chen, our Chief Human Resources Officer, who has also run strategy in the past, as it relates to any questions that people have about the pandemic, or what we are doing with our global employee base, how do we continue to make sure we ensure that we have the best talented and motivated employees, and Scott Belsky, our Chief Product Officer of Creative Cloud, frankly, the visionary behind all of the great innovation that we're delivering across desktop, mobile collaboration, including the new web related functionality that we showed at MAX as well as what we did with Creative Cloud Express. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan to help navigate the Q&A. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, Shantanu. So, we've shared a lot of information today, you can clearly see the team's enthusiasm around the growth opportunity ahead. Now, we'd like to go ahead and take your questions. So for folks who are on the phone, if you haven't already done so, please go ahead and queue up for questions. Quick reminder, we do ask that each of you limit yourself to just one question per person that'll allow us to get through as many people as possible. And with that, I'd like to go to the operator. Operator, could we go ahead and take the first question, please? Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] First question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, folks, thanks for taking my question here, and congrats Anil and David on the promotion, and welcome, Dan. Dan Durn : Thank you. Saket Kalia : Maybe the question is -- maybe to start us off, I'd love if we can address the digital media net new ARR in the quarter, particularly within Creative. I think, Dan, you had mentioned that we hadn't seen spikes that maybe as high as we've historically seen around Cyber Monday and Black Friday. I was wondering if the team could just go in a little bit deeper into the result versus the guide, and then maybe comment on the competitive backdrop within Creative specifically? Shantanu Narayen : Why don't I start with that, Saket, and then I'll certainly have others add. I mean, as we look at the Digital Media ARR accomplishment over the quarter, firstly, it was record quarter as well as it was a record year. And when we think about what our Digital Media guide was, I mean, we certainly expected Frame to close in the quarter, and it closed pretty early in the quarter. And so what we do is, we think about a range of outcomes and what that might do. And certainly we wanted to focus on Frame as well, but it was probably not explicitly factored into the quarter. When you consider it from different customer segments, the Team business actually performed really well right through the quarter. And so, the Teams is offering and the strength in the small and medium business was great. Enterprise, we actually actively redirected and pivoted the team to think about video and Frame and how we were continuously selling it, as I said, it closed early in the quarter. And so, Enterprise had the traditional Q4 strength as well, that we normally expect. The individual demand was actually fairly strong right through the year. As Dan mentioned, maybe the one slight change is that as you think about what's happening with online shopping, while we continue to see demand up into the right, we perhaps did not see as much of the spike, as you would have perhaps seen traditionally in either the Black Friday or the Cyber Monday weeks. But apart from that, strength and demand continues to be strong. And clearly, we factored that into our guidance for fiscal 2022, which is the strongest ARR guide that we've ever guided to. I think as it relates to the product and the differentiation, maybe I'll have Scott touch on that, and then David can certainly speak to other issues of the business. Scott Belsky : Sure. In terms of product differentiation for Creative Cloud, I mean, what a year we had. We delivered some of the mind-blowing Adobe Magic throughout our actual Pro products, neuro filters in Photoshop, for example, a lot of the collaboration features and we really made a proclamation that Creative Cloud going forward will be as much about collaboration, as it is about Creativity, which if you think about it invites many more stakeholders of Creativity into the fold. And that's where we're seeing across all of our enterprise as well as small businesses. Everyone wants to be a stakeholder and have a say and be able to jump in and give feedback. And so we're building our products for the future to enable that. I also want to mention, of course, last week you launched Creative Cloud Express, this is just the start of an amazing new chapter for us. We've had a number of products in the market in our incubation zone. We call it as we learn about how to really fulfill our mission of creativity for all. And now we've galvanized all of the learnings, all of the signals. And we just couldn't be more excited about the new journey we're on here with that product in particular. David Wadhwani : And I'm happy to add a little bit more from the business perspective as well, all the innovation that Scott's talked about and has been driving. One of the big things that you have to recognize is that it's really what's driving the TAM growth that Ann talked about earlier, both in terms of expanding the base of people we can access with something like Creative Cloud Express, and also increasing the value that we're providing to our Creative Pro base. So, as you start looking at, where we're going with the business, we're building on the momentum, as we talked about, we had almost $2 billion of net new ARR added in FY'21, we had our strongest guide ever and it's really on the back of that. One more thing with regard to Creative Cloud Express and how that will start to drive opportunity for us, it can start by actually adding a lot of new users to the franchise, one of the things that we've been doing a phenomenal job with and I think this expands is bringing new users to Adobe, getting them successful with what they're doing, and then start to mature them up the value curve into Creative Cloud subscription or now Creative Cloud Express subscription, but we're also making this available to all Creative Cloud customers. This is something that we see a lot of Creative Cloud customers occasionally want speed and content first development. For those users, we see the opportunity to really drive higher engagement and retention, even beyond where we already are. And then as you start to have more plans that are separated for the kinds of things people want to do, it gives us the opportunity to drive more price optimization across the lines as well. So we're very excited about where we're heading and what this really adds to the mix we have. Saket Kalia : Got it. Thanks very much, guys. Very helpful. Operator : And our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll go a little bit more directions, we're getting a lot of questions from investors. If I look at the guide, if I look at the performance of Digital Media era for, and we assume the Frame.io was not in the guide, it\u2019s the first time, I think ever that you've actually not outperformed your guidance for the quarter. And so I realized that there definitely were some issues in Q4 that may have impacted that. So, just give us a sense of mix like what it was, now let's look back and you had looked back at the COVID impacts those in the first half, second half, the holiday season, how should we think about the confidence in your guide for next year vis-\u00e0-vis your historical cadence or historical pattern and seasonality? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Alex, I mean I'll take that. And if you think about it, first, as you know, people who've covered us for a long time, we take our guidance very seriously. And let me maybe roll back a little bit to what we accomplished in 2020 and then how we guided for 2021. As you know, we guided a little bit below what our 2020 guidance was, in 2021, when we started, and we certainly outperformed that guidance as it relates to digital media ARR accomplishment in 2021. And if you look at how we've guided for 2022, it's actually a little bit closer to our 2021 guide, as a starting point. And so clearly, we continue to be incredibly optimistic associated with the underlying strength of the business, the overall need for creativity just continues. We don't believe in any way, shape, or form there was sort of pull-ins and I know that sort of exists for other companies, we just continue to see secular strength. And some of the new initiatives that we have underway. I mean, we really pivoted the team to be thinking about enterprise and video, we have Creative Cloud Express, the usage is going to build dramatically, we already have the largest communicator business, I think among the Creative community. So, we're incredibly optimistic about how that business looks. And then if you look at it from a quarterization perspective, again, let's just go back and look at what we guided in Q1 of 2021, as you know, when we guided to a number we were factoring in the $24 million that we outlined was an additional part of what we accomplished as part of the 13 versus 14-week. And so if you look at it, it's very much in line. In other words, the trends of the business continue and the optimism in the business continues. So that's how I would think about it, Alex. Alex Zukin : That's super helpful, and maybe just one for Anil on CDP, the last time we talked about the CDP products, I think you talked about being surpassing the $100 million in ARR margins, clearly [indiscernible] from your commentary sounds like perform really, really well. And really, it broke down for the entire digital experience. Where are we with that business today, if there's any way to dimensionalize work for the project from an ARR perspective? Anil Chakravarthy : We see a lot of momentum, the market clearly customers looking at us and saying they have the right vision. And we have the right product to really think about a range of use cases that's supported by the Adobe Experience platform, and we've done a really nice job of integrating our applications with the Adobe Experience platform, so that you are able to populate the data from our analytics platform, and then use the data for activation across all kinds of channels. So, in terms of scale, in terms of performance, in terms of the range of use cases, data governance, et cetera, it's really enterprise ready right now. And enterprises are beginning to see that this is at the heart of their Digital Experience and their digital customer engagement. So we feel like we're in a really good place right now with that. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : Up next, we will hear from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Excellent, thank you guys for taking the questions. I want to dig a little bit into I think David, you started getting into this with the positioning of Express and how we should think about that. How does the Express positioning relate to kind of what you guys were trying to do with Spark and those mobile offerings in terms of an entry ramp? Is it kind of in between those two? To what extent should we think about this as defensive to some of the emerging competitors that are ramping up in the marketplace? And is there any risk of downshifting of the existing Creative Cloud customers, who need a lighter weight solution. Now here is a cheaper offering if you will. Is there any potential that you can see some downshifting within the base of people trying to price optimize there, or to the contrary, does this allow you to sort of pull price up on the core Creative Cloud? You just help us with those kinds of questions on the positioning around the portfolio now? Shantanu Narayen : Okay. Maybe I'll start, Keith, and then David, certainly you can add to it. If you take a step back, I think this just speaks to the enormous opportunity that exists for creators. And if you look at our offerings already today, Keith, I mean, we have an incredible diversity of offerings. We have Photoshop Express on mobile that's doing great as it relates to the ARR. And we have the Creative Cloud product that also allows now the substance 3D products, that's probably the most expensive. And so I think with online and our DDOM, we now have absolutely the ability to target and personalize our offerings against a broader set of customers and to make sure that we make it all net positive and net from a customer satisfaction as well as a net positive from the ARR that we accomplish. A couple of other things, I mean, first, our creative business with the Communicator segment is already the largest creative business in the world. I mean, when you think about what's happening with Photoshop or Lightroom or the express set of products, and I think what express really does is it actually adds value to every single Creative Cloud subscriber. I mean, they are Creative Cloud subscribers, who are incredibly proficient in video, who sometimes want to do a quick flyer associated with it. And so I think this brings more and more and more people into the fold. It's similar frankly to what we've done with the Document Cloud, where when you think about what's happening with this organic demand that we've created for PDF. And so net, net, I think it's a creative, and then I'll hand it over to David to speak specifically about how this might roll out, but it is actually an enabler for us, and it unifies frankly all of the different creative offerings that we've already had for the Communicator segment. David Wadhwani : Yes. Just adding to that, we look at this as a really pivotal moment in terms of our ability to fulfill a need that we know our customers have. If you think back to what we talk talked about earlier, we have 400 million IDs that have been created on mobile devices already. We have 600 million monthly active users across our Digital Media products that are not creative professionals. And Creative Cloud Express represents an opportunity to give all of them something that we can onboard them in an effective way. As Shantanu also talked about, one of the things that we find really exciting about this is that our Creative Cloud base as well is looking for sometimes often they're looking for the power and precision of our creative flagship applications, but sometimes they just want a velocity driven content first creative, creation model two. And by giving Creative Cloud Express to most of our Creative Cloud plans, we expect to drive even higher engagement and retention there. And the last thing I want to say is that this fundamentally expands how we think about our go to market motion. And we have talked for the last many years about our data driven operating model and how that drives our ability to pull and acquire users bring them into our acquisition funnels with product led growth because of our increasing investment in mobile and web, we have the ability to do a lot more quick iteration and optimize the user journeys, so that conversion of that 600 million mile into paid and premium customers and engagement with them continues. And the last thing I will say is that, I don't think you can look at this market as you've got non-professionals and professionals. We have a lot of non-professionals that really want to use the power and precision of Creative Cloud. And so we look at this as this ongoing seamless journey from the first time you come in, you want to do something with creative expression, you can do it for free with Creative Cloud Express. We then move you up that chain. So you have the premium content and availability of the premium features and content and Creative Cloud Express paid plan. And then we see people are able to actually move all the way up to the power and precision of Creative Cloud. So it's really a seamless end-to-end journey. Keith Weiss : Got it. Is that what you were talking about when you mentioned price optimization? Is it just having more tiering within that pricing? David Wadhwani : Yes, certainly. Keith, so we've talked about price optimization being it. I mean, for the first time as you saw with the 3D products, we did not included as part of Creative Cloud all applications because of the value. But certainly I think as we get a better feel for all of the different offerings that we have, there are some offerings that are probably under-priced relative to the value that they're providing. But our focus just continue be attract more people to the platform and deliver more product value. Scott, we would add something on Creative Cloud? Scott Belsky : No, I was just going to say, I mean, I think David, you covered certainly the opportunity for Creative Cloud Express for the broader franchise. But one of the very exciting things that we've learned over the last few years is a really around the distinct customer needs that we're just not covered frankly by Spark or Photoshop Express other things we were doing or other kind of competitive tools out there. And I just wanted to share a few of those because I think they're really relevant. I mean, first of all, we're seeing a lot of these customers that come in, wanting to make something with a template, they want to be able to go further. So our product team is actually very excited about the prospect of a customer being able to make something and then take it to the next level using one of our more pro-ish applications like Photoshop or Illustrator, also the desire for artificial intelligence. A lot of customers come in from small businesses, etc, and they have an idea of what they want to make, but they want some assistance and making something remarkable. They want fonts to be recommended to them. They want colors that will perform better on social media. And so we have an opportunity to do that. And then finally, the idea of a multimedia editor was another really important insight for us in the development of Creative Cloud Express. Because what we learned is that while a lot of customers come in through the top of the funnel, because they want to make a flyer, they want to edit a video, they want to edit an image. When they come in, they actually realize, I'll add some animation. Maybe I'll add some sound. And before you know it, it's a multimedia creation. And so we're very much building Creative Cloud Express not just for where the customer is now, but where we see the market going, people are going to want to stand out with their media. And that's something that I believe Adobe can uniquely deliver with this product. Keith Weiss : Outstanding. Super helpful, guys. Thank you. Operator : Up next, we'll hear from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much. No, I was wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the strength you're seeing in the enterprise side on the experience cloud front, obviously RPO was really strong. I assume a lot of that strength came from the experience club side. And what continues into next year, because when you look at the fiscal '22 guide, obviously CECL assume some of that's just work front being anniversary, but could you kind of tell us what you're sort of assuming continues in the strengths of business this year, going into next year? Like what has momentum in that business that you feel good about and where are some of the potential points of leverage in terms of upside next year? Thanks. Scott Belsky : Well, we definitely see some of the tailwinds we saw during the pandemic continuing and every company, B2C companies, B2B companies, and companies that are experimenting with new business models, direct-to-consumer for example, they're all starting to invest across the board in digital experience. And we see that play out across all of the categories that are laid out, definitely with one view of the customer, a single view of the customer that carries through the unified profile that we have in the Adobe Experience Platform that is at the heart of all customer engagement. So if you kind of map it to how we think of our DDOM, everything from discover to try, to buy, to use, to renew that whole journey needs a common unified profile, so that you can deliver a consistent experience across all channels. And that's a major investment that all companies are making. And so what we've been able to do is to really take advantage of all of the knowledge we have and the applications we have across all of these areas and populate that data in the Adobe Experience Platform. And that gives us a clear head start for with every company and then say, then opening it up by saying that it is open to developers. The data model is an open data model. It runs on top of a cloud, so that it's horizontally scalable that has really made it something that any enterprise of any size can use, but they can also get started in a particular geography or in a particular business unit or a customer segment and scale from there. So I'm really excited. I think across our categories, we definitely see a lot of strength and more as we now see some of the trends that we've just talked about with the creator economy and so on, that'll continue to add more use cases that'll be built on top of the platform. Shantanu Narayen : And Kirk, if I were to add a little bit more to that, I mean, when you take a step back and think about what we've accomplished, we created the digital marketing category, and we said, there is a much larger opportunity as it relates to this customer experience management, the innovation that went into the building of the experience platform and the unification frankly of everything that analysts talked about, whether it's content and commerce, whether it's data and insights, whether it's the marketing flow associated with work front, which is also doing well. There really isn't another company that enables somebody whether you're the marketer, the Chief Revenue Officer, the Chief Digital Officer to very quickly say, I want to get all my data, whether it's online or offline into one particular place and even more important to activate it. And so I think from my perspective, the momentum associated with having this unified platform and you can get customers really up and running so rapidly, that's pretty amazing. The second thing I would say is that we've done a really good job with the Digital Strategy Group, as well as what Anil had outlined earlier about these transformative accounts. And so, again, as we shared in the data, the ability to sell multiple solutions, the ability to upsell, the ability to co-sell, I think that's also gives us a lot of confidence, but now we have the platform, we have the apps and services on it. We have the AI associated with it, and I think if you take a step back, there isn't a company that doesn't want to talk to us about (a), Adobe, how did you do it? And (b), how do we really make sure that we can get this up and running and activated faster? So, I really hope in 2022, you'll see how we make increasing progress in terms of not only just the selling, but the provisioning and frankly the value realization and I think we've done a good job on that front as well under Anil's leadership. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Operator : All right. Up next, we'll hear from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter and the year. I'd like to drill in a little bit, because I'm getting a lot of questions obviously. Dan following up on your prepared presentation, you discussed how subscription is sustained 24% growth. And when you look at the overall guidance, I'd like you to help us better unpack what the opportunities that are impacting for you are specifically your Digital Media side and then also on the experience side. Also, can you give us any sense on how much you are figuring FX via headwinds in ARR and revenue, I'd much appreciate it. Dan Durn : Sure. Thanks for the question. I think the best place to start is underlying performance of the business. I think we're exposed to great market opportunities; company's got the right strategy performing well against those strategies. As we think about performance in the current environment, against that backdrop of good performance. We want to strip out noise in the one year look ahead, set of numbers and I think there's two things that we point to when we separate the noise from what's been communicated. First is FX, second is the extra 53 week versus 52 week. And so, let's go one layer deep in each of those. As we think about the 53 versus 52. Week, that's about a 2% add or to growth for the overall company in fiscal '21. And as we window into fiscal '22, that's going to be about a two-point headwind because that extra week occurred in Q1 and you look at Q1 FY '22. It's about a seven-point headwind from just that one extra week alone as we look along quarter forward. As we take a look at FX and we think about the currency moves not surprisingly, FX for our business over 2021 also added about a two-point tailwind from a growth perspective, broadly speaking across the business. As we look forward into the next year, it creates about a one-point headwind given the recent moves that we've seen over the last couple of weeks, I'm sorry, last couple months of the dollar strengthening versus a variety of currencies around the globe. That gives you a sense of the magnitude of the moves from both of those two factors as we extract underlying performance from a bit of the noise we see, if we were to go to one click further down and take a look at how both of those factors affect the Digital Media business versus the Digital Experience business. I would say from the 52 versus 53 week dynamic, you'll see more of that upside and more of that headwind from a growth standpoint, impacting the DME business, then you do the DX business, but it's just a slight difference between the two businesses, depending on how we engage commercially with our customers. And I can go into that a little more detail, if you'd like. On the FX side, you see a similar dynamic, you see slightly accentuated performance to the upside and downside tailwind and headwind from FX on the Digital Media business than you do on the DX business. It's a slight change, but you see a slight bias to the upside and downside of DME versus DX. I think that unpacks the numbers and gets to the true underlying performance of the company. And as you take a step back and look at how our businesses have performed over the last couple years, you'll see what we've just guided is about in line with where we've been for the last couple years. So again, the company continues to perform pretty well. Shantanu Narayen : And maybe Mark, I'll just add a couple of things to that. First is, as Dan tells me, which is first welcome to the big leagues. And so, I guess when you're $15 billion of revenue, it's neither practical and it's frankly too expensive to hedge all the FX exposure that you were accustomed to maybe we're doing, so if you strip out that FX part and if you think about ARR, just very tactically to be clear. What we do is, we have an ARR at the beginning of the year with the strength of the dollar in November, you could argue it's the hardest compare on a pure FX, and then we both devalue the beginning book of business on ARR. And then we're using that dollar rate for the ARR for the quarter, and so then again, if you think about it, at a $1.9 billion guide that we have for ARR. Clearly, the underlying strength of business and the units that is not what's impacting the business, so, just I think that's the other way that I unpack what was the impact of FX, as well as to specifically tell you how we take the dollar rate at the beginning of the year for the ARR calculation. Mark Moerdler : That's extremely helpful. I really appreciate, Dan, if you don't on the difference between the two businesses. Can you drill it a little bit more why that extra week is so much worse a little bit on digital? Dan Durn : Yes. As you look at how we engage with customers, you engage with customers, through adobe.com and other channels on a daily basis, and you're exposed to every single extra day of that week to the upside and the downside depending on which year you're in. On the DX business, the vast majority of our, not the vast majority -- the majority of our revenues will all get booked on a daily basis, but there are parts of that business that engage with customers on a monthly basis. And as you can imagine when that extra week falls in a month and you engage with customers on a monthly basis, you won't see the upside or the downside on that business. So, on a like-for-like basis, you'll see more of that dynamic flowed into the Digital Media business than you will the DX business. But again, as you think about a two-point tailwind FX in FY '21 and a one-point headwind in FY '22. You're talking about slight separation to the upside and downside, and depending on what year you're in to this dynamic. Mark Moerdler : Perfect. I very much appreciate it. Thank you for the detail. Dan Durn : Yes, you're welcome. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay, thank you for taking the question and thank you for hosting this event. One of your competitors in the Document Cloud space recently cited softening demand and execution issues. Naturally your business is a lot broader than theirs. But have you seen any changes as it relates to customer engagement within Document Cloud? Shantanu Narayen : Gregg, we had a phenomenal quarter and Document Cloud. I think we had record net new ARR $141 million in net new ARR for the Document Cloud. I think the team has done a really good job of integrating that. So maybe I'll have David speak a little bit to how just integrating sign as well into the Acrobat business as one of the verbs is really I think helping really make it more pervasive. David? David Wadhwani : Yes, as Chuck said, we're very excited about the momentum we see in the Document Cloud business as a whole. We have -- we benefit from this incredible reach we have. As I mentioned earlier, between our inside sales folks and our reseller partners, really anyone that has a document need is coming and flowing into our funnel. And then certainly with the benefit of the enterprise selling in the top down, we're able to go and have solution-oriented conversations with them, but one of the key areas that we've been focused on over the last 12 months that has really been productive for us is to leverage our footprint in terms of our desktop applications predominantly things like Reader across mobile, desktop and web and drive awareness and utilization of our services through that. As I mentioned earlier, we saw an 85% year-over-year increase in terms of Adobe Sign transactions that were successfully committed -- completed or initiated in Acrobat and you can expect to see us continue to do that. We want signatures and Adobe Sign to be available to anyone that uses Acrobat going forward and will continue to double down on that strategy. Shantanu Narayen : And may be just one last thing to add on that, Gregg, I mean, one of the exciting things that again, I think the team has done is now this extension that we have in Chrome, as well as what we are doing and we announced the extension of the partnership with Microsoft. So again, I think the distribution of Adobe PDF with all the magic that we have with Liquid Mode and Mobile and Sign, I think that just really enables us given we have the APIs and the developer motions to really even further extend that. But this notion of automating document workflows, it's just going to continue to go up into the right. Gregg Moskowitz : That's terrific. And then, a quick one for Dan, you spoke about FX and the extra week a moment ago. But how much is an increased or more normalized level of T&E expected to impact your operating margins in fiscal '22, how should we think about that? Dan Durn : Yes, so as I think we look into 2022, we in the prepared comments talked about as the world begins to open up, we're going to get on airplanes, we're going to spend time with customers, you'll see some of the facilities costs come back, this is about growing and scaling our business and engaging with customers and solving their highest value problems. So you will see some of those costs come back. And that's reflected in our guide. And so when we take a look at the opportunity in front of us, and we think about the runway for growth, we think about how well we're positioned in each of our respective businesses. And we think about where the world's going and the key enablement role we as a company can play to enable that digitization of the world, we're going to invest for growth, we're going to invest in market leading and defining products. And we're going to continue to lead the way we've done in the past. So you'll see some of that complement the investments we're going to make. And then as you think about the Adobe Experience platform, and you think about Creative Cloud Express, we're going to invest in sales and marketing to grow and scale those businesses globally. So we're going to be oriented to growth. And you'll see that reflected in both the performance and the decision making going forward. Gregg Moskowitz : Great, thank you. Operator : And up next, we'll hear from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Dan, welcome to the team. Just on the margin side, I mean, I think we all understand your margins have gone up 590 basis points in the last three years. So tapping the airbrakes a little bit on margin makes sense. But when you think about the long-term trajectory still for Adobe on the margin, you believe you're capped in the mid-40s, do you still believe long-term, the margins can trend more towards 15, and I have a quick follow-up for Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : I think 60s comes after 50s, Brent. If you're thinking about numbers on that scale, we have as Dan said, such incredible opportunities, and one of the statistics that he showed that was really, hopefully, Brent, and you know us how we think about the businesses, which is we're investing in these long-term really growth rates. But we've been able to do all these acquisitions, and really do a fantastic job of keeping our margin. And so, I think it again is all about the growth opportunity, you know it, we have an unbelievable leverage model. And so the leverage model will demonstrate itself. And if you look at our 2022 targets, it actually continues to show a lot of optimism in what we can do. I think Frame.io is a little dilutive. And again, as he said, some of these things, the Experience Cloud, and what we are doing with getting more Experience Cloud adoption globally, what we are doing around Document Cloud and Creative Cloud and Creative Cloud Express, I mean, we want to make sure that we are spending wisely, Ann is the expert on attribution, not just within the company, but in the world. And so, we'll continue to do it. But we do believe that, and this is the question that you've also asked in the past, which is the value that customers are getting is there an ability to continue to drive higher price offerings, and all of them are there. I mean, we're just excited about all of these different things, but I wouldn't count on 50 anytime soon right now, I'd rather count on accelerated growth, Brent. Brent Thill : Okay, very clear, Shantanu just for the quarter, forget the guide. I think many of the analysts have asked this question, what happened in Q4, and this is not a quarter that we're all used to seeing from you. So from your perspective, is this just the digital digestion from a huge adoption, we've seen the last year is Adobe execution. I don't think it's competitive. But I think many are still asking all of us the question throughout this Analysts Day with the stock down, what happened from your perspective? Shantanu Narayen : Brent, so let me maybe again touch a little bit on the Adobe Digital Index, and then I'll come back to our business. If you look at the Adobe Digital Index, what has clearly happened over the last 12 months, 18 months, even pre-pandemic, but certainly during the pandemic, is this more and more activity happening online. That is a secular trend that's actually not going to change. We see it, there's more energy, there's more traffic, there's more activity associated with what's going online. If you look at what I think a lot of companies are looking at, the traditional spikes that you may have seen, a couple of weeks the Black Friday week or the Cyber Monday week, I think those are maybe a little bit more muted, because it's a little bit more of that traffic, you're seeing actually a steady growth as opposed to those spikes. So, if I take a step back and think about our Digital Media business teams, and the small and medium business, nice performance, if I look at the Enterprise, as I said, traditional close to the quarter, if I look at the individual business, a little bit of those spikes that we would have seen, we did see growth, we did see growth in both of those weeks, but it was perhaps a little bit less than that. And then you're back to again, the secular demand. So as I think about the business, it's not about the long-term demand. It's not about the market leadership of our products, I think it's just a little bit of how maybe online shopping globally has changed a little bit in terms of what the experience is. So that's what I attribute it to and we're back on Q1, look at our guide and let's go execute against the opportunities that we have. So I'll really point to a little bit of those couple of weeks. And it's not just Adobe, it's certainly represented, if you look at the Adobe Digital Index, and what we thought was the growth rate going to be for the entire community and how that got a little muted. So that's the way I would look at it. Brent Thill : Thanks, Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Hey, operator, we're coming up on the top of the hour. Let's take two more questions, please. Operator : Absolutely. Our next question will come from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Brad Sills : Great. Thanks guys for taking the question here. I wanted to double click a little bit on the TAM expansion that you've seen, from your perspective with the core Creative Professional enter the market, I think two years ago, you're $15 billion, now you're forecasting $25 billion, is there a certain persona that you think is driving a lot of that expansion in the TAM, just in the core business versus say a couple of years ago, when you look forward towards the addressable market? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, there are three things that are really driving that first is just, with the increased demand for content, we're seeing more Creative professionals come into the market. So we're seeing the base of people we can sell to as Creative professionals continuing to grow, we also are able to provide more value as people are trying to accelerate the velocity of content, they have to build content more quickly. So, things that Scott and team are doing around the addition of collaboration means that we're able to add more value, the Frame.io acquisition is a great example of that. But we've also added some core new collaborative capabilities to Creative Cloud itself. And third is the emergence of these new content types. We've been all tracking the growth of 3D. But also now with the emergence of the Metaverse, we're starting to see more demand for new types of content. And if you look at the performance of Substance 3D, and the fact that that business as an example grew 100% year-over-year, it shows you that the business and the growth that we're seeing is tracking to the TAM expansion that Ann talked about earlier. Brad Sills : Got it, great. And one more if I could please, with all the effort and work you've done integrating the suite for Experience Cloud between Magento and Core CMS, now you have Workfront, are there different entry points that the enterprise customers are starting within that suite now that you've delivered on a more integrated offering there? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, absolutely. We're starting to see customers who start with commerce. And now they want to have a much better web presence. And they work with us on content management. And they want to focus on marketing agility, and efficiency, and that leads to Workfront. So that's a different entry point that we see now. We also see a number of our customers, as they think especially about different patterns in commerce, B2B commerce, B2B2C commerce, et cetera, they are expanding from the Content Management presence they have with us, and taking us up on our vision of making it a truly shoppable experience. And so that's starting to move in the other direction as well. Brad Sills : Great to hear, thank you so much. Operator : And lastly, we'll hear from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan : The good thing about going last is I've got three minutes. And you're stuck with me for three minutes. I'm kidding. I'll try to make this. I'll kind of make this brief. Shantanu and Dan, I was intrigued by your comment that you plan to double the size of the company to $30 billion and beyond that to $45 billion. And dovetailing that to Shantanu's observations that you're looking to accelerate, as opposed to go for margin expansion, which is great. And with that construct in mind, certainly when I look at your guidance, it doesn't suggest any deceleration but maybe a little bit of conservatism if anything. If you could just talk about the levers in your business, Shantanu, that could cause the company to better than expected or downside levers as well for fiscal '22 that would be great. But more longer term, you look at Metaverse, constant Metaverse and how Satya Nadella talks about the equivalent of Metaverse on the business side how we work, combination of virtual presence. The outlines of view of the word that is fairly compelling. I'm curious how you have thought about, how Adobe is positioned for that word the Metaverse in the consumer context and enterprise virtual work context as laid out by Satya? Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Well, thanks for the question, Kash, and before I get to the Metaverse, maybe the one thing we didn't quite cover is if you look at the big trends that people are talking about cash, the one thing we're maybe not in is EVs and batteries, right? So that's perhaps the one area of digital that Adobe is still not really involved in. As I think about web 3D, and as I think about the Metaverse, what it really means and implies is that things that you are accustomed to doing in the physical world, increasingly more and more of that you're going to do in the virtual world. And so if you think about it that way, whether, you're doing shopping, whether you're playing games, whether you are co-creating with other people, whether you're expanding it. The aspect of creating all of that Metaverse was what better company in the planet than Adobe to be able to do that. So that's at one dimension, which is this exponential need for content is only going to increase. I think the other way I think about what's happening in the Metaverse. And if you think about it from that point of view is, where prior only physical goods in creativity were deemed worthy of buying. I think now even all these virtual goods are going to have a value associated with it. And so when you think about what's happening with NFD and block chain, again, Adobe, I think is incredibly well positioned. We've already demonstrated some leadership in that with what we've done in Photoshop. And so I think the commerce aspects associated with not just large businesses and we've talked about the large businesses, but even individual businesses, I think Adobe is uniquely positioned. I think like that Adobe is probably a little bit more conservative than others in order to, in terms of putting it directly in our forecast for the year, but make no mistake. I mean, we are thinking about how these new opportunities, the fact that, we bought a 3D company a while ago, the fact that we have Aero, and we're working with all of the OS provider in terms of thinking about augmented reality and virtual reality. We're absolutely in the middle of it. We're not just counting it in terms of what happens in terms of revenue of the top. But if you take even more of a step and go to your question associated with how do we think about the opportunity? I will actually say, Kash, as we were all preparing as a group to prepare this. We had so much material and we were talking about how do we try and condense it. So I really hope you look at what Jonathan forced us to do, which is the deck has much more information in it. We were trying to really provide sort of abstract of all of that material. And I think it just reflects the interest that we have. I mean all three of our businesses and let's go maybe digital experience. We've been talking about that for a while and you're seeing just some tremendous adoption of our solutions in that. Digital is only going to go up and to the right. And I think Adobe is incredibly well positioned. The real-time customer data platform, the experience platform, how we've unified our products, it actually reminds me of the really heavy lifting that we did many years ago in what we did on our content creation tools with the unified profiles and the data and insights to deliver value to our customers. So, it feels really good. I think what we are doing around Document Cloud on the web across surfaces, PDF, liquid mode in terms of the AI, we're really spending a lot of time thinking about how businesses are going to automate, what it means to have a hybrid work environment, which is clearly a trend and really making sure that we unify that with respect to our innovation, so really fantastic job by the teams there across all surfaces. And certainly Creative Cloud, the heritage of the company, this notion of everyone who has a story to tell, I actually tend to think of it as the webs now come alive, the web come alive. And perhaps one of the things we didn't talk about, the biggest asset even on the web is Adobe's file formats. So the ability to deal with a Photoshop file format, the ability to deal with Illustrator for logos, the ability to deal with in design, if you want to create these flyers and actually for the creative community to participate in this massive community that's being created, we've done all the heavy lifting that now makes that magic possible. And we have a broader set of offerings than ever before in terms of being able to target people wherever you are in the world, we have pricing flexibility and we have a DDOM that allows us to do it. So I just take us step back and look at it and say, you know what? Adobe is really uniquely positioned. We have a fabulous team. We didn't talk enough about that, certainly my colleagues here and Dana, who is not on the stage, but our GC is an executive team, as well as the 25,000 employees. Don't take for granted what we have in terms of this motivated stuff. And so I just look at it and say, \"We're focused on top line growth to the questions that Brent and others ask.\" We're always going to be focused on making sure that we have profitable growth and focus on the margin as well. But I feel just uniquely excited about the opportunities that we have. The one thing I miss is unfortunately we're not altogether. And please stay safe. Stay healthy during this holiday season. I think that's the really important thing, but as a management team and as an employee base, I could not be more excited about the future that Adobe has. And so, thank you very much all of you for joining us virtually and thank you for the team for all of the work that went into the preparation. Have a nice day.",

Reconciliations between the two are available in our earnings release and on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before I discuss our Q1 results, I want to acknowledge the horrifying and heartbreaking crisis in Ukraine. The pain and suffering of millions of innocent civilians is incredibly tragic and our thoughts and prayers are with the Ukrainian people. Adobe joins the global community in taking a stand by stopping all new sales of our products and services in Russia. The Adobe Foundation has made grants to aid humanitarian relief efforts. I am proud of how our teams have come together and continue to successfully manage our business throughout the most challenging of times while focusing on delighting customers and the long-term growth initiatives for the company. Adobe has always had a strong purpose-driven culture and that has never been more evident than it is today. Adobe\u2019s mission to change the world through digital experiences is more critical than ever before. Everywhere we look, whether it is in entertainment, education or the enterprise, content is fueling the global economy. The democratization of creativity, emergence of new ways to work and learn from anywhere and the business mandate for personalized customer experiences underscore the immense opportunities we have as a company. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is working. Our innovation engine is delivering category-leading products, services and platforms across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. Adobe had a strong Q1. We achieved a record $4.26 billion in revenue, representing 17% year-over-year growth on an adjusted basis. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $2.66 and non-GAAP earnings per share, was $3.37. In our Digital Media business, we drove strong growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, achieving $3.11 billion in revenue. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $418 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q1 grew to $12.57 billion. In our Experience Cloud business, we built on our Q4 momentum, achieving $1.06 billion in revenue, and subscription revenue was $932 million for the quarter. I am pleased to have David Wadhwani, President, Digital Media; and Anil Chakravarthy, President, Digital Experience, on this call to share more about our momentum in the Digital Media and Digital Experience businesses, respectively. David? David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu and hello everyone. The acceleration to all things digital has made content and creativity more important than ever before. Everyone needs to express themselves digitally, from the individual on social media to the student creating a more compelling school project to the creative professional making the next marketing campaign. The rapid rise of the creator economy is giving individuals, solopreneurs and small business owners the opportunity to monetize their passions, their products and their services. Creative Cloud is catalyzing these trends and fulfilling our vision for Creativity For All, enabling customers of every skill level to create content that stands out. We continue to lead in core creative categories such as imaging, design, video and illustration. And we\u2019re advancing new media types like 3D and immersive for the emerging metaverse platforms. We\u2019re building applications for every surface and every audience across web, mobile and desktop. And we\u2019re investing heavily in collaboration services that are deeply integrated into our flagship applications. Our new web-based solutions enable us to deliver value more quickly and broadly than ever before. Creative Cloud solutions are powered by Adobe Sensei, our AI engine, which enables customers to work faster and smarter. As a result, our creative community has never been stronger. Behance now has nearly 30 million members, and we continue to host hundreds of on-demand and live sessions weekly that serve as a source of learning and inspiration. As a result, in Q1, we achieved net new Creative ARR of $315 million and revenue of $2.55 billion, which grew 16% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Q1 highlights include the launch of Creative Cloud Express, our new template-driven web and mobile product that makes it easy for anyone to create and share beautiful content. Its zero-friction onboarding will bring millions of small business owners, social influencers and students into the Creative Cloud family and empower them to create everything from social posts to marketing materials. Creative Cloud Express features thousands of gorgeous templates, millions of stunning stock images and videos and the world\u2019s most complete collection of fonts. Its easy-to-use interface is continuously expanding with innovation such as enhanced search capabilities for millions of assets and new PDF Quick Actions that enable users to edit, convert, combine and organize PDFs. While we\u2019re just a few months into our journey, we\u2019re seeing strong traffic, millions of monthly active users and high customer satisfaction. On the video front, the explosive demand for video content shows no signs of abating. In Q1, we launched new AI-powered innovations in Premiere Pro that help merge music into video sequences and accelerate transcriptions. We also drove strong growth for Frame.io, the leading video collaboration solution Adobe acquired late last year. Frame had its best quarter ever, closing more deals than in any prior quarter while increasing deal sizes to record levels. As creativity has become a team sport, we will extend our leadership in video collaboration and bring collaboration capabilities to all creative categories. We are also seeing tremendous interest for Substance 3D and our new 3D Modeler beta as brands bring together the physical and digital worlds and begin their journeys to become metaverse-ready. Substance is already being adopted by global brands like Coca-Cola, NASCAR and NVIDIA for marketing and e-commerce. Finally, we continue to see strong demand for Creative Cloud offerings globally across all segments : individuals, SMBs, teams and enterprises with key wins at Disney, the FAA, IBM, ING Bank, Kohl\u2019s and the New Mexico Public Education Department. On the Document Cloud side, digital documents have become the foundation of how businesses run and will continue to gain significance as hybrid work becomes the standard. Adobe is accelerating document productivity with Document Cloud, enabling all capabilities, including editing, converting, sharing, scanning and signing to be frictionless across web, desktop and mobile. PDFs are getting smarter and more accessible through our continued investment in AI and ML. And we\u2019re enabling new workflows through our APIs by empowering developers to build customized digital document experiences for their businesses. In Q1, we achieved record revenue of $562 million and net new Document Cloud ARR of $103 million. Ending ARR for Document Cloud crossed the $2 billion mark, which represents 29% year-over-year growth. Q1 highlights include strong growth in Adobe Sign, driven by unifying e-signature functionality in Acrobat and new Sign integrations with Adobe Commerce and Workfront. On the web, we continue to see a high volume of searches for document actions such as editing, converting and sharing PDFs. As a result, Acrobat Web\u2019s contribution to the business has nearly doubled year-over-year. On mobile, we saw billions of Acrobat mobile PDFs opened in Q1. This usage, combined with our efforts to convert users to paid subscribers on mobile, is working. Acrobat mobile ARR grew over 70% year-over-year. And lastly, our Document Cloud enterprise business continues to do well with key wins including Medallia, Mercedes-Benz, Raytheon, Ricoh Europe, Shimizu and UnitedHealth. We have responded to the needs of professionals by adding a broad array of features to our flagship applications across both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. And we\u2019re attracting millions of new users, including a significant number of non-pros, with Acrobat and Creative Cloud Express on web and mobile. Our increasing breadth of offerings not only expand our ability to reach new customers but also enable us to further personalize pricing across our offerings starting later in Q2. I will now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Over the last 2 years, the digital economy has exploded as we have experienced a profound global shift in how we work, learn and play. Telehealth visits are now the norm rather than the exception. Customers and businesses are engaging and transacting digitally. Online shopping is now essential, and the U.S. is on track to surpass $1 trillion in e-commerce sales this year, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index. To succeed, companies must make the digital economy personal with powerful digital experiences that can be personalized to millions of customers in milliseconds. Adobe Experience Cloud is a comprehensive set of integrated AI-driven applications and services to help companies deliver experiences across all aspects of the customer journey. At its core is the Adobe Experience Platform with billions of customer profiles. Our Adobe Experience Cloud applications span the entire customer funnel, from acquisition to monetization to retention, across content and commerce, customer journeys, data insights and audiences and marketing workflow. We have made the dramatic transformation to deliver AI-driven services with over 80% of Experience Cloud customers now using Adobe Sensei, our industry-leading AI and ML framework to power experiences for their customers. Last week, we hosted Adobe Summit, the world\u2019s largest digital experience conference. We launched exciting new Experience Cloud technology and heard from executives from some of the world\u2019s most interesting and innovative brands, including BMW, Nike, Prada, Real Madrid and Walgreens Boots Alliance. We enabled the entire event using Experience Cloud, personalizing the experience for our global attendees. Summit content has had over 22 million views to date, underscoring the significant interest and demand for digital transformation. We continue to drive outstanding growth in our Experience Cloud business. The pandemic has caused brands around the world to realize the critical need for digital transformation. And we\u2019re adding new logos while continuing to focus on driving significant value realization for our existing customers. In Q1, we achieved $1.06 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $932 million for the quarter, representing 22% year-over-year growth on an adjusted basis. Q1 highlights include a slate of exciting product innovations, including new real-time customer data capabilities with the integration of Adobe Real-Time CDP and Adobe Target. Adobe Real-Time CDP is used by a large and growing base of customers such as DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods, Henkel, Panera, Real Madrid, ServiceNow and Verizon; new cross-cloud integrations, including a unified workflow between Workfront, Creative Cloud Enterprise and Experience Manager assets that powers end-to-end content creation and delivery; strong performance in Adobe Experience Manager, emphasizing the need for unified content management to meet the ever-increasing demand for content at speed and scale. Adobe is uniquely positioned to help customers across the content supply chain; new APIs that provide developers with the flexibility to create customized user experiences on top of Adobe Commerce; the general availability of Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare to deliver personalized health care experiences; an expanding partner ecosystem, including a partnership with OneTrust to simplify consent management; the next phase of e-commerce integrations with FedEx, Walmart and PayPal as well as a collaboration with The Weather Company; and key customer wins, including CrowdStrike, Deutsche Telekom, IBM, Jaguar Land Rover, JPMorgan Chase, McDonald\u2019s and UnitedHealth. Our Experience Cloud product innovation, global customer base and vibrant partner ecosystem are driving our continued success. We are executing across our entire go-to-market motion and continue to receive strong industry recognition. This quarter, Adobe was named a leader in 3 industry analyst reports focused on core customer experience management segments, including Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms, the inaugural IDC MarketScape for CDPs for Front Office and the Forrester Wave for Digital Asset Management. Dan, over to you. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Today, I will start by summarizing Adobe\u2019s performance in Q1 fiscal 2022, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I\u2019ll finish with targets for Q2. Adobe\u2019s strong financial results demonstrate the company\u2019s ability to execute in a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Across our business, we are attracting new customers, signing up transformational deals, growing our recurring book of business and seeing emerging businesses ramp and, in some cases, reach escape velocity. We are witnessing the digitization of everything and Adobe\u2019s products offer customers access to a digital future, underpinning how they live and work. Our investment in products, marketing and a data-driven operating model are continuing to drive Adobe\u2019s growth. In Q1, Adobe achieved record revenue of $4.26 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 17% on an adjusted basis. Business and financial highlights included GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.66 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.37; Digital Media revenue of $3.11 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $418 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.06 billion; cash flows from operations of $1.77 billion; RPO of $13.83 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 3.8 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 9% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 or 17% on an adjusted basis. We exited the quarter with $12.57 billion of Digital Media ARR. Global demand for digital content continues to explode. And with the strength of Adobe\u2019s product innovation and our data-driven operating model, our net new Digital Media ARR in Q1 grew on a year-over-year basis after factoring out the additional week in the year-ago period. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.55 billion, which represents 7% year-over-year growth or 16% on an adjusted basis. We added $315 million of net new Creative ARR in the quarter. First quarter Creative growth drivers included strong creative engagement and retention across individual and SMB segments; new customer demand across large organizations, small and medium businesses, driving growth in our Creative Cloud for Teams offering, which was the highest Q1 on record; sustained growth of subscription licensing for individual flagship applications such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere as well as strength in our Adobe Stock business; and enterprise adoption of new collaboration capabilities, including Frame.io as well as our 3D and immersive applications. We are also pleased by the adoption we see in some of our newer initiatives such as Creative Cloud Express, Substance as well as Acrobat, Photoshop and Illustrator on the Web. We are driving strong usage growth and have already attracted millions of monthly active users to our cloud-native offerings. We expect these businesses to be drivers of future ARR and revenue growth. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $562 million, which represents 17% year-over-year growth or 26% on an adjusted basis. We added $103 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter, surpassing $2 billion in ending ARR, growing at 29% year-over-year. Document Cloud continues to be our fastest-growing business, demonstrating that our strategy of accelerating document productivity is working and reflecting how Acrobat and PDF are essential to the way people work in a digital-first world. First quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included customer demand for Acrobat subscriptions, the strongest Q1 on record; new licensing and renewal for Acrobat for Teams offering in the SMB segment, both on adobe.com and through our reseller channel; momentum in Adobe Sign with strong year-over-year growth of Sign transactions within Acrobat; strong demand for our PDF solutions on mobile; and continued momentum with our frictionless onboarding of new customers through Acrobat Web with ARR growing approximately 90% year-over-year. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.06 billion, which represents 13% year-over-year growth or 20% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $932 million, representing 15% year-over-year growth or 22% on an adjusted basis. When we look at the quarterly sequential revenue growth, we continue to see acceleration as our strategy of delivering personalization at scale is resonating with enterprise customers. First quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included new logo acquisition across our solutions; strong customer retention as a result of investments we\u2019ve made in product innovation, greater value realization and customer experience; larger deal sizes in our Workfront business; traction upselling customers to new cloud-native solutions; and momentum with our Content & Commerce, customer data platform and Customer Journey Analytics offerings. In Q1, we continued to increase investments in initiatives that will drive long-term revenue growth, including ramping headcount across R&D and sales capacity. Travel and facilities remained at lower levels in Q1, but we\u2019re increasing facilities utilization and travel in Q2 as we resume in-person meetings with customers and partners. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q1 was 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The tax rate came in higher than expected, primarily due to less-than-expected tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Our trade DSO was 36 days, which compares to 38 days in the year-ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. RPO grew by 19% year-over-year to $13.83 billion exiting Q1, benefiting from enterprise bookings. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.70 billion and cash flows from operations in Q1 were $1.77 billion. We repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares in Q1 at a cost of $2.1 billion. Included in this purchase was the partial settlement of an accelerated share repurchase entered into during Q1 to repurchase shares at an aggregate cost of $2.4 billion. The final number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR will be based on a discount to the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement with the final settlement and delivery of incremental shares to Adobe scheduled to occur in early Q3. These share repurchases are part of the previously announced program, under which we currently have $10.7 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization that was granted in December 2020 and goes through 2024. Before we get to our Q2 targets, I want to discuss the impact of the devastating situation in Ukraine. Earlier this month, Adobe announced the cessation of all new sales in Russia and Belarus. In addition, we\u2019ve made the decision to reduce our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represents all ARR for existing business in these two countries. While we will extend subscriptions automatically in Ukraine during this period and continue to provide Digital Media services, we reduced ARR by an additional $12 million, which represents our entire Ukraine business. This results in a total ARR reduction of $87 million and an expected revenue impact of $75 million for fiscal 2022. The impact toward Digital Experience business is de minimis. For Q2, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $4.34 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $440 million; Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 17% year-over-year or 18% in constant currency; tax rate of approximately 20% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.44; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.30. As a result of the lower-than-expected deductions from stock-based compensation, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 is now targeted to be 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. As we look towards the back half of the year, we expect quarterly sequential revenue and EPS growth in Q3 and Q4. In Digital Media, we expect strong second half ARR performance across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including continued strength of emerging businesses like Acrobat Web, Frame.io, Substance and Creative Cloud Express. In addition, we expect ARR contributions to increase sequentially in Q3 and Q4 from a new offering and pricing structure which starts late in Q2. We expect Digital Experience bookings to show continued momentum in the second half with a traditional strong Q4 finish. We will continue to invest in product innovation, sales capacity, marketing awareness and demand generation given our immense market opportunity. As the world reopens, we expect to increase our travel and facilities expenses. In summary, I\u2019m pleased that Adobe delivered another record quarter in Q1 with sustained growth and world-class profitability. Adobe continues to show its resilience through unprecedented circumstances that all companies face today, and I\u2019m confident we will emerge stronger. We are on track for another year of strong financial performance. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. This is a transformative time at Adobe. We\u2019re engaging with hundreds of millions of customers globally, from individuals to the largest enterprises, launching new applications for new audiences and bringing our flagship category applications to new surfaces and platforms while increasing collaboration capabilities across our solutions. Adobe has a winning strategy applied to an exceptional opportunity. We\u2019re a leader in the digital economy with Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud, which combined have a total addressable market of $205 billion. Few companies can consistently deliver technology innovation, successful transformation across new categories and business models and a broad ever-growing base of customers and partners. I\u2019d like to thank our 26,000 employees for their continued dedication and unwavering focus on delivering customer innovation and inventing the future of digital experiences. Thank you. We will now take questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Curious if you could shed any more color on the new pricing structure and what that means. And Shantanu, beyond Ukraine, is there anything else you\u2019re seeing in the broader economy that\u2019s different than you\u2019ve seen historically? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : So Brent, as it relates to what we have seen first in terms of the macroeconomic situation, we actually continue to see strength. We were pleased with the strong Q1. Certainly, I think the last few weeks of the quarter, you saw some impact in Europe, specifically as it related to what happened in terms of the terrible situation in Ukraine. But I think we continue to see growth around the world. I think on the first one, as you know, and then I\u2019ll have David also add some color, the last major comprehensive overall that we had for our pricing was in 2017. And you\u2019ve seen since then the number of different initiatives that we have and offerings that we\u2019ve introduced, whether it was the 3D offerings, what we\u2019ve done on the web, what we\u2019ve done in mobile, what we\u2019ve done around Creative Cloud Express. So I think it was time to take a very comprehensive look, which David has done. And I think directionally, what I would say is that we want to continue to attract hundreds of millions to the platform, but we also want to get value for the tremendous innovation that we\u2019ve provided. David, maybe you can add a little bit more. David Wadhwani : Yes, happy to. So as Shantanu mentioned, the last pricing update and adjustment we made was in 2017. Since then, we\u2019ve added a lot to our existing offerings. We\u2019ve added new applications. We\u2019ve extended broadly across multiple services. We\u2019ve doubled down on collaboration. We\u2019ve added millions of stock assets and thousands of fonts. And we\u2019ve also introduced new offerings. Obviously, Acrobat across web and mobile has been growing for the last few years, and you heard us talk \u2013 last year or 2, you heard us talk about that in the prepared remarks. But also CCX is now in market across web and mobile. And the early success we\u2019re seeing with these new offerings across web and mobile and across Acrobat and CCX has really been the catalyst for these pricing adjustments that we\u2019re looking at doing. They let us introduce the right value with the right onboarding experience and the right pricing to attract millions of new subscribers. And they provide us the opportunity to right-size the value where engagement and usage is highest in our core existing customer base. The impact of this, we think, for Q2 will be fairly minimal because it takes time to roll this out globally, and it takes time for customers to go through their renewal cycles where their prices change. But we expect it to have a more significant impact and build-out in Q3 and Q4. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hi, guys. So maybe to think \u2013 to ask Brent \u2013 to ask the question a different way, if you think about Adobe has been around for a long time through many business cycles, as we \u2013 as you look at the pipeline of activity for the back half of the year and you think about the \u2013 where \u2013 how investors should think about it in a more recessionary, inflationary environment, can you just give us some color around how you think about the pipeline development, how you think about any changes with respect to the shape of the year and seasonality? And then maybe just a financial question, I think there is just a better understanding of how the mechanics of the NRR are shaping up for Q2. Are you taking that \u2013 is the $440 million, is that guide inclusive of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine adjustment? Is it taken out of the prior year? Just a little bit more context would be helpful? Thank you, guys. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Alex. There were multiple questions in that. So let me \u2013 maybe first, to your point, which I agree with, when you think about the rhythm of the business and maybe the seasonal cadence, clearly, that\u2019s been impacted by whether it\u2019s the external events as it relates to the pandemic or more recently the war in Ukraine. But big picture, as we look at what\u2019s happening in terms of customer adoption, what\u2019s happening in terms of the excitement, there is no question that digital is a tailwind and will continue to be a tailwind. And our perspective is that what happened was the pandemic actually put a spotlight on the importance of everything we\u2019re doing, whether it\u2019s customer engagement, whether it\u2019s content or document productivity. And so as you think about what happens seasonally, certainly, I think we would continue to see strength in Q3 and Q4. Dan referred to that in terms of the second half momentum that we would see. But even Q1, we had a strong start. So from our perspective, some of the seasonal cadence might have changed, but the secular trends in terms of up and to the right, we actually don\u2019t see any impact associated with it. I think your second question is related to what happens specifically on Russia and Belarus and Ukraine. Since the Digital Media ARR, the book of business, we made the decision to reduce it. And so I think what you\u2019ll see on the data sheet is what our exiting Q1 ARR is and then another number which just takes out all of the existing book of business for those three countries. You see the impact on revenue certainly in Q2, Q3 and Q4 because what it means is the revenue that we would have been able to collect. But again, in the grand scheme of things, as you can see, it\u2019s fairly small as it relates to the business. So I think our targets, $440 million specifically, as you said, yes, it\u2019s impacted by the ARR business in those countries. But overall, business is strong and we feel optimistic. I think in many ways, the message really is that the new growth initiatives that both Dan and David talked to, they are starting to really show traction. And so we expect to see strength in the second half of the year and certainly beyond that. Alex Zukin : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, thanks for taking my question here. David, maybe for you. Great to see the Creative Cloud Express launch recently, I guess the question for you is, how do you feel the product differentiates from some of the competition out there? And maybe without going too deep, how do you plan on investing in that product specifically to continue your lead? David Wadhwani : Yes, thanks for the question. We\u2019re very excited about the launch of CCX. But just to up-level for a minute, and as a reminder for everyone on the call, we\u2019ve been talking about the communicator segment for years, both as it relates to non-pros and as it relates to the creator economy. We\u2019ve talked about in the past that our mobile and desktop apps have hundreds of millions of registrations, which is clearly going beyond our Creative Pro base. And we\u2019ve built a significant business. In fact, we believe that we\u2019re the largest provider of creative tools in the world when measured by revenue across all of our segments : pros, communicators and consumers. The introduction of Creative Cloud Express though represents a lot of our learning over the last few years, starting with the business model. It\u2019s a freemium business model. It\u2019s predominantly web and mobile. So it\u2019s zero friction for onboarding customers, and users are seeing success in minutes, not hours. In addition to that, we have an unprecedented library that we bring to Creative Cloud Express. We have 175 million stock images and videos. We have 20,000 fonts, largest font library online available, and thousands of templates that have been really carefully crafted and designed by some of the best creatives in the world. And this is important because at the end of the day, if you\u2019re going to be a content-first creation tool, the content you mix together is a fundamental differentiator in terms of what you\u2019re creating and what you\u2019re producing. And we feel very, very good and confident about our ability to continue to expand this library and just make sure that what people are mixing to create their output is world class. But of course, we also have the power of Adobe. If you look at what we\u2019re starting to do, and this gives you a hint of where we\u2019re going with our quick actions across Photoshop Quick Actions, Premiere Quick Actions, Acrobat Quick Actions that have started to make their way into Creative Cloud Express, we feel really good about the pipeline of innovation we can bring from our decades of leadership across all of our segments directly into Creative Cloud Express. And then, of course, we are looking for ways to accelerate. We acquired a company called ContentCal that we\u2019ve announced will be the foundation of rich content publishing and scheduling for Creative Cloud Express users. And then lastly, the work we\u2019ve been doing over the last many years around the data-driven operating model that Dan talked about in his opening has been invaluable here. So we\u2019re finding and we\u2019re onboarding new users that would not have typically interacted with Adobe through their intent-based search. And the result is a little bit of what we alluded to. We\u2019ve seen great traffic. We\u2019re seeing millions of monthly active users just a few months into the launch. We have an NPS over 60 at this point in the product. So we\u2019re really bullish on the start of where we are. And if you look at the long pipeline of Adobe-only innovation, maybe to your question, we\u2019re super excited about that. And the last thing I\u2019ll say here is that don\u2019t forget the opportunity here is to drive millions of new users into our franchise. But the opportunity is also to drive high engagement and usage within our core CC base and take what has already been a very, very strong retention curve there and continue to drive engagement and retention of our CC users as well. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Just maybe for clarification. With the changes, there is no update to the annual guidance. You typically don\u2019t, but I think investors want to understand how the impact on the negative side from the changes to ARR for Russia and Ukraine impact the annual guide versus the positive uplift that you\u2019ll get from the pricing structure. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Sterling, I mean, I think color-wise, it\u2019s really still early in the year, but I feel great about the way we\u2019ve been navigating all of the external issues that have come. And it was a strong Q1. As we prepared for this call, we felt it was important to share with you the impact that we know of things, whether it\u2019s the revenue or ARR for Russia, what\u2019s happening on EPS as it relates to the tax rate as well as to provide some more of the growth drivers. But I net it out by saying while we are not updating the annual targets, as you pointed out, we\u2019re really optimistic on the significant number of growth drivers that we have. And we will share more throughout the year because we still are all navigating what is a considerably unpredictable situation. Our strong Q1, however, and the things that we control, we feel excellent about. Sterling Auty : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, referring back to the analyst meeting 3 months ago, you and David used the term product-led growth. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on that because arguably, when you think about the company over the last 30 years or more, you\u2019ve always, in effect, been product-led growth. So how are you thinking about that differently now in terms of a concept or various executables for that? And then for Dan, could you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about your headcount growth relative to your expense growth for the year? You onboarded over 500 employees during the quarter, you finished Q1 with a record number of open recs. How are you thinking about filling those divisions, either to compensate for the increase in attrition you had in fiscal \u201821 versus normal organic growth that you otherwise would have done anyway? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Jay, when I think about the transformative things that we\u2019ve done in the company, certainly the move to subscriptions, the entrance into digital marketing, what we\u2019ve done with data-driven operating model to drive the sort of financial cadence of the business, they absolutely bubble to the top. But I would say those actually dwarf in comparison to the excitement that I feel about what product-led growth can continue to do. When you have hundreds of millions or billions of people using your software, a good example of what we\u2019ve done is the constant innovation that we\u2019re delivering on the Document Cloud side. And I think David referred to some of the statistics, whether it\u2019s sort of doubling what we see with web traffic and really being aware of the intent-based approach that people want when they come on the web to accomplish document actions, what we are doing in mobile and doubling it. And I think product-led growth just relates to ensuring that all of our product teams have information at their fingertips as to how people are really using it so that we can rapidly iterate in terms of what customers want and delight them. And I think on the Creative Cloud, to add to what David said to Saket as well, what that means with Creative Cloud Express is as you have these millions of users, we\u2019re constantly understanding where the search traffic is, how do you improve it. And it\u2019s just a new way of liberating all of the product-led \u2013 product teams to focus on what\u2019s truly important and truly needle-moving as far as customer interest and customer sentiment. And it\u2019s something that David has pioneered. So I\u2019ll have David add a little bit more. But I think the impact on how we serve customers, the NPS and being able to continue to recruit and retain is significant. David Wadhwani : Yes. I think Shantanu covered most of it. Just a couple of things to add. As you correctly point out, we joke internally that actually John and Chuck created product-led growth with distributing the free Reader and then sort of upselling people from there to the Acrobat offering. And so we\u2019ve, throughout our history, had this idea and sense of how you drive utilization and usage and engagement and then drive that to convert to users. I think what we are \u2013 where we are right now is an exciting inflection point where, as Shantanu mentioned, we\u2019re seeing a lot more activity and engagement on web, we\u2019re seeing a lot more activity and engagement on mobile. And that lets us have better and more seamless onboarding. So we can use everything we\u2019ve learned around DDOM to drive better intent-based search and reach audiences that frankly we weren\u2019t able to reach before because the onboarding experience, the actions to success and then what we do beyond that is in minutes, not hours. Shantanu Narayen : Maybe one last thing before Dan comments. I think both Dan and David talked about retention and engagement during the quarter. And to give you a little bit more, Jay, color in terms of that, we look at churn rates. We look at reseller renewal. We look at 90-day cohort retentions. And in all of those, I think as a result of the activity that we\u2019re doing on the product teams to help improve, we\u2019re seeing improvement and getting to rates on all three of those that are better than they have ever been even prior to the pandemic. So I think that\u2019s, again, another example of what gives us confidence in our offerings and our innovation going forward. Dan Durn : And then, Jay, just to come to your second question, we talked about the business performing well. When we talk about digital content and data increasingly driving economic growth going forward in a world where everything is going digital. That means we have an immense market opportunity in front of us, greater than $200 billion in 2024 and significantly larger than that as we look forward. So our long-term growth opportunity at Adobe is not opportunity-constrained. And so when we think about our leadership and product positions, they are built on the back of a very strong innovation engine at the company. So, we are going to orient towards growth. We are going to continue to invest in R&D and the sales muscle to scale our businesses over time and continue that leadership in the markets that we participate in. But we are going to do what we have always done along the way, is do it in a disciplined way, so we are marrying the investments we make with the opportunities as they materialize and grow in a very profitable way. And so you can see the company\u2019s history in terms of strong profitable growth, and I would expect our track record on that to continue over the long run. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys for taking the question. I actually had a couple of clarifications I was hoping to ask you guys about. Shantanu, earlier in the call, you do made some comments about perhaps seeing a little bit of weakness in Europe at the end of the quarter. Can you dig in on that a little bit like where in the business, did you see that weakness? And did that persist into Q2, or was it just kind of more temperamental? So, that was number one. Number two, on the \u2013 I know we are not giving full year guidance, but when we think about the operating margin outperformance in Q1, is the commentary that that\u2019s going to be given back later in the year, or is it just like sort of the ramp-up gets pushed out, so the savings kind of like accrue throughout the full year? And then clarification number three, when you guys gave the original $1.9 billion net new ARR addition guidance for FY \u201822, did you guys already contemplate these price increases, so was the \u2013 or the price changes, were the price changes already in that $1.9 billion guide? So that\u2019s my three clarifications. Shantanu Narayen : Sure. So, Keith, maybe I will answer the last question first and then talk about it, which is, as we were entering the year and what we talked at the FA meeting, if you actually \u2013 I think we also got a couple of questions as it relates to what we were going to do on pricing, and we alluded to the fact that we are constantly looking at it. And so while it was something that we were working on, we actually just pretty recently finished the entire effort. So, we didn\u2019t have it finalized, but we always thought that it was timed with the new offerings to actually look at the pricing structure as well. And so the definite amount and the materiality of that, we will know as we go through the process. But directionally, we knew that we were going to be looking at pricing more exhaustively. I think in terms of the clarification of what we saw, when the war broke out for the last couple of weeks, that impact is not just felt in Russia and Belarus and Ukraine, you see a little bit of that traffic across the region. So, that\u2019s really all I was alluding to. And we saw strength, and that strength continued in the U.S. right through the quarter. And so not unsurprisingly, we saw a little impact. So, that\u2019s all I was referring to as it related to the European situation. And did you have a third question, Keith? Keith Weiss : Yes, the third one was on operating margins. Dan Durn : Yes. Your third question on operating margin. So, let me break it up into three time periods. Let\u2019s talk about Q1 briefly. Let\u2019s talk about FY \u201822 and then beyond. So, as we think about Q1, clearly, Omicron was a context around that quarter. So, our investments in things like travel, facilities weren\u2019t as robust as originally contemplated, and you saw a little bit of uplift from a margin structure standpoint in Q1. When we take a step back, we talked about the growth profile and the leadership of our product positions, continuing to invest to scale our businesses, and a lot of those investments being R&D and sales-oriented. We will continue to do that. And the targets that we set in FA Day a few months ago implied in those \u2013 in that framework is an operating margin for the year. And so I think you will see that unfold throughout the rest of the year. And then longer term, we talked about the significant opportunities facing the company and our ability to capture that with our leadership position as the world goes increasingly digital. And as we grow and scale this business, you will see the benefits of that over time layer into the operating margin as we continue to do it in a strong, profitable and disciplined way. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Tyler Radke with Citi. Tyler Radke : Yes. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just going back to the price increase and pricing changes. Obviously, I am sure you will be sharing a lot more specifics as we go forward. But philosophically, just how are you thinking about the pricing changes at the high end versus the kind of entry-level creative products? And particularly, just curious how you are evaluating those pricing changes in the context of the competitive landscape? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : So, I think philosophically, the way we are looking at it, I will repeat what I said earlier, which is we haven\u2019t done a comprehensive look at that in multiple years. And directionally, I think the significant value that we have added has to do with people, whether you are in businesses or whether you are a user of the entire apps. I mean we continue to add new apps to the \u2013 what\u2019s called the CC All Apps platform. And directionally, we are just saying that is the area where we have to look at all of the increased value that we have. This is not driven in any way, shape or form by any competitive response. So, let me be categorical about that. This is raised by \u2013 we continue to attract billions of people to the platform in terms of the interest. And with all of the new offerings that we have, again as David said, across web, across mobile, across the browsers, we just want to make sure that as we continue to expand the offerings, we are looking at the pricing in a good way. So, the value that we have added to whether you are in teams with collaboration or whether you are to businesses continues to be a motivator for us to look at the prices as well on all the new apps that we have added. So hopefully, that gives you color. Let me also back up and say this is for us, all really about customers and delighting customers. But because we had an earnings call, we said as this gets rolled out, we at least want to give you some heads up because otherwise, some of you would say, why didn\u2019t you at least allude to it. As David said, this doesn\u2019t have an impact in Q2 really. It\u2019s a pretty small impact. So, that was the rationale and thinking associated with it. And we will certainly roll this out with customers first, and then we will share with you more of what the impact is. But that\u2019s the way we look at how we move the business going forward. Tyler Radke : Great. And if I could sneak in a follow-up just on the digital experience side, obviously, pretty strong growth here in Q4 and the first part of the year, above 20% on an adjusted basis. I guess was there any kind of one-time factors that drove that outperformance? And as we think about the guide for the next quarter and the deceleration implied, just anything to call out there? Thank you. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks for the question. We are pleased with the momentum we have seen in the digital experience business with 22% growth and subscription on an adjusted basis. The market opportunity is huge, over $100 billion of TAM. The pandemic obviously put a spotlight on it in terms of the urgency. We are seeing it continue to grow in terms of customer demand, customer interest at the Board level and at the C-level. We are in a really strong market position with what we have built with the Adobe Experience Platform and the native apps like Customer Journey Analytics and CDP that we have built with that. So, overall, we feel really excited about the path forward. And we just had the Summit conference last week, excellent pipeline building event as well as a chance to showcase our product innovation. So, we expect this to continue through the year in terms of our momentum. Tyler Radke : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Keith Bachman with BMO. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you. I am going to follow lead with a couple of clarifications. Dan, could you comment on what the inorganic contribution was this quarter and where it manifests? So for instance Frame.io, what was the contribution there? Secondly, when you think about \u2013 I just want to clarify on the ARR write-off, so to speak. The comment was that you are ceasing all new incremental business. But are you going to continue to get ARR payments in Russia \u2013 or from Russia and Belarus from existing business that might actually contribute to ARR? Just a little bit confused on that one. And then in the spirit of Keith Weiss, I am actually going to ask a third clarification. Shantanu, in the past, you have said that in the creative side, new subscribers was the most significant contributor to growth. And I just wanted to try to understand given more competition perhaps in the lower end of the market, is that still true? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I will answer the first \u2013 the third one first, Keith, as Dan does, which is if you look at the growth, the unit growth is being driven by single apps, which is new subscribers and driving to it. So that trend, in terms of continuing to drive single unit, is definitely part of how we think about it. I will answer maybe one part of also how you have to think about it, which is when you think about Russia and Belarus, we have the ARR, which is the book of business, but there is no way to really get payments. And with all of the sanctions that\u2019s there, what we have factored is that book of business, because we are not going to be getting payments from Russia, that is the impact that Dan alluded to, which is the $75 million for the rest of the year. So, in addition to seizing new payment \u2013 in addition to stopping new sales, what you have to realize is for a service that exists as a SaaS-based service, you are unable to collect payments. And so we have reflected that impact as well in the particular geographies. Dan Durn : Yes. And just coming back to your last piece, Keith, on Frame, now, that it\u2019s part of the business, we are not going to be breaking this out. We talked about the momentum in the business. It\u2019s great. The team is doing really well. The number of deals, the average deal size, business has a lot of momentum around it. And we talked about the great collaboration technology that exists there. But now that it\u2019s a part of the business, we won\u2019t be breaking it out explicitly. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. The numbers look quite good for Q1. So, Shantanu, I am curious, the shifting seasonality, generally when you find a more seasonal second half, that\u2019s generally a sign of maturity in the market or macro factors or just product transition factors. But when I look at your second half, you do have relatively easier comps for DM ARR, right? And then you have the pricing optimization. So, if we net it all out, how do you feel about the business in the second half relative to going into the first quarter, granted that we have all these macroeconomic concerns? But net of the positives against \u2013 net of the negatives against the positives, how do you feel today versus three months back about the rest of the fiscal year? Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Kash. I mean to net it out, I definitely feel more positive about business moving forward than I ever have, because just if you take a step back and look at all of \u2013 first look at Q1, we had a strong Q1. We clearly beat our targets in what is perhaps the most unpredictable situations that exist in the world. So, we feel really good about Q1. We feel really good about the new initiatives that \u2013 both in Document Cloud and Creative Cloud and in Experience Cloud that David and Anil spoke to. I did allude to the fact that when you think about the seasonal cadence and the rhythm of the business, certainly, some of that\u2019s impacted. And perhaps the thing that you are alluding to, Kash, was in Q2 of last year, there was sort of a catch-up as \u201csmall and medium businesses\u201d came on \u2013 come back online. And so you have to just factor what that is in. But both in terms of the revenue growth in DME for Q3 and Q4 as it relates to getting more similar to Q1 as well as the ARR, we are optimistic about the second half. The only reason we didn\u2019t talk about Q2 is because we actually gave specific guidance and targets for Q2. So, don\u2019t take that as anything as opposed to we have given you targets for Q2 and we are trying to give you color on what happens in Q3 and Q4. So hopefully, that helps, Kash. And on the DX side, since there have been fewer questions on the DX side, I mean what we have done, Summit was really exciting, the amount of new announcements that we have done there. Every person that I talked to in the C-suite continues to want to really focus on digital transformation and customer experience management. I am excited. I am back on the road again. It feels great. We have employees back in the office and facilities. People want to meet, and digital engagement is top of mind. So, across all three of our businesses, we didn\u2019t talk about the document business. $100 million in ARR for the quarter, $2 billion book of business, really good adoption of our new functionality, whether it\u2019s on the web as well as a unifying sign with Acrobat, which was a big movement that we are trying to do. So, I think all of those are positive. I think the one impact that, again, maybe Dan can just touch on is certainly, it doesn\u2019t impact our core business. But the EPS, you just have to factor some of the revenue and other considerations that happened. But for the functional part of the business, I feel really good. Dan Durn : Yes. So Shantanu did a good job talking about the fundamentals of the business. The other piece are the transient effects. And I would point to two of them. So, for the war in Ukraine, we de-risked the profile around the situation. And that\u2019s the prudent thing to do, to be conservative in situations like this. So, that\u2019s what you see in the $87 million reduction in ARR as well as the $75 million reduction from a revenue standpoint, Q2 through Q4. So, if I take that revenue and I flow it through the P&L, that\u2019s going to be about a $0.04 a share headwind per quarter for the balance of the year, Q2 through Q4. From a tax standpoint, we talked about an 18.5% non-GAAP tax rate. That\u2019s a 1.5 point change versus where we were at FA Day. If I were to roll that through the P&L, that\u2019s about $0.06 a share per quarter throughout the year. We were able to overcome that in Q1. And then when I look at the share repurchase activity, clearly the company took advantage of the current environment. And that\u2019s going to create about a $0.02 a share benefit each quarter this year versus where we were at FA Day. And so when I net all of that out on a go-forward basis, you have got about an $0.08 per share headwind in each quarter. And again, like we said in Q1, we were able to overcome that headwind in Q1 and deliver above the expectations that we had set, and we are going to continue to orient towards growth. We are going to invest to lead, but if there is opportunities to do it in a disciplined way and overcome it on a go-forward basis, we will take it a quarter at a time and let you know what we see. Kash Rangan : Thank you, Dan. And Shantanu, just one final follow-up, the clear \u2013 I know that you want to talk about the Document Cloud and the Experience Cloud, but I remember fall of 2011, you have made a very bold transition to Creative Cloud subscription. You, in fact, outlined that you have a target of 4 million subscribers in fiscal \u201815, which seemed quite visionary back then, right? So, as you look at the inflection point going \u2013 the company is going through, what are your aspirations for Creative Cloud Express if you were to measure it in subscribers or how big of a business would you like it to be? What would be your similar prognostication as you look into the next few years? And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Kash, at the FA meeting, we talked about what the overall addressable market opportunity is. But I really feel like we can get billions of users to use our product. And then they will be the spectrum of people who will be paying us on a subscription business as well as others who will perhaps take advantage of some of the freemium offerings that we have. We are starting to see that kind of adoption with the Document Cloud certainly, right, where you have 0.5 billion people who have used our \u2013 a Reader and other products. But I think in terms of Creative Cloud Express, my hope and my aspiration is that every single person who has a story to tell uses some part of the Creative Cloud Express. We are off to a great start there, Kash. I think on the differentiation, as David said, we have the platform. We have every single piece of technology that we need to deliver a great compelling experience. And now we are also world-class at making sure that we capture search-based intent. So, we want to anticipate what people want to do with Creative, but I would be disappointed if that doesn\u2019t just continue to be a huge growth area in terms of new users to our platform. Jonathan Vaas : Operator, we are a little past the top of the hour. We will squeeze in one more question and then wrap up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Turrin : Hi there. Good afternoon. Appreciate you squeezing me on. We have been expecting a return to normal expense profile. Q1 operating margins were actually flat relative to last year. Anything else you can add just around the Q1 margin results? And as we think through the puts and takes between that return to a more normalized expense profile and some of the product and pricing efforts you have mentioned ahead this year, any way to think through if price uplift can help offset some of that expense normalization you are expecting? Thank you. Dan Durn : Yes, sure. So, if I were to look at where we landed in Q1, and we talked about not fully investing from a travel and facilities standpoint because of the Omicron environment. And as I look forward to the Q2 guide and the operating margin that is implicit in that guide and I were to break it out into some several buckets. There is going to be an influence from the transient effects of the Russia situation. We are going to do increased hiring to invest for future growth. We get full quarter impact from a merit standpoint instead of a one month impact. And then we will start to see the reopening expenses start to layer back in. Those are the four buckets that bridge you from Q1 to Q2. And I would say each of those four buckets is roughly equally weighted. And so I think that\u2019s what gets you to a more normalized run rate as we look into Q2 and the back half of the year. Shantanu Narayen : And since that was the last question, I wanted to, again, thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased with the performance. We think we had a really strong start to the fiscal year across all three of our businesses Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. And more than that, I think our ability to continue to delight customers and deliver on the innovative roadmap gives us a lot of confidence associated with the new initiatives taking stock and contributing to the future growth at Adobe. The spotlight, I believe, on digital will just continue. And as we get back to more normalcy, I think that will only all go well for both Adobe and our customers. And the successful Summit that we just organized, I think is another indicator of the interest that exists in our solutions. So, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing more as we go through the year. Thank you. Jonathan Vaas : This concludes the call. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

In my conversations around the world, it is clear that Digital is playing a pivotal role in powering the economy and enabling the world to keep moving forward. I will now turn it over to David to share more about our momentum in the Digital Media business. David? David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu, and hello everyone. Adobe products have always been the solution of choice for the world's creators, whether they're designers, photographers, filmmakers, or illustrators. Today, the explosion of the creator economy is enabling even more individuals, solopreneurs and small business owners to express themselves in creative ways. Whether it's a hobby, a side hustle, or a full time job, every creator and business is reimagining how they build their brand and engage their audiences in a digital first world, underscoring the rapidly growing demand for content and creativity. Adobe Creative Cloud offers the most comprehensive portfolio of products and services across every creative category, including imaging, photography, design, video, and 3D and immersive. We continue to invest across our core flagship products, including a heavy dose of new AI features. As demand for content increases, content creators are looking to Adobe to help them work together efficiently. We're responding by integrating collaboration capabilities directly into our flagship applications that enable creative teams to collaborate with each other, and with stakeholders. As communicators have become a growing part of our creative cloud customer base, we've expanded our offerings to include Adobe Express; our new template based easy-to-use web and mobile product. Express creates an opportunity to serve a broader base of communicators who need lightweight task based tools to create everything from social media posts, logos and flyers for their small businesses, to party invitations and posters for their personal needs. Real Estate entrepreneur Chrishell Stause is a great example of a social media influencer, who is leveraging Adobe Express to transform how she markets her properties and engages her followers. She is one of millions of users promoting their products and services with Adobe Express. In Q2, we achieve net new creative cloud ARR of $357 million and revenue of $2.61 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year. Q2 highlights include continued innovation in the imaging category. This quarter, we launched powerful new capabilities in Photoshop, including Photo Restoration neural filter that detects and restores damaged photos in seconds. Neural filters are one of Photoshops most used AI powered features. They have now been used by millions of users and apply it to hundreds of millions of images. We're also delivering enhancements to Photoshop on the web, including new editing features, support for mobile browsers and integrated learning content. Video Production also continues to explode, and Premiere Pro remains a leader in video creation, editing, and now collaboration with Frame.io. The new integration between Frame and Premiere Pro and After Effects is streamlining review and collaboration workflows across stakeholders. Frame had another strong quarter with new customer wins including Epic Games and NBCUniversal which are using it to manage their video content supply chain something that Anil will talk more about in a few minutes. We're also seeing the emergence of new categories like 3D as customer demand for metaverse ready content continues to increase. Substance 3D had its strongest Q2 ever as customers like Hugo Boss, Mattel, and Unity rely on it to deliver immersive experiences across fashion, gaming and e-commerce. We continue to rapidly innovate in this space, including delivering native Apple hardware support for painter, designer and sampler enabling creators to work faster than ever before. The Substance team also delivered a new SDK for developers who want to integrate 3D capabilities into their applications. And finally, we're excited about the momentum we're seeing for Adobe Express with millions of monthly active users and strong growth in traffic and new users in Q2. We continue to bring the magic of Photoshop imaging Premier Video and Acrobat PDF capabilities like background removal, QR code generation, video resizing, and PDF editing to Express, and we released our new content scheduler feature thanks to our recent acquisition of ContentCal, allowing creators to quickly create, preview, schedule and publish social media content. We're also excited to kick off our \u201cExpress Your Brand Partnership\u201d with Meta, which will enable over 200 million businesses to grow their online presence using Adobe Express. And our product led growth strategy allows us to use millions of data points to continuously test, learn and optimize the entire Express experience from search to export. Adobe Express recently received the Editor's Choice Award on the App Store, recognizing top apps for design, functionality and performance. We're very excited about the strong demand for Creative Cloud offerings globally driven by acquisition, engagement and retention from our data driven operating model across individuals, SMBs and Enterprises. Key enterprise customer wins include Activision, Bertelsmann, Hasbro, Honda Motor, Daimler AG, and CSOFT, Services Australia, State of California and WPP. In our Document Cloud business, digital document workflows are automating manual paper processes across our personal and professional lives. Whether it's a legal contract, invoice, or school permission slip, we now need to scan, edit, share and sign from anywhere. Adobe Document Cloud offers the most comprehensive intuitive tools for document productivity across every device and platform. In education, the University of East London is adopting Document Cloud to manage workflows for enrolling 17,000 students from 135 countries. In financial services, TSB Bank is transforming the online banking experience by enabling customers to quickly and securely complete common tasks like loan applications that could previously only be done in branches. In Q2, we achieved net new Document Cloud ARR of $107 million and record revenue of $595 million, which grew 28% year-over-year. Q2 highlights include strong growth in monthly active users across desktop, mobile and web. The rising volume of search traffic for Acrobat verbs remains a productive funnel to Acrobat web, which surpassed 50 million monthly active users in Q2 more than doubling year-over-year. Mobile App momentum remains strong with billions of PDFs opened in Acrobat mobile, and hundreds of millions of cumulative Adobe scan installs. Acrobat and Adobe sign integration continues to drive strong demand for Adobe sign as users increasingly send PDFs for signature directly from the unified Acrobat experience. Acrobat and Adobe Express integrations now give hundreds of millions of Acrobat users the ability to embed customized templates and make their PDFs visually stunning. And Acrobat and Sign API's are thriving as customers increasingly customize, integrate and automate document services. We're thrilled with the momentum we see in the Acrobat ecosystem, and our business performance across routes to market and customer segments, including key enterprise customer wins with automatic data processing, Duke Energy, Quanta services and U.S. Bank. We continue to see strong demand for our products in the second half of FY 2022 will continue to win in the digital media business through product innovation across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, which are targeting a broad growing base of customers. Our tremendous scale, consistent marketing investments, proven data driven operating model and new product lead growth initiatives are accelerating our momentum across our new and established businesses. I'll now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Even in this uncertain economy, every business continues to prioritize its digital investment.

Dan, over to you. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Today, I will start by summarizing Adobe\u2019s performance in Q2 fiscal 2022, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I\u2019ll finish with targets. Adobe delivered a strong quarter, surpassing our issued Q2 financial targets in an uncertain macro environment. On the top line, we grew revenue by 14% year-over-year, or 15% in constant currency, while making long term growth investments, we delivered operating margins of 35% on a GAAP basis and 45% on a non-GAAP basis continuing to be one of the most predictable and profitable growth companies in technology  We have three strategic businesses growing into massive addressable markets, with differentiated products used by hundreds of millions of individuals every month. In addition to our established businesses, we are delivering innovations and new offerings that will drive transformational growth in the future. Q2 business and financial highlights included record revenue of $4.39 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.49 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.35. Digital Media revenue of $3.02 billion net new Digital Media ARR of $464 million. Digital Experience revenue of $1.10 billion cash flows from operations of $2.04 billion. RPO of $13.82 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 1.9 million shares of our stock during the [Technical difficulty] 15% year-over-year revenue growth in constant [ph] currency. We exited the quarter with 12.95 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved creative revenue of $2.61 billion which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We added $357 million of net New Creative ARR in the quarter, a sequential increase of 13% from Q1. Second quarter creative growth drivers included continued strength in acquisition, engagement and retention across our customer segments. Momentum in the small and medium business segment, where our team's offering continues to drive new customer acquisition. Demand for our flagship products including Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere. Mobile applications where our Ending ARR grew greater than 30% year-over-year exiting the quarter. Adobe Stock where we saw strong book of business growth across organizations and new customers and momentum. And momentum in new businesses with strong growth and Frame IO as well as our substance offerings, which grew Ending ARR greater than 60% year-over-year exiting the quarter. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $595 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth, or 28% in constant currency. Document Cloud continues to be our fastest growing business given the relevance and importance of PDF the knowledge workers around the globe. We added 107 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Second quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included continued strength and acquisition engagement retention for Acrobat across our customer segments. Momentum in the small and medium business segment and the reseller channel continuing to drive New Document Cloud subscriptions. Continued growth of searches online for document actions funneling millions of new customers into our document franchise through Acrobat Web. Strength in mobile with Ending ARR growing greater than 40% year-over-year exiting the quarter, and strong adoption of Acrobat with integrated sign capabilities within organizations of all sizes. Our document business also had a strong quarter and sales of Acrobat perpetual licenses. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q2, we achieved revenue of $1.10 billion, which represents 17% year-over-year growth or 18% in constant currency.

Second quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included strong growth in our Adobe Experience platform business or AEP with real time CDP revenue more than doubling year-over-year. Increase in customer interest and pipeline generation for new applications built on AEP, including real time CDP, customer journey optimizer and customer journey analytics. Success with Workfront where average deal sizes grew greater than 35% year-over-year, continued customer demand and content and commerce with significant new customer acquisition and Adobe Experience Manager as a cloud service. Enterprise demand for Adobe Professional Services, driving customer success and new implementations across our solutions and strength and retention rates during the quarter driven by product differentiation and our focus on delivering customer value. Our strategy of enabling enterprises to activate first party data to provide personalization at scale in real time is resonating with customers driving our continuing digital experience growth. In Q2, we continued to focus on making disciplined investments to drive growth, including marketing campaigns and headcount additions in our R&D and sales organizations. We're pleased with our success in talent acquisition during the quarter in a competitive market. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q2 was 21% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The increase in the GAAP tax rate is primarily due to the lower than expected tax benefits associated with stock based compensation and geographic mix of earnings. RPO exiting the quarter was $13.82 billion growing 13% year-over-year, or 15% year-over-year when factoring in a 2% foreign exchange headwind. Our ending cash and short term investment position exiting Q2 was $5.30 billion in cash flows from operations in the quarter were $2.04 billion. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at a cost of $800 million. We currently have $9.5 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020, which goes through 2024. We will now provide Q3 targets as well as an update on the annual targets we provided in December factoring in the following four items. First, in March, we stated that as a result of lower than expected tax benefits associated with stock based compensation, our effective tax rates would increase in fiscal 2022. Second, in March, we outlined the impact of the on-going war in Ukraine, and our decision to cease all new sales in Russia and Belarus, resulting in an expected $75 million revenue impact on our digital media business. Third, as a result of the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we are now factoring in an incremental effects headwind of $175 million across Q3 and Q4 revenue. And fourth while demand for our products remains strong, we now expect the second half of the fiscal year to show more pronounced summer seasonality in Q3 and the enterprise business with a stronger sequential increasing Q4. As a result, for Q3 we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $4.43 billion, net New Digital Media ARR of approximately $430 million. Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year, or 16% in constant currency. Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year, or 14% in constant currency. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year, or 15% in constant currency; tax rate of approximately 22.5% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, and GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.33. For fiscal year 2022, we're now targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $17.65 billion. Net New Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.90 billion. Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year, or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year, or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year, or 19% on an adjusted basis. Tax rate of approximately 21% on a GAAP basis, and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, and GAAP earnings per share of approximately $9.95 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $13.50. In summary, I'm pleased by the way Adobe executed in Q2. We are driving growth across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud with momentum in our established businesses and early success in our new initiatives. As a result of our disciplined operating model and focused execution, we were able to dramatically reduce the expected impact of increased tax rates and FX headwinds on our EPS. The investments we're making today in people, products and marketing will enable us to drive strong growth for years to come. And we are on track for another year of record revenue and operating cash flows. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. We are proud of our strong Q2 performance across Creative Cloud Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. Adobe remains one of the greatest places to work in the industry. And I want to thank our employees for their relentless dedication. This quarter, Forbes named us a top employer for college graduates, and we were ranked on their list of America's best employers for diversity. I'm thrilled to welcome our largest cohort of interns and university graduates this summer. Demand for our category defining products and services continue to grow. We're innovating at rapid speed for new and existing customer segments, accelerating our leadership in established categories, and seeing strong momentum for our newer initiatives. Our strategy remains to focus on long term growth initiatives while delivering world class profitability. Our business fundamentals and market tailwinds are strong. And I've never been more confident in our ability to execute on the $205 billion market opportunity ahead of us. I will now turn it back over to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, Shantanu. Adobe MAX, our creativity conference will take place during the third week of October this year in Los Angeles. On day one at MAX on Tuesday, October 18 we plan to host the financial analyst meeting. Invitations including discounted registration information will be sent to our analyst and investor email list later this summer. More information about the event can be found online@max.adobe.com. We would now be happy to take your questions. And we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to our first question from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Hi guys, thanks very much and congrats on the strong results. Shantanu and Anil I was wondering if you guys could just talk a little bit about the type of conversations you're having with your enterprise customers these days, given the macro backdrop. Are you seeing any hesitancy to spend? Obviously, you guys are keeping your full year guidance, despite all these headwinds, but I was also just curious if there's any change in kind of the type of deals your is it more smaller deals but more deals? Or is the product mix changing at all on the experience cloud side? I was just wondering if you could give us some color on that because that obviously remains a very primary concern for folks these days. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks Kirk. Yes, we are pleased with what we saw in the quarter. In the conversations that we're having, both Anil and I would first say that the interest level in executives all around the world, is very high. Unlike last time, I would say right now, the focus is also a lot on execution. So a lot of the investments that people have made in digital, they recognize that given how critical the imperative is to engage with customers digitally. So we're actually pleased both Adobe as well as if you look at the entire systems integrator and partner network, they are finding that there's a lot of demand for implementation on Adobe products. I think the other part of the conversation that you all have with enterprise CEOs right now is they all recognize it's an uncertain time. And that's the conversation that we have. But despite that uncertain macroeconomic environment, the thing that all of them recognize is that Digital is a priority. And they really want to continue to have conversations with us as to how they can do Digital. I\u2019ll have Anil maybe add a little bit of what he's seeing across different verticals as well. But the importance of digital remains undiminished. Anil Chakravarthy : Yes thanks Shantanu. Just to add a little bit on the vertical color, we were really pleased with some of the wins we had in Q2. If you look at the automotive and what we had with Daimler over in Europe, where we continued our strength in sports media and entertainment with NFL, which is using the real time CDP for personalization at scale across their fan base. And in healthcare, where we had a really important win with CVS. That was a great validation of all the HIPAA readiness we built into our platform So that opens up a big market opportunity. So we were really pleased those wins and as you said digital continues to be a priority. And we're seeing that in the pipeline for the second half. Operator : And, Kirk, did you have anything further? Kirk Materne : No, that was that. I'll keep to my one question limit. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we'll go next to Brent Thill of Jefferies. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Dan, I was curious if you could just comment on the more pronounced summer seasonality. What are you seeing this year versus perhaps in past years, and just a quick follow up on the numbers? The net new ARR guide was down Q2 to Q3. And I think last quarter; you said it would be up? Do we misinterpret what you said last quarter? I just want to make sure we clarify that. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Brent, the way I would describe it as we had a strong first half, and we actually continue to see a strong demand for our unique solutions. And all of our new initiatives as well as the established businesses are doing well. I guess what we're also paying attention to is, what we all read as part of the macro environment. And when I look at what we expect for our second half, the confidence remains undiminished. The question really for us is timing. And maybe we're being a little cautious as it relates to what happens, given the summer seasonality, as Brent better than most is, sort of the July and August. So as it relates to our second half pipeline, the confidence remains undiminished. And we're just maybe a little cautious as it relates to timing. In terms of what we had said, in March, you're right, we had sort of alluded to the fact that we would have expected some sequential increase; clearly we had a strong Q2. But that's part of the reason why we wanted to give a little bit of color and be transparent on how we see it. And as you notice, we reaffirm the $1.9 billion for net new ARR for the year. Brent Thill : Thanks, Shantanu. Operator : And we'll go next to a question from Brad Sills of Bank of America. Brad Sills : Oh, great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I wanted to ask about Creative Cloud Express. You mentioned some new features here imaging video, editing for Acrobat, it seems to me like those are, would be considered typically premium features. Is there any change in strategy with Creative Cloud Express as to where you see that playing in different segments of the market? Thank you. David Wadhwani : Yes, thanks for the question. First of all, we're really thrilled with the reception of Creative Cloud Express, Adobe Express into the market. And frankly, it's been a lot of fun for us because it's a product that everyone at Adobe can also be using, it's amazing to see the creativity coming out of finance and legal for example. As a reminder, just to sort of up level for a second, we've been focused on the communicator and creator economy, ecosystem for years. In fact, we believe that we're the largest provider of creative tools to professionals and communicators on the back of our core products. So I want to just make sure people recognize that the core products are playing to this incredibly large market, where we see Express filling in is that Express is additive and broadens the region, that new communicator base, because of exactly what you're saying the freemium business model, there's zero friction onboarding, it's clearly showing that we're able to attract millions of new users into the franchise. And we're able to do it very efficiently by optimizing how we onboard customers from search terms that typically were not ones that we've focused on in the past. We also look at the ability to onboard those users and differentiate the offering, with the integration of these amazing features that we get from the from the desktop applications like Adobe magic. And all of this helps differentiate what we're doing with Express. And if we take a step back and look at it from a business perspective, we feel very confident that Adobe Express and the way we actually pull people into that funnel is additive to the market opportunity that we're playing. So we're really emphasizing the ability to add more capabilities there and differentiate there. I do also want to remind folks that that Express is also available to core Creative Cloud customers. And by integrating some of those features into Express, we're enabling workflows between the core Creative Cloud products and also Express and we believe that's going to have a strong retentive value on the core base and we just had, in fact, a great quarter with very strong retention for Creative Cloud as well. Brad Sills : Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Brad maybe if I were to add, I think the team is actually having a lot of fun with all these cool features. To your point, they're showing some incredible stuff as part of the quick actions. But if you look at the depth of what they have, I mean, there is so much behind the scenes that we will be able to monetize. But clearly the focus is on usage right now, as David said. It's been fun. Brad Sills : Great to hear. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Yes, hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just a two part. The first one, we've talked, I think a lot about pricing tailwinds during last quarter in terms of the impact for the year, and I guess can you help us just quantify the impact that you're anticipating for Q3 and Q4. Because it does, it does look to start ramping here pretty meaningfully. And then Shantanu, I guess, maybe just for you with respect to the strategic approach to M&A and kind of what's on the horizon, given the change in valuation paradigms in the market, how important is either large strategic M&A to the growth profile of the business versus tuck-ins? Shantanu Narayen : I think as it relates to your M&A question, and then David could certainly answer the other one, clearly valuations to your point have changed quite a bit. And the first thing I'll start off by saying is, we're really pleased with our portfolio. If you look at some of the new initiatives, and we've touched on that, whether it's Adobe Express, whether it's the real time CDP customer journey analytics, what we're doing with things on the web, including PDF, we feel really good. I do feel Alex that there are going to be a number of small single product companies that are probably not going to survive, what's happening. And the valuation sort of multiple changing is actually I think, good for a larger company like Adobe. So I, it doesn't feel like we need anything, but we will always be on the lookout for things that are additive, that are adjacent, and that will provide great shareholder value and our metrics associated with ensuring great technology, great cultural fit, and adjacency remain. But we have so much going on within the company that we're excited about our current portfolio, clearly, things will be more reasonable in terms of M&A as well. David Wadhwani : And on pricing, Alex, you're right. We did sort of introduce a modest price increase to a portion of our customer base in Q2, the new prices were in market for about a month and drove a little under 10 million of benefit, which is exactly what we were expecting. And as you can see, it's a very small part of the 464 million that we drove in Q2. Customer reaction overall to this has been good, because we've added so many new features since the last price update that it's been very positive overall. And in fact, if we get asked anything by analysts, it's why we didn't make a bigger price increase. And the reality there is we're primarily focused on adding millions of new users. We are a growth business. We want to continue to grow the user base. And we believe that with the initiatives we have around both the core and the new products, we want to run the business through acquisition of new users engagement and retention. Alex Zukin : Got it. And sorry, Dan, just maybe just the impact on Q3 that you're anticipating in the guide for net New ARR on pricing? David Wadhwani : Yes, that we want to provide that as part of the guide. I think the metrics that David gave you, around Q2, give you a good sense of the expected actions that we anticipate going forward. Alex Zukin : Thank you guys. Operator : And we'll go next to Saket Kalia of Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here. David, maybe just to stay with you, given the questions on macro, I was wondering if we could go one level deeper into the makeup of Creative ARR. We have the very helpful disclosure from analysts say the single app versus the all-out mix, which is helpful. But how do you think about the mix from maybe consumers versus professionals if there's a way to break that down? Because of course, right now, there are lots of questions just about the health of the consumer. How do you think about that mix? And how do you think about maybe the defensiveness or the retention rates on both of those different cohorts? Does that make sense? David Wadhwani : Yes, it makes perfect sense. Yes happy to take that one. So at a high level we think about the business through obviously multiple segmentations. But as you're looking at it, we think about it as enterprise buyers, midmarket and SMB buyers, communicators and consumers. So we have a very broad and diverse portfolio, which has served us very well in the past. And, and as you as you are alluding to, we've been through multiple recessions before so we have some good insight into how these different cohorts respond to difficult financial times. And overall, we fared very well. Enterprises we've talked about, you heard Anil and Shantanu talk about content is fueling the digital economy and needing to stay very focused on their digital investments. From a pro market perspective, we have professionals that are making their living using our products. So we feel very good about that offering, as well. From a communicators perspective, they tend to be either working in departments or small businesses, or they're part of this growing movement around the creative economy. And they're aspiring to make money or build followers with that. So it's an essential part of their, their toolset that they're going to do to grow their side hustle in their activities. And as it relates to the consumer businesses, we've been very thoughtful with pricing there, and have had very attractive pricing that we think has fared very well for us in the past around, through recession. So, overall, we think the business is diverse, and we see the business is very resilient. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from Karl Keirstead of UBS. Karl Keirstead : Hi, thanks very much. I'd love to ask about the digital experience guide. You said it for 14% in the third quarter, that's down about four points in constant currency from 18% in May, and is the lowest and a bit. I know it's a tougher comp is, is that the issue? Or is there anything else to call out on the DX business? Thanks a lot. Shantanu Narayen : Nothing Karl to call out. I mean, if you look at what our targets are for the year, and if you look at it in terms of what we would expect, for both subscription and total revenue we\u2019re in effect saying exactly the same at the beginning of the year, in what's a really tough economic environment. So the interest in our solutions remain strong. I also wanted to maybe add to a little bit of what David said to for Saket. The consumer sentiment that we continue to hear from banks, such as yourselves, is that the consumer sentiment actually continues to remain strong, both in the U.S. and in Europe. So I didn't want to have anybody feel like that's not what we're seeing as well. Karl Keirstead : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move to our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening, I'd like to ask about two important attributes of your product led growth strategy. First, could you comment on the contribution from or expectations for what you call your application and intelligent services? Is that becoming meaningful at this point? And then secondly, at Summit a couple of months ago, and again this evening, we heard multiple examples of integration within and across your segments, which is long standing Adobe practice. But we've heard a great deal more about that the last couple of years. Could you comment on which of the many integrations you think either in terms of addressable market, or your own sales capacities might be the most meaningful over the next number of quarters and years? David Wadhwani : Thanks. Thanks for the question, Jay. In terms of the application intelligence services, it fits really well into the portfolio of our Adobe Experience platform based services. So just to recap, we have three major services the real time CDP customer journey analytics, and the journey optimizer. And what we have done is really integrated these intelligence services as part of these applications that run natively on the Adobe Experience platform. And where that has been extremely valuable to us is, we have a broad base of customers through our digital experience portfolios, for example, with Adobe analytics, we have that's been the gold standard for a long time on for web traffic analysis and trends and insights. And with customer journey analytics, our enterprise customers can now get a 360 degree view of everything that's happening across the customer journey, whether it's web traffic or, or through mobile apps, social call center, and so on. And that's where the intelligence services really fit in, to really be able to expand the portfolio and derive value from how you segment those into audiences and activate them. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Okay and the second part of the question David Wadhwani : If you could repeat the second part of the question please? Jay Vleeschhouwer : Oh, sure. I was trying to get some insights into which of the many integrations that you've done either within or across your segments, whether it's Digital Media DX, or combinations thereof, you think had had or will have the most meaningful impacts, assuming that not all of these integrations are created equally. Shantanu Narayen : I\u2019ll start off maybe on that particular question, Jay, because one of the areas that we're seeing just tremendous interest is what we are referring to as content supply chain. And both David and Anil can touch on that as well, a little bit more. But this notion of people creating campaigns, if you agree with us that the greatest value that we can provide is enabling every enterprise to do personalization at scale, the amount of content that's being created, the amount of content that's being delivered, and to understand the efficacy of the campaigns, is just absolutely top of mind. I mean, we have a large, large consumer company that has completely consolidated all of their marketing activity to really understand what this content supply chain is. And so the notion of content supply chain, and what we can do between our creative applications, the asset management that we deliver, the website and what we are doing with AEM Experienced Manager, that and work front to be able to do workflow associated with that, that is really resonating with every single customer right now. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Great, thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you guys for taking the question. I have a question for Dan. And it's about sort of the guidance philosophy. And that these are what a lot of people are trying to get at is understanding holding the Digital Media ARR guide at 1.9 billion for the full year, despite the kind of increased seasonality in Q3, despite the fact like the street kind of gave you a pass, we've already taken our numbers down to like 1.8 billion. Why keep that risk out there? Why push more risk into Q4? Why put a high bar out there when obviously, it's not in the stock? All the stocks are getting killed here. It's not in our expectations, like, what is it that gives you so much confidence to like, keep that number out there. David Wadhwani : So I guess where I'd start is, if you take a look at where we are in, in the first half, I would say the performance of the businesses is really good. We talked about it earlier conversations with the customers, what we're seeing in data and DDOM and the insights that it gives us, we see strength into the back half of the year. So we're confident in the underlying performance of the business. And, I'd go back to the earlier comments, we see the headlines we see what others are talking about. And so in an environment like this, maybe we're a little cautious about Q3, I think that's the prudent way to go. But it doesn't take away from the insights we have and the belief we have and confidence in the underlying performance and the strength we see into the second half. And so I think we've taken everything into account. And we've got the right set of targets out there that reflect what we're seeing in the business and how we expect to perform. Keith Weiss : Got it. And I mean, any visibility into what gets better in Q4 that that's kind of enabled it because you're looking for net New AAR to go from basically down in the first half of the year to growing in the back half what, what could you give us any kind of visibility to like, what gives you guys that confidence? Shantanu Narayen : If you look at the rhythm of how we\u2019ve managed the business, certainly, you look at what happens with education in Q4, you look at the enterprise, which tends to be a seasonally strong Q4. You start to look at what's happening with the emerging businesses that will continue to ramp. And so, it's a combination I think somebody else alluded to pricing, and we'll have a full quarter of pricing as well. And so, when you put all of those together, every Q3 to Q4 we see a seasonal uptick. And if you look at what happened even last year, and you look at what the numbers look like it's something that we know we're going to go drive. Keith Weiss : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Tyler Radke with Citi. Tyler Radke : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about the CDP space. I think you talked about your revenue, they're doubling year-over-year. I guess just a couple of questions. Number one, how significant is CDP as part of the overall experience businesses is a growth driver; and two, could you just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape. This is something that Sales force talked a lot about, on their last earnings call. We've seen amplitude recently launched a CDP. So how do you kind of see all this evolving? And how do you think this plays out? Thank you. David Wadhwani : Thanks Tyler. Yes, but let me take the big picture first on what we see with the overall CDP market. First of all, all the interest in CDP is a great validation of the fact that the traditional CRM is not the way to go to build the next generation, customer experience. Some of the data might be there, but you really need to activate the data and construct a rich profile before you can activate that. So if we look at the CDP market, what we see is, from our perspective, it's the platform for full customer engagement. And then that involves a number of different components. You look at the data collection that's required. And we built a lot of connectors, not only with our apps, we have over 100 connectors out there for the data collection, then you need to be able to assemble that into a real time database so that you can make the next best action the next best offer. We call it personalization at scale to millions of people in milliseconds. And that real time customer profile needs to be activated. And third, it then becomes the platform for not just the apps in our portfolio. But then for example, the integration we have with Dynamics, for example, with customer service, or the integration we have with ServiceNow, and so on, it needs to become the customer data platform that serves the entire range of customer facing applications. That's the way we look at CDP. That's what makes it a broad and exciting market. And that's really where we're differentiated where when we talk to customers, I mean, I'll give you the examples of say CVS, and NFL and so on, they recognize and agree with that vision. And that's why they're betting on us. And most of the players you see do one piece of it and don't really have the either the comprehensive nature of the product in their portfolio, or the real ability to pull it off in a true real time manner. Shantanu Narayen : Maybe the one thing I would add to all of that is, we have 32 billion profiles right now. I mean, clearly every customer has their profile kept isolated. So we're clearly the leader as it relates to you know, large companies that have a CDP in the market. That's well done. Tyler Radke : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay, thank you for taking the question. Can you talk about the Express Your Brand program, obviously, Meta has huge small business reach, but it will be helpful to get your expectations on what this partnership will do for Adobe incrementally. Thanks. David Wadhwani : Yes, so happy to do that. It's been a it's actually a very exciting program for us. So as you know, Adobe Express is predominantly focused on communicators, small medium businesses, as they start to move more online. We've talked a lot about the rise of the creative economy, we've mentioned that there are hundreds of millions of small medium businesses that are really targeting more online communication and really focus on social media, in fact that in a recent survey, we found that the majority of small medium businesses actually say that their online presence is more important than their physical presence. And so they need to do coordinate and communicate digitally and our ability to provide with meta provide all the tools that they need end-to-end to build incredible content that stands out and participate in the online experience that that meta is providing. And, of course, also work more broadly across all the other social networks, I think, is a really great opportunity for meta, for us and certainly for the small medium business owners that are part of that program. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay, thank you. Jonathan Vaas : Hi, operator, we're coming up on the top of the hour. We'll take two more questions, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Hey thank you very much, Shantanu and team. This upcoming maybe recession is the one that everybody has been predicting. And the company has, as David said, has been through a couple of recessions before. The company's a very different company today than it was even just a few years ago. What is your best prognosis as to how the portfolio of Adobe products behaves if we are to enter a downturn, not that we wish it but if we are to enter one, how do you think the portfolio is positioned? And in the financial angle are you prepared to at all slow down firing? The beauty of the subscription model is that the instant start on hiring and produce nice margin upset that sort of thing from a financial perspective, but curious to get your thoughts overall on this particular topic Shantanu Narayen : Sure, let me first cover your second part cash as it relates to the bottom line. And our philosophy right now, given all of the myriad opportunities that we have is, we're planning for the upside, we know how to react to the downside, when that happens. I mean, look at what's happened with the tax rate, and the team, and the financial team and the product teams, what they were able to do to really address all of that is truly remarkable. I mean, we take it for granted at the company, but we've done an amazing, amazing job at continuing to be extremely profitable. For me, I think, when you talk about a recession, the question I ask people is, when you look at the three things that Adobe does, which is focus on content, focus on automation, focus on customer engagement, I just don't look at any of those and feel like the secular trend for that will change. So there may be some change in the rhythm of that quarter-over-quarter. But the fundamental shift of what we are doing, I mean, Anil talked about this real time CDP customer engagement is going to be the only thing that differentiates a business from another business, and the success that we're seeing in healthcare, clearly points to that as well. So, we\u2019ll navigate it, we have an incredibly experienced management team. We're planning for the upside right now, which is all of our growth initiatives and will react as appropriate. And we are clearly not going to be in denial. But right now, it feels like a very strong time for Adobe to continue to execute against the things that we have on our plate. David Wadhwani : Yes, just want to build a little bit on the first part of Shantanu\u2019s answer. We talked about offsetting some of the headwinds we see. We talked about the increase in tax rate. We talked about the FX headwind into the back half of the year. In Q1, we discussed the impact we were seeing from the war in Ukraine. When we take the effects and the impact we discussed in Q1, that's a $250 million revenue, headwind in the back half of the year, the increase in tax rate is about a $0.25 a share impactful year. When I net both of those together, we would expect to see about $0.60 to $0.70 a share erosion of the earnings power of the company. And to Shantanu\u2019s point, it really underscores a philosophy that's underpinned how this company has operated for a very long time. It's about focused execution. It's about operating discipline. And the fact that the full year targets have come down $0.20 when the map would suggest it should be much greater than that just really underscores the power of the model. We're investing for innovation. We're investing to serve our customers, but we're doing it in a very focused and disciplined way. And I think that says a lot about who we are as a company. Kash Rangan : Thank you, Dan. Operator : And our last question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Excellent, thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on a strong Q2. My question is for David. David, we've seen reports of the trial, you're running in Canada for a free browser based version of Photoshop, which I assume is another Express like offering to build top of funnel interest and awareness. Can you share more about the strategy here? And how you think about the balance of more simplified products, creating incremental demand versus competing with more premium skews? David Wadhwani : Yes, absolutely happy to talk about that. We are very excited about the work we're doing here. Frankly, not just with Adobe Express but with Photoshop, as we mentioned here with Lightroom, as we've done in the past, and also with, with Acrobat. Our focus has always been to take the strengths that we have in the desktop and build a multi surface experience for our customers across desktop, mobile and web. And as we've done that, we've noticed that web and mobile really represents an opportunity to broaden our audience in a very significant way. And we do that by capturing search, traffic and at the point of intent, bringing them into the zero friction web experience with a freemium model. And so PS web and what you're seeing there is a step along that journey for our core imaging franchise. And we absolutely anticipate it being a source of funnel opportunity, similar to the way that that Acrobat has seen Acrobat web as a source of that funnel activity. You see how strong the core Acrobat businesses and how it's performing. We have a version of Acrobat web that's available we've been able to double traffic to that. And we now have over 50 million monthly active users, leveraging Acrobat web. And we use that as a top of leveraging Acrobat web on a monthly active basis. And we're able to leverage that and convert that traffic into real business. We're playing that same playbook now with Photoshop as well. And we expect that to be a very productive opportunity. Brad Zelnick : Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I think if I were to add to that, I mean, really, in effect, what we do is we look at platforms in an unbelievably expensive way. And on any platform, just making sure that we get the magic of our technology and as friction free way possible, is part of what we are continuing to do. And we have a unbelievably rigorous process also or then really understanding how to monetize it. So some of the press releases may be a little bit more sensationalistic, in terms of how they announced that, Brad. But since that was the last question, I just have to say we're proud of how we're executing against our strategy. I mean, everybody would have knowledge that it's an uncertain macroeconomic environment. But we believe that we will continue to win by delivering great innovative products that at the end of the day delight and ever increasing for our set of customers. We're making some very creative marketing campaigns. We have strong sales and go-to-market motions that are appropriate for the set of customers that we're targeting. And I think we're the being the best users of our product, which actually gives us tremendous credibility, to both innovate at a rapid pace, as well as deliver great customer satisfaction and growth to our customers worldwide. So thank you for joining us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Great, thanks. Thanks everyone for joining the call. We look forward to speaking to many of you soon and this does conclude the event. Thank you.",

The information discussed on this call, including our financial targets and product plans is as of today, September 15th and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainty and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements. For a discussion of these risks, you should review the factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and then Adobe\u2019s SEC filings. On this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our reported results include GAAP growth rates, as well as adjusted growth rates in constant currency. During this presentation, Adobe\u2019s executives will refer to constant currency growth rates unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations between the two are available in our earnings release and on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Jonathan, and thank you for joining us. Adobe had another record quarter, achieving $4.43 billion in revenue, which represents 15% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.42 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.40. In our Digital Media business, we achieved $3.23 billion in revenue. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $449 million and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to $13.40 billion. In our Experience Cloud business, we achieved $1.12 billion in revenue and subscription revenue was $981 million. In this digital-first world, Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud have become even more mission-critical to an increasingly wide range of customers, from students to creative professionals to small businesses to the world\u2019s largest enterprises. Fueled by our groundbreaking technology, track record of creating and leading categories and consistently strong execution, our opportunity is larger than ever before. Adobe\u2019s greatness has been rooted in defining new categories and platforms and delivering cutting-edge solutions through both organic innovation and inorganic acquisitions. Throughout our history, Adobe\u2019s innovations have touched billions of lives around the globe. From revolutionizing imaging and creative expression with Photoshop, to pioneering electronic documents through PDF, to creating the digital marketing category with Adobe Experience Cloud, Adobe continues to invent and transform categories. We are in the golden age of design and we believe we have a unique opportunity to usher in a new era of collaborative creative computing.  I am thrilled to share that today we announced our intention to acquire Figma, a leading web-first design platform that will help us accelerate this vision. Figma enables designers, developers and all stakeholders to collaborate in the product design process from ideation to design to delivery. The combination of Adobe and Figma will significantly expand our reach and market opportunity while making the creative process more accessible and productive to more people.  I will now turn it over to David to share more about our vision for Adobe and Figma and momentum in the Digital Media business. David? David Wadhwani : It\u2019s an exciting day for Adobe and Figma. Figma\u2019s mission is to help teams collaborate visually and make design accessible to all. Dylan Field, Figma\u2019s CEO, and his team launched Figma as the first design tool purpose-built for the web in 2012. Figma and FigJam make it possible for all stakeholders designing interactive mobile and web applications to collaborate through multi-player workflows, sophisticated design systems and a rich extensible developer ecosystem. Figma has built an incredible product and an outstanding business, delivering world-class ARR growth and net dollar retention with a disciplined and efficient operating model. Figma has attracted a new generation of millions of designers and developers and a loyal student following. To give you a sense of their scale and financial success, Figma is expected to add approximately $200 million in net new ARR this year, surpassing $400 million in total ARR exiting 2022, with greater than 150% net dollar retention rate. With a total addressable market of $16.5 billion by 2025, Figma is just getting started. Adobe has always been focused on empowering everyone to create digital experiences, and the combination of Adobe and Figma is the perfect better together opportunity. The combination of Adobe and Figma will create new opportunities and accelerate our strategy in a few ways. First, reimagining the future of creativity and productivity, Adobe and Figma share a passion for helping individuals and teams be more creative and productive. Adobe and Figma now have a new opportunity to make content creation more efficient, collaborative and fun by bringing together Adobe Express, Acrobat and FigJam, an online whiteboarding solution for teams. With the combination of these products, we can offer tremendous value to hundreds of millions of customers. Second, accelerating creativity on the web, as creativity becomes increasingly collaborative, the web makes it easier for teams to create together. Figma\u2019s web-based, multi-player platform can accelerate the delivery of Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud technologies on the web, making the creative process accessible to more people. This will dramatically increase Adobe\u2019s reach and addressable market opportunity. Third, advancing product design, web and mobile applications are increasingly underpinning how we live and work. This is driving explosive growth in the product design category. The combination of Adobe and Figma will benefit all stakeholders in the product design process, from designers to product managers to developers, by bringing powerful capabilities from Adobe\u2019s imaging, photography, illustration, video, 3D and font technologies into the Figma platform over time. And fourth, empowering and expanding the community, throughout our history, Adobe\u2019s community has been a constant source of inspiration and a catalyst for innovation. Figma has a thriving community who develop and share everything from tutorials, templates and plug-ins with their large and growing ecosystem. The combination of our communities will bring designers and developers closer together to unlock the future of collaborative design. Adobe and Figma could not be a better match, our people, innovative technology and joint mission to democratize creativity and collaboration will deliver increased value to a growing base of customers. I look forward to welcoming Dylan and the entire Figma team to Adobe once the transaction closes. The acquisition of Figma could not come at a more exciting time for Adobe\u2019s Digital Media business, which surpassed $13 billion in ARR this quarter, growing 16% year-over-year exiting the quarter. Adobe Creative Cloud remains the world\u2019s creative engine, empowering everyone to create whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. In Q3, we achieved net new Creative Cloud ARR of $330 million and revenue of $2.63 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year. Q3 highlights include; strong momentum for Adobe Express, with significant growth in new users. Adobe Express is serving an expansive universe of creative professionals, communicators and knowledge workers, from students to small business owners to social influencers. It\u2019s exciting to see the rapid innovation we are delivering to enable millions of customers to create standout multimedia content. Adobe Express has thousands of templates, millions of stock assets and quick action functionality that make it easy to do any creative task. Millions of new users are coming to Adobe Express, driven by viral adoption and our creative marketing campaigns. Fast Company recently named Adobe Express one of the best new productivity apps of 2022. Strength in our Photoshop and Lightroom offerings across desktop and mobile, tailwinds in our video segment for Premiere Pro and Frame.io, our integrated video editing and collaboration offering, demand for our Substance products, as brands across every industry embrace 3D and immersive content as a new medium, and momentum in the Adobe Stock business, emphasizing the importance of content velocity for businesses of all sizes. And finally, we are really excited about Adobe MAX, the world\u2019s largest creativity conference. It will be held in Los Angeles and streamed live for our global community. In addition to unveiling amazing new Creative Cloud innovations, we will hear from luminaries including renowned film directors, artists and musicians. Now on to our Document Cloud business. Digital documents are enabling individuals and businesses to be productive in a digital-first world. With more than 300 billion PDFs opened and more than 8 billion digital signatures processed each year, Adobe Document Cloud is accelerating document productivity and workflows across web, desktop and mobile. Document Cloud had its best Q3 ever, achieving net new Document Cloud ARR of $119 million and record revenue of $607 million, which grew 25% year-over-year. Q3 highlights include; continued adoption of PDF across every computing surface, with over 2.6 billion cumulative installs of Acrobat and Reader; significant enhancements to the Acrobat web experience, making popular verbs like view, edit and collaborate easier than ever and adding accessibility capabilities such as Read out Loud and High Contrast support. Acrobat Web MAU continues to see tremendous growth, driven by the high volume of web searches for document actions. Strong growth in Adobe Sign, driven by integrated e-signature functionality in Acrobat; integrated workflows between Acrobat Desktop, Acrobat Web and Adobe Express; and key enterprise customer wins, including Amazon, Boeing, Chubb, Lloyds Bank and ServiceNow. Demand for our industry-leading Digital Media products remains strong across a growing base of customers. We are accelerating momentum across the business with continued product innovation, strong go-to-market capabilities and a proven data-driven operating model. I will now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello everyone. One thing has become abundantly clear in this environment, digital has become the critical channel to engage customers and drive growth. Across the globe, companies in every industry are prioritizing investments in software solutions and services that enable them to anticipate and meet the expectations of their consumers. Customer Experience Management is an imperative and Adobe is the category leader. Adobe Experience Cloud delivers predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences, from acquisition to monetization to retention, across content and commerce, customer journeys, data insights and audiences and marketing workflow. In particular, we are driving strong enterprise adoption of Adobe Experience Platform and Real-Time CDP which are foundational to this next-generation enterprise architecture. FC Bayern, one of the world\u2019s most successful football clubs, is leveraging Adobe Experience Cloud and Real-Time CDP to transform their fan experience. This gives them a holistic view of every fan\u2019s engagement online and offline, enabling them to deliver personalized experiences such as discounts at the stadium or an immersive shopping experience for viewers at home. In Q3, we continued to drive strong Experience Cloud growth, achieving a record $1.12 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $981 million for the quarter, representing 15% year-over-year growth. Q3 highlights include; strong momentum for Adobe Experience Platform and AEP-native applications, with the book of business more than doubling year over year; significant growth for Adobe Commerce, underscoring the demand for digital storefronts and marketplaces; Experience Cloud was named a leader for the sixth consecutive year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Commerce and achieved the highest position in the Forrester Wave for Enterprise Marketing Suites; and key customer wins, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Morgan Stanley, NASA, Qualcomm, T-Mobile and UnitedHealth Group. Looking forward, Adobe is leading an explosive growth category that is increasingly important to enterprises of all sizes. Adobe is well-positioned to help enterprises deliver exceptional customer experiences with industry-leading platforms and applications, a strong track record of deploying solutions successfully for thousands of customers and a proven ability to deliver the next-generation architecture for Customer Experience Management. Dan, over to you. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Today I will start by summarizing Adobe\u2019s performance in Q3 fiscal 2022, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, then I will discuss the announced acquisition of Figma and I will finish with financial targets. Adobe delivered a solid Q3, continuing to demonstrate that our products are mission critical to our customer\u2019s success in any macro environment, from the millions of individuals who use our offerings to create digital content, to the small businesses that run their document workflows on Adobe, to the large enterprises that have transformed how they interact with their end users by providing personalization at scale. Q3 business and financial highlights included; record revenue of $4.43 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.40; Digital Media revenue of $3.23 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $449 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.12 billion; cash flows from operations of $1.70 billion; RPO of $14.11 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 5.1 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 13% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 or 16% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $13.40 billion of Digital Media ARR. We saw expected summer seasonality in the quarter, with the overall acquisition and engagement environment for our offerings remaining strong. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.63 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We added $330 million of net new Creative ARR in the quarter. Third quarter Creative growth drivers included; momentum in small and medium businesses with our Teams offering, where we continue to drive strong new customer acquisition and are seeing engagement and retention at all-time highs; strong growth in our Illustrator and InDesign businesses; demand for our flagship photography, imaging and video applications; Adobe Stock where we continue to drive strong book of business growth; and momentum in our new growth initiatives, such as Frame.io and Substance, each of which grew ending ARR greater than 50% year-over-year exiting the quarter. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $607 million, which represents 23% year-over-year growth or 25% in constant currency. We added $119 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter, our strongest Q3 to-date. Third quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included; accelerated adoption of PDF and Adobe Reader across multiple surfaces; growth of Acrobat Web, fueled by online searches for PDF and document actions; strong performance of Acrobat and Adobe Sign; performance of our reseller channel continuing to drive new Document Cloud subscriptions, particularly with small and medium businesses; and continued seat expansion in the enterprise. In August we began to roll out the new Acrobat integrated with Sign offering, which included updated pricing. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q3 we achieved revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents 14% year-over-year growth or 15% in constant currency. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $981 million. Third quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included; strong retention, upsell and enterprise bookings in the quarter across our solutions, particularly in the U.S.; success closing numerous million-dollar deals, as well as larger transformational deals that span our portfolio of solutions; continued momentum with our foundational Adobe Experience Platform and Real-Time CDP business, with our book of business for Platform and AEP-native applications more than doubling year-over-year exiting the quarter; success integrating our solutions with workflow, including Workfront, which grew revenue greater than 35% year-over-year in the quarter; and higher customer demand for professional services, as enterprises focus on implementations and value realization. In Q3, we focused on making disciplined investments to drive growth, including a strong class of university hires and marketing campaigns to raise awareness of new and flagship offerings. We continue to have world-class operating margins and drove strong EPS performance in the quarter. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q3 was 22% on a GAAP basis and 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate came in lower primarily due to benefits associated with share-based payments. The non-GAAP tax rate came in lower primarily due to additional U.S. income tax credits. RPO exiting the quarter was $14.11 billion, growing 12% year-over-year or 15% when factoring in a 3% foreign exchange headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $5.76 billion and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.70 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In Q3 we repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares at a cost of $1.80 billion, including shares received for the final settlement of our ASR entered into in December 2021. We currently have $8.3 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020 which goes through 2024. As Shantanu and David mentioned, we are thrilled about the opportunity to acquire Figma, which will accelerate Adobe\u2019s strategy. Under the definitive agreement, we have agreed to acquire Figma for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma\u2019s CEO and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is expected to close in 2023, subject to regulatory approvals. We plan to finance the cash portion of the consideration with cash on hand, and if necessary, a term loan, to be paid down from our operating cash flows following the closing. Figma\u2019s products address a $16.5 billion market opportunity and the company has an impressive financial profile. This year they are expected to add $200 million in net new ARR, surpassing $400 million total ARR by the end of the year, with greater than 150% net dollar retention. They have a disciplined, efficient operating model, with gross margins of approximately 90% and positive operating cash flows. Figma have strong business momentum, a large and expanding customer base and we are incredibly excited about what we can bring to this combination from a financial perspective. While this transaction is primarily about creating new markets, expanding adjacent opportunities and accelerating growth, we are committed to maintaining Adobe\u2019s strong profitability and maximizing EPS for our investors. In year one and two after closing, the transaction will be dilutive to Adobe\u2019s non-GAAP EPS and we expect it to be breakeven in year three and accretive at the end of year three. While the transaction has not yet closed, I want to provide color on the path to non-GAAP EPS accretion as a combined company exiting year three, assuming Adobe\u2019s operating margin for the second half of fiscal 2022 as the baseline. The combination will accelerate top-line growth for both Adobe and Figma based on three primary drivers; one, we extend Figma\u2019s reach to our customers and through our global go-to-market footprint; two, Figma accelerates the delivery of new Adobe offerings on the web to the next generation of users; and three, we jointly introduce new offerings to market as we unlock the possibilities of collaborative creativity. Clearly the explosive revenue growth of Figma combined with their efficient operating model would result in an expanding standalone operating margin. Figma\u2019s innovative technology platform will accelerate our R&D roadmap including the delivery of our Creative Cloud technologies on the web, which will allow Adobe to focus and manage our future R&D investments. We will quickly pay down any term loan, if necessary, after close and then resume stock repurchases to reduce Adobe\u2019s share count. While the transaction is pending, at a minimum we expect to maintain share repurchases sufficient to offset the dilution of equity issuances to Adobe employees. We will now provide Q4 targets, which factor in the overall macroeconomic environment; FX headwinds, as the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against foreign currencies; and typical year-end seasonal strength in demand for our offerings. As a result, for Q4 we are targeting; total Adobe revenue of approximately $4.52 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $550 million; Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 10% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency; tax rate of approximately 23% on a GAAP basis and 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis; and GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.44 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.50. In summary, Adobe continues to drive performance across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud, while making transformational investments in strategic growth initiatives. I look forward to sharing more about our growth opportunities next month in Los Angeles at Adobe\u2019s Financial Analyst meeting. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. It was great to be back on the road this quarter meeting customers and partners as businesses return to a new hybrid work model. I was inspired and energized welcoming our new hires and meeting Adobe employees across multiple sites who will together drive the next phase of innovation, growth and culture. Adobe\u2019s strength has always come from our most important asset, people. I am incredibly proud of the recognition we continue to receive as a great place to work. This quarter, Adobe was named to Fast Company\u2019s Best Workplace for Innovators and Fortune\u2019s Best Workplaces in Tech. Next week, we will hold our Adobe for All conference to bring employees together to celebrate our shared values of diversity, equity and inclusion. It is an exciting time at Adobe. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is working. We are delivering on our innovative product roadmap, driving growth across new and established businesses and delighting a growing universe of customers. In addition to achieving all this success, we continue to look around the corner for new transformational opportunities that will drive decades of growth for Adobe. We believe that every individual, team and business will strive to be more creative and productive in this digital era. Adobe has a unique opportunity to usher in a world of collaborative creativity. In my conversations with Dylan at Figma, it became abundantly clear that together we could accelerate this new vision, delivering great value to our customers and shareholders. I look forward to welcoming Figma into the Adobe family upon close of the transaction. We look forward to seeing you at MAX and closing the year strong. Now, we will take questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Hello. Thank you very much. Congratulations on really massive step forward to the management team. Shantanu and team, I wonder if you can talk about the persona of Figma and if there is any overlap at all between what Adobe wanted to be in the future with its a Creative family and where Figma is growing -- was going, and if you net it out, what is the incremental opportunity. It looks like $16 billion TAM, but your own Creative business, you outline as having a more than a $40 billion TAM. So I am wondering what the TAM could look like for Figma in the future as it integrates into Adobe, you identify new personas. And for Dan three years to breakeven, it sounds like there are some conservative assumptions built in especially because Figma is generating cash. I am wondering what your assumptions are for that the rather lengthy duration to breakeven. Thank you so much and congrats. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Kash, and congratulations to you as well for the conference that is happening right now and given our quiet period as you know we can\u2019t attend. But let me take a step back and talk about why we believe this is a fundamentally transformative move for Adobe. When we think about the future of what\u2019s happening with creativity, and in a sense, what\u2019s going to happen as it relates to multiple people engaging in that with respect to collaboration, we just believe that this is going to be an incredible value and a way to attract a whole bunch of new customers to the combined platform. When you think about Adobe, certainly we target knowledge workers, we target communicators, we target creative professionals. Figma really focuses a lot also on developers, they focus very much on the other stakeholders, who are involved in the product design process. So when we talk about the fact that Figma has a $16 billion TAM, that\u2019s referring to the TAM as it exist today, in terms of what they are doing, both as it relates to product design, as well as that would relates to collaborative whiteboarding and ideation, which as you know, say, FigJam this incredible product that has, I believe, a much, much larger available addressable opportunity. But if you take a really what we think is the massive opportunity and putting this together. I think there are four aspects that are really exciting for us. First, there is going to be a next-generation of Creative collaboration that happens in the industry, and we believe that the combination of the two companies enable us to really position Adobe and deliver great value for this Creative collaboration industry. Second, we continue to believe that we can accelerate what it means to create on the web. What Figma has done is they have delivered a really incredible technology platform and solved the number of the issues that need to be solved to allow multiple people to collaborate on the web. Third, we think that we can advance product design and if you take the decades of Adobe technology that exists, our imaging technology, our vector technology, the video technology that we have and think about what that means to bring that to the web and dramatically increase the number of customers who can then benefit from it. And last but not least, I think, to your question. This is now really addresses that sort of Holy Grail of anybody creating a mobile application, anybody creating a website, anybody creating an application for any device that has a screen, combining what we can do on the designers, developers and the stakeholders to make that happen. So I think today, what we shared with you is what they talk about as their addressable market opportunity, what we talk about as ours. But I think the real benefit of this combination is creating brand new markets, much like we have done with Digital Experience and other industries that we are part of. So thank you and we are really excited about this. Dan Durn : Yeah. Then from an accretion standpoint, first and foremost, this deal is about growth. This is about positioning the company to define new categories and drive growth for decades to come. And as we think about that growth trajectory, walked into -- walked through a number of those drivers. It\u2019s about extending the performance of that platform as part of the combined company, getting it access to our customers and our go-to-market global -- go-to-market footprint. It\u2019s about accelerating the delivery of new Adobe offerings on the web and then jointly introduce new offerings as we unlock those possibilities in collaborative creativity. This gives us an opportunity to focus and manage the R&D investments as we drive that roadmap and striking the balance between accelerating the growth and preserving that growth trajectory, but doing it in a disciplined way. We are going to deliver a tremendous amount of value over time to investors. Starting in year two post close, you will see our EPS growth rate faster than our overall revenue growth, will be accretive exiting year three and we are poised to deliver a lot of value. Kash Rangan : Wonderful. Thank you so much and best wishes. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Thank you very much and congratulations. This is obviously a big moment for Adobe. It\u2019s pretty clear what Figma brings to the table in terms of innovation, collaboration and communities, and I appreciate the comments about Figma helping to further webify core Adobe products. But what do you say to the perspective that this $20 billion acquisition seems more reactive versus proactive? And perhaps more importantly, how do we get comfortable that Adobe\u2019s organic innovation engine is alive and well for capturing the trends and opportunities that lie ahead in Creative? Shantanu Narayen : Brad, it\u2019s a good question and I understand that in these markets, in particular, acquisitions and maybe large ones are viewed with some skepticism. We certainly believe and I will talk about it that Figma will be a transformative deal for the customers and industries and it dramatically increases our TAM. We can deliver great value to an increasing set of customers. But I also want to reassure all of you and if you look at our results, this in no way changes our focus or our excitement on our current portfolio. We are growing well, and we are demonstrating strength across all of our three cloud offerings and we continue to execute against our current initiatives. And so if you look at the multiple internal businesses that are achieving velocity, whether it\u2019s Adobe Experience platform and the apps that are built natively on top of it, what\u2019s happening with 3D and immersive, what\u2019s happening with Acrobat Forms, what\u2019s happening with Frame. This is additive. And when opportunities like this present themselves, Brad, I think it\u2019s the great companies that look at it and say, are you going to focus on the here and now only or are you going to seize on the opportunity that really positions Adobe for the next few decades. And so it\u2019s a great question. We understand that there will be questions associated with valuation. We certainly believe that it provides valuation to our shareholders as well. When you look at what this means for us, but in no way diminishes my excitement around our current portfolio. Brad Zelnick : Very fair. Thank you and look forward to seeing it all on display at MAX next month. Thanks, guys. Congrats. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you, Brad. Operator : We can go to Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. So I will start with a non-Figma question and then layer in Figma. I guess, Shantanu, can you talk, or David, can you guys give us the kind of lay of the land on the demand environment, how it trended throughout the quarter, obviously, a lot of companies are seeing some elongation of deal cycles, descoping, even our channel checks on the Digital Experience side suggested that their deals are taking longer to close as they are requiring a lot more signatures. So, I guess, first of all, what are you seeing in the demand environment and what are -- because one of the questions we are getting from investors is why now, given that we may be entering a more recessionary environment, couldn\u2019t you have done this type of a transaction cheaper later, so that\u2019s kind of how I want to weave this in? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. Let me address the first part, which was your second part of the question, which is why now. Again, and as I said, we just believe that this new vision that we can create for, what we can do with collaborative creativity, there\u2019s no time like the present to start working on top of it. And when opportunities like this present themselves, you have to act upon it rather than kicking that can down the road, Alex. So, from my perspective, we know how to make this deliver great value to our customers. I will have David also speak to the demand environment and the Creative side. On the Enterprise side, as we said, we had strong results. I mean the AEP plus apps business, that book of business is doubling, which really reflects the foundational aspects of what we are delivering. But it -- again, I go back to -- opportunities like this present themselves rarely and Figma is one of those rare companies that has achieved the kind of escape velocity and technology platform that they have. But we equally believe that it\u2019s even rarer for a company like Adobe to be able to take advantage of what they deliver and actually accelerate it and provide greater value and so from my perspective, there\u2019s no time like the present. David Wadhwani : Yeah. And on the Digital Media side, we began the year with a guide of $1.9 billion, and of course, we hope to beat that. And in the context of everything happening in the macro, if you look at Q1, Q2, Q3 and our guide for Q4, we are at $1.88 billion and in the context of everything happening in the world, we are very proud of this performance. And of course, we are an aggressive company. We hope to beat that number. And all the leading indicators remained strong. New user acquisition is strong, engagement and retention continues to be strong, monthly active users continue to be strong. And so we feel really good about the macro -- about our ability to navigate the macro despite what\u2019s happening in the world around us. And then in the context of as we start looking for opportunities to grow, we have so much product innovation coming out at -- and we will see a lot of it at MAX, accelerating what\u2019s happening in our flagship applications, what\u2019s happening around Express and the kinds of capabilities we are putting in there. We are seeing great growth and momentum in terms of use and NPS there, Photoshop and Illustrator coming to the web. We have a lot of share for review collaborative capabilities coming as well. And then as you look at the conversation around Figma, we have known Dylan for years and we have shared very common values and vision, and the opportunities to grow that business faster and the synergies we have in mind are -- just allow us to take what is already a strong business and make it even stronger and faster. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question is from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Brent Thill : Shan, you -- everyone\u2019s admired your ability to stay disciplined on M&A over the last decade and I guess many are kind of feeling like you broke the mold on this, and I think, everyone just wants to hear on the multiple, even if revenue doubled again, it would be over 25 times ARR. So what was it that was so special, and if you think about in the last few years, you have always said XD could carry you, why -- what happened with XD, what happens with XD now as it scales? Shantanu Narayen : So two things to that, Brent. The first is, I understand that what you are saying in effect is some people will say, hey, show me how this value is accruing to Adobe shareholders as well and we certainly believe that otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be doing it and we do believe that it will be value-generating for the Adobe shareholders. I think as it relates to XD and as it relates to Figma, I mean, we certainly, for designers, we are targeting what needed to happen as it related to screen design with the desktop product. I think the much newer market that emerged, which Figma effectively both addressed and pioneered was the ability to do this in a collaborative way and dramatically increase the scale, and they over the last decade, have really invested in and solve some of the hard technical problems that existed to make this happen on the web friction-free. So from our perspective, the Creative products continue to be strong, the ability to really tie the designers and developers is really where there\u2019s this unique opportunity, as well as to create new markets. I mean I will give you one more sort of what-if scenario in terms of how we think about it, which is you combine what they have done with whiteboarding and ideation, and what will be the future of work, and if you think about the presence of Acrobat and what we have with Acrobat or if you think about the notion of brainstorming and what happens with FigJam, with what happens with Adobe Express, I think the opportunities are tremendous. I understand that there will be some sentiment associated with the price, and ball\u2019s in our court to go demonstrate how we execute against our current initiatives, as well as to demonstrate the value of this new one. Brent Thill : Thanks, Shantanu. Operator : We can go to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. One just a real brief one on Figma, I don\u2019t want to beat that horse too much and then some questions on the core business. On Figma, we have definitely heard a lot about them in the field and it\u2019s a great asset you guys are acquiring. It does seem like it overlaps pretty directly with InDesign. So can you talk a little bit about sort of the -- is there a rationalization of those two products or is Figma just kind of the go-forward product there? And then on the core business, last week -- not last week, last quarter you gave us a little bit of an update on kind of how pricing was impacted -- impacting Digital Media and net new ARR. I was hoping to get an update on sort of how the pricing impact flow through this quarter. And then on the margin front, it looks like you guys pulled back on hiring a little bit, can you talk to us about the pace of investments on a go-forward basis and whether that\u2019s going to be a little bit more measured given the macro impact starting to build up? Thank you very much. David Wadhwani : Yeah. I will start by talking about InDesign and Figma. They are very different products at the core. InDesign is around building print and publishing workflows and doing layout. Figma is really all about enabling product design and a collaborative product design model. In fact, if you look at InDesign, it\u2019s our traditional base of users, predominantly designers that are using it. One of the things that\u2019s really interesting about Figma is the makeup of their user base. In fact, two-thirds of their users are not designers, they are developers and other stakeholders in the process, and the foundation of that collaborative model is what makes this such a special and accretive acquisition for us. If you think about going forward, the primary focus is going to be about bringing Figma into the family and then taking all of the capabilities we have across illustration and video and creative imaging and building it on top of the Figma platform to enable a whole new generation of capabilities that are going to resonate with digital native and next-generation creative professionals, and we are very excited about them. The two products are quite different. Dan Durn : Yeah. Then from an investment standpoint, one of the great things about Adobe is, is we have got tremendous growth opportunities. We have got an opportunity to drive the core franchise to $30 billion to $40 billion of revenue. But we are going to do what we have always done, which is invest in a disciplined way and drive that growth with strong profitability and strong cash flow and so we will do what we have always done. We are going to orient towards growth. We are back utilizing our facilities. We are investing to scale our business. We are investing in our products, go-to-market marketing. We are driving PLG motions, but we are going to do it in a disciplined way that delivers strong profitability and cash flow, while growing this business in a strong and robust way. So we will do what we have always done, operating a disciplined business. Keith Weiss : Got it. And on the pricing side? David Wadhwani : Yeah. On the pricing side, first of all, pricing for us is all about value. The business that we have been building is all based on new user acquisition, upselling, and of course, occasionally pricing moves and the pricing is always associated with added value. So on the Creative side we have been adding lots of apps. We have been enabling Frame.io integration into Creative -- into our Creative Cloud applications. We have been building a lot of share and review workflows, as an example, a lot of stock and content images in there as well and then on the Acrobat Pro side, we have been doing a lot more deep integration with Sign around bulk signatures, branding, web forms payments. So the foundation is that pricing is always connected to the real value that we are adding, and in doing that, we continue to see pricing play out the way we expected and all of this was baked into what we had planned for the year. Operator : Next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America Securities. Brad Sills : Oh! Great. Thanks so much. Another question here on Figma, it looks like the company is well positioned for designer, developer use cases, much like Frame.io for video editing, bringing you into more of those use cases really extending the reach for Creative Cloud. I guess the question is, where does Creative Cloud end up, where does that footprint end and the Figma footprint began? In other words, could you see a scenario where this acquisition and these use cases bring through -- pull-through more sales of Creative Cloud subscriptions? Shantanu Narayen : I think the three ways in which we look at that. First, in terms of the customers for Figma, I think, as David mentioned, the number of developers who are part of this products set is actually extremely extensive. But in addition to the product set associated with Figma design for developers, as well as stakeholders, I do want to again emphasize the product fit as it relates to FigJam for anybody who\u2019s a knowledge worker and anybody who wants to ideate. So if you think about the value of ideation and brainstorming. I mean the reality is, they have tens of millions of people who signed up and trialed Figma. We have hundreds of millions of people who have used our products and so the adjacency in terms of enabling both of those combined sets of customers to use each other\u2019s products, we continue to believe that drives great value. So this is really about, in our sense and then if you take Acrobat and the penetration that Acrobat has, everybody who\u2019s using Acrobat also wants to both share, as well as ideate and brainstorm. So I know there\u2019s a lot of questions around Figma design, which is clearly achieved escape velocity. I would urge you also to spend a little time looking at FigJam as I know you have and then you would really understand that, that also dramatically expands the customer base. So, yes, getting Creative Cloud to a more diverse set of customers on the web, allowing collaboration and enabling it much like you said with Frame. That\u2019s very much part of the strategy and that\u2019s why even in the press release, we talk about accelerating creativity on the web as one of the key pillars. Brad Sills : Thanks so much, Shantanu. Dan, one for you, please, if I could, you have talked about in the past some healthy pipeline build for Q4 backing your confidence for Digital Media ARR guidance based on some good pipeline activity there for Q4, any update on that, please? Thank you. Dan Durn : Yeah. No. It\u2019s playing out as we expected as we take a look at the enterprise business, closing million dollar plus deals, transformational deals as we look forward off of that momentum into Q4. Pipeline is building nicely. Team is doing a good job executing against the opportunity and it\u2019s playing out as expected. Brad Sills : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good morning. Shantanu, in some of your remarks and Dan in one of your bullet points regarding the rationale for Figma, you made some interesting references to their platform and accelerating your products on the Cloud. Are you suggesting perhaps that there\u2019s something in their DevOps, let\u2019s call it, that may lead ultimately to a material change in Adobe\u2019s product release cadence or product packaging? How do you see your portfolio evolving and your underlying R&D, let\u2019s call it, infrastructure or process, because there\u2019s something into in terms of how they develop products that I think you are hoping to splice in that kind of DNA? And then, secondly, it\u2019s not unprecedented for Adobe to purchase a dynamic competitor, we can go back many years, we have done this before. Maybe put this into context of some of those prior acquisitions where you bought a competitor that had meaningful either competitive impact or complementary technology and thinking, of course, about the material impact that the Macromedia acquisition had many years ago. Shantanu Narayen : So, Jay, let me first cover the first one and there\u2019s no doubt that what Figma has been able to do on the web by solving a lot of these multiplayer high scalability requirements to allow the tens of millions of people to use Figma design and even more important FigJam on the web, is an engineering marvel. And having access to that technology and being able to take advantage of it to dramatically increase anybody who\u2019s participating in our design products, whether they would be stakeholders and developers will, I think, dramatically increase our TAM as well. And so, first and foremost, their DevOps is great. I mean we certainly have a lot of that expertise on the Digital Experience side of the house as it relates to the trillions of transactions. But for the Creative, we really believe that this is one of the key pieces of technology that we are getting that are going to be really amazing. I think as it relates to your second question, we really view these as, when you have the right altitude, for us it\u2019s all about how do you take things that might seem competitive, but are actually more complementary and expand the nature of the market. And for me, when I think about what we did with Macromedia, it was really about saying. We are going to target more graphics professionals and not just focus on imaging. We are going to focus on what\u2019s happening with video on the web or gaming. And so I think it was an expansive part of how we looked at it. And that\u2019s the same situation here. For us, it\u2019s really not about what we had on the desktop. It\u2019s really about expanding to the web. Multi-surface is something that we have talked about a lot. It\u2019s about a community in many ways, Jay, and what they have done as it relates to their communities and plug-ins and how they have been able to use artificial intelligence, all of that also power we bring to bear to the combined. So from my perspective, this is really about adjacency. It\u2019s about complementary things that we have done. Certainly, we did have a presence in screen design on the desktop. But big picture this is all about dramatically expanding it and that\u2019s the conversation that David, Dylan, Scott and I have been having. And David, feel free to add to that. David Wadhwani : Yeah. From the beginning of the conversations with Dylan, the primary focus has been on things that we couldn\u2019t do individually. What are the things that we could do and bring to market that combining the two products and put -- two product sets into two companies could really enable a better-together story. And in particular, what we see is that we have this incredible wealth of technology and expertise around illustration and video and imaging and photography and 3D, all from -- coming from the lens of our flagship applications, and as Shantanu mentioned, they have built such a rich platform for collaboration. Bringing these things together allow us to re-imagine what the -- basically Creative -- content creation should look like in the future by taking our technology, integrating it on top of or building it on top of the Figma platform and then enabling a whole set of new use cases that would never have happened were it not for this combination. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats to all on the announcement. Dan, maybe for you, just to maybe focus on the core business for a minute and then loop in Figma. Are there any puts and takes with margins this year that we should keep in mind when thinking about organic margins next year, and of course, I understand you are guiding to it, but just sort of anything that you want us to note? And then on top of that, how do you think about the EBIT profitability for Figma and where that can go over time? Dan Durn : Sure. So let me take them in order. So as we think about our margins this year, I think, you can see the trajectory throughout the year. What I would say is what we are seeing in the back half of 2022, I think, is more reflective of the normalized environment. We talked about continuing to invest in the products, how we market those products, how we drive product led growth, how we are going to market. But also complementing it with repopulating the campuses, being back to in-person interaction, getting on planes and that\u2019s a bit more reflective of a normalized operating environment. So that\u2019s what I would say, think about maybe the second half of 2022 as a bit more of a normalized environment. As we think about margins in the context of Figma and the transaction, we talked a couple -- about a couple of things. We talked about this is about growth. This is delivering that growth in a disciplined way. So when I think about operating margins in that context, we talked about the second half of 2022 being that baseline more normalized run rate. And if I think about the first couple of years post close, year one, year two post close. Think about margins that are maybe 1 point to 2 points delta versus where we would be on a standalone basis. And then by the time we get to year three, I would expect it to be more neutral from an influence standpoint. And again, I also want to register the point that I mentioned earlier in Q&A. As we get past year one, we are going to start growing EPS faster than our revenue growth profile and so we feel good about that inflection point and driving it in a disciplined way. When we look at GAAP operating margins, obviously, you will see a bigger delta in the near-term. To account for the stock-based compensation, we really view that stock-based compensation to incentivize the employees to stay with the company and unlock those growth potentials and you will see that amortize over a four-year period consistent with our equity programs and then we will be back to a more normalized run rate after that amortization period. So you will see more impact on the GAAP side and we feel pretty good about the trajectory from a non-GAAP operating margin standpoint. Saket Kalia : Very, very helpful. Thanks, Dan. Congrats again. Dan Durn : Thanks. Jonathan Vaas : Hey, Operator. We are coming up on the top of the hour. Let\u2019s try to squeeze in two more questions please. Operator : Certainly. We can go straight to Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on a little bit more in the near-term in terms of your guidance for Q4. If we were in back to last year, you saw sort of a lower uplift around sort of the Black Friday selling period as compared to prior years. Now, obviously, going into this Q4 is always is you are a seasonally stronger business or enterprise spend period for Adobe, we are also going into that sort of that Black Friday period again, obviously. When you think about your guidance for Q4, what are you baking in compared to last year for sort of those Black Friday trends, but also that sort of seasonal uplift in the business spending? Shantanu Narayen : I think as we said in our prepared remarks, Phil, we are guiding in typical seasonality, Q4 tends to be a strong season both in terms of the enterprise business for us and closing the enterprise business and the pipeline that we have built over the year, as well as some consumer commerce days, as you mentioned and all of that is factored into the targets that we are guiding. We are not changing that based on anything different than we have seen. So I think we continue to believe that our business is resilient and if you look at the initial targets that we are providing, we would expect to have another strong seasonal close to the year. Phil Winslow : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And the final question today comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Hi. Thanks very much and congrats on the acquisition. Dan, I just wanted to follow up on your comments maybe on the dilution around the deal. I think just based on what Shantanu and all of you have said about sort of the complementary nature of the deal, the ability to expand the market. I think people are asking why isn\u2019t there more sort of synergy from a go-to-market perspective with this deal, meaning bringing Figma onto your platform would theoretically just turbocharge sales immediately given sort of your scale? So I just -- how much of that\u2019s baked into the dilution forecast or are you -- I realize it\u2019s early, but are you leaving that more for upside, because I think the length of the dilution given that this should be complementary from a go-to-market perspective, I think, is what\u2019s somewhat confusing to folks? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Well, certainly, for us, this is all about the top line growth and what -- if you look at actually what we would expect in terms of their continued growth and our continued growth, I think, the topline of both companies they would accelerate. And so I think maybe at the FA meeting, as we get more time, we are happy to share more color associated with it. But from my perspective, we actually think that we have a plan that allows us to really show the benefits of the combination, as well as continue to overachieve against those. Kirk Materne : Okay. Shantanu Narayen : And since that is the\u2026 Kirk Materne : Yeah. Shantanu Narayen : Go ahead. Kirk Materne : Just a follow-up on that. I just -- too difficult for us to, meaning you both can grow faster, are these new developers that require sort of new efforts to go get them from Adobe perspective. I am just trying to get a sense of the overlap of the opportunity would seemingly think that you guys combined could actually do it more effectively together, which would create greater operating leverage to a certain degree sooner. So I am just trying to -- I realize there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in the near term to this, but I was just kind of curious, is that what\u2019s sort of embedded in your expectations or are you sort of leaving that for to see what happens as you get, I guess, a little bit closer to the deal closing? Shantanu Narayen : I think for us, we are just factoring in everything, including the fact that this is a stock purchase and half of it is approximately in stock and what that means in terms of dilution. As we said, we will start to offset that. We have tremendous cash flow generation. But from our perspective, we are going to be aggressive about making sure that we continue to drive the topline and the bottomline. And so that is very much on our mind in terms of delivering great value to the customers in the industry and creating new opportunities. And from my perspective, what I do want to say, since that was the last question was, first and foremost, we are really excited about our current business. I mean the current business is growing at a great clip in this macroeconomic environment. We have multiple growth initiatives that are all demonstrating how mission-critical they are and how they are relevant they are in this new digital-first world where whether it\u2019s work, life, play, everything is going to be impacted by digital. So, first and foremost, we are very confident about our existing portfolio and the growth trajectory of the current portfolio. The addition of Figma, from my perspective, is the ability to turbocharge that in terms of both the opportunity that the company has, as well as the ability to serve ever broadening set of customers. And so I hope you all view that within that context, which is lot of confidence about our existing business and more excitement about making sure that we are setting in place greater future opportunities. We will look forward to having a lot of you at MAX. I hope you do come there. We are planning an FA part of that section as well and so we would be happy to share more with you when we join that. And with that, I will turn it over to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, Shantanu, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. This concludes the call.",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. 2022 was an exciting and eventful year for Adobe. We achieved record revenue of $17.61 billion, representing 15% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share was $10.10 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $13.71. We delivered record operating cash flows with a focus on profitability. Our strong performance in the uncertain macroeconomic environment underscores the resilience of our business and the mission-critical role of our products in a digital-first world. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is driving momentum across every geography and customer segment, making us one of the most innovative, diversified, and profitable software companies in the world. We continue to execute against our product roadmap, serve a vast customer universe from individuals to large enterprises and deliver strong top and bottom line growth. Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud have become the foundation of Digital Experiences, starting with the first creative spark, to the creation and development of all content and media, to the personalized delivery across every channel. In Q4, we achieved revenue of $4.53 billion, representing 14% year-over-year growth. In our Digital Media business, we had our best quarter ever on net new ARR, delivering $576 million, and our Digital Experience business achieved its first $1 billion subscription revenue quarter, growing 16% year-over-year. I will now pass it to David. David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu, and hello, everyone. The demand for digital content across every creative category, customer segment and media type is accelerating at a rapid pace. Creative Cloud remains the leading creativity platform, offering a comprehensive portfolio of products for every discipline across imaging, photography, design, video, web, animation and 3D. Core products such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Acrobat continue to lead their categories as we add new features and enhance their capabilities with Adobe Sensei, our AI engine. The rapid progress we\u2019re making with Adobe Express is attracting millions of new users and delivering additional value to Creative Cloud members who are also interested in lightweight, task-oriented tools. New collaboration capabilities, like Share for Review, are integrated directly into Creative Cloud and Document Cloud applications to enable seamless creation, sharing and review across creative and document workflows. Our ongoing product innovation ensures that Adobe remains the preeminent destination for a wide and growing base of individuals, students, creative professionals, small business owners and enterprises to create and monetize amazing content more quickly and easily than ever before. Q4 was a record quarter for Creative Cloud. We achieved net new Creative Cloud ARR of $453 million and revenue of $2.68 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. This strong performance was a result of : demand for our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Acrobat; expansion in SMB and enterprise, driven by strong execution of our year-end pipeline across direct sales and our reseller channel; accelerating growth in Substance 3D and Frame.io, underscoring the continued strength and significant opportunities in our newer businesses; momentum in Express, our template-based web and mobile product for creating everything from year-end sales promotions to holiday cards to social media posts. Express\u2019 unparalleled collection of stock images, videos, fonts, design assets and templates and its unique integration of AI magic from Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Acrobat enable us to deliver the best of Adobe to customers of every skill level. Q4 continued to see exciting growth with millions of monthly active users, greater than 40% quarter-over-quarter visitor growth in the U.S., and an NPS greater than 50. Key customer wins include Electronic Arts, Meta, NBC Universal, Publicis, Roku, Target and United Nations. In October, we were thrilled to be back live with thousands of members from our creative community at Adobe MAX. The conference has always been an opportunity to showcase our incredible innovation, and we drove over a quarter of a billion video views across all channels. Our announcements included : powerful new AI capabilities in Photoshop, such as a one-click Delete and Fill tool to remove and replace objects, and a new Photo Restoration neural filter that instantly fixes damaged photos; a Share for Review service in Photoshop and Illustrator that enables designers to easily collaborate with key stakeholders; the first-to-market Camera to Cloud integration between Frame.io and RED Digital Camera and Fujifilm, significantly reducing production costs and time; advances in Substance 3D that empower brands such as Electronic Arts, Hugo Boss, NASCAR, NVIDIA and The Coca-Cola Company to create engaging immersive experiences; a new partnership between the Content Authenticity Initiative and Leica and Nikon to implement provenance technology into cameras, allowing photographers to embed when, where and how images were captured; and early demonstrations of Adobe\u2019s Generative AI technology integrated into our tools, which promises to transform the creative process, making it more accessible, fast and efficient than ever before. Now turning to the Document Cloud business, digital documents have become synonymous with productivity in our personal and professional lives, whether it\u2019s an offer to purchase a new home, a bank deposit form, a school permission slip or a sales contract. Document Cloud is the leader in digital documents, offering innovative solutions across every device and for every skill level. Our strategy to enable all common document actions, including editing, sharing, reviewing, scanning and signing across desktop, mobile and web, is paying strong dividends. In Q4, Document Cloud had record revenue of $619 million, which represents 19% year-over-year growth and strong net new ARR of $123 million, with ending ARR growing 23% year-over-year. Q4 highlights include : new Acrobat functionality for SMBs, including the ability to send branded agreement templates and combine payments with e-signed documents; new capabilities between Document Cloud and Creative Cloud to help knowledge workers and creative professionals seamlessly collaborate and improve their productivity; scan innovation that allows users to simultaneously scan the left and right pages of a book as well as scan both sides of an ID card on one page; strong organic growth in both traffic and searches for PDF capabilities, which serve as a critical funnel to Acrobat web; significant growth in Sign transactions within Acrobat, underscoring the need for integrated document solutions; outstanding growth in API transactions. API calls nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the strategic necessity of integrating PDF capabilities within enterprise applications; key customer wins include BioNTech, Cigna, Deloitte, Mitsubishi Electric, Raytheon, Shell Information Technology and the U.S. Department of State. Q4 was the strongest net new ARR quarter ever for Digital Media, driven by outstanding execution against multiple growth drivers in our core business. In addition, we\u2019re excited about the pending Figma acquisition, which represents a tremendous opportunity to accelerate the future of creativity and productivity for millions of people.  Overall, the regulatory process is proceeding as expected. The transaction is being reviewed globally, including by the Department of Justice and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK. We are currently engaged in the DOJ\u2019s second request process. We expect that the transaction will also be reviewed in the EU. We continue to feel positive about the facts underlying the transaction and expect to receive approval to close the transaction in 2023. I\u2019ll now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello everyone. Every business in every category now depends on digital to engage and transact with their customers. Adobe\u2019s Holiday Shopping Report, which analyzes trillions of data points in Adobe Analytics, found that Cyber Monday drove an all-time high of $11.3 billion in online spending, with mobile shopping now accounting for 55% of sales on Thanksgiving, and Buy Now Pay Later orders jumping 85% during Cyber Week. We predict spend will exceed $210 billion this holiday season. No company is better positioned than Adobe to capitalize on this large global opportunity. In my customer conversations, it\u2019s clear that the current macroeconomic climate requires businesses to prioritize investments, and digital remains mission-critical to drive operational efficiency, improve customer engagement and maximize long-term value realization. We are driving a mix of diversified revenue streams through subscription and consulting services across new and existing customers, demonstrating the strength of our business. Experience Cloud is powering digital businesses in every industry across B2B and B2C with our leading solutions spanning data insights and audiences, content and commerce, customer journeys and marketing workflow, and it is unique in that it helps businesses drive customer demand, engagement and growth while simultaneously delivering productivity gains. Our comprehensive set of applications, including Real-Time CDP, are built natively on our highly differentiated Adobe Experience Platform, providing companies with a unified profile of each of their customers to deliver the most personalized, real-time experiences at scale. Adobe Experience Platform processes 29 trillion segment evaluations per day and executes a response time of less than 250 milliseconds, illustrating the impact of its real-time capabilities at scale. In Q4, we continued to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.15 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.01 billion, our first billion-dollar quarter and representing 16% year-over-year growth. Adobe is differentiated in our ability to power the entire customer experience, from ideation to content creation to personalized delivery to monetization. Chipotle is a great example. They are using Creative Cloud to design content for web and mobile channels and Experience Cloud to highlight new product offerings based on consumer preferences and support a faster, easier and more customized online ordering process. In government, the State of Illinois is using Experience Cloud and Document Cloud to provide simpler and more equitable access to state services for over 12 million residents. It's especially inspiring to witness the positive social impact of Adobe technology. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has long used Photoshop to create age-progressed photos and uses Experience Cloud to facilitate the recovery of missing children. Additional Q4 highlights include : strong demand for Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, inclusive of Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics, which are rapidly becoming the digital underpinning of large brands globally; accelerating demand for Adobe Experience Manager, demonstrating Adobe\u2019s role in helping businesses effectively manage their content supply chain, from creation to monetization; a new Marketing Mix Modeling service as part of our data insights and audiences offering, which enables marketers to harness the power of Adobe Sensei to assess marketing ROI in weeks rather than months and forecast resources for campaigns more effectively; strong growth in partner and Adobe professional services, underscoring our customers\u2019 continued focus on implementation and value realization; key customer wins, including BlackRock, Chipotle, Delta Air Lines, DFS Group, Disney Parks, Elevance Health, GM, Office Depot, Publicis, Santander and Wells Fargo. Adobe continued to receive strong industry analyst recognition, including leadership in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for B2B Marketing Automation Platforms, the Forrester Wave for Collaborative Work Management and the Forrester Wave for Enterprise Marketing Suites. I\u2019ll now pass it to Dan. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Our earnings report today covers both, Q4 and fiscal year 2022 results. As you know, in 2022 we experienced significant headwinds from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, increased tax rates and the impacts from the Russia-Ukraine war. Despite those headwinds, in fiscal \u201822 Adobe achieved record revenue of $17.61 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth, or 15% growth in constant currency on an adjusted basis. GAAP EPS for the year was $10.10, and non-GAAP EPS was $13.71. We exceeded our initial Non-GAAP EPS target for fiscal year \u201822, which speaks to the discipline, strong execution and resilient operating model of the Company. Fiscal year 22 business and financial highlights included : Digital Media revenue of $12.84 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $1.91 billion; Digital Experience revenue of $4.42 billion; cash flows from operations of $7.84 billion; RPO of $15.19 billion exiting the year; and repurchasing approximately 15.7 million shares of our stock during the year at a cost of $6.30 billion. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201822, Adobe achieved revenue of $4.53 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $2.53 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a record $3.60. Q4 business and financial highlights included : Digital Media revenue of $3.30 billion; record net new Digital Media ARR of $576 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.15 billion; record cash flows from operations of $2.33 billion; adding over $1 billion to RPO sequentially in the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 5 million shares of our stock. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q4 revenue of $3.30 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $13.97 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.68 billion, which represents 8% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency, and we added $453 million of net new Creative ARR in the quarter. Driving this performance was good linearity throughout the quarter as well as strong customer purchasing during the peak holiday shopping weeks. Fourth quarter Creative growth drivers included : new user growth, fueled by customer demand, targeted campaigns and promotions, and yearend seasonal strength, which drove strong web traffic and conversion rates in the quarter; adoption of our Creative Cloud All Apps offerings across customer segments, from enterprise, to Team, to individual and education; strength of the new Acrobat within our Creative Cloud offering, demonstrating the importance of digital documents and workflows to the creative community; sales of individual applications, including a strong quarter for our imaging and photography offerings; continued growth of newer businesses, including Express, Substance, Frame and Stock; and a solid finish to the year in SMB and enterprise. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $619 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth, or 19% in constant currency. We added $123 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Fourth quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included : Acrobat subscription demand across all customer segments; continued growth of Acrobat web, fueled by online searches for PDF and product-led growth; strong performance of our new Acrobat offering integrated with Sign, driving upsell ARR as well as new customer adoption; and year-end seasonal strength in SMB, including through our reseller channel. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q4 we achieved revenue of $1.15 billion and subscription revenue of $1.01 billion, both of which represent 14% year-over-year growth, or 16% in constant currency. Fourth quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included : expected year-end strength, with significant bookings of our newer offerings in EMEA that builds on our momentum in North America; success closing numerous transformational deals that span our portfolio of solutions; momentum with our Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, including RealTime CDP; strength with our Content and Workfront solutions, which are integral components of our content supply chain strategy; and increased customer demand for professional services, as enterprises focus on implementation and accelerating time to value realization from digital investments. In Q4, we focused on making disciplined investments to drive growth and awareness of our products. We continue to have world-class gross and operating margins and drove strong EPS performance in the quarter. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q4 was 22.5% on a GAAP basis and 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate came in lower than expected primarily due to lower-than-projected tax on our foreign earnings. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.19 billion, growing 9% year-over-year, or 12% when factoring in a 3 percentage-point FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $6.10 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were a record $2.33 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We now intend to use cash on hand to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date, which we expect will reduce our interest expense in fiscal year \u201823. In Q4 we entered into a $1.75 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $6.55 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020 which goes through 2024. As a reminder, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year and revalue ARR at year-end for current currency rates. FX rate changes between December of 2021 and this year have resulted in a $712 million decrease to the Digital Media ARR balance entering fiscal year \u201823, which is now $13.26 billion after the revaluation. This is reflected in our updated investor data sheet, and ARR results will be measured against this amount during fiscal year \u201823. We provided preliminary fiscal year \u201823 targets at our Financial Analyst Meeting in October that take into account the macroeconomic environment and the growth drivers for our various businesses. While there is ongoing macro uncertainty, given the massive long-term opportunity in digital and the momentum in our business, we are pleased to reiterate those financial targets. In summary, for fiscal year \u201823 we are targeting : total Adobe revenue of $19.1 to $19.3 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.65 billion; Digital Media segment revenue of $13.9 to $14.0 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $4.925 billion to $5.025 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $4.375 billion to $4.425 billion; tax rate of approximately 22% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $10.75 to $11.05; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.15 to $15.45. As a reminder, these targets do not contemplate our planned acquisition of Figma. We expect normal seasonality throughout the year, with Q1 being sequentially down and seasonally light for new business, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, a dip in Q3 on account of summer seasonality, and a strong finish to the year in Q4. For Q1 fiscal year \u201823 we are targeting : total Adobe revenue of $4.60 billion to $4.64 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $375 million; Digital Media segment revenue of $3.35 billion to $3.375 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.16 billion to $1.18 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.025 billion to $1.045 billion; tax rate of approximately 22% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.65; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.65 to $3.70. In summary, Adobe finished FY22 strong, executing on our strategies across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. I expect this performance to carry into next year, as Adobe\u2019s sustained top-line growth and world-class profitability continue to position us well for fiscal year \u201823 and beyond. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. As the company celebrates its 40th anniversary, it is a perfect time to reflect on our past and our future. Adobe was founded on simple but enduring principles that remain with us today. Innovation is at our core, employees are our greatest asset and our customers, communities and shareholders are central to our success. Over the past four decades, Adobe\u2019s continuous innovation and leadership have empowered billions of people around the globe to imagine, create and deliver the best Digital Experiences. Our strong brand and company culture enable us to attract and retain the world\u2019s best employees. We are proud to once again be named to Interbrand\u2019s Best Global Brands list as a top riser for the 7th year in a row and to Wall Street Journal\u2019s Best Managed Companies, ranking number one for Employee Engagement and Development. We have everything it takes to continue our success in the future : massive market opportunities; a proven ability to create and expand categories that transform markets; an expansive product portfolio that serves a growing universe of customers; revolutionary technology platforms that advance our industry leadership and competitive advantage; an expanding ecosystem that delivers even greater value to customers; strong business fundamentals; and the most dedicated and talented employees. I have never been more certain that Adobe\u2019s best days are ahead. Thank you and we will now take questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter and the guidance, by the way. Can you give us, David, some more color on Adobe Express and your ability to convert free users to paid users? Are you seeing any impact to creative customers trying to switch to Express? And how do you assure express paid adoption with that impact on Creative Cloud? David Wadhwani : Yes. We're very excited about sort of the state of Express. Express just finished its first year in market. We have millions of monthly active users. As I mentioned, we saw very strong growth sequentially quarter-over-quarter in the U.S., which is our primary focus market, 40% quarter-over-quarter growth in visitors, terrific NPS of over 50%. And that's really on the backs of hundreds of millions of stock content that we have, the 20,000 fonts that we've added that is unique to our offering, the highest quality templates. And the constant addition of best-breed features from our other Adobe products like Photoshop and Premier and Acrobat. We've had over 100 releases in the first year that Express has been out. So, we're very excited about that. And so, the Express business itself continues to do well, both in terms of free users and in terms of conversion of those users. But to your question, we also are seeing very strong adoption of Express within our existing CC customer base. So, we see a lot of people, of course, buying our core flagship applications for the power and precision that they have and that they represent, but there are times in those users that are looking to just get something done quickly. And the fact that Express is also entitled to those users gives them the ability to have the power and precision and the speed and ease. And so as users are coming, we're bringing in more users than we've ever had in audiences, we haven't reached by finding intent-based search for things. We're bringing those users in, which is giving us incredible top of funnel. We're driving the conversion. And we're also able to drive utilization increases in CC customers, which is driving retention of that business overall as well. So, the funnel and that migration of that base is very healthy and playing out as expected. Operator : We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Brad Sills : I wanted to ask another question about Creative Cloud Express. Obviously, you're seeing some success here with that top of funnel business. Is there any color you can provide on where you see the upgrade path for some of those customers? Are there -- is there a certain upsell motion that we could see conversion of other products, even potentially the full suite in that installed base as it's growing? Thank you. David Wadhwani : Yes. As we talked about when we launched Creative Cloud Express, the primary focus right now is bringing people into Adobe Express and just making them successful, whether it's at the free tier or whether it's at the paid tier or whether it's a pay tier eventually migrating up into the core flagship applications. Our primary focus has been and continues to be right now around usage, repeat usage and utilization. We are seeing, though, while that's our primary focus, we are seeing a lot of really interesting data coming in suggesting that we -- that the upgrade has are -- while still early and not our primary focus are working. For example, in many higher ed institutions where we've started to deploy Adobe Express, we're starting to see not just the increase in terms of usage of Express, but we're also starting to see increase in demand for Adobe Creative Cloud flagship applications. And again, part of this is we know and we believe that everyone should be creative and creativity is the new productivity. But as people start to leverage and benefit from that creativity, they naturally want more power and precision as well. So that they do go well hand in hand. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Sterling Auty with SVB MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty : So, I'm curious, is there anything operationally that you can do in preparation for the Figma acquisition, either from an expense structure or development side now before close? And if so, what are those moves that you're making? Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Sterling, maybe I can speak to that. I mean, first, it's nice to see that since the deal was announced, the excitement associated with both what we can do as combined companies as well as, as you can see from our results, the interest in the core business. And so, we're excited overall associated with it. Certainly, as the regulatory bodies are looking at it, we can focus on thinking about strategically. We are getting a lot of great feedback from customers. But these are two separate independent companies. And as it relates to our own cost structure as well as our technology, we feel really good about all the prioritizations we've made. And so, we feel like we're uniquely positioned when it closes to immediately take advantage of it. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : My congrats as well on a strong finish to the year. Following up on Sterling's question, it's good to hear the Figma close process is moving forward as expected. Can you give us an update on how their business is trending, just relative to your commentary at the time the deal was announced, especially given the evolution of the macro environment since then? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Brad, as you know, they're a private company. And so, we're certainly not at liberty to talk about it. And they have to continue to execute on their opportunity by themselves. Brad Zelnick : Okay. Understood. Thank you, Shantanu. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much, and I'll add my congrats. So Shantanu, the amount of energy and excitement in the audience was quite impressive down at the MAX conference. And I'm wondering which of the innovations that you unveiled has created the most enthusiasm, which you might -- you think might also be monetizable? And I'm wondering whether it could be generative AI or that Share for Review capability, the intertwine capability or anything else really coming to the forefront. Shantanu Narayen : Well, Mark, firstly, thanks for being there, and it's clear that you were also looking at all of the cool new innovative stuff that was delivered. I always worry about questions like that because it's, you know, which of my children do I love the most. But let me just speak to, I think, thematically, what David and Scott showed, which is the core applications. We just continue to make sure the core applications are more accessible, more productive, more fun. And so I think that's one area, thematically, that the team has done an outstanding job of making sure that we continue to deliver innovative capabilities. You mentioned Intertwine and Illustrator. I think the second thing, thematically, we talk about how do we get more people into the franchise. David also referred to that when he answered the two questions on Express, which is, the more we get people into the franchise, whether it's through our trial products, whether it's through Express, whether it's through participating in the collaborative process. I think that only adds to the available market for Adobe. And so, I think the work that we're doing in collaboration is really continuing to democratize what we can do. So, I'm pretty excited about that. I think the AI and the sneaks that you talked about, that really -- the potential for that when you see whether it was the individual fonts that were being done or whether your ability through a text, to be able to get your content done exactly the way it is. I'm sure you've been tracking also what's happened, Mark, in terms of the chat GPT and what you can do with respect to text. So, I think that entire space, our vision has always been anybody who has a creative idea, how do you get that creative idea to life. And so, I think moving from the hundreds of millions to billions of people who can use it. You're right, that has profound impact in terms of getting more people on our platform. And I think you'll see us be quite aggressive about delivering more of that functionality in an augmented way, perhaps first starting with Express. But I think we're excited about all of that. And the Frame acquisition certainly also is off. I think David and Dan spoke to Substance. So, we feel really good about the multiple growth drivers. David Wadhwani : If I can adjust a little bit to that. The three examples you brought are really interesting examples because intertwine is an example of the ongoing innovation in our existing flagship application. So that continues to drive an keep people engaged and onboarding into the applications and keep those -- keeps everything fresh and differentiated. Share for Review that initial release, while still early, we've been amazed by the repeat use of that once people start using it. And that represents a great growth loop for us. Because, as you know, anyone that gets shared a document, whether it's a Photoshop document or an Illustrator document or any other document is also an opportunity as a stakeholder to turn into a future user of Adobe products, whether it happens to be the Photoshop document to Photoshop usage or whether it happens to be driving people to try Adobe Express. So, those growth loops are really interesting and important to us as well. And I just wanted to make sure people saw that opportunity. Operator : The next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Shantanu, I'd like to ask about a term that you used often at MAX. And in fact, a new three-letter acronym that you use as well, namely product-led growth. And the question is Adobe has arguably been a product-led growth company for the more than 30 years that I've known you. And I'm wondering now what does product-led growth mean differently today from what it might have meant historically? And relatedly, how are you thinking about the cross-sell and upsell opportunity that you also spoke about at MAX, specifically for 2023. Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Jay, thanks for recognizing that our innovation has really come through an extremely close relationship with customers. So, I think in the past, in the desktop era, what product-led growth really was all about was making sure that as we engage with the customers, as we engage with the community, that we were able to use that. I think the best example perhaps in the desktop era was what we did with Lightroom. And when we first came up with Lightroom, given the fact that we had Photoshop already as a product, just getting the millions of people to use it even before we release the product, having all those evangelists and a great product, I think was a great example. What the team in both Creative Cloud and frankly, in the Experience Cloud, are doing is actually also following on the great work that we pioneered in the Document Cloud. And so, in the Document Cloud, I think product-led growth really related to as we think about what people were doing on searches when we introduced our web-based offerings for Acrobat, that's when we just started to see this velocity of how we engage with customers and prioritizing what's clearly top of mind for them, our ability to immediately satisfy them, I think, escalated quite a bit. When David came in, David really said, we've got to take this to a whole new level with product-led growth, and it's integrating both the community as well as, frankly, right now, engagement and engagement marketing in the product. And so when you get into product sessions right now, and you see the product manager and the engineering manager as well as the product marketing manager, all of them are on the same page. We have data. We have things instrumented in the products and your ability to do both AB testing and here's where we use our own products and the products that Anil does. And so, product-led growth right now is about saying, at any given time, we probably have three tests in market for a particular feature as well. And we're using that to really learn from the customer interactions and to deliver better quality products sooner. But David has really been the pioneer. So, David, if you'd like to add? And then maybe a little bit, Anil, on what we are doing for that in Digital Experience as well. David Wadhwani : Yes, Shantanu, I think that was a pretty complete summary. The only thing I would add is that there's an interesting inflection point that we are in terms of our product development cycles that give us an opportunity to take what we've always been doing, to your point, with product-led growth and drive even more use of it, which is the introduction of all the web applications that we have. So, we now have Photoshop Web, we have Illustrator Web, we have Acrobat Web, we have Adobe Express, and you combine that with the sharing focus that we have with Share for Review as an example. And we have new growth loops that we can start optimizing, and that's been a huge area of focus for the teams. Anil Chakravarthy : Yes. I just wanted to add, Shantanu, as you said, several of our enterprise customers are starting to deploy their own product-led growth using our analytics technology, a banking customer, for example, one of our best customers. They have their online mortgage application, and they want to track who is able to use it successfully, who's able to complete applications completely online, and they're using our analytics technology to do that and see what works and what they need to do to fix it. So, we're starting to see like exactly, as you said, our technology being both used inside Adobe to drive our own PLG as well as customers doing it. Shantanu Narayen : And Jay, maybe to get to your second question and taking a step back, I do have to say, when we look at our annual targets that we had provided for Digital Media ARR at the beginning of the year of $1.9 billion. And I know even with our Q4 guide, I think people had some questions about where is the momentum. And I think the team crushed that, which I feel really good about. And so, a lot of that is happening as a result of just first, attracting and acquiring customers to the platform. And then what you're referring to is the cross-sell, upsell, whether it's people who first engage with us on a mobile device, whether it's people in Acrobat. We've used Adobe Reader as a very, very good on-ramp to allow people to engage with PDF functionality and then either get a license for our Acrobat web product or for the desktop product. Individual apps, the success and the driving of individual apps has always been an on ramp, and we then do a really good job because we use Adobe Experience platform to then convert them and even promotional pricing. I know we've had some questions in the past. And we have incredible data that shows us when people come in, whether that's on educational pricing and then they graduate or on promotional pricing, converting them to customers. So, I think there are numerous ways in which we've demonstrated that by personalizing our offer to every creative or knowledge worker that we're able to monetize that as well after they derive the value from it. Operator : We'll move on to Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Derrick Wood : Congrats on a strong net new ARR customer -- quarter. I wanted to ask about the composition of this number. The growth dynamic between Creative Cloud and Document Cloud was a little surprising. I mean Creative Cloud had, I think, the second strongest sequential percentage growth Q4 ever. But looking at Document Cloud, net new ARR didn't grow much sequentially in what's typically a stronger uptick in Q4. Can you just give a little more color on the seasonal dynamics you saw between Creative and Document Cloud in the quarter? David Wadhwani : Sure. Yes, I'm happy to do that. So first of all, yes, as Shantanu mentioned, we're very pleased with how FY22 has gone and how the quarter closed out, we saw a lot of strength in the core businesses. And our primary focus across these businesses continues to be around new customer acquisition, new customer ads. We also have a lot of diversity in terms of the drivers that we have and the leverage we have to drive the business. As we mentioned, we saw great strength across all of our creative segments imaging, photo, video, design. We also grew a lot of -- focused a lot in terms of new campaigns that are targeting new audiences for creative as well with a new campaign called Everyone can Photoshop, that's bringing customers in directly into the products and has been very productive in terms of driving top of funnel and conversion. On the -- in terms of new businesses for Creative, we're seeing a lot of strength from new businesses like Frame and Substance that have contributed more this quarter than ever before. And to your point, we've also been seeing a lot of strength in the core business around Acrobat. We're running a Acrobat\u2019s Got It campaign really targeted at new customers in SMB where we show them all the capabilities that Acrobat has now, including specifically focused on signatures and things that really help them drive the business. So overall, the business is doing very well. The one dynamic that -- if you look at from an Acrobat perspective that we're really proud of too, is that we saw -- for the year, we saw growth of ARR at 23% despite the complicated macro. And it's important to remember that some portion of this is also -- the Acrobat business is also represented in the creative business. So, the Acrobat growth number is probably a bit understated in this point. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Turrin : Maybe one on the digital price side. We fielded some questions there just around guidance for next year in the current backdrop. You're holding on targets, grew well at 16% in constant currency for the quarter. So, can you just talk more around how much visibility you have in the targets there and it's how you closed the year at all, particularly given that EMEA comment provides incremental confidence in those targets going forward. Thank you. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks for the question. We are pleased with the performance of the Digital Experience business. I mean just as a quick reminder, at the beginning of the year, we had guided DX at 17% of digital growth for the year, which is what we achieved in a really tough year with all the different macro issues. So if I really take a step back, we're -- first of all, we're in a really strong position with our product portfolio. We are a clear leader in the market with the investments we made at the Adobe Experience platform starting 5 years ago. And that is really paying off with the book of business that we are seeing and all the customer adoption that we are seeing. And what we are hearing from our conversations with our customers is that they're really eager to invest in a platform that enables them to meet the mission-critical priorities around digital. And that's what we are enabling them and personalization in real time at scale. So, this is a significantly large opportunity. And what we believe is that as we go through this time, single product companies are going to come under a lot of scrutiny. So, while we definitely see deals getting scrutinized and going up to higher levels for approval, we also see that customers really want to invest in a market leader like us for their investments, it's going to last the next 10, 15 years to -- for the digital investment. So pleased with where we are. Shantanu Narayen : Maybe Anil, I'll just add a couple of things to what you said. I mean the first is that value realization has been top of mind for a lot of these customers. And so, I think if you look at the business as well, the services part, it's very clear that people want to implement it. And what I think is unique about Adobe's offerings in this particular space is that we help both with the customer engagement and frankly, the top of funnel as well as we help with productivity and cost. And so, it doesn't matter which side of that equation you are as, as an enterprise, I think both of them find that the Adobe Experience Cloud as well as, frankly, what we are doing with Sign actually help them on both fronts. And so we're pleased associated with that, and we have good visibility. I want to complement Anil and his team on the execution against the pipeline and transformational deals also, I think, just reflect the overarching interest that people have in making sure digital continues to be an imperative. And so, we're not going to be immune to the macroeconomic, but I like our differentiated solution and our execution. Operator : And our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thanks. Dan, in terms of your guide, are you implying the environment gets worse or stays the same. And for Shantanu, can you just talk about the next 6 to 9 months as we potentially go into a tougher economic headwind, how you're reshaping and rethinking your go-to-market or any steps that you can take to ensure you can cut through what is coming in. Dan Durn : Yes. So, from a guide standpoint, we spent a lot of time talking about the environment we're in during FA day. Against that backdrop, you can see the momentum of the business. You can see the execution against the opportunities. What I really like about the way we're positioned in the market. There's a diversification of the company. It's end markets, it's product segments, it's business models, it gives us a resilience in the environment that we're in, and we see that in the momentum we're carrying into next year. There's really no change to the view of the environment that we're in, and you see that reflected in the targets that we set for 2023. So, we feel good about the way we're executing against a complicated macro environment, and we'll continue to stay focused on adding value to our customers, but there's a diversification and a resilience to who we are and a mission criticality of what we sell to our customers. And then you could see that in the comment that Shantanu made. You can see us impacting the company's top line. You can see us impacting the productivity with which they serve their customers, and that puts us in a pretty unique position. Shantanu Narayen : And Brent, as it relates to your second question, I'll unpack that in maybe two ways. First is we're really pleased with what we did and even when the pandemic first started about prioritizing what was really critical for us. And I think the prioritization exercise when you're really focused on your top imperatives, that's really helped bring clarity and alignment within the company that I don't think should be undersold in terms of how effective that has been for execution. As it relates to the next 6 or 9 months and you think about the three routes to market, digital continues to be an area of strength. I mean, I know through our Adobe Digital Index we talk about what we are seeing in terms of people continuing to engage with the customers -- companies that they want to transact with electronically. And so, on the digital side, we will just continue to make sure we focus on acquiring the customers. David spoke to some of the effective campaigns. Clearly, we understand the attribution of that. And we just have to remain vigilant on making sure that we're attracting the customers on the new platforms where they exist. And for retention, which is a key issue as well, just how they continue to get value from the offerings that they have. The partner ecosystem, whether that's for the small and medium business or whether that's for what we are doing with the SI and VAR community on Digital Experience, just continuing to enable them, continuing to engage with them. I think that's a part. Clearly, the small and medium business did see a rebound after what they went through last year, which was a really bad situation. So I think we have to remain vigilant on that. And I think on the direct sales part, as we look at our pipeline, December, despite the fact that it's our first month of our quarter, we will continue to focus on execution against that to take advantage of whatever budget flush exists in companies. And then, as you start to come to what happens in Japan in February as it's the end of their fiscal year, continuing to focus on Europe. Brent, Europe was actually one of the highlights for us in the quarter. I think Adobe Experience platform has done well. And so, we remain cautious clearly about the macroeconomic, but I think we have visibility into making sure that we can continue to execute, Brent. Operator : We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Keith Bachman with BMO. Please go ahead. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you very much. And apologize in advance for some background noise. Shantanu and David, I wanted to direct this to you, if I could. The ARR net new in the quarter was very good, particularly relative to expectations. If we look back over a little longer period of time though than the quarter, growth has slowed in net new ARR, even if it's assuming of flattening out. And what I didn't -- what we didn't really get -- I think as much as we would have liked at the Analyst Day was, what do you think the key drivers of the net new ARR and creative have been or total ARR, if you want? And what are the key things that you're focused on before Figma that would cause an improvement in AR growth? I assume that one has been perhaps Adobe Express as a more compelling entry point. Is there anything else that you can call out as some things that you believe that Adobe is focused on like really some issues in the past that you think are going to be resolved and therefore before Figma but improve despite the macro or help growth in the creative side? Many thanks. David Wadhwani : Yes. I'm happy to jump in and Shantanu can add anything. So at a high level, if you look at what we've talked about at Analyst Day, our strategy is very clear, which is new users and retention are the core drivers and focus areas. As Shantanu mentioned, we're being very focused and very intentional in terms of those two things. When it comes to new subscribers, we added more new commercial subscribers this year than we've ever added in our history. And that is a really important intentional sort of activities we are doing. Many of those new users are -- tend to be nonprofessionals, right, or they tend to be earlier in career professionals. And so, they are coming in and leveraging our initial single app plan or Adobe Express, as an example, and we're very happy to have them take that on because we believe very strongly that the opportunities to drive and upsell them from Express to single app and from single app to all apps, is going to be something that is persistent and something that is very ready and available to us at the time we need. The main thing, though, is about getting them into the products and making them successful. And so with that focus, we've been very -- we've also been maniacally operational about retention of those bases. I think people have asked questions, as you broaden the net, you bring in other users that are not typical Adobe users, what's happening to the retention rates. I think we also shared that we're seeing usage of products continues to stay very strong as we bring in these new audiences. And we're starting -- and we're seeing retention continue to tick up and improve. And in fact, retention now is better than it was pre-pandemic as an example. So, we continue to bring in new users. We continue to retain those new users and we see organic opportunities to move them up and upgrade them. Shantanu mentioned a great example of education. We continue to see a lot of people come in with our education pricing. And then, we have the opportunity, two years or three years later when they graduate to upgrade them to full commercial pricing. And those activities are playing out as expected, and we see a lot more opportunity to it. But it all comes down to bringing new users in, getting them using the products a lot and retaining them. Shantanu Narayen : And maybe to add to that, Keith. I mean, when you think about the newer businesses that we're talking about, video just continues to be a really key growth driver, 3D and immersive imaging and photography. But if you take a step back, I think that two things happening in the macroeconomic environment that are actually going to be tailwinds. The first is the fact that it is the golden age of design. Everybody would like to express themselves. There are more screens on which all of this content is being consumed. So, I think the insatiable consumer demand for content, I think, is certainly driving a lot of more content that's being created. One of the exciting areas that I think David and Anil have talked about is what we are calling content supply chain. And when you take even the larger companies, they are all trying to get a handle of as they engage digitally with customers how much content is being created? Where is it being created? Where is it being delivered? How do I localize it? What's the efficacy of that content? And so, I think this content supply chain and everything we have with our creative applications, our asset management, the fact that we then deliver that content, I think we continue to believe that that's going to be a growth driver for the entire business as well. So, I wouldn't underestimate the insatiable consumer demand but I also wouldn't underestimate what's happening as enterprises recognize that the way to engage with people is to personalize that content. Jonathan Vaas : Hey operator, we're at the top of the hour. We'll make time for one more question, and then we'll wrap up. Thanks. Operator : You bet. We'll go ahead and take our last question from Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Alex Zukin : I apologize for any background noise. I guess we've heard a lot about the continuing growth initiatives in the demand environment, sounding like it's pretty resistant to any macro pressures I believe you're seeing at the moment. I'll ask the kind of other side of the equation. As you think about the levers that you have on the margin side, the discipline that you've been exhibiting. It does seem like over the last quarter and maybe the past few quarters, that margin story, that margin discipline has continued to exceed at least our expectations. So, as we look at the next year, as you think about the levers that you have in the business if the parts of the business should slow. Can you go through maybe walk through a little bit of where you see the opportunity to either, A, lean in or B, pull back? And also, how we should think about cash conversion in that scenario from a cash flow perspective. Thanks again. Dan Durn : Yes. So from an operating performance standpoint, you rightfully point out, the Company is performing really, really well. But we're doing what we've always done inside the company, which is drive growth, deliver industry-leading products and innovation to our customers, help them become more effective on the critical path of driving revenue for their business. But we do it in a very disciplined way that drives margin and cash flow while driving growth. And we talked a lot about Rule of 40 at our FA day. If I were to take a step back and reflect on FY22, it's complicated macro environment, and we\u2019re operating at a rule of 60 for the year. So, we feel really good about our ability to operate. And so as I look forward into next year, we're going to continue to lead. We're going to continue to innovate. We're going to continue to make our customers successful, but we'll continue to do what we've always done, which is ruthlessly prioritized where we make our investments, constantly review the portfolio, prioritize the things that are going to drive long-term value for our customers and do it in a very disciplined way. So, that's the operating tone inside the company. Nothing's changed on that front. We feel really good about how we're executing in the environment and the momentum we're carrying into 2023. From a cash flow standpoint, it all starts with driving that discipline in the business and we'll continue to drive cash flow and deploy that excess cash on a quarterly basis to create value with the shareholders. Shantanu Narayen : And Alex, given that was the last question, let me start off by saying as we celebrate our 40th anniversary, it's both humbling and inspiring to think about the impact that Adobe has had on the communication world and what we've been able to do. And it's rare to be able to say at this level that we believe that our best years are ahead of us. If I take a step back and I look at what we had done in 2022, there are three things that stand out for me, the Digital Media ARR and just continuing to drive new customer acquisition and deliver innovative products across both, the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. We've done a really good job of demonstrating why creativity and design is going to be more important and also combining creativity with productivity. On the DX side, the organic creation of the Adobe Experience platform and its apps, and the success that we've seen associated with that, the fact that we just had a first $1 billion quarter as it related to subscription revenues, I think that just reflects both the fact that we created this category. And unlike all of the other enterprise software companies who are in that space, we're just ruthlessly focused on this. And it is unique in that it helps both the top line and bottom line for enterprises. And to the question that you specifically asked, Alex, I mean, profitability, despite the FX impact that impacted hundreds of millions of dollars when you look back and say, at the end of the year, we exceeded our non-GAAP EPS that we had said a year ago/ I think that is a really amazing performance by the finance and operations team of making sure that we continue to remain focused. And I think as it relates to go-forward, we've clearly talked about why we're excited about the innovative road map, why we're excited about all of the things that are going to come up in 2023 and beyond. And so, I think it was a good year. We will continue to remain focused. I want to thank our employees who really are the unsung heroes of all of this execution and the work that they do. And for every one of you, thank you again for your interest in Adobe and happy holidays and wishing you all a joyous holiday season. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, everyone. This concludes the call. Operator : With that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Adobe had a strong Q1, driving record revenue across our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud businesses. We achieved $4.66 billion in revenue, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter, was $2.71 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.80. Digital is reshaping how we connect and engage with the world around us. Our performance demonstrates the critical role that Adobe products are playing in fueling the global digital economy, empowering everyone everywhere to imagine, create and bring any digital experience to life. We are executing against our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses, delivering on our innovative product roadmap and engaging a growing universe of customers from individuals to small businesses to the largest enterprises. Given the recent news reports, I wanted to provide an update on the process and timing of our pending acquisition of Figma. We remain excited about the opportunity to advance product design, accelerate collaborative creativity on the web, and redefine the future of creativity and productivity. The potential combination continues to be well received by customers, industry analysts and partners. In addition, we are preparing for integration as we work through the regulatory process. From the outset, we have been well prepared for all potential scenarios while realistic about the regulatory environment. We have completed the discovery phase of the U.S. DOJ second request and are prepared for next steps, whether that is an approval or a challenge. Adobe remains confident in the facts underlying the case. And based on current process timing, we believe the transaction continues to be on track for a close by the end of 2023. It goes without saying that our Q1 success demonstrates that we continue to be ruthlessly focused on executing against our immense opportunities, independent of this combination. David, over to you. Dan Durn : Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. We are living in a visual digital-first world where content creation and consumption are exploding and where consumers, students and businesses need to create content that stands out and elevates their online profiles. As a result, more and more people are turning to Creative Cloud, which remains a preeminent destination for creativity across imaging, design, video, illustration and animation as well as new media types like 3D and augmented reality. We continue to see strong demand for our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Acrobat and are excited about the traction we are getting with Adobe Express. Q1 was a strong quarter for Creative Cloud. We achieved net new Creative ARR of $307 million and revenue of $2.76 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. Q1 highlights include strong growth in top-of-funnel traffic, which resulted in healthy new demand for creative cloud applications across all routes to market and customer segments globally from individuals to SMBs, to large enterprises, increased demand and mobile adoption in imaging with products like Photoshop and Lightroom. Lightroom Mobile is now the default photo editor for the high-end photo editing experience on the Samsung Galaxy S-23 Series, continued momentum for Premier Pro, After Effects and Frame.io, which are leaders in video editing and collaboration. Over two-thirds of films at Sundance as well as Oscar winners, Everything Everywhere All At Once and Navalny were edited with our video products. Rapid adoption of Substance 3D by brands such as Amazon, Burberry and Louis Vuitton, the Substance 3D team was honored with a technical Oscar in recognition of 3D capabilities that are making popular films such as Spider-Man, Star Wars and Blade Runner 2049 possible. Acceleration in our Adobe Stock business driven by the demand for high-quality imaging vector, video and 3D content. Momentum for Adobe Express with significant year-over-year growth in monthly active users across segments such as students, small businesses and creative professionals. We are actively driving adoption of both new users and existing Creative Cloud subscribers who are now using Express when they want speed and ease and we look forward to an imminent release of a dramatic upgrade with enhanced performance, collaboration functionality and new authoring capabilities for video and mixed media. Exciting introduction of new products, including our beta releases of Character Animator and Adobe Podcast. Adobe Podcast is a web-based AI-powered audio recording and editing app, perfect for the growing podcast industry. It makes every recording even those done on your phone in busy spaces, sound like they were recorded in a studio. Key customer wins in the quarter include Accenture, BBC, Disney, IBM, Infosys and Nintendo. Our innovation engine continues to fire on all cylinders to reimagine the future of creativity. Last October, we previewed some of Adobe\u2019s generative AI technology at MAX. We have been hard at work training Adobe models on our proprietary data sets, creating APIs, envisioning new services and integrating all these capabilities into our existing applications as a creative co-pilot. These innovations are developed and deployed in alignment with Adobe\u2019s AI ethics principles of accountability, responsibility and transparency. Stay tuned for some exciting announcements slated for next week in conjunction with Adobe Summit. Digital documents are powering productivity at home and at work, whether users are filing a tax form, submitting a sales contract, requesting feedback on a marketing campaign or completing an online bank transaction. Adobe Document Cloud is a leader in digital documents, redefining how people view, edit, share, scan and sign documents across desktop, web and mobile. In Q1, Document Cloud had record revenue of $634 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth and strong net new ARR of $103 million, with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 highlights include continued demand for PDF with outstanding growth in documents opened in the Acrobat Chrome extension and the new integration that will make Acrobat Reader the default PDF viewer in Microsoft Edge for over 1 billion Windows users; significant growth in monthly active users for Acrobat web, driven by search volume for PDF related verbs and a continually optimized funnel to our web offering; continued proliferation of Acrobat driven by demand for integrated functionality such as Share for Review for collaboration and Adobe Sign for e-signatures; outstanding increase in API transactions as our ecosystem and business customers continue to customize and integrate document services; strong demand across all routes to market and customer segments globally from individuals to SMBs to large enterprises. Key customer wins include Bank of Montreal, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Ministry of Defense of Netherlands, Samsung and Verizon. Given the strong Q1, the demand for our products and our innovation roadmap, we are pleased to raise our FY \u201823 Digital Media net new ARR target. I will now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello everyone. During the 2022 holiday season, e-commerce drove a record $211 billion with 38 days of $3-plus billion in daily spend according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index. Companies across B2B and B2C need an integrated customer experience management platform that empowers them to anticipate and meet the expectations of their customers. Today, digital is especially critical in enabling companies to drive profitable growth by delivering engaging and efficient customer experiences across the entire funnel, and Adobe is uniquely positioned to power experience-led growth. Experience Cloud offers a comprehensive portfolio of products that span the entire experience life cycle from marketing planning and workflows to data insights and activation to content and commerce and customer journeys. Built natively on Adobe Experience platform, our real-time CDP provides businesses with actionable customer profiles, leveraging data from online and off-line channels to deliver personalized experiences at scale. In Q1, we continued to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.18 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.04 billion, both representing 14% year-over-year growth. Petco is a great example of a B2C company leveraging Adobe\u2019s comprehensive set of products to create and deliver engaging experiences. Petco uses Creative Cloud to create content and Experience Cloud, including real-time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer, to orchestrate personalized experiences across their pet care ecosystem, including veterinary care, grooming, training and insurance. On the B2B side, Qualcomm is harnessing experience cloud to deliver personalized experiences and improve marketing performance as well as Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to accelerate content velocity across its business lines. Additional Q1 highlights include high retention rates and strong demand for services, demonstrating our customers\u2019 focus on long-term value realization; strong growth in Adobe Experience Platform and our native applications, inclusive of real-time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics; momentum for Workfront, which is powering workflows to help teams around the globe collaborate and launch campaigns with ease and efficiency; significant wins over single product competitors in analytics, content management and CDP that underscore Adobe\u2019s differentiation; leadership in industry analyst reports, including the Forrester Wave for Digital Intelligence Platforms, the Forrester Wave for Cross-Channel Marketing Hubs and Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms; a significant number of transformational deals, including Accenture, Carnival Aida, Costco, IBM, MetLife, Paramount, Pfizer, S&P Global, TD Bank and Tim Hortons. The Digital Experience business had a strong start to the year. Enterprises are focused on driving revenue growth through digital channels while increasing the productivity of their investments in customer experience and marketing. Experience Cloud is uniquely positioned to help enterprise customers across the world unlock profitable growth. Next week, we are excited to host Adobe Summit, the world\u2019s largest digital experience conference. It\u2019s our first time coming together in person in Las Vegas since 2019. And we\u2019ll be joined online by tens of thousands of customers, partners and developers from around the world. In addition to unveiling exciting new technology innovation across Experience Cloud, we will host inspirational C-level executives from several companies at the forefront of the digital economy. I will now pass it to Dan. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Today, I\u2019ll start by summarizing Adobe\u2019s performance in Q1 fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I\u2019ll finish with financial targets. Q1 was a strong start to the year for Adobe. I know the macroeconomy is on every investor\u2019s mind right now, and you can see the resilience and diversification of Adobe\u2019s business in our financial results. Businesses today are prioritizing investments in order to maximize returns and impact, both to drive their top line and to deliver operational efficiency. And individuals are looking to create content that enables them to connect and stand out across digital platforms. In this environment, the demand for our products continues to be strong as our solutions are mission-critical to customers in a world where digital content and engagement drive the global economy. Our product differentiation, engine of innovation and data-driven operating model are continuing to drive Adobe\u2019s growth. We have a world-class balance sheet, industry-leading margins, a strong cash flow profile and a proven track record. I can\u2019t think of a company that\u2019s better positioned as we continue to innovate in our core business and create and scale emerging businesses to drive profitable growth. In Q1, Adobe achieved record revenue of $4.66 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. Business and financial highlights included : GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.71 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.80, Digital Media revenue of $3.40 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $410 million, Digital Experience revenue of $1.18 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.69 billion, RPO of $15.21 billion exiting the quarter and repurchasing approximately 5 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q1 revenue of $3.40 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $13.67 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.76 billion, which represents 8% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency, and we added $307 million of net new creative ARR in the quarter. Q1 Creative growth drivers included new user growth, fueled by customer demand and targeted marketing campaigns, which drove increased web traffic in the quarter; adoption of our Creative Cloud All Apps offerings across customer segments and geographies; students graduating from our Education segment into the creative professional job market; continued strength in upselling our new Acrobat CC offering, which includes integrated sign capabilities; licensing of individual applications, including a strong quarter for our imaging and photography offerings; momentum in high-growth businesses, such as Substance and Stock, where we had a tremendous quarter generating new business; and with Frame, which we are successfully cross-selling into our video customer base; a fast start to the year selling into our large enterprise accounts. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $634 million, which represents 13% year-over-year growth or 16% in constant currency. We added $103 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Q1 Document Cloud growth drivers included continued growth of Acrobat web, demonstrating the success of our product-led growth strategy; strength in conversion and retention rates of our Acrobat mobile customers; demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all customer segments; success generating new customer demand for Acrobat Sign in SMB and the mid-market; and strength in the enterprise, driving seat expansion for our Acrobat business. Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.18 billion and subscription revenue of $1.04 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. Q1 Digital Experience growth drivers included success closing numerous transformational deals with large enterprises that are choosing Adobe to be their end-to-end CXM platform to drive personalization at scale; momentum with our AEP and native applications with the book of business growing more than 50% year-over-year; strength with our Content and Workfront solutions as our content supply chain strategy is resonating with customers; renewal rates of our enterprise customers that continue to be strong; and sales execution across multiple geographies. Turning to the income statement and balance sheet. In Q1, we continued with our strategy of making disciplined investments to drive growth while identifying cost-saving opportunities to drive earnings. Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate in Q1 was 22% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations. For fiscal 2023, Adobe\u2019s management is adopting a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate to assess and report on operating results, which we believe provides a clear view of Adobe\u2019s financial performance. The fixed long-term non-GAAP rate considers our current operating structure, existing tax positions, legislation and available forecast information. This rate is based on a 3-year projection and may be adjusted for changes in the future. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.21 billion, growing 10% year-over-year or 13% when factoring in a 3 percentage point FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $5.65 billion and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.69 billion. Over the past year, we completed a thorough review of our short-term investments and marketable securities to ensure we are prepared for the current environment and with a bias towards the higher end of the investment-grade spectrum. Adobe does not hold substantial assets or securities at Silicon Valley Bank or any regional bank. In Q1, we entered into a $1.4 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $5.2 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020, which goes through the end of fiscal 2024. In light of the strong start to the year and momentum across our business and factoring in the macroeconomic environment, for Q2, we\u2019 re targeting : total Adobe revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.78 billion, Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $420 million, Digital Media segment revenue of $3.45 billion to $3.47 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.70 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.75 to $3.80 and. As a result of the strong performance in Q1 and trajectory of the business, we are raising our fiscal 2023 net new ARR and EPS targets. For fiscal 2023, we are now targeting Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.70 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $10.85 to $11.15 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.30 to $15.60. In summary, I\u2019m pleased with our strong top line and bottom line execution in Q1, demonstrating the momentum we\u2019ve established for the year. Our strong engine of innovation, combined with our operational rigor, are driving profitable growth and position us well to capture the massive growth opportunities at our doorstep. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. Adobe\u2019s Q1 results underscore our strong momentum and the significant opportunities we have across our businesses. We\u2019re thrilled to be back in Las Vegas for Adobe Summit next week. In addition to unveiling several new innovations across Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, we will share how we are building on our decades of AI leadership to deliver generative AI technologies that redefine creativity and customer experiences. We look forward to seeing you there. Adobe\u2019s employees around the world motivate us to continuously raise the bar and create the future. This quarter, we were named to Glassdoor\u2019s Best Places to Work; Bloomberg\u2019s Gender Equality Index for the 5th year in a row; and the CDP A List, which recognizes leadership and environmental impact. Our renowned brand, mission-critical products, and vast base of customers create an unmatched advantage that will fuel our growth. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats on a really strong start to the year. Dan, your guidance explicitly embeds assumptions for the macro environment. Can you share with us what those are and how those assumptions might have changed from a few months ago when you last guided? Thanks. Dan Durn : Yes. Thanks, Brad. There is really no change in our view in the macro environment. I think we\u2019re pretty clear at the time we set our annual guidance, the environment that we\u2019re in. We see the environment that others see. I think you can see that the company is performing really well against that backdrop. So we feel good about how we\u2019re situated, the way in which we\u2019re engaging with customers and its broad diversified performance across that environment. And so we like how we\u2019re set up, but there is really no change to the assumptions underlying the macro environment. We see the same environment that others do. Brad Zelnick : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alex Zukin : Yes. Hi, guys. So maybe just what do you think is the driving force behind \u2013 so many companies are talking about longer sales cycles, difficult to closing business. You had an outstanding quarter, specifically within the enterprise. So maybe what\u2019s driving those macro headwinds for others that you\u2019re not seeing or your resiliency specifically? And then on the topic of metrics, every metric was strong as we looked at revenues, RPO, Digital Media ARR operating margins. But maybe just can you talk about deferred revenue in the quarter? Anything there that was a headwind, because it did look like free cash flow was a little bit lighter than what we were expecting? Shantanu Narayen : I\u2019ll take the first, Alex, and then maybe Dan can speak to the second. I mean, I think, as Dan said, when we look at the macroeconomic situation, and you can see strong companies actually refer to this across the board, whether it\u2019s consumers, whether it\u2019s small and medium businesses, whether it\u2019s enterprises globally, I think the reality is that digital for them is an imperative. And really for companies that have innovative solutions, it\u2019s a tailwind. I think what a lot of companies are focused on is the message that enterprises are certainly sharing is that if the prior focus was growth at any cost, certainly, they are looking for more profitable growth. And I think if you look at our solutions on the creative document or enterprise side, we help them. We help them with growth, but we help them with profitable growth and engaging with customers. The second thing I would say is that there is a large TAM here, and so I think our job in this environment is making sure that we have an even larger pipeline that we go address and attract because there may be some difference in the closure rates. But I think if you look at it in aggregate, our job is looking at it and saying how do we differentiate ourselves. I think the one thing also I would say, Alex, is that a lot of the companies that have single product offerings, I think they are probably seeing more headwind because a certain company may not put one part of what they offer as a priority. And I think a lot of the companies are looking at it and saying if we\u2019re engaging in digital, we might change our focus from content management to the implementation of the customer data platform or there might be a focus more on campaigns or ensuring that the advertising spend, the attribution associated with it. So I think the team has executed against continuing to try and drive a large opportunity. The other thing I think we feel good about is the fact that both Summit as well as in the U.S. and UK, we\u2019re looking forward to being in person because we can engage more in person with them. So hopefully, that gives you some color of why perhaps the stronger companies are showing more macro strength than other companies. Dan Durn : And Alex, I\u2019ll jump in on the second part of the question. As we think about RPO being up 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, you think about the underlying performance of deferred revenue, unbilled backlog, it\u2019s very similar profile across both of those dimensions of the RPO. If you think about cash flow, the one thing I would point to, we all know that there has been a change in the tax regulation around capitalization of R&D expenses. We signaled at the time we set our annual targets that we would see a step-up in cash taxes starting this quarter, and that\u2019s really what you see profiling through operating cash. Alex Zukin : Prefect. Thank you, guys. Congrats. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Hi, excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question. A really nice quarter. I think my question is actually a deep dive into the prior two questions. Dan, maybe digging a little bit into sort of what Brad was asking. We are like, from a market perspective and an investor perspective, worrying about these kind of incremental impacts like Silicon Valley Bank and other bank failures. And you\u2019re seeing continued like a reduction in headcount from big shops like Meta on a go-forward basis. So I think the market is getting incrementally worried about the underlying kind of macro impacts. But you guys went the other way. Like in Q1, you\u2019re taking up your net new ARR additions for Digital Media. So can you walk us through specifically, is there anything mechanical or sort of tactical, if you will, that gives you guys the confidence that like even with the heightened kind of volatility that we\u2019re seeing out there that you guys feel comfortable in Q1 taking up that full year guide? And then on the other side of the equation on the free cash flow, can you just specify for us and you can give us a sense of kind of where those cash taxes are going to go over time just to help us kind of tune in our model? Dan Durn : Yes. So let me take them in reverse order. In terms of cash taxes, there is a 5-year amortization period around the capitalization of that R&D. So you\u2019ll see a pretty dramatic cash tax step-up initially. But over that 5-year amortization period, it will converge on the reported tax rate. And so that\u2019s the general profile, and that\u2019s why you see the significant step-up in Q1 just starting that process now. In terms of the environment we are in, clearly, the company is performing well. You see the diversification of our business that\u2019s across geographies, industry sectors, product portfolio. The company is just performing well at a broad base way on the strength of that performance and the momentum we have, the visibility we have into the full year. We think it\u2019s the prudent thing to set expectations with investors in a way that reflects what we see as the opportunity in the company-specific performance. When I take a step back and I think about what is driving that differential performance in this environment, I think our products are mission-critical to our customers. We are on the critical path of them generating revenue. But as the world goes digital and those investments are prioritized, not only do we help companies drive top line growth, but we help them with the underlying productivity gains that go with that. It is why customers in this environment are prioritizing around things that we sell to enable their success. It addresses top line performance as well as underlying profitability of our customers. So being on the critical path, being mission critical to customers, we think this is the type of environment where the power of Adobe and the performance of the company gets to shine. David Wadhwani : Yes. And I\u2019ll just add a little bit specific to Digital Media. The foundation of the growth that we have, we still feel a very significant tailwind even in this market. Shantanu talked about the strength of the enterprise business. Every business needs to be a digital business. Digital content is fueling the global economy. That\u2019s true for smaller organizations and individuals as well. If you look at the creator economy, we\u2019re seeing more people come in to start to create their own personal online brands. So we saw a very strong digital funnel. As well, we had the highest traffic that we\u2019ve ever had come to adobe.com. And even in small, medium businesses, the part of their business that they need to invest most in is the digital channel as Dan was talking about. You look at that diversity, you then layer on the diversity of the growth drivers that we have in the business, whether it\u2019s new user acquisition, whether it\u2019s upsell of existing users, whether it\u2019s retention rates, whether it\u2019s new businesses like Substance or Stock or the pricing and packaging opportunities that we have. Every one of those levers has been very productive for us. In terms of primary growth driver, it is and always has been new user acquisition. It is by far the biggest contributor, and a lot of the PLG work that we\u2019ve done over the last year or 1.5 years is contributing to not just top of funnel, but also conversion of that top of funnel. In terms of upsell and migration, we\u2019ve been investing for a decade or more in education, and we have a very efficient channel now where students that graduate effectively upgrade and migrate into full priced offerings. That drove a very strong Creative Cloud individual all apps quarter for us. Retention, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work in retention through PLG, but we\u2019ve also been driving a lot of utilization of Adobe Express as part of the Creative Cloud business. All of that combined makes for a very strong retention rate. New businesses, we talked about Substance and Frame having outsized growth. And of course, the pricing and packaging work that we\u2019ve been doing and all along continues to contribute to that, both for CC and Acrobat CCDC as a whole. So looking ahead, all of these drivers and these levers are intact, and we have lots of opportunities going forward as well. Shantanu Narayen : And maybe just putting it altogether if you look at it and say that, hey, we did $410 million in Q1, we are targeting $420 million of net new ARR in Q2. The question you would have asked us if we hadn\u2019t done this was what are you signaling about the second half of the year. So I think it\u2019s a way of showing that the momentum is there in the business. Keith Weiss : Super helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed. Jake Roberge : Hey, congrats on great results. I just want to double click on that retention commentary you said, you called out several \u2013 in several areas of the business during the prepared remarks. Is there anything specific that you\u2019re doing differently in this period of macro uncertainty that\u2019s driving those results? And have you started to see Express help at all with retention metrics as customers now the tier that they can actually graduate down to? Shantanu Narayen : Well, for a couple of years right now, we\u2019ve been really focused on what we\u2019ve called in the past, the data-driven operating model and really being pretty focused on driving the business both with the narrative and the number. And so I think as we continue to, as David mentioned, have different products. And he is really focused on how we are acquiring them, how are we engaging them, what\u2019s the usage, how do we make sure they are getting value for the product, how do we continuously tell them about what\u2019s new. And then I think as David has come in and introduced the notion of product PLG, I think that part has also really started to reflect in making sure that customers know that we\u2019re building products and features that are relevant for the pain points that they have. So I would say the underlying business, while they are sort of the digital imperative, I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the incredible execution that the team continues to do on that or in DX. I mean how do you look at the solutions we\u2019re selling? How do you understand cross-sell? How do you understand upsell? And I think the hours and hours of work that goes in is sometimes not appreciated, but I\u2019m incredibly respectful and appreciative of what the teams have done. So a lot of execution is, I think, the short answer. Jake Roberge : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And we will take the next question from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Brad Sills : Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about that top of funnel activity that you have been generating here with Communicator and the consumer segment with Creative Cloud Express, the success you\u2019re seeing there, some exciting new announcements coming here. It sounds like on Creative Cloud Express enhancements here. Could we interpret that to mean that perhaps you\u2019re pivoting more towards upselling those customers to some of these newer features and offerings that are coming with Creative Cloud Express away from that top of funnel activity that you\u2019ve been very successful with thus far? Thank you. David Wadhwani : Yes. As Shantanu talked about, it\u2019s a holistic process. First of all, we\u2019ve, over the last couple of years, spent a lot of time with product-led growth. What that gives us is confidence that when people come to Adobe.com and they get into the products, they are going to have a great onboarding experience. They are more likely to convert, and they are more likely to stay, which then starts to give us more confidence and growth in terms of improving what has already been a world class in terms of lifetime value. As that happens, we\u2019ve been running more targeted campaigns with things for Photoshop and Acrobat and Illustrator as an example that are more targeted to the growth activities and the landing pages in the products themselves. And we\u2019ve actually been connecting all of our outbound marketing activities with landing pages in the products themselves. So we have been able to really increase our demand efforts and the ROI associated with that to bring more traffic to top of funnel. In addition to that, we have been investing a lot in growth loops. So people are able to now when using the products actually share some of \u2013 share the content out to stakeholders. Those stakeholders are able to look at that content, but also become top of funnel opportunity for us. If you look at Acrobat Web, as an example, we have seen a massive increase in terms of Acrobat Web usage driven by things like Share for Review. So, that drives more top of funnel for us. And then third is partnerships. We have been working very closely with Microsoft as an example. We have announced that Reader, as an example, will be the default PDF viewer in Edge, which now gives us access to over billion users on Windows-based devices. So, it\u2019s a cacophony of these activities that ultimately results in strong top of funnel. And then as we talked about, it\u2019s really about the hard work and the data to drive personalized experiences at scale, leveraging a lot of Anil\u2019s DX businesses and products to drive users all the way through to conversion. Brad Sills : Wonderful to hear. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Turrin : Hey. Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. One of the things that stood out is you mentioned wins over single product competitors and a few key areas on the digital experience side. Can we go a bit deeper into that as this environment and some of what\u2019s happening on the private company side, maybe presenting opportunities you are now able to take advantage of? I would just be curious here a bit more on maybe both the DX and DM side, just what\u2019s happening there. Thank you. Anil Chakravarthy : Yes. Let me start on the digital experience side. We have a broad and comprehensive portfolio, and it\u2019s integrated with the Adobe Experience Platform. So, from a customer perspective, they get the best of both worlds. They get those best-in-class applications, whether it\u2019s content and commerce or customer journeys or data insights or workflow, marketing workflow, and they get the benefit of integration with the Adobe Experience Platform and the native apps that we have built there. So, that\u2019s a powerful combination. It helps to really address what Shantanu was talking about, which is how do you keep growing through your digital channels and you get the revenue growth, but you also get the benefit of getting efficiency through consolidation. And that\u2019s where we believe we really shine as customers are looking at their overall stack, similar to what they have done in other aspects of their IT enterprise architecture. They are looking at who is my go-to platform that I can really standardize on and I will build around, and so we are getting the benefit of that choice. David Wadhwani : And on the DME side, we look at the \u2013 just like all the energy in the market around single product players, whether it\u2019s a mobile app, whether it\u2019s a web app or whether it\u2019s this excitement, incredible excitement and that we have as well around generative AI really is focused on driving top of funnel because it\u2019s driving a lot of awareness of creativity and the things that people want to do. And ultimately, as they leverage those apps, as they see themselves as more accretive, they inevitably end up at our doorstep going forward. Operator : And we will take our next question from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan : Thank you very much. I just want to pick up there. I think David talked about the excitement with generative AI, anybody that wants to jump in. What does this mean for Adobe? Is this just somewhat substitutive for all the opportunity that you have, or is it somewhat incremental or massively incremental? And how does Adobe monetize generative AI? Is this something that you can create a separate SKU or charge more? I am curious to get your thoughts quantitatively and qualitatively. Thank you so much. David Wadhwani : Kash, I think there was about three or four questions, but all related. So, happy to take those really quickly. Nicely played. First of all, this is really about increasing the total number of users, we believe, very strongly. As we talked about at MAX, this is about enhancing human creativity, not replacing it. And ultimately, whether you are an individual solo printer SMB or enterprise, we are hearing the same thing, which is that you need to create more content than you are able to create today. And so this really plays well into our core strengths. As you know, we have got a decades-long focus on AI, things like neural filters and object selection. And hundreds of other features have been based on AI for us, and they have increased creativity, and they have increased productivity, and they have helped people keep up with the demand for content. They have also made it easier for people to onboard into the experiences, and so we have been able to broaden the opportunity for people to start leveraging and using our core products. We have now been able to leverage the hundreds of people that are in our research organization and really target them towards generative technology, which we believe is a huge step forward, leveraging all of the work we have done, but a huge step forward going forward. And we and everyone else in the industry are still in the early innings. So, to give you a sense of where we are going at MAX, we talked about our vision for effectively not just creating content, but really engaging and embedding it in the existing workflows to create a creative copilot we refer to it as. And since then, we have been very hard at work at creating our own model, and the model that we are focused on is around output quality. So, it\u2019s about best-of-breed generative AI. But combining that with the Adobe magic that we have talked about over the years and all of the technology we have that takes images and makes them better, and so the output quality, we think is going to be differentiated. The second thing is around commercial reuse. There is a lot of complex questions here around copyrights, around diversity and inclusion, about harmful content that\u2019s being created. That\u2019s something we take very seriously, and we are embedding that into everything we do. And the third thing is really about workflow integration. Creating an image is just the start. It\u2019s not the end. And Adobe is the only player that has a full end-to-end workflow, not just within the products and the tools that we have in the digital media business, but also everything that Anil is doing around the content workflow and the content supply chain out to the point of distribution. And in fact, because of this, we are seeing other gentech companies wanting to partner with us more and more, and so we feel like we are in a really advantaged position where we are going to come out with our own model and we are going to be partnering with others to make sure that because of our distribution and the place we play in the market, we can bring a lot of this value to actual fruition. And stay tuned, next week at Summit, where we have a lot of exciting announcements and progress to make there. And then last to your, I think fourth or fifth question. Kash Rangan : Monetization, yes, correct. David Wadhwani : Monetization, we are very excited about what this means for the business. New user onboarding. We think that, again, if you can start to imagine yourself as creative by using a text prompt, we can take you through that full journey and onboard you into other Adobe offerings. It\u2019s also great for retention. We have always seen the more value that gets used in our core offerings, the better the retention rates and the better the LTV. And we think there is up-sell opportunity. We do think these are distinct new packages that we can bring to market and up-sell people to. Operator : And we will take our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. David, for you first, when we spoke at MAX on the subject of monetization, you alluded to Adobe\u2019s plans for new pricing and packaging, and you alluded to that this evening. But there was a third ingredient that you also alluded to at the time, which was segmentation, which sounded to me like something that you have success with back in the pre-CC days. And so is this something that you could talk about in terms of your returning to the segmentation techniques of the past that work rather well for the company? And then for Anil, it\u2019s interesting to hear the reference to your competition with single product companies. That\u2019s not a new phenomenon, of course. You have had multi-solution DX portfolio for some time. So, would you say, therefore that the wins or magnitude of the wins against single product competitors is more pronounced now? It\u2019s a larger part of the DX business? And would you say that the investments that you have evidently been making over the last year in consulting capacity has been a critical enabling ingredient for the growth you are now seeing in DX? David Wadhwani : Yes. So, starting with the DME side, Jay, for broad understanding, what we talked about at Adobe MAX was this recognition that since we introduced Creative Cloud 10 years or 11 years ago, we have now a much more comprehensive set of capabilities all the way from a freemium model with Adobe Express, all the way to our high-end creative cloud offerings, but also additional capabilities and packages beyond that like Substance and like Frame and like Stock that allow people to go beyond what they can do with the core creative products. The second thing that, in addition to that expansion that\u2019s happened is that as we have been driving more with DDAM [ph] and more with product-led growth, we are starting to automatically segment customers, not necessarily today in terms of what they buy, but how they experience the products that they are using already. And so what that leads to is an opportunity. And then going back to all the levers that we have for ongoing growth, there is the opportunity to start segmenting them earlier in the purchase flow into offers and offers that meet their needs and optimize the value to the price in a way that benefits our customers and of course also benefits Adobe. So, you can expect to see us continuing to play with everything from how we get new users, how we up-sell users, how we retain them, new businesses we bring in, but also pricing and packaging to your point. Shantanu Narayen : And just to punctuate that maybe a little bit, Jay. I mean the reality is that we actually have different pricing for different devices today, which is completely different. We have web-based pricing for people who come and experience this as a result of a web search that they have made more successfully through Acrobat Web, for example. And so if the question is when we have had things like design collection or web collection or video collection, I mean the reality is the CCO laps, which actually had a really good quarter, is perceived by people to be the new sort of table stakes for what is happening in creative, and we think that that\u2019s a great offering. And as David said, I mean whether it\u2019s Stock or whether it is Substance and our 3D offerings, what we are doing there, those are really perceived to be the differential offerings that are personalized. And for a Photoshop customer, how do we get them to use one of these other offerings. So, I think we have done a really good job on that particular front. Anil Chakravarthy : Yes. From the DX perspective, we obviously started investing in AEP 5 years ago. Now we have lots of examples of customers who are using some of the capabilities like unified profile or the real-time CDP and the real-time performance at scale in production. So, from a customers\u2019 perspective, if they think about a single product, they actually know what an integrated product looks like, and they realize that that\u2019s what they would have to build together, build on their own. So, I think that\u2019s making the choice of going with a product from Adobe, which is already integrated with also best-in-class applications versus a single product where they would have to put it together. I think that\u2019s making the contrast more stark. Shantanu Narayen : And there is more scrutiny, wouldn\u2019t you say, Anil, that so I think part of what\u2019s happening is as the IT or the Chief Marketing Officer, the Chief Digital Officer is thinking about this holistically. There is more scrutiny around who is the company that can provide us the more comprehensive solutions. So, that \u2013 you have seen, Jay, a certain difference in how customers are viewing that, which again plays to our strengths. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question here and well done in the quarter as well. I would love to dig into Figma a little bit, understanding very well that it\u2019s still in process. And so David, maybe for you, I know you and the team see the opportunities with products like FigJam in really complementing Creative Cloud. I was wondering if you have seen other opportunities for some of that complementary sort of opportunity as you spend more time with the business. And then, Dan, maybe just a quick housekeeping question. Can you just remind us sort of what the revenue overlap looks like with Figma? I believe it\u2019s the Adobe XD product where specifically where there is overlap, but maybe you could just remind us sort of what that revenue overlap looks like? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. Saket, maybe I will first jump in. I mean I think just let\u2019s remember before they answer, these are two separate companies, and so we are operating at arm\u2019s length in terms of what they are doing. I think we have shared upfront that the XD revenue is de minimis, and so that\u2019s the part that I wanted to get across. And then David can certainly speak to some of the strategic rationale and ideas for what we can do. David Wadhwani : Yes. So, I think there is a ton of opportunity in terms of how we look at the Figma business and figure out Figma opportunity. First of all, as we have discussed, we believe that we can just fundamentally accelerate what they are doing today in product design. We have a global footprint. We are working with a lot of our \u2013 with enterprise customers across the globe, and the feedback that we are getting from these enterprise customers is a lot of excitement about the kind of things we can do by bringing these two companies together to just accelerate and make them more productive in terms of what they want to accomplish and just accelerate everything that they are doing. The second thing is around taking workflows between Photoshop and Illustrator and Figma and really just operationalizing them in a way that we can bring real-time collaboration capabilities based on the Figma platform to these \u2013 to the core disciplines like illustration and video editing and photography and 3D design and more. And the third is really around the evolution with FigJam, bringing that into the core for productivity use cases. So, taking FigJam and integrating it more deeply with things like Acrobat and starting to just recognize that creativity is starting to be the foundation of how new productivity applications need to present themselves. And that whole motion of enabling productivity workers to express themselves creatively is where the market is going with the rise of the creator economy. And so we see \u2013 we just see a ton of opportunities to integrate the products. We can\u2019t \u2013 we are limited in what we can talk to them about in a moment. But what I can say is everyone from Adobe employees to Figma employees, to our customers, can\u2019t wait for this to close so we can actually get moving on all this. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks guys. Jonathan Vaas : Operator, we are just about at the top of the hour. We will take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Shantanu, on the DX business, I am just curious if you could just give us an overview of what you are seeing there. Are you still seeing the big deals? Are you seeing a smaller number of \u2013 higher number of smaller transactions, anything? Can you just talk through the pipeline? Just general kind of set up, what you are seeing in terms of the overall DX business and how customers are behaving? Shantanu Narayen : Happy to, Brent, and I hope we get to see you next week at Summit because then you willalso get to meet a whole bunch of customers. I think \u2013 and Anil, certainly feel free to add. I mean I think we saw some really good transformational deals. I think both Dan and Anil referred to that. And so companies that are looking at Adobe to help them with their entire end-to-end customer experience management, good strength there, Brent. I mean those tend to be ones that we have worked with for many years and some that are really looking at it as a strategic. So, I would say that segment, the pipeline associated with people who are looking for a comprehensive and integrated CXM solution is pretty large. I think as it relates to what we call the solution-led segment as well, which is people who may have our analytic solutions and want content solutions or those who have both of those and want journey optimizer or customer journey analytics or certainly the commerce solutions, that\u2019s another part of the business where we are making sure that we can up-sell. I know Anil typically at every FA meeting gives you stats and metrics on how we are making progress. So, that is one. Given we have the customer relationship and we have the customer engagement, and we have customer success managers, I think continuing to penetrate a customer account, that\u2019s where also we see pipeline. And that\u2019s a pipeline that\u2019s driven, frankly, by us. I think in terms of the geographies, we continue to see strength in North America. I think when you think about EMEA, that remains an area of strength. There are some areas in Asia, some countries in Asia. So, our job there, really, Brent, has been how do you drive a large pipeline, understanding that there is going to be different companies that look at this differently in specific quarter, but we are focused on the addressable market. Anil, I don\u2019t know if you have other stuff to add. Anil Chakravarthy : I think the only thing I would say is I think the themes that we are going to hit on at Summit, personalization at scale, content supply chain, even for customers who are starting with a single product, they like that vision because they know that, that is what is key to driving the digital growth and driving profitable growth. So, even if they are starting with one and focusing on value realization, they have their eye on a longer term roadmap, and that benefits our relationship with them. Shantanu Narayen : And Brent, the other thing I will say, given just the last question is, I think at Summit, you will see some of the themes. I mean certainly, content has been a theme for us for a long time. Data has been a theme for us for a long time. The focus on customer platform and CDP has been a big one. I think how this spreads its tentacles into the product and PLG as David has said, so I think we have some exciting things that we will talk about in that particular space in AI and how AI can help. So, we are not just resting on what we have today as an integrated offering. We are really the innovative product roadmap across each one of our businesses, what Dave has been doing in creative, what\u2019s happening in documents on the web and mobile devices and what Anil is going to show. I think that\u2019s also what gives us a lot of confidence that we are anticipating and solving customer problems. And so it was a strong start to Q1. And based on the product innovation, we really continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have at Adobe, and we look forward to seeing all of you at Summit. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks everyone for joining the call. Like Shantanu said, we hope to see many of you next Tuesday at Summit. I look forward to talking to many of you soon and this concludes the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s meeting. Thank you for your attendance and you may now disconnect.",

The information discussed on this call, including our financial targets and product plans, is as of today, June 15, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainty and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements. For a discussion of these risks, you should review the factors discussed in today's press release and in Adobe's SEC filings. On this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our reported results include GAAP growth rates as well as constant currency rates. During this presentation, Adobe's executives will refer to constant currency growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Reconciliations are available in our earnings release and on Adobe's Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Jonathan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Adobe had an outstanding quarter, achieving record revenue of $4.82 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.82, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.91. Our results demonstrate strong demand across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud with particular strength in Digital Media ARR. Adobe's mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences is more critical than ever as digital continues to rapidly transform work, life and play. Our groundbreaking innovations, including the new Adobe Express, the launch of Firefly, our family of creative generative AI models, co-pilot functionality in our creative applications, including Photoshop and Illustrator, AI-powered advancements in Acrobat; a new product analytics solution and the latest capabilities in real-time CDP are empowering an ever-expanding customer base to imagine, create and deliver standout content and experiences. We're executing against our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses.

We have delivered hundreds of AI innovations through Adobe Sensei such as Neural Filters in Photoshop, Liquid Mode in Acrobat and Customer AI in Adobe Experience Platform. Our ongoing R&D investments have enabled a rapid development and deployment of Firefly, our generative AI technology. We believe generative AI will drive both further accessibility and adoption of our products. Our generative AI strategy focuses on data, models and interfaces. Our rich data sets across creativity, documents and customer experiences, enable us to train models on the highest quality assets. We will build foundation models in the categories where we have deep domain expertise, including imaging, vector, video, documents and marketing. We are bringing generative AI to life as a copilot across our incredible array of interfaces to deliver magic and productivity gains for a broader set of customers. Since its launch in March, Firefly has captured the imagination of the world with over 0.5 billion generations and we're just getting started. Our digital experience business is powering personalized customer engagement for companies around the world, enabling them to drive experience-led growth. We're delivering an innovative product road map and integrating Sensei gen AI services across Experience Cloud. Last week, we hosted a successful EMEA Summit with tremendous excitement from thousands of customers and partners reinforcing that digital is a critical imperative across industries. Adobe's category leadership and mission-critical products will continue to drive our growth. For FY '23, we now expect Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to end the year ahead of our previously issued revenue and ARR targets and Digital Experience to be slightly below our previous annual target given the current enterprise spend environment. As a result of our groundbreaking innovation and continued execution, we are pleased to raise total Adobe annual revenue and EPS targets. David, over to you. David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu, and hello, everyone. Adobe has long had a mission to unleash creativity for all and today, this is more possible than ever through the power of AI. The introduction of the new Adobe Express and Firefly will go down as a seminal moment in our creative history. These innovative products and our generative AI copilot in our flagship applications will extend our leadership in core creative categories such as imaging, design, video, illustration, animation and 3D as well as attract an increasingly expansive global audience. In Q2, we achieved net new creative ARR of $354 million and revenue of $2.85 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year. We could not be more excited about our generative AI road map that will make Adobe products more accessible to an even larger universe of people, while dramatically enhancing productivity for existing customers. Firefly is attracting tremendous customer interest and is highly differentiated in the market. It is being directly integrated into our product workflows as a copilot to accelerate ideation, exploration and the end-to-end production process. Business and innovation highlights include the beta release of Firefly, Adobe's pioneering family of creative generative AI models and adobe.com/firefly, a destination that allows users to generate and refine content. Firefly's first model is trained on Adobe stock images and other openly licensed content designed to generate commercially viable, professional quality content. Firefly powered capabilities seamlessly integrated into Photoshop are catalyzing a new era of creative power and precision. The viral response to Photoshop's new generative fill copilot has been extraordinary across social media platforms. Users have now generated over 0.5 billion assets on the Firefly website and in Photoshop, making these 2 of our most successful beta releases in company history. Building on this innovation, earlier this week, we announced Generative Recolor in Illustrator, which will similarly serve as a generative AI copilot to millions of designers to iterate and transform Vector Art. We also released an all-new Adobe Express with Firefly generative AI capabilities that revolutionizes how everyone, from students to small business owners to marketers and large organizations, creates and share standout content. Adobe Express brings the magic of our technology from Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere and Acrobat to combine power and precision with speed and ease. The response to the public beta in particular the groundbreaking video editing capabilities has been overwhelmingly positive. The enterprise version of Adobe Express and Firefly will empower every employee in an organization to participate in the creation of content, campaigns and websites in conjunction with Experience Cloud. New AI-powered text-based editing and automatic tone mapping in Premier Pro makes video editors more productive. An expanded Frame.io platform that now supports collaboration across PDFs and images, in addition to video, increases the value of Adobe's Cross-Cloud content supply chain solution. A major Lightroom mobile update that instantly allows you to access photos from Apple iCloud and Android Gallery empowers our growing base of mobile-first and mobile-only users. Continued momentum with our ecosystem of strategic partners drives awareness of our products and top-of-funnel for Adobe. Google announced that Adobe Firefly will be a premier generative AI partner for Bard, powering text to image capabilities. NVIDIA and Adobe announced that we will collaborate on generative AI optimizations across hardware and software. Apple highlighted how Lightroom will empower users to edit photos on the Vision Pro VR headset at WWDC. Momentum across routes to market and customer segments, including key enterprise customer wins, EY, government of the Philippines, NVIDIA, Omnicom, TAFE, New South Wales and WPP. Our generative AI offerings represent additional customer value as well as multiple new monetization opportunities. First, Firefly will be available both as a standalone freemium offering for consumers as well as an enterprise offering announced last week. Second, copilot generative AI functionality within our flagship applications will drive higher ARPUs and retention. Third, subscription credit packs will be made available for customers who need to generate greater amounts of content. Fourth, we will offer developer communities access to Firefly APIs and allow enterprises the ability to create exclusive custom models with their proprietary content. And finally, the industry partnerships as well as Firefly represent exciting new top-of-funnel acquisition opportunities for Express, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Our priority for now is to get Firefly broadly adopted, and we will introduce specific pricing later this year. Now turning to the Document Cloud business. PDF has become the de facto standard for the world's unstructured data, and businesses of all sizes are turning to Adobe to help streamline and automate document-based workflows. Adobe Document Cloud offers a comprehensive set of ubiquitous products to accelerate document productivity across every device by seamlessly integrating PDF services into Acrobat. In Q2, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $659 million, growing 14% year-over-year. We added $116 million of net new Document Cloud ARR with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year. Business and innovation highlights include, significant growth in Acrobat web monthly active users, driven by searches for Acrobat verbs and further accelerated by an explosion of PDF consumption through our Chrome and Edge extensions; viral adoption of PDF collaboration services, which are both increasing active use among existing users and creating a growth loop to bring new users into the Acrobat ecosystem. Mobile momentum across both App Store downloads as well as documents consumed in liquid mode. New workflows between Acrobat and Express allow users to integrate documents seamlessly into their creative process. Express now has full fidelity PDF import and editing, which allows users to make documents visually stunning; momentum across routes to market and customer segments, including key enterprise customer wins, Boston Consulting Group, Cushman & Wakefield, Novartis, T-Mobile and WPP. Today marks the 30th anniversary of Acrobat, a significant milestone that is both inspiring and humbling. PDF and Acrobat are more relevant today than ever before. We are incredibly proud of how PDF continues to transform the world of digital documents, powering communication and productivity for billions of people every day and we know that the best is yet to come. The pending acquisition of Figma will further expand our addressable market, and we have been delighted to hear from customers, partners and industry analysts who are excited about the benefits that the combination will unlock. We continue to engage in conversations with the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K., the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice as they conduct their regulatory reviews and given the merits of the case, we believe the transaction should close by the end of 2023. Adobe's Digital Media business is on a roll. We're rapidly delivering groundbreaking innovations across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Our increasing breadth of offerings is reaching a broader universe of customers, and our incredible go-to-market strength and proven data-driven operating model are propelling the growth of both our emerging and established businesses. Given the momentum, we are raising our net new Digital Media ARR and revenue targets for fiscal '23. I'll now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. In Q2, we continued to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.22 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.07 billion, representing 14% year-over-year growth. Customer interest in the digital experience category remains high. Last week, we were excited to spend time with thousands of customers and partners at EMEA Summit. Businesses of all sizes and industries around the world are increasingly relying on digital channels to engage customers and deliver experience-led growth and they are turning to Adobe as their trusted partner on that journey. Adobe Experience Cloud offers the most comprehensive set of solutions for content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys and marketing workflows.

We're working with partners, including Accenture, IBM, Omnicom and Publicis to scale the delivery of content supply chain to our joint customers. Strong demand for Workfront as it rapidly becomes a solution of choice for teams to plan, orchestrate and launch personalized campaigns at scale. Global availability of Adobe Mix Modeler to provide marketers with an AI-powered, self-service solution to accurately measure campaigns across paid, owned and earned channels. New AI innovations in Adobe Experience Manager, that provide real-time content performance data and predictions on which content will perform best by audience segment. Leadership in industry analyst reports, including the IDC Marketscape for retail commerce platforms and a positive rating in Gartner's annual assessment of Adobe's enterprise strategy. Key customer wins, including DSV, ICICI Bank, JPMorgan, Kroger, Omnicom, Royal Canin, ServiceNow, T-Mobile and Volkswagen. While overall demand is strong and win rates remain healthy, as we enter the second half, we are seeing some projects being pushed out in the current enterprise spend environment, which we have reflected in our updated annual targets. In a world where digital has become the predominant channel to reach and engage customers, Adobe is uniquely positioned to keep winning with innovative products that power end-to-end customer experiences and enable enterprises to simultaneously drive growth and profitability. I'll now pass it to Dan. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Today, I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q2 fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. Adobe's Q2 results demonstrate strong demand across a diverse portfolio of products from individuals buying through digital channels to the world's largest enterprises. While we grow existing businesses and deliver world-class profitability, Adobe continues to incubate and invest in groundbreaking new technologies that will change how people work and democratize access to our tools. I couldn't be prouder of how Adobe has navigated the current environment and position the company to win. In Q2, Adobe achieved record revenue of $4.82 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. Business and financial highlights included, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.82; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.91, Digital Media revenue of $3.51 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $470 million, Digital Experience revenue of $1.22 billion, cash flows from operations of $2.14 billion, RPO of $15.22 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 2.7 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q2 revenue of $3.51 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $14.14 billion of Digital Media ARR, growing 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.85 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We added $354 million of net new creative ARR in Q2, with strong digital demand for our offerings throughout the quarter. Second quarter creative growth drivers included, new user growth across geographies, customer segments and creative offerings driven by targeted campaigns and promotions and utilizing insights from our data-driven operating model, strong traffic and conversion on adobe.com, single app subscriptions, including a strong quarter for imaging driven by Everyone Can Photoshop campaign; strong growth in photography driven by accelerated demand for Lightroom mobile, another strong quarter for Adobe Stock and other emerging businesses with exiting ARR for both Frame.io; and Substance growing greater than 50% year-over-year in constant currency; continued success rolling out our new Acrobat CC offering integrated with Sign capabilities; and success in the enterprise as our creative and collaboration solutions continue to see strong adoption. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $659 million, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We added $116 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter, crossing the $2.5 billion milestone with exiting ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Second quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included : strong subscription demand for Acrobat with integrated sign capabilities across customer segments and geographies, driven by targeted offers, DDOM Insights and our Acrobat's Got It campaign, success monetizing new customers through the Acrobat web funnel with monthly active users growing greater than 50% year-over-year as our product-led growth strategy continues to perform well, strength in Acrobat mobile downloads, conversion and engagement with liquid mode usage up over 40% year-over-year, and strength in the enterprise, driven by seat expansion. This quarter perpetual sales accounted for less than 5% of Document Cloud revenue. Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q2, we achieved revenue of $1.22 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. Q2 subscription revenue was $1.07 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. Second quarter digital experience growth drivers included : strong demand for our Adobe Experience platform and native applications, including real-time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Journey Optimizer. In Q2, subscription revenue for AEP and apps grew more than 60% year-over-year; strength in content and commerce with AEM as a cloud service, seeing significant book of business growth in Q2; customer interest in our content supply chain solution. The value proposition of seamlessly connecting content creation workflows to customer experience management is resonating with enterprises and is driving accelerated growth for Workfront and our content solutions, continued value realization from our solutions leading to strong retention across our customer segments, and momentum selling transformational deals to large enterprises, adopting our platform and end-to-end suite of applications, including T-Mobile and Omnicom. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q2 was 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.22 billion, growing 10% year-over-year or 13% when adjusting for a 3% FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $6.60 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $2.14 billion. In Q2, we entered into a $1 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $4.15 billion remaining on our $15 billion authorization that was granted in December 2020 and goes through the end of fiscal 2024. In light of the momentum across our business and factoring in current macroeconomic conditions and summer seasonality, for Q3, we're targeting, total Adobe revenue of $4.83 billion to $4.87 billion, Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $410 million, Digital Media segment revenue of $3.55 billion to $3.57 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.08 billion to $1.10 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $2.82 to $2.88 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.95 to $4. Given the company's performance in the first half of the year and our relentless focus on driving disciplined profitable growth, we're raising our annual fiscal 2023 targets for EPS and net new Digital Media ARR. We are also raising our total Adobe revenue target for fiscal 2023 with Digital Media ahead of our previously issued targets and Digital Experience slightly lower. For fiscal 2023, we're now targeting, total Adobe revenue of $19.25 billion to $19.35 billion, Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.75 billion, Digital Media segment revenue of $14.10 billion to $14.15 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $4.85 billion to $4.90 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $4.30 billion to $4.35 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $11.15 to $11.25 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.65 to $15.75. In Q4, we expect to see year-end strength in customer demand for Digital Experience and Digital Media solutions. Our updated targets for fiscal 2023 demonstrates solid operating margin expansion in the second half as compared to the second half of fiscal 2022. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with Adobe's performance in the first half of the year. Few companies are capable of delivering strong top and bottom-line growth in a challenging environment, while at the same time, delivering game-changing innovations that will drive the next decade of growth. These innovations are generating strong customer demand for our products, shaping fiscal 2023 to be another wonderful year for Adobe. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. Our strong Q2 results underscore our momentum and the significant opportunities we have across our business. I'm proud of how our employees around the world continue to raise the bar, create the future and live our purpose. We continue to invest in hiring new college grads and interns to bring the best and brightest talent to Adobe. It's an incredibly exciting time at Adobe. Demand for our category-defining products and services continues to grow. Our innovation engine is delivering Adobe Magic for an expanding set of global customers and our strong execution is enabling us to address a massive market opportunity. 2023 is going to be another phenomenal year for Adobe as we continue to deliver top line growth and margins while investing in fundamental technologies that expand Adobe's success for decades. Thank you. We will now take questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Turrin : Nice job on the results. I mean, obviously, I think starting point is with Firefly. We've been fielding a number of questions just on how this alters the size of the market. You had some useful commentary both on monetization and your views on the market. But can you just add some context around early demand signals and how you're expecting this to show up both on the user side of the market and just the overall velocity of content generation? Thank you. David Wadhwani : Sure. Happy to talk about that. We're really excited, if you can't tell on the call, about the Firefly and what this represents. The early customer and community response has been absolutely exhilarating for all of us. You heard us talk about over 0.5 billion assets that have already been generated. Generations from Photoshop were 80x higher than we had originally projected going into the beta. And obviously, we feel really good about both the quality of the content being created and also the ability to scale the product to support that. And we have seen incredible social buzz. The Photoshop community is doing what it always does and is using the product, both Firefly and Photoshop, in ways that we didn't even think of when we were initially building the feature set. So it's great to see all this organic development and buzz coming up. And as we talked about, we're also excited about what this means from a business opportunity perspective. On the retention side, we think the value that we add in the flagship applications are going to be great for existing users. In terms of top of funnel, we think that this helps us reach billions of new users because it makes the act of creating more accessible with regard to conversion. We are very excited about what this can mean for new user onboarding, both Photoshop and Illustrator and also in Express that makes the onboarding of new customers especially early success far more achievable for them. It introduces new offers with adobe.com/firefly as a destination that we can monetize and everything that we talked about at Summit last week around what this can be as an enterprise-grade offering. And of course, with all of this, we have an opportunity to sell subscription credit packs for upsell opportunities. So if you net all that out, we see an ARPU opportunity. We see a net number of users opportunity, and also because of retention, an LTV opportunity. Now we expect all of this to play out over many years. We're very focused right now on user acquisition. None of this, we expect to impact our Q3 numbers. And we'll start to see some of it in Q4 but we don't expect it to be material. But as I mentioned, we expect to see it ramp over the next few years. And we'll share more specifics of this in the months ahead. Michael Turrin : Clearly lots to be excited about there. Thanks. Operator : And the next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Congrats on a great quarter. David, maybe for you. I want to zero in on that point around Firefly and generating billions of potential users in the years ahead. Obviously, still very early with Firefly but as well as Adobe Express. But I'm curious, what are you seeing with Adobe Express and the ability for Firefly to generate some of that demand or pull through some of that demand for Express, both on the consumer side and the enterprise side. David Wadhwani : Yes. Very excited on both fronts. As you may have seen, we had a beta release of Express last week and this is a massive update to Express. In fact, it's a brand-new product effectively built from the ground up, and we believe this is the product for everyone to use. The response has been absolutely incredible. Broad-based feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, as you mentioned, because of the integration of Firefly, but also how Firefly is able to integrate directly into the user flows and the user journeys for utilization and generation of video content, also for PDF integrations so people are able to bring in and build end-to-end workflows to generate amazing marketing collateral with PDF. We've seen CC users, existing subscribers for CC very excited about the workflows that we've introduced with both Illustrator and Photoshop. Illustrator users are able to take their illustrator output, bring it into Express, add animation and push it out to social. Photoshop users are taking their corpus of Photoshop templates, and they're making that the foundation for easy editing and sharing for their marketing organizations. And that's really been sort of an incredible vote of confidence from everyone that we've seen using the beta, which has also driven the announcements we had last week, specifically around Express and Firefly package together for enterprises. And the interest that we've seen coming out of the announcement in terms of enterprise interest and pipeline generation associated with that has been terrific. And what we're particularly excited about that is it brings our clouds together. So Creative pros are able to create in Photoshop and Illustrator and our other flagship applications. Marketers are able to take that content and edit it more quickly in Express. Both of these are orchestrated through Workfront and Frame.io and they're pushed into AM. So really a core part of our content supply chain. It really feels like an inflection point for Express as well. Shantanu Narayen : And Saket, maybe if I were to add two things to that. First, I think on the consumer side, with the new Express, if you can imagine it, you can do it. And so I think it's really powerful. And within an enterprise, much like Acrobat, we want every enterprise employee to now have a combination of both Acrobat and Express. Operator : And our next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. I guess one, it's probably for David again. David, I was just kind of curious when you think about the enterprise part of the Visual Media business. How, I guess, prepared are customers from a content perspective and a data perspective to take on some of the generative AI capabilities that you guys are bringing to market? And I'm sure this blends into Anil, too, on the Adobe Experience Manager. But I was just wondering if you guys could talk about the data aspect of this and how that interplay might help, frankly, both sides of the Digital Media and the Digital Experience businesses. Thanks. David Wadhwani : Sure. I'll say a few words and then hand it off to Anil as well. So as we've talked about, Firefly, from the beginning, has a few core principles. The first is the quality of output, right? So text. We have capability of text imaging, text-to-text effect. We have vectors in there now. We're working on video design, 3D generation as well. So we have a series of all this incredible content that we think will be a cornerstone of everything needed for enterprise content velocity. The second thing is that we're building it in a way that we can integrate into existing workflows. We've already started to announce integrations into Photoshop and Illustrator and Express. You'll also start to see us continue those integration points, but you'll also start to see us integrate it more directly into the Digital Experience workflows as well. Third is that and perhaps most importantly, we've also been able to because of the way we share and are transparent about where we get our content, we can tell customers that their content generated with Firefly is commercially safe for use. Copyrights are not being violated. Diversity and inclusion is front and center. Harmful imagery is not being generated. So we're able to give them that confidence. And also, as part of our enterprise plans, give them indemnification for the content that's being created. So those things, I think, fundamentally help them engage that. Anil Chakravarthy : Just picking up on what you said. I think if you look at Express and Firefly and also the Sensei gen AI services that we announced for Digital Experience, comes at a time when marketing is going through a big shift from sort of mass marketing to personalized marketing at scale. And for the personalization at scale, everything has to be personalized, whether it's content or audiences, customer journeys. And that's the unique advantage we have. We have the data within the Adobe experience platform with the real-time customer profiles. We then have the models that we're working with like Firefly. And then we have the interfaces through the apps like Adobe Campaign, Adobe Experience Manager and so on. So we can put all of that together in a manner that's really consistent with the data governance that customers expect that their data is used only in their context and use that to do personalized marketing at scale. So it really fits very well together. Shantanu Narayen : Maybe just given how much excitement we have around this, Kirk, three quick things. The first is it really allows for us to, within a company, have every marketer participate in the production and delivery of content. And so agility for an enterprise is great. Second thing maybe I'll add to what both Anil and David said. We can now create custom models. So think of it if you're a company like Coke or a company like Disney and you want to create these campaigns where you want to try out different things. The Firefly model can be customized for them. And that in conjunction with what we have with Express and AEM, really allows it to be tailored for that particular company. I also wanted to just clarify that, that entire go-to-market is completely aligned already within the company. And so we have one enterprise sales force calling on them across Express, Creative Cloud as well as Experience Cloud solutions. Operator : And our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Alex Zukin. Alex is flying right now, but he says it's good to see who the [indiscernible] winners are. So now to my question, the DM business continues to outperform in an impressive way. Can you talk to some of the underlying levers and stack rank what is driving the strength? Whether it's demand for content, uptake of newer products or cross-selling success? Can you help unpack the layers of success you're seeing? And then just on gen AI, you have announced new offerings with Generative Fill and more recently, Generative Recolor. As you are seeing kind of the traction you are getting online within the creative community, how is it helping inform you about where the greatest monetization opportunity is? Thank you. David Wadhwani : Sure. Yes, first of all, thanks for the question. Yes, we feel like we're off to a great start for the first half of the year. And as we look at it, the strength was very broad-based. Traffic to adobe.com and top of funnel was strong, frankly, all quarter long. And it's clear that our messaging is resonating well with a broader and broader set of audiences that we can reach. Second, we saw a strong conversion. Our product-led growth investments that we've been making for some time now are starting to pay dividends. Adobe.com is an area we've focused for a long time. We continue to see improvements in terms of customer journey work and conversion. And we've more recently been investing much more significantly in product-led growth motions in our core flagship applications like Photoshop and Acrobat as well. And we've been leveraging a lot of Anil's Digital Experience products that allow us to do personalization at scale in terms of in-product experiences there. And then lastly, it feels like we've really started to see some good inflection in our mobile applications, in particular, Acrobat on mobile and Lightroom mobile performed very well this quarter as well. In addition to that, as Dan mentioned in his opening comments, the emerging products like Substance and Frame continue to grow very nicely and really sort of slipstream into the content supply chain conversation that we're having with enterprise customers. And frankly, enterprise demand for content creation continues to grow. Anil said last week at EMEA Summit that our customers are expecting it to grow 5x in terms of content creation over the next few years. We continue to see more pull for creative apps. And also, we're starting to see enterprises invest much more in Acrobat penetration into their accounts. So they really want more people to have Acrobat from Adobe. So that's just to name a few things. Things are shaping up great for the year, and we're very excited about the direction of the business. Operator : And our next question will come from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much and congratulations on the strong quarter and the updated guidance. Dan, can you give us some color on how gen AI is going to impact margins? Especially 0.5 billion assets created just in the beta, the potential for substantial gen AI, once this is all launched, is going to be enormous. How should we think about that? Dan Durn : Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. As I reflect on the company's journey, we've got a long history of driving strong profitable growth. We deliver the innovation and the top line progression, but we do it in a very disciplined way, which drives margin and cash flow for investors. I see this playing out in a similar fashion. These are real investments. They are material investments we're making to unlock the magic of the Adobe technology platform and seamlessly integrating it across the product portfolio. When we think about the cost drivers, we think about training, we think about inference, we think about storage costs. The company is ruthlessly prioritizing how we're spending and what projects we're investing in to create a spend envelope to bring this technology to life in a very rapid fashion. You can see the discipline at play. We've been at this for several quarters. You see the strong print from a profitability standpoint in Q1. We followed through with a strong print again in Q2. And we look into the back part of the year, again, you're seeing second half year-over-year, second half over second half, showing an uptick from a profitability standpoint. So we're going to continue to stay focused on being very disciplined, how we prioritize what we do and don't do, and make sure we create the right kind of spend envelope for this technology as we bring it to life. I think it's an statement for us at the company and what we've done for a very long time here. Drive innovation, drive strong top line growth and do it in a very profitable way that's cash flow generative and value creative for investors. David Wadhwani : Yes. And just I'll add a little bit on to that because we've been working very closely between our engineering organization and the finance organization on a number of levers to make sure that we're managing and keeping discipline and cost front of mind. The first is the model training itself. There are a number of things the team has been doing to optimize our ability to train larger models more efficiently. The second is post training inference optimization. There's a lot of, I think, cutting-edge work coming out here, both in terms of research and the work we're doing around things like pruning and distillation and quantization that make the inference execution much more efficient. Third is, as we've talked about in the past, we're working with folks like NVIDIA to make sure that the hardware and software advances go hand in glove, and we're leveraging more and more compute pathways that are on the chip itself. Four is user experience, making sure that as we expose these things to users, we do it in a way that drives more efficiency in the back end. And of course, the big unlock longer term is about hybrid generative approaches. So how do we move more of this computing to the desktop as well, that will be a major cost benefit down the road. But it's a significant effort and a lot of work to do, and we take it very seriously. Shantanu Narayen : And Mark, I just wanted to add, in addition to all of that great work that we're doing on saving costs, I'm more excited about the top line growth that this is going to cause for us. Operator : And our next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citibank. Tyler Radke : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the Document Cloud strength you saw in the quarter. I saw that the business saw a nice improvement relative to last quarter. If you could just unpack that a bit. And then secondly, as I look at the full year outlook, clearly, a really strong quarter, one of the biggest speeds we've seen in years. As I think about Q4, just kind of the initial implied guide, is there anything to call out any one-time factors around pricing we should keep in mind as we compare the year-over-year decline or is that just conservatism? David Wadhwani : Yes. Maybe I'll talk about the Acrobat business and we can get to Q4 after that. So first of all, yes, another great quarter. It was great to see ARR growing 23%. And a lot of this is the basics of PDF demand, right? We've seen this incredible tailwind with demand for PDF continuing to grow. PDF has become the de facto standard for unstructured data. And PDF-related searches continue to grow. And this as Shantanu mentioned, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, 30 years after PDF had launched. So it's amazing to see how things are going. We've been investing very heavily in expanding our top of funnel. We have Acrobat Web that's been driving a lot of new users. We've seen good growth directly to Acrobat Web. Acrobat Mobile has also been a source of new opportunity for us. We talked about our extensions in Chrome and Edge. And also we've mentioned in the past, our partnership with Microsoft to really make Acrobat the foundation or PDF and Reader, the foundation of all documents viewed in Edge as well. So that creates an enormous top of funnel for us, and we continue to sort of broaden that. In addition to that, we've been adding more value directly into the products with a proliferation of signatures and collaboration capabilities. And all of that, combined with our product-led growth motion, is driving strong conversion. So we feel really good about the foundation of that business. Dan Durn : And coming to the guide, Tyler, the way I'd think about it is if we think about the journey to date this fiscal year, we had a strong print in Q1. We had a strong print in Q2. We've got a lot of momentum around this business. As we look into the back half of the year, we see that momentum continuing. We're 2 weeks into Q3. We see that momentum continuing. And as you would expect, we see a strong finish to the year in Q4. And we've got a long track record inside of the company of setting expectations and then executing against those expectations in a way that drives value for investors. And so I think the setup for the back half of the year is no different than that. Operator : And our next question will come from Matt Swanson with RBC. Matt Swanson : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And I'll add my congratulations on the quarter. We've kind of talked from the beginning that a major differentiation point for Firefly is that this is an enterprise-safe generative model. Could you just give us some insights into your customer conversations and really how focused enterprises are around the potential, maybe a copyright or trademark issues that generative could create using other solutions. Shantanu Narayen : Matt, maybe I'll take that. It's actually been off the chart the interest. We just had our Summit in London, following the successful launch that we had here where customers even in the U.S. were asking us questions. And I would say there are around three areas. All of them had perhaps experimented with other solutions. The moment Adobe came in and said this is both safe and designed for commercially safe as well as we can create the custom models, I think the interest associated with that has been off the charts. We've already created some custom models where we tweak our core model with assets that people can provide us. And that's also a secret sauce that we're unlocking and the integration of that within each of our products. So frankly, the product is not yet available, but the number of customers who want to sign on in terms of wanting to use it has been one of the most successful launches that we've had. And when I say the product is not ready, all I'm saying is it's not generally available. It's certainly available for them to put through their paces within the company. Matt Swanson : Yes. No, that sounds fantastic. We get the users and the CEOs to agree on the same product. That's a good combination. Shantanu Narayen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, at Summit, with the content supply chain news, the company pretty much effectuated something that you've been talking about for the last number of years. That is content supply chain. And the question is about the potential business impact. Could you talk about what is fundamentally new or newly required in terms of pipeline development for that broader concept of implementing Adobe product? What you think the impact might be, for example, in your average book of business that you disclosed with your top 2,500 and top 1,000 customers each year at the analyst meeting? And you do seem to be investing still heavily in consulting capacity. So is that part of the development that you're foreseeing necessary for content supply chain? Shantanu Narayen : A couple of points, Jay, and then certainly, Anil can add to it. First, I think, we are good user case for what's happening. The reality is that with what David talked about as it relates to product-led growth, what the content supply chain really allows us to do is start with a marketing brief that we're putting within workflow, start to create the campaigns, have AEM and our asset management solution be the place where all of these assets are and then deliver them through campaign as well as deliver them through the Adobe Experience Manager on the website. So I think the interest associated with this is all about trying to say all of the content that we are creating, how do we both make that more efficient as well as understand how we can both globalize, which has been a big driver of why people want this content supply chain. The traditional agencies, I think Anil referred to this. They all have not only, I think, procured our solution for their internal usage but they're also collectively taking this solution to joint customers. So I think it actually just really beautifully aligns within Anil's enterprise sales motion, how we can go with everything from workflow, which actually had a great quarter, so we continue to see good growth in workflow. So I think it aligns all of our offerings. And there isn't one customer that doesn't want. That's partly because of all the additional cost and scrutiny on what the expenses are right now. Anil Chakravarthy : Yes. We are just so uniquely differentiated across the Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud. And in terms of getting this implemented for customers, as you mentioned, we have now partnerships with Accenture, with IBM, with Omnicom, with Publicis. And all of them are working very closely with us, with our field teams to make sure that the content supply chain gets implemented for every customer across different verticals and geographies, specifically for their needs. Operator : And our next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Porter : Great. Thank you very much. This is Elizabeth Porter on for Keith Weiss. Congrats on the strong quarter. And my question is again around generative AI. There's clearly a lot of investment and news across the industry. So are there generative AI capabilities that could become table stakes? And what are the areas that drive real differentiation that is monetizable for Adobe? How do you see this market evolving between those two pieces over time where Adobe really solidifies its leadership? Shantanu Narayen : Yes. I think, for us, the entire generative AI really is all three layers that we talked about. And if you think about our generative AI strategy, it really first starts with do we have unique data that we can use on behalf of our customers for customers. And clearly, both in the creative in the document space with PDF as well as in the marketing space, the amount of data that we have is a key differentiator because that is going to dictate the models when you want to design this to be commercially safe. I think the second thing that we're really focused on is in the domains where we have incredible expertise, whether you consider it imaging or vector or documents or marketing, we are creating our own foundational models. And so when you create the foundation models, you really understand how that works, you understand how you can take it to an enterprise and create a custom model for that. But I think the real differentiator for Adobe continues to be, how does a user get value? And I think it's in the ubiquitous interfaces that we have, whether that's on the marketing side, everything where people are trying to create these campaigns or automate production or create a website or create a mobile app, similarly in documents, which we haven't touched on as much today, how they get the synthesis of the PDF, how they understand the structure of the PDF. And clearly, in creative that we've seen, both with Generative Recolor and Adobe Illustrator as well as Generative Fill in Photoshop. As long as we have the interfaces that delight customers and where all this magic comes to life, that's really, I would say, Adobe is differentiated. And you've seen that. It's not like there weren't other imaging models out there. The fact that we've captured the imagination of the community is a result of how all three of these layers really work well for Adobe better than anybody else. Jonathan Vaas : Operator, we're right at the top of the hour. Let's take one more question and then we'll conclude. Operator : Thank you. And that question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Thanks. Shantanu, a lot of questions around why won't the DX Cloud give the Creative Cloud the [indiscernible] as well. Why are you confident this won't spill over? And given on the last question, I'll break the operator's policy and asking one for David on, when you think about just the number one question we're all getting, will AI reduce the number of seats available to you. Can you just address that? That's the number one question we continue to get. Thank you. David Wadhwani : Great. I'll start with the second, and we can go to the first after that. So Brent, if you take a look at Adobe's history, this is what we do, right? If you look at desktop publishing, if you look at creative imaging, if you look at video editing, the result of Adobe's focus here is always about increasing productivity, increasing the importance of these new workflows, and that has always led to an increase in jobs. Let's take video editing as an example, right? We lowered the cost of production in video significantly with our work with Premier and After Effects in Audition. And what that did was it increased the ability for people to create more content. So they didn't create the same amount of content with fewer people. What they did was they found new business opportunities. They created more niche content that led to video streaming and personalization, and that created an explosion in the industry around video production. That's what we do. And we're sitting at a moment where companies are telling us that there's a 5x increase in content production coming out in the next couple of years. And you see a host of new media types coming out. And we see the opportunity here for both seat expansion as a result of this. And also because of the value we're adding into our products themselves, increase in ARPU as well. Now beyond all of this, in terms of professional video and professional content creation, I should say, there's also a massive opportunity because this catalyzes our ability much more effectively to go after the billions of creators around the world who need things like this to be creative. So we're going to help them also create standout content. So again, I take a step back and I say, we have an opportunity to get more people into the franchise. We have the ability to drive more ARPU through our products. And we have the ability to make people more successful and drive more LTV. So the foundation, I think, is very strong. Shantanu Narayen : And Brent, if I understood the question right, I mean, the interest within the DX customer base for what we are doing on Creative Cloud, if you look at both Summits, the interest associated with how these clouds and offerings are working together is actually one of the catalysts that I think will help both the Digital Media as well as the Digital Experience business. So you're right. I mean, we are finding that every customer is saying, this is the way for us to really go all the way from when we start to create a campaign all the way to the delivery and understanding the analytics associated with that. And I think the enterprise team has really aligned around this joint selling, and we've created a bill of materials where you can actually have both the Digital Experience as well as the Creative Cloud offerings in it. And I think that's what you're going to see. In the second half, we're going to have a lot more of these combined sales that happen with every enterprise because it helps, as we've been saying, with both the top line and the bottom line. And since it was the last question, I mean, let me end by saying it was a great first half. We appreciate all the comments that you have made about the quarter. And I wanted to thank the Adobe team for real great execution as well as, again, congratulate in particular, the Acrobat team for 30 years of amazing innovation. What I'm most proud of is, if you look at just the last few months in terms of what the company has delivered across Firefly and Generative Fill and Generative Recoloring, what's happening with Acrobat across the web, in Digital Experience, the Adobe mix model, product analytics, what we are doing around content supply chain, the new offerings that are coming for an increasing set of customers that will serve real customer problems I think really all goes well for how we will continue to drive innovation and serve customers as well. So I'm really excited about the second half as well as what we're going to continue to do in terms of delivering top line and bottom line growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, Shantanu, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I look forward to speaking with many of you soon, and this concludes the event. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation and have an excellent day.",

Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is driving our growth across every geography. By delivering innovative technology platforms and services, we continue to advance our industry leadership and delight a growing universe of customers. I'll now turn it over to David to share more about our momentum in the Digital Media business. David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q3, we achieved net new Digital Media ARR of $464 million and revenue of $3.59 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strength in both our Creative and Document businesses. On the creative side, digital content creation and consumption are exploding across every creative category, customer segment and media type. Creative Cloud is the leading creativity platform, offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for every discipline across imaging, photography, design, video, animation and 3D. We're excited about the growth we are driving with our creative flagship products, and with Adobe Express, our AI-first, all-in-one creativity app that makes it fast, easy and fun for any user to design and share standout content. Yesterday's announcements highlighted several advances to our creative business : First, after an unprecedented beta that saw over 2 billion images generated, Adobe Firefly models and the Firefly web application are now commercially available. Firefly supports text prompts in over 100 languages and enables users around the world to create content that is designed to be safe for commercial use. We will continue to train and release new Firefly foundation models in areas where we have rich datasets and expertise, such as imaging, vector, video, design, 3D and more. Second, Adobe Firefly-powered features are now natively integrated into several Creative Cloud apps, including Generative Fill and Generative Expand in Photoshop, Generative Recolor in Illustrator, and Text to Image and Text Effects in Adobe Express. These deep integrations deliver more creative power than ever before to customers, enabling them to experiment, ideate, and create in completely new ways. Third, Adobe Firefly for Enterprise is now generally available for businesses to enable both creative teams and knowledge workers to confidently deploy AI-generated content. Adobe will empower customers to create custom models using proprietary assets to generate branded content and offer access to Firefly APIs so customers can embed the power of Firefly into their own content creation and automation workflows. And finally, we announced subscription offerings including new generative AI credits with the goal of enabling broad access and user adoption. Generative Credits are tokens that enable customers to turn text-based prompts into images, vectors and text effects with other content types to follow. Free and trial plans include a small number of monthly fast Generative Credits and will expose a broad base of prospects to the power of Adobe's generative AI, expanding our top-of-funnel. Paid Firefly, Express and Creative Cloud plans will include a further allocation of fast Generative Credits. After the plan-specific number of Generative Credits is reached, users will have an opportunity to buy additional fast Generative Credit subscription packs. In Q3, we added $332 million of Creative ARR and achieved $2.91 billion of revenue, growing 14% year-over-year. Business highlights include : The integration of Firefly into Photoshop and Illustrator. Over 3 million users have downloaded the Photoshop and Illustrator beta releases. The general availability of Adobe Express now includes support for editing and posting designs, videos, images, PDFs, presentations and more. Express features include Firefly-powered Text to Image and Text Effects. Express is already being used by millions of people globally. New AI and 3D features in Premiere Pro and After Effects, including Enhance Speech and Text-Based Editing in Premiere Pro and a new 3D workspace in After Effects. The Text-Based Editing feature in Premiere Pro received the 2023 Hollywood Professional Association Award for Engineering Excellence. New Lightroom mobile now integrates directly with the camera roll and introduced a streamlined interface to make editing even easier on the go. The introduction of new video assets in Adobe Stock and strong product-led growth motions, drove a record Q3 for the Stock business. Key customer wins include Amazon, Havas, Paramount, SAP, Southern Graphics, Take-Two Interactive and U.S. Department of Energy. As we have continued to add new applications and delivered innovations across our creative offerings, we announced price updates for certain Creative Cloud plans across the Americas and Europe, starting November 1, 2023. In addition to being a growth driver in the Creative Cloud business, Acrobat and PDF continue to power the Document Cloud business. Whether it's a sales contract, legal document or a back-to-school form, seamless document workflows across every device and platform are more important than ever for all of us to be productive in our professional and personal lives. Document Cloud is powering document productivity and automation across the web, desktop and mobile. In Q3, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $685 million, growing 15% year-over-year. We added $132 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Business highlights include : Significant growth in monthly active users across web, mobile, and embedded third-party app ecosystems, reflecting our growing top of funnel and the effectiveness of our product-led growth execution. Strong mobile momentum reflecting the value of Acrobat as an essential productivity application on mobile devices.

A new Adobe PDF Electronic Seal API, which is a cloud-based, end-to-end solution for applying electronic seals on PDFs at enterprise scale. Key customer wins include Citibank, GlaxoSmithKline, Emerson Electric, Morgan Stanley and Volkswagen. We continue to be excited about the pending Figma acquisition, which will reimagine the future of creativity and productivity. We remain engaged with regulators and have confidence in the merits of the case. We look forward to hosting Adobe MAX, the world's largest creativity conference, next month in Los Angeles, where we will welcome 10,000 members of our global community and engage with hundreds of thousands more online. We will hear from inspiring creators and unveil innovations across Creative Cloud, Firefly and Express. In summary, we are excited about the pace of innovations across our Digital Media products and continued execution across multiple growth drivers. I'll now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Every company sees digital as an opportunity to drive experience-led growth. As I've spent time with customers across the world, it's clear that they are prioritizing investments in customer experience management technology to improve customer acquisition, engagement, retention and operational efficiency. We are driving revenue growth across content and commerce, customer journeys, data insights and audiences and marketing workflows, leveraging the Adobe Experience Platform, demonstrating the strength of our business. Brands around the globe are working with Adobe to accelerate personalization at scale through generative AI. With the announcement of Adobe GenStudio, we are revolutionizing the entire content supply chain by simplifying the creation-to-activation process with generative AI capabilities and intelligent automation. Marketers and creative teams will now be able to create and modify commercially safe content to increase the scale and speed at which experiences are delivered. In Q3, we continued to drive strong growth in our Experience Cloud business, achieving $1.23 billion in revenue, representing 11% year-over-year growth, as a growing number of enterprises turned to Adobe as their trusted partner for customer experience management. Subscription revenue was $1.1 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Adobe Experience Cloud delivers predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences, from acquisition to monetization to retention. We are driving strong enterprise adoption of Adobe Experience Platform, and native apps including Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics. For example, the Coca-Cola Company is leveraging Adobe Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer to bring together 98 million customer profiles globally into a single CDP to quickly deliver personalized campaigns and experiences. smart Europe, an all-electric automotive brand, is using Adobe Experience Cloud to offer customers the ability to personalize their vehicle purchases through the integration of Adobe Workfront, Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Experience Manager. Business highlights include : Strong momentum across AEP and native apps with the total book of business surpassing $600 million during the quarter. Adobe Journey Optimizer book of business more than doubled year-over-year as customers increasingly drive omnichannel personalization and engagement. Continued innovation in Adobe Experience Manager with AEM Assets now natively integrated with Firefly and Express, enabling any employee across an organization to generate and reuse beautiful on-brand content. Growth of our Workfront business, reflecting our ability to serve the workflow and collaboration needs of enterprise customers and agencies. In Q3, we added Havas to the growing list of top agencies standardizing on Adobe for their content supply chain. Expanded strategic partnership with Amazon. Given customer demand, we will jointly deliver AEP on AWS and Amazon will deploy Experience Cloud across their enterprise. Adobe's leadership in Content Management Systems was recognized across three industry analyst reports, including the IDC MarketScape for Full-stack Content Management Systems, the IDC MarketScape for Hybrid Headless CMS and the Forrester Wave for Content Management Systems. Adobe was also named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Commerce as well as the IDC MarketScape for OmniChannel Marketing Platforms for B2C Enterprises. Key customer wins include Amazon, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, Dollar General, Havas, Intuit, IRS, Jet2.com, Lufthansa, Macy's, MSC Cruises, Novo Nordisk and SAP. These and other customers continue to prioritize investments in customer experience management solutions despite increased scrutiny of enterprise IT spend. Our solutions enable enterprises to simultaneously achieve the twin goals of driving new customer acquisition and serving existing customers to deliver profitable growth. Adobe is well positioned to keep winning with our differentiated offerings, track record of innovations and ability to drive ROI for companies across industries. We're looking forward to a strong close to the year. I will now pass it to Dan. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Today I will start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q3 fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. Adobe's performance in Q3 demonstrates something that makes us exceptional, the combination of growth and profitability. In fact, at Adobe, rather than talking about trade-offs between growth or profitability, we call it an \"and\" statement. Growth and profitability is not new for us, we have been delivering both for a very long time and it is at the core of our operating philosophy. It all starts with prioritization, innovation and a sharp focus on execution. This philosophy shines through in our Q3 results. We are investing in technology platforms, global campaigns to attract and engage millions of customers and recruiting the best and brightest people in our industry. While doing that, Adobe is driving performance on margin and earnings, demonstrating what a special company we are. In Q3, Adobe achieved revenue of $4.89 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.05, up 26% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.09, up 20% year-over-year. Other business and financial highlights included : Digital Media revenue of $3.59 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $464 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.23 billion; cash flows from operations of $1.87 billion; RPO of $15.72 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 2.1 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q3 revenue of $3.59 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We added $464 million of net new ARR in the quarter, our strongest Q3 on record, exiting the quarter with $14.60 billion of Digital Media ARR, growing 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.91 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. We added $332 million of net new Creative ARR in Q3, with strong demand across our offerings. Third quarter Creative growth drivers included : new user growth across geographies, customer segments and Creative offerings, driven by innovation and targeted campaigns utilizing insights from our data-driven operating model; outstanding top-of-funnel performance resulting from viral community excitement and success of our product-led growth strategy, driving traffic to Adobe.com; single app subscriptions for Photoshop driven by interest in the magic of Firefly, Generative Fill and Generative Expand; another great quarter for value-added services, including strong customer demand for Adobe Stock; continued customer adoption of Acrobat CC; strong engagement and retention across customer segments; and success in the enterprise, driven by transformational ETLAs that span the entire Creative portfolio, including CC All Apps for creative teams, Express for knowledge workers, Frame for collaboration, and Adobe Stock and Firefly for content. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $685 million, which represents 13% year-over-year growth, or 15% in constant currency, and we added $132 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Third quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included : success with new customer acquisition through our Reader and Acrobat web funnels and distribution partners, with monthly active users up over 70% year-over-year for Acrobat web; strong demand for Acrobat subscriptions across customer segments and geographies, driven by targeted offers; strength in monetization from Acrobat mobile, which grew ending ARR over 30% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by product innovation and conversion; and traction in B2B, with strong unit demand for our Team offering through the reseller and direct routes to market. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q3, we achieved revenue of $1.23 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, or 11% in constant currency. Q3 subscription revenue was $1.10 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency. Third quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included : demand for our Adobe Experience Platform and native applications, including Real-Time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Journey Optimizer. In Q3, subscription revenue for AEP and Apps grew 60% year-over-year; strength in Content and Commerce, with Adobe Experience Manager continuing to set the standard for enterprise content management; growth of our Workfront business, as workflow and collaboration are essential components of an enterprise content supply chain solution; strong retention rates in the quarter, as we continue to focus on value realization to our Digital Experience customers; and continued momentum in transformational platform deals with large enterprises adopting our end-to-end suite of applications. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q3 was 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate came in lower than expected due to tax benefits associated with the vesting of share-based payments in the quarter. RPO exiting the quarter was $15.72 billion, growing 11% year-over-year, or 13% when adjusting for a 2% FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $7.52 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.87 billion. In Q3, we entered into $1 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $3.15 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020. Factoring in current macroeconomic conditions and year-end seasonal strength, for Q4, we are targeting : total Adobe revenue of $4.975 billion to $5.025 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $520 million; Digital Media segment revenue of $3.67 billion to $3.70 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.25 billion to $1.27 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.11 billion to $1.13 billion; tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $3.10 to $3.15; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.10 to $4.15. Q3 was a great quarter for Adobe, and I couldn't be more pleased with how the company is positioned to continue to deliver for our customers and investors. We're looking forward to our Investor Meeting at Adobe MAX on October 10, where we'll do a deep dive into our AI innovation. I hope to see you there. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. Adobe's strong Q3 results are a reflection of our team's exceptional execution. We recently lost our beloved co-founder John Warnock. John's brilliance and innovations changed the world. He was one of the greatest inventors of our generation and an inspiration to the technology industry. While we miss him tremendously, it gives me great comfort knowing that John was so proud of all of the innovation Adobe continues to deliver. As someone who shares John's passion for product and innovation, I'm exceptionally energized by the technology platforms we are delivering with AI at the center across our three clouds to delight customers. Our brand, technology and our talented employees position us for a strong close to the year and continued growth in the decades to come. Adobe's best days are ahead of us. Thank you. We will now take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and really nice quarter. Dan, actually a margin question, for you. And kind of a riddle that, like, we've been thinking about. We've been told generative AI is really expensive to run. The inference and training costs are really high. You guys have been running a beta for a while, 2 million images generated. There's a lot of functionality already in the product. And your operating margins are up. Your gross margins are up on a year-on-year basis. So, how are you able to do that? Like, where are these costs going, if you will? And on a go-forward basis, if all this stuff becomes generally available, how should we think about that gross margin impact or the overall margin impact of generative AI on a go-forward basis? Thank you. Dan Durn : Yeah. Thanks, Keith. So, as you rightfully point out, the engine of innovation at the company is really strong. A lot of exciting announcements this week, but we've been at this now a year, bringing the magic of generative AI and Firefly to life. And we're just getting started from an innovation standpoint. Over the last six months, we've been live with the beta. And as you point out, we've generated -- our customers have generated over 2 billion images. And I know it's not lost on people. All this has done while we're delivering strong margins. But when we take a step back and think about these technologies, we have investments from a COGS standpoint, inferencing, content, from an R&D standpoint, training, creating foundation models, and David alluded to it in his prepared comments, the image model for Firefly family of models is out. But we're going to bring other media types to market as well. So, we're making substantive investments. When I go back to the framing of my prepared comments, we really have a fundamental operating philosophy that's been alive at the company for a long time : growth and profitability. We're going to prioritize, we're going to innovate, and we're going to execute with rigor, and you see that coming through in all of the financial results of the company. As we think about going -- the profile going forward, what I'll come back to is, is when we initially set fiscal 2023 targets, implicit in those targets was a 44.5% operating margin. If you think about how we just guided Q4, where we've got these four great new products and these technologies infused into the product lineup, and all of the support we're going to do as we roll these out in our MAX conference down in L.A. again to keep the enthusiasm with the customer base building, implicit in that guide is an operating margin of around 45.5%. So, as you think about us leading this industry, leading the inflection that's unfolding in front of us, that mid-40%s number we think is the right ballpark to think about the margin structure of the company as we continue to drive this technology and leadership. Looking forward to the Q4 earnings call where we will share more about our fiscal 2024 targets. Shantanu Narayen : And maybe Keith, just 30 seconds to add to that, for investors like you who want to make sure we're not in any way not investing in the future, we are investing on training for 3D, for video, for new forms of imaging and vectors. So, what we are confident is while we continue to invest in that, the scrutiny that Dan and his team have on other expenses, that we can continue to drive top-line growth as well as cash flow and EPS. So, I think we're unique in that respect. Keith Weiss : Definitely. Very impressive, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Operator : And our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Sorry to hear of John Warnock's passing. My condolences. But congrats on the quarter. As we look at the pricing model for generative AI products which are based on consumption, do you think that these -- rather, how additive do you think the generative AI offerings will be to the growth profile of the company going forward? And also one for Dan. When you look at your Q4 guidance, are you contemplating -- it looks like it's not largely changed versus the Street's prior expectations. Are we not embedding any opportunities to show what the generative AI products can do? Because they seem to be largely incremental to what had been contemplated when you first gave guidance fall of last year. Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Well, Kash, maybe David and I can take the first parts of the question. And just again, for everybody on the call, I think to summarize the new offerings that we have, we've announced that we have a Firefly subscription. So, you can use a free trial number of credits, and after that, you can actually subscribe to Firefly. We have Adobe Express, which now includes an allocation of Firefly. We certainly have the Creative Cloud products and Photoshop and Illustrator that have it. We have Generation Credit Packs, and we have GenStudio for the Enterprise and to be able to deal with it. So first, I just wanted to make sure that you recognized the tremendous innovation that we're delivering associated with that. And as you know, one of the things that we have done is to really focus on both new user acquisition, which is going to be driven across all of those offerings, as well as with the price increase, given there is an allocation associated with it for existing customers, they will start to see that as they roll over and they have to renew their subscription. So, I just wanted to set that bit, and maybe then I'll ask David to add a little bit about each of these and how we see that play out. David Wadhwani : Yeah, thanks, Shantanu. Yeah, as Shantanu said, we look at the business implications of this through those two lenses : new user adoption, first and foremost, and then sort of opportunity to continue to grow the existing book of business. On the new user side, we've said this for years, our focus continues to be on proliferation. We believe that we have a massive number of users in front of us. We continue to have our primary focus being net user adds and subscribers. And so, the goal here in proliferation is to get the right value to the right audience at the right price. And if I think about the four new offerings that Shantanu teed up, I think two of them are primed to maybe be on the earlier side of that. First, on the individual side, Express. It's been in the market for over a year now, and the new release of Express is a massive step forward in terms of the abilities that it has, both -- everything from performance to support for a broader set of things beyond design, into video and into illustration, into PDF and document workflows. So, there's just a tremendous amount of new value that we've added, including generative AI into that. So, we think that Express will be an early indicator of that success that we're talking about. The second one is the work that we're doing in the DME business in conjunction with Anil on the DX business around enterprises, so GenStudio, and enabling the broad base of marketers to actually use Express in conjunction with the Creative Studio teams using Creative Cloud to really accelerate their use of and creation of content. So that really -- in the context of the short-term contributors, we think that will be really meaningful. We also expect that -- as we do this and drive new users, we expect to see a lot of new users come into the free plans. And that's going to take a little time to ramp. We'll bring them into the Adobe family, get them using the products, and ramp them to greater value over time. So, first and foremost, proliferation on new users. The second thing is going to be on the book of business. And here, we're -- basically, the pricing changes. Just as a reminder, they have a rolling impact. We're going to start them late in Q4. And we're going to start it in certain geos only. And then, we're going to have a measured rollout in new countries over the course of the next couple of years. And then certainly also as it relates to enterprise customers, the renewal timing will probably take about three years, given the multi-year contracts that we have in place. So, net-net, we see this truly as a seminal moment for how we're going to grow the business, but it's going to take a few years to play out, and we're really excited about sort of what this means for bringing new customers into the franchise. Shantanu Narayen : And maybe Kash, just to then tie that all together, in terms of the numbers that we've given for Digital Media ARR, because you asked the question from the beginning of the year, remember, I think we guided to $1.65 billion, if you look at what it is even with our Q4 guide that I think $200 million more than that, $1.86 billion or something to that effect. And since we guided in Q3, for Q3 and Q4, $100 million. So, we continue to be really confident and we're excited about the roadmap. Operator : And our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter and outlook. Anil, actually my question is for you. Obviously, a lot to talk about with Firefly in the Digital Media business. And it's very clearly a revenue opportunity there. I'm wondering how you think about the generative AI roadmap or revenue opportunity in the Digital Experience part of the business. I know we talked about the content supply chain, but how do you think about the future of generative AI in your business? Anil Chakravarthy : Yeah, thanks, Saket. Shantanu and David already talked about the Adobe GenStudio, and we're really excited about that. This is a unique opportunity, as you said, for enterprises to really create personalized content and drive efficiencies as well in -- through automation and efficiency. When you look at the entire chain of what enterprises go through, from content creation, production, workflow, and then activation through DX, through all the apps we have on our platform, we have the unique opportunity to do that. We already have deployed it within Adobe for our own Photoshop campaign. And we're working with a number of agencies and customers to do that. So, this is a big net new opportunity for us with Adobe GenStudio. We're also working on generative AI for other DX applications as well. And at the investor meeting in October, we'll share more details. But we see a similar opportunity with generative AI to bring together the ability for a number of users across marketing departments or organizations to be able to use the Adobe Experience platform and apps and it'll act as a co-pilot to accelerate the use cases that they bring to life. So, we'll share more about that at the investor meeting. Shantanu Narayen : Saket, maybe, just to give Anil and the team a lot of credit for what they actually accomplished in Q3 as well, the wins in Q3 in the enterprise actually included a lot of the components of GenStudio, both in the Digital Media as well as in the Digital Experience. So, certainly the transformational deals that we're talking about, a big part of that is the synergy between the two clouds. So, I wanted to point that out as well. David Wadhwani : And if I could actually just add one quick thing is that the GenStudio work that Anil team has been doing, we've actually been using that within the Digital Media business already to release some of the campaigns that we've released this quarter. So, it's one of these things that it's great to see the impact it's having on our business, and that becomes a selling point for other businesses too. Saket Kalia : Great to hear. Thanks. Operator : And moving on to Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Gregg Moskowitz : Hey, thank you for taking the question. Congratulations as well on a strong quarter. So, when I look at Firefly, the amount of image generation in a six-month period is clearly pretty stunning. I'm just wondering if you're able to provide any additional color, whether it be monthly active users or some other metric that may additionally help all of us gauge the improvements that Firefly is driving to your engagement level, to your top-of-funnel, et cetera? Thank you. David Wadhwani : Yeah, happy to talk about that. It's been a remarkable few months. I mean, we've said a few things. First is that the viral excitement that we saw because of Firefly on social has been hugely beneficial and it's certainly driven a lot of top-of-funnel opportunity for us. In addition to that, one of the things that we were very excited about is when we integrated it into our CreativePro applications, Illustrator and Photoshop primarily, we saw over 3 million downloads of those betas -- beta applications, which is something we've never seen before. That gives you a sense of like how thirsty the existing customer base is for the generative capabilities that we have as well. And lastly, one of the things that we're very excited about, and we obviously track very carefully, is what does this do in terms of giving us access to new users that don't typically come to Adobe. And both Express and Firefly, and in particular the integration of Firefly and Express, has been a real accelerant to that. So, it's been nice to see us not just getting excitement within the current base, but seeing millions of other users coming in, that would not have typically come to Adobe for a product and then giving -- and starting their journey with Adobe through Firefly and Express. Shantanu Narayen : Two other maybe financial indicators to that, Gregg, are first the Photoshop Single App, and I think Dan referred to that. Even in the beta, that actually drove a lot of Photoshop Single App and the early indicators of how that also benefits retention in the entire book of business. So both of those are also good financial indicators of the potential of AI. Gregg Moskowitz : Great. Thank you, both. Operator : And we have a question from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Brad Sills : Wonderful. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about a comment that I think David made earlier in the call where you're working hard to make Firefly the option for content design to be safe. I would love to double click on that, understand a little bit, how is Adobe the safe option, and how is the company making this Firefly in this new generative frontier the safe option for enterprises? David Wadhwani : Yeah. So from the very beginning of Firefly, we took a very different approach to how we were doing generative. We started by looking at and working off the Adobe Stock base, which are contents that are licensed and very clearly we have the rights to use. And we looked at other repositories of content where they didn't have any restrictions on usage, and we've pulled that in. So, everything that we've trained on has gone through some form of moderation and has been cleared by our own legal teams for use in training. And what that means is that the content that we generate is, by definition, content that isn't then stepping on anyone else's brand and/or leveraging content that wasn't intended to be used in this way. So that's the foundation of what we've done. We've gone further than that, of course, and we've now actually -- we've been working with our Stock contributors. We've announced, in fact, yesterday we had our first payout of contributions to contributors that have been participating and adding Stock for the AI training. And we're able to leverage that base very effectively, so that if we see that we need additional training content, we can put a call to action, call for content out to them, and they're able to bring content to Adobe in a fully licensed way. So, for example, earlier this quarter, we decided that we needed a million new images of crowd scenes. And so, we put a call to action out. We were able to gather that content in. But it's fully licensed and fully moderated in terms of what comes in. So as a result, all of the content we generate is safe for commercial use. The second thing is that because of that, we're able to go to market and also indemnify customers in terms of how they're actually leveraging that content and using it for content that's being generated. And so, enterprise customers find that to be very important as we bring that in, not just in the context of Firefly standalone, but we integrate it into our Creative Cloud applications and Express applications as well. So, the whole ecosystem has been built on that. And the last thing I'll say is we've been very focused on fair generation. So, we look intentionally for diversity of people that are generated and we're looking to make sure that the content we generate doesn't create or cause any harm. And all those things are really good business decisions and differentiate us from others. Brad Sills : Great to hear. Thanks, David. Operator : And we have a question from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Keith Bachman : Yes, thank you. I wanted to go back -- David, I wanted to hear your perspective on kind of the third cloud, the Document Cloud, if you will, as we look out over the next 12 months. And the spirit of the question is there's a lot of attention, appropriately so, given Firefly and whatnot, and perhaps even lending itself in the Experience Cloud. But does gen AI provide any tailwinds associated with the Document Cloud, or is it sort of the existing drivers that will help contribute to growth as we look at next year? But any just kind of -- what are the key things that we should be thinking about for Document Cloud? Many thanks. David Wadhwani : Yeah. First of all, we are very happy with the quarter Doc Cloud had. The ending book of business grew 22% in constant currency. And the strength of that is really driven based on top-of-funnel growth. So, Acrobat on the web had a phenomenal year-over-year growth rate. We've been working very actively to get Acrobat sort of deployed with -- as plugins within the browsers. We've got a great -- we've been doing a lot of product-led growth work in the products themselves to drive link sharing, so that more and more people are not just using our products, but as they share links, we're actually able to capture more people and build growth loops. Signatures has been also doing incredibly well. So, as we've got this broad-based proliferation of our surfaces that are available and continue to grow in terms of both free and paid usage, it creates a surface area that we can introduce a lot of really interesting things into. We haven't announced anything publicly associated with gen AI directly inside of Acrobat, but I think you can fairly safely expect to hear more about that from us soon. And what makes gen AI particularly interesting as it relates to Acrobat is the distribution that we have with Acrobat. So, if Acrobat is -- and Reader are in front of hundreds of millions of people on a monthly basis, our ability to insert generative AI into their workflows, just like we've been able to really differentiate our work on generative AI in creative by inserting it into the workflows of creative folks, I think that becomes the secret sauce to how we differentiate ourselves. Keith Bachman : Interesting. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Shantanu, you mentioned success in ETLAs. What's driving that? Especially given some of the macro jitters are still lingering, are you starting to see those jitters go away and that's a result of what's happening with the ETLAs? Shantanu Narayen : I think in the ETLAs specifically, Brent, both to the comments that David and Anil mentioned, the first is the amount of content that people are creating, there's a lot of interest associated with ensuring that the combination of Creative Cloud plus Express that people can really understand what they are spending on their content, as well as find ways to use AI to automate it, to localize it, to improve production costs. So, I think that message is certainly resonating with people. And the fact that Express can be a productivity application for every knowledge worker in the enterprise, much like Acrobat as well. So, I think both of those are really leading to a significant amount of great conversations. I think, mobile -- David perhaps mentioned even in his prepared remarks how mobile has been one of the tailwinds that we've seen, Brent. So, I think that's also working. So, I think investment in productivity gains is clearly top of mind right now. And both of these play well into that narrative in enterprises. Brent Thill : Thanks. Operator : And we have a question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. And I guess a two-parter on generative AI. First just around the pricing model for generative credits, obviously, very progressive. And I guess how should we think about as we go forward? And you've seen at least on the hobbyist side, some of the usage of Firefly and within Express. How do we think about for the two cohorts of both obvious and professional creatives? How many credits are kind of a typical user or use case likely to drive in a given month? And to the question that you got kind of about Document Cloud and the impact of generative AI on that business, is it fair to think that given the pricing that's been announced, the next wave of incremental innovation, is that going to come more from a new product availability, or should we think about more pricing enabled levers to come? Shantanu Narayen : I think, Alex, on the first question associated with how did we think about pricing, I mean, first, it's important to remember the breadth of all of the segments that we serve. In other words, how we think about K-12 all the way to the largest enterprise in the world. And I think it's fair to say that philosophically, we wanted to drive more adoption. And therefore, the pricing as it relates to what's included in the at least short run for Firefly subscriptions, Express subscriptions, GenStudio in terms of how much they can get within an enterprise is going to be the bulk of how we recognize the ARR. And I think getting that adoption and usage is where the primary focus is going to be in terms of the new user adoption, as well as for existing customers, the pricing upgrade. So that's how we think about it. We certainly need the ability to have the generative packs, but I think just getting everybody exposed to it. One of the real innovations that we did that's driven tremendous uptake in that is what we've called this context aware sort of menus within Photoshop. So, it's so front and center, you'll start to see that being rolled out in all of the other applications. So that's sort of the focus. Let's get the core subscriptions, let's get all of them exposed to it, and let's make sure that we're covering what we need to by the pricing actions that we took. So that was sort of the focus. I think on the Doc Cloud part and how we look at it, to add to again what David said, I mean, some of the things that people really want to know is how can I have a conversational interface with the PDF that I have? Not just the PDF that I have open right now, but the PDF that are all across my folder, then across my entire enterprise knowledge management system, and then across the entire universe. So, much like we're doing in creative, where you can start to upload your images to get -- you train your own models within an enterprise, [indiscernible]. The number of customers who want to talk to us now that we've sort of designed this to be commercially safe and say, hey, how do we create our own model? Whether you're a Coke or whether you're a Nike, think of them as having that, I think in the document space, the same interest will happen, which is we have all our knowledge within an enterprise associated with PDFs. Adobe helped me understand how your AI can start to deliver services like that. So, I think that's the way you should also look at the PDF opportunity that exists, just more people taking advantage of the trillions of PDFs that are out there in the world and being able to do things. The last thing maybe I'll mention on this front, Alex, is the APIs. So part of what we are also doing with PDFs is the fact that you can have all of this now accessible through APIs, it's not just the context of the PDF, the semantic understanding of that to do specific workflows. We're starting to enable all of that as well. So, hopefully that gives you some flavor. You're right, the generative credits has been designed to more for adoption right now, but we also wanted to make sure that at the high end, we were careful about how much generative credits we allow. David Wadhwani : Yeah. And just one thing to add to that, Alex, is that one of the things we did, first of all, it was a very thoughtful, deliberate decision to go with the Generative Credit model and the limits, as you can imagine, we're very, very considered in terms of how we set them. The limits are, of course fairly low for free users. The goal there is to give them a flavor of it and then help them convert. And for paid users, especially for people in our single apps and all apps planned, one of the things we really intended to do was try and drive real proliferation of the usage. We didn't want there to be generation anxiety put in that way. We wanted them to use the product. We wanted the Generative Fill and Generative Expand. We wanted the vector creation. We wanted to build the habits of using it. And then, what will happen over time as we introduce 3D, as we introduce video and design and vectors, and as we introduce these Acrobat capabilities that Shantanu was talking about, the generative credits that are used in any given month continues to go up because they're getting more value out of it. And so that's the key thing. We want people to just start using it very actively right now and build those habits. Alex Zukin : Super clear. Super thoughtful. If I could sneak one in for Dan. Of the $520 million in the net new ARR for Q4, just roughly, you've talked about before having some impact from the generative AI product that you were going to launch this year. Is it fair to assume it's very minimal in that $520 million? Dan Durn : Yeah, I would say it's modest impact to the business in Q4. And again, a quarter from now when we give our FY 2024 targets, we'll have more to say of what that looks like going forward, but modest impact in Q4. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : And we'll take a question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great, thanks very much. David, you talked about making Firefly APIs available to customers to embed Firefly into their own content creation and workflows. Can you talk about the use cases and monetization? And is this something you foresee partners leveraging as well into their own third-party offerings? David Wadhwani : Yes, absolutely. Our goal right now is for enterprises and third parties that we work with is to provide a few things. The first is this ability, obviously, to have API access to everything that we are building in, so that they can build it into their workflows and their automation stack. The second thing is to give them the ability to extend or train their own models as well. So, as we mentioned earlier, our core model -- foundation model is a very clean model that generates great content and you can rely on it commercially. We want our customers and partners to be able to extend that model with content that is relevant to them so that Firefly is able to generate content in their brand or in their style. So, we'll give them the ability to train their own model as well. And then, last but certainly not least, we'll give them some core workflows that will work with our existing products, whether it's Express or whether it's Creative Cloud or GenStudio as well, so that they can then integrate everything they're doing onto our core platform. And then, from a monetization perspective, you can imagine the metering concepts that we have for Generative Credits, extending to API calls as well. And of course, those will all be custom negotiated deals with partners and enterprises. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Congrats. Jonathan Vaas : Hey, operator, we're getting close to the top of the hour. We'll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Great. Thank you very much. Shantanu, over the last decade or more, one of the most important attributes of how you've managed your product portfolio have been the intra-segment and inter-segment integrations, particularly between Digital Media and DX. There is, as you know, a famous acronym for that. Now when we think about the current generation of integrations that you just announced, including yesterday, aside from the Firefly-ing of the product line and the proliferation of Firefly, what are some of the internal developmental changes that you yourselves have had to make in order to support the development of new integrations, new packaging? What are you doing differently internally? And then, externally, particularly to support the new generation of products, what are you having to invest in, in terms of customer support and enabling their adoption? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah, Jay, I mean, certainly I think at MAX also you'll see a bunch more of the innovation. I think first internally, I'd be remiss if I didn't start off by saying how really thrilled I am with how quickly the company has embraced the possibilities of AI, how we've run all of these betas out there at a scale that, as we have said, is unprecedented, dealing with the differentiation that we can provide, whether that's how we deal with the data, understanding the indemnification, how we embed all of this AI stuff in the interfaces, and we've already shown that in Photoshop, Illustrator, Express, as well as create the new offering. So, I think the pace of innovation internally of what we have done is actually truly amazing. I mean, relative to a lot of the companies that are out there and the fact that we've gone from talking about this to very, very quickly making it commercially available, I don't want to take for granted the amount of work that went into that. I think internally it is really galvanized, because we are our own biggest user of these technologies. What we are doing associated with the campaigns and the GenStudio that we are using, as David alluded to it, our Photoshop Everyone Can campaign, or the Acrobat's Got It campaign, or how we will be further delivering campaigns for Express as well as for Firefly, all of this is built on this technology. And we use Express every day, much like we use Acrobat every day. So, I think it's really enabled us to say, are we really embracing all of this technology within the company? And that's been a big change, because I think the creative products, we've certainly had phenomenal usage within the company, but the extent to which the 30,000 employees can now use our combined offering, that is very, very different internally. So, very pleased associated with that. And I think one way in which that manifests is that all of our product reviews right now include all three groups. So, there's very little product sort of reviews that happen without people from Creative and Document and the Experience Cloud being part of it. So that's one of them. I think the work that we have already put in on the digital excellence as part of D-DOM, that also gives us a lot of confidence of, \"Now that we have this breadth of offering, how do we make sure that we can personalize the offerings?\" Part of the success that was driven in this quarter, Jay, was to do with the fact that the Stock and these value-added services, I think the digital excellence team in terms of the D-DOM have really got very good at segmenting our customers and understanding how we can make sure that they have the right offering. And now think of that with all of the breadth of offerings that we have across mobile and desktop and web. So, I think internally and externally, this has been again a real sort of drinking from the fire hose of how we embrace AI. And so, I think those are really two examples of how we've done it. And the third thing I would say is that in parallel, internally we've had to really change. Where prior to this, Jay, we may have said, okay, we're really going to make all of this magic happen in one of our applications. Today, that has to happen not just within the application, which we've certainly done, but it has to happen as an API so that everybody else can use it. It has to happen as a web-only playground, which is what Firefly and Express both are. So, the simultaneous release of not just investing in the model, but making sure that's available across all the surfaces, I would say that's another thing. And the last thing I'll leave you with is you've seen this for imaging. Make no mistake, those same investments, whether it's in vector or animation or 3D or -- all of those video certainly are underway. And so, I think the parallelism associated with saying how do we embrace this opportunity, I think that's also been another big change. But I think it's clear given this was the last question before I hand it over to Jonathan that a lot of the questions have been focused on understanding right now all of our announcements and the monetization associated with it. But I did want to again sort of acknowledge that we have delivered all of this innovation at a breakthrough pace. And so, we'll certainly share more as it relates to how we see this play out. At MAX, you'll see us have more information on the products. And certainly with the 2024 targets, you'll start to get more visibility into how and why we believe this is both a growth opportunity as well as embracing new customers. So, thank you for joining us. And with that, I will turn it back over to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, Shantanu, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Looking ahead, we have an exciting lineup planned for MAX starting on October 10, and we hope you'll be able to attend the entire conference. At the Investor Meeting after the day one keynote, we plan to focus on the impact of AI across our customer offerings with previews into our technology roadmap and how these innovations expand Adobe's reach. Given that, fiscal 2024 targets will be provided at our December earnings call. In addition, we're planning another investor event at Adobe Summit in March to give more insight into our addressable markets and financial performance. We hope to see you there. Thanks, everyone, and this concludes the call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

Q4 was the culmination of another record year for Adobe, achieving $19.41 billion in revenue, which represents 13% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2023 was $11.82 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $16.07, both representing 17% year-over-year growth. We exited the year with $17.22 billion in RPO. Our strong performance reflects the mission-critical role our products play in a digital-first world, incredible product innovation and exceptional execution. Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud have become the foundation of digital experiences, starting with the moment of inspiration to the creation and development of content and media to the personalized delivery and activation across every channel. Adobe's mission of changing the world through personalized digital experiences and our delivery of foundational technology platforms, set us up for the next decade of growth. We take pride in being one of the most inventive, diversified, and profitable software companies in the world. We believe that every massive technology shift offers generational opportunities to deliver new products and solutions to an ever-expanding set of customers. AI and generative AI is one such opportunity and we've articulated, how we intend to invest and differentiate across, data, models, and interfaces. We have delivered against this strategy and I'm pleased that a number of our groundbreaking innovations, including our Firefly models and integrations across Creative Cloud, Liquid Mode and integrations across Document Cloud and AI services in our real-time Customer Data Platform and integrations in Experience Cloud, are now seeing tremendous usage by customers. We remain excited about the strategic opportunity with Figma, to jointly advance product design, accelerate collaborative creativity on the web, and redefine the future of creativity and productivity. We continue to engage with the European Commission, the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK, and the US Department of Justice, as they conduct their regulatory reviews. The EC has provided a preliminary statement of objections and the CMA has issued provisional findings of competition concerns. We strongly disagree with these findings and are responding to the respective regulators. As per the current timelines, the EC's decision deadline is February 5th and the CMA\u2019s is February 25th, while the DOJ does not have a formal timeline to decide whether to bring a complaint, we expect a decision soon. I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our Digital Media business. David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q4, we achieved net new Digital Media ARR of $569 million and revenue of $3.72 billion, which grew 14% year-over-year, fueled by innovation in both our Creative and Document businesses. Starting with Creative Cloud, global demand for content is accelerating and continues to be a tailwind for the business. Creative Cloud remains the creativity platform of choice for creators across imaging photography, design, video, web, animation, and 3D. Our rapid pace of product and AI model innovation is empowering a wide and growing base of individuals, students, creative professionals, small-business owners, and enterprises to create and monetize amazing content more quickly and easily than ever before. We were thrilled to come together in person with thousands of creators at Adobe MAX in Los Angeles. And at our MAX event in Tokyo with millions more from our community engaging with us online. We reached a record 300 million social interactions in the month following MAX. Q4 was a record quarter for Creative Cloud, achieving $3 billion in revenue, which grew 14% year-over-year. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $398 million. Business highlights include strong digital traffic, resulting from product innovation, social engagement, and our continued product-led growth efforts which drove record new commercial subscriptions in the quarter. The general availability of our generative AI Firefly models and their integrations across Creative Cloud drove tremendous customer excitement with over 4.5 billion generations since launch in March. The release of three new Firefly models, Firefly Image two model, Firefly Vector model, and Firefly Design model, offering highly differentiated levels of control with Effects, Photo Settings, and Generative Match. We also introduced Generative Credits as part of our Creative Cloud subscription plans. The general availability of Photoshop Generative Fill and Generative Expand which are seeing record adoption, they're already among the most used features in the product. Advances in Adobe Illustrator with the introduction of Text to Vector beta enabling users to generate icons, scenes, subjects, patterns, gradients. Adobe Premiere Pro advances include a significant performance improvement in the timeline for faster and smoother editing, new color preferences, and improved tone mapping. Premiere Pro is now natively integrated with Frame.io offering faster content sharing and collaboration. The combination of Adobe Express and Firefly is enabling everyone from Creative Pros to beginners to quickly move from ideation to task-based workflows in Express dramatically expanding our reach and widening our top-of-funnel. The family of generative capabilities across Express including Text to Image, Text Effects, Text to Template, and Generative Fill are driving adoption of Express and making it even faster and more fun for users of all skill levels. Express now comes pre-installed on all new Chromebooks, making it accessible to students, educators, and anyone using Chrome OS. Continued strength in Adobe Stock which had its best year ever driven by accelerating demand for high-quality image, vector, video, and 3D content. Creative Cloud, Express, and Firefly integrations with Adobe GenStudio enabling ideation, creation, and stakeholder collaboration as part of their overall content supply chain. Strong mid-market and enterprise adoption driven by up-sell to Creative Cloud offerings with Firefly. Key customer wins include Cyber Agent, Deloitte, Discovery Communications, Nexstar Media, Pepsi, Publicis, and the United Nations. We are thrilled with the momentum we're seeing in the Creative business following a year of unprecedented innovation. Customer excitement around Firefly integrations across our applications has been great to see with community engagement, social interactions, and creative marketing campaigns, driving organic brand search volume, traffic, and record demand. While we started rolling out new Creative Cloud pricing in select geographies in November, the primary driver of growth continues to be new paid subscriptions across our routes-to-market. We are excited to build on this momentum as we enter FY '24. Now turning to Document Cloud, digital documents are essential enablers of our personal and professional lives. Document Cloud is a leader in digital documents powering all common document actions including editing, sharing, reviewing, scanning, and signing. Document Cloud innovations are advancing accessibility, comprehension, productivity, automation, and security in document workflows across web, desktop, and mobile. In Q4, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $721 million, growing 17% year-over-year. We added a record $171 million of net new Document Cloud ARR with ending ARR growing 23% year-over-year in constant currency. Business highlights include Acrobat Web growth, which continues to be an incredible source of customer acquisition, with monthly active users up over 70% year-over-year. The surge in usage of link sharing for stakeholder collaboration around PDF files, which increased 400% year-over-year, creating a viral growth loop, that is bringing tens of millions of users into the Acrobat ecosystem. This is a great example of how we are scaling our PLG motions. Strong demand for Acrobat on mobile with MAU surpassing 100 million users in Q4. Liquid Mode has now served over one billion files to customers demonstrating how indispensable this technology has become on mobile devices. Adobe Acrobat to Express workflows making it even easier to import, edit, and enhance documents to create visually stunning PDFs. Key enterprise customer wins include Alshaya, Bank of America, Department of Veterans Affairs, Mastercard, State Farm Auto Insurance, and Volkswagen. Much like the Creative business, we expect generative AI to deliver additional value and attract new customers to Document Cloud. Acrobat's generative AI capabilities, which will enable new creation, comprehension and collaboration functionality have already been rolled out in a private beta. We expect to release this in a public beta in the coming months. It's been an extraordinary year for the Digital Media business with the introduction of hundreds of transformative innovations that are reshaping the future of creativity, productivity, and digital experiences. Capping this year\u2019s many accolades, TIME magazine recognized Adobe Liquid Mode, Photoshop Generative Fill, and Generative Expand, among the best inventions of 2023. I'll now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Digital experiences are indispensable for every business in every category, enabling companies of all sizes to engage and transact with customers around the world. Adobe's Holiday Shopping Report, which analyzes trillions of data points, found that both Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales hit record highs of $9.8 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, jumping 7.5% and 9.6% from last year. We predicted that holiday 2023 spend will exceed $221 billion in the US alone. Adobe Experience Cloud is optimally positioned to capitalize on this massive global opportunity. Companies across B2C and B2B are turning to Adobe Experience Cloud as the platform to accelerate experience-led growth. Our leading solutions spanning data insights and audiences, content, and commerce, customer journeys, and marketing workflow, empower businesses to drive customer demand, engagement, and growth while simultaneously delivering productivity gains. Our comprehensive set of applications, including Real-Time CDP are built natively on our highly differentiated Adobe Experience Platform, providing companies with a unified profile of each of their customers to deliver personalized, real-time experiences at scale. Generative AI accelerates our pace of innovation across the Experience Cloud portfolio enabling us to build on our capabilities to deliver personalized digital experiences. Our efforts are focused in three areas : one, augmenting our applications with an AI Assistant that significantly enhances productivity for current users, and provides an intuitive conversational interface to enable many more knowledge workers to use our products; two, reimagining existing Experience Cloud applications, like we did with Adobe Experience Manager; and three, developing entirely new solutions built for the age of generative AI, like Adobe GenStudio. In Q4, we continue to drive strong growth in the Experience Cloud business across our enterprise and mid-market customers achieving $1.27 billion in revenue. Subscription revenue was $1.12 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth. Business highlights include, strong momentum with Adobe Experience Platform and native applications inclusive of Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and Customer Journey Analytics. AEP had its first $100 million quarter of net-new business in Q4 and exited the year with a greater than $700 million annualized book of business. Release of Adobe GenStudio, an end-to-end solution that brings together best-in-class applications across Creative Cloud, Express, and Experience Cloud with Firefly generative AI at the core to help brands meet the rising demand for content. GenStudio provides a comprehensive offering spanning content ideation, creation, production, and activation. We're seeing tremendous interest in GenStudio from brands like Henkel, Pepsi, and Verizon and agencies like Publicis, Omnicom, and Havas as they look to accelerate and optimize their content supply chains. Reimagined customer experiences with the all-new Adobe Experience Manager Sites that enable businesses and developers to quickly test and optimize web content, deliver fastest possible page load times, and maximize SEO rankings, lighthouse scores, and conversion. Adobe was recognized as a leader in over 25 industry analyst reports this year, including the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms, B2B marketing automation platforms, and multichannel marketing hubs. In the Forrester Wave for Digital Experience Platforms which was published last week, Adobe received the highest scores for strategy. Key customer wins include Alshaya, Coca-Cola, EY, IBM, Marriott, Riyadh Air, Santander Brasil, Sony, Southern Graphics, Unilever, Vanguard, and Verizon. In our conversations with these and other customers around the world, c-Level executives are continuing to prioritize experience-led growth as a critical business imperative, despite ongoing budget scrutiny. Adobe Experience Cloud is well-positioned to keep winning with innovative products that power end-to-end customer experiences and enable companies to simultaneously drive growth and profitability. We are looking forward to continuing our leadership and momentum into 2024. I'll now pass it to Dan. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and FY '23 results. What a year 2023 was, fueled by a deep understanding of our customers, product innovation, and outstanding execution, we delivered strong financial results and world-class margins, positioning the company for years of continued growth. In FY '23, Adobe achieved record revenue of $19.41 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 13% growth in constant currency. GAAP EPS for the year was $11.82 and non-GAAP EPS was $16.7; each growing 17% year-over-year. FY '23 business and financial highlights included Digital Media revenue of $14.22 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $1.91 billion, Digital Experience revenue of $4.89 billion, cash flows from operations of $7.3 billion, RPO was $17.22 billion exiting the year and repurchasing approximately 11.5 million shares of our stock during the year at a cost of $4.63 billion. In the fourth quarter of FY '23, Adobe achieved revenue of $5.05 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. GAAP-diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $3.23 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a record $4.27, growing 28% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. Q4 business and financial highlights included Digital Media revenue of $3.72 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of $569 million, Digital Experience revenue of $1.27 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.6 billion. Adding approximately $1.5 billion RPO in the quarter, our highest sequential quarterly increase ever and repurchasing approximately 1.8 million shares of our stock. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q4 revenue of $3.72 billion, which represents 13% year-over-year growth, or 14% in constant currency. Our net-new ARR in Q4 was $569 million, which was a quarterly record in constant currency and we exited the quarter with $15.17 billion of Digital Media ARR. We achieved Creative revenue of $3 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency and we added $398 million of net-new Creative ARR in the quarter. Driving this performance was strong customer acquisition throughout the quarter as well as strength during the peak holiday shopping weeks. Fourth quarter Creative growth drivers included individual subscriber growth fueled by targeted campaigns and strong web traffic. A strong quarter for Creative Cloud All Apps subscriptions across customer segments and geographies, with particular strength in emerging markets. Sales of CC single apps, including a strong quarter for Imaging and photography offerings. Continued growth of our Frame.io offering and Adobe Stock which capped off its best year ever in terms of net-new ARR. Customer demand in education driven by back-to-school purchasing as well as migrations to full-priced offerings by graduating students entering the workforce. And typical Q4 strength in the Enterprise, including significant upsell of our new Firefly and Express offerings. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $721 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth or 17% in constant currency. We added a record $171 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Fourth quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included, Acrobat's subscription demand across all customer segments routes-to-market, and geographies. Continued strength of our free-to-paid funnels including Reader on the desktop and Acrobat web. Strong performance of our collaboration services including PDF link sharing and Sign, which are virally bringing new users to the Acrobat ecosystem. An outstanding quarter for Acrobat Mobile as a result of increased proliferation, usage, and conversion and year-end seasonal strength in SMB and enterprise. Turning to our Digital Experience segment, in Q4, we achieved revenue of $1.27 billion, growing 10% year-over-year, or 11% in constant currency. We achieved subscription revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth. Fourth quarter Digital Experience growth drivers included strong year-end bookings across solutions with particular strength in North America, continued success closing multi-solution transformational deals with large enterprises, momentum with AEP and native applications with the FY '23 exiting book of business growing greater than 60% year-over-year, strong net dollar retention for early adopters of AEP, demonstrating the value enterprises are realizing from our real-time data platform and integrated offerings, and strength across our data and insights, content and workfront solutions and growing customer interest and pipeline for our new GenStudio solution. We drove world-class operating margins in Q4 and throughout fiscal 2023 by making disciplined investments in R&D marketing and sales and we're pleased that we grew EPS faster than revenue. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q4 was 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis in line with our expectations. RPO exiting the quarter was $17.22 billion, growing 13% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $7.84 billion and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.6 billion, after making a previously discussed payment in the quarter of $826 million of US Federal taxes that we deferred from the second and third quarters of FY '23. In Q4, we entered into a $1 billion share repurchase agreement and we currently have $2.15 billion remaining of our $15 billion authorization granted in December 2020. As a reminder, we measure ARR on a constant-currency basis during the fiscal year and revalue ARR at year-end. FX rate changes between December of 2022 and this year have resulted in a $160 million increase to Digital Media ARR balance entering FY '24, which is now $15.33 billion and is reflected in our updated investor datasheet. Factoring in the momentum across our businesses and current expectations for the macroeconomic and foreign-exchange environments, for FY '24, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of $21.30 billion to $21.50 billion. Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.9 billion, Digital Media segment revenue of $15.75 billion to $15.85 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $5.275 billion to $5.375 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.80 billion. Tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of $13.45 to $13.85. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $17.60 to $18. As a reminder, and as is customary, these targets do not reflect our planned acquisition of Figma. We expect normal seasonality throughout the year with a seasonal step-down for new business into the first quarter, sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, typical Q3 summer seasonality, and a strong finish to the year in Q4. We expect our cash tax rate to improve sequentially in FY '24 by 2 percentage points as the amortization of previously capitalized R&D increases our deductions next year for tax purposes, benefiting our operating cash flows next year. For Q1 FY '24, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.10 billion to $5.15 billion, Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $410 million, Digital Media segment revenue was $3.77 billion to 3.80 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.27 billion to $1.29 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. Tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.40. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.40. While the implied operating margin for Q1 is up sequentially, we expect a typical seasonal margin step-down starting in Q2 as a result of the annual merit increases and disciplined investments to drive growth. In summary, I couldn't be prouder of the company's performance in FY '23 and the momentum we're carrying into 2024 across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. Our strategy, scale, speed of execution, and profitability position us for years of sustained success. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. In addition to our financial accomplishments, we are proud to once again be recognized for our industry leadership. Content credentials and Adobe's approach to responsible AI were recognized by Fast Company as one of the year's breakthrough innovations. We were again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Glassdoor listed Adobe is one of the best places to work and Interbrand ranked us in the top 20 Best Global Brands as the rising brand for the eighth year in a row. Digital remains a massive tailwind as content demand and consumption continues to grow and businesses of all sizes are focused on transforming their customer experiences. Adobe is incredibly well-positioned to lead and capitalize on this opportunity. Thanks to our innovative roadmap expanding global customer base, strong brand, and the best employees in the world. Our fiscal '24 financial targets reflect our confidence in continuing to drive strong topline growth and world-class profitability. I am more certain than ever that Adobe's best days are ahead of us. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kash Rangan : Hi. Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter and happy holidays. Shantanu and team, I'm wondering, going into 2024, it definitely feels like the economy is in stable footing and in general, the software metrics are all improving as the year unfolded. And very different from going from '22 to '23, yet your DM - new ARR guidance is about the same as how you started last year, but you got the benefit of generative AI, tailwinds from the economy, and got pricing and Firefly. Can you just help us understand if you isolate for those factors, what has gone into your -- into your guidance, but it seems like, if we exclude the optionality that you have, including the tailwinds in economy that guidance looks like it's very conservative. And maybe that's the right thing to do, but just wanted to understand your thought process. Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. Thanks, Kash. I mean, certainly, really thrilled with what a phenomenal year we had across all aspects of the business, whether it was the $5 billion quarter, $5 billion book of business now in DX exiting, and certainly Digital Media ARR performance. Let's -- if you reflect, I mean, you talked about the guidance that we gave at the beginning of '23 and '24, if you recall, we actually had guided to $16.50 first then we opted as you know, to $17.50, and ended with $19.13. And so to your point on the execution front, we have delivered some great innovative products. We've expanded the customer base with new products like Express and Firefly. We're certainly focused on surfaces and making sure all of our flagship products are available across all surfaces. And so we do have multiple growth drivers to your point. And we are focused on monetizing the opportunity. I mean, I would say, we take our guide very seriously, the other way of looking at it, Kash, is it\u2019s our highest annual guide ever in terms of what the guide we've issued, it's the highest Q1 guide ever and we want to go again, execute against this large opportunity and have another record year. So, we're feeling good, the momentum is certainly there in the business. But we take our guidance at this point of the year very seriously. Kash Rangan : Thank you so much and happy holidays. All the best for 2024. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks. Happy holidays. Operator : We will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I think this is in a similar vein to what Kash was trying to get at. But maybe a little bit more focused on Q4 in particular. When we look at the Digital Media net new ARR adds in Q4, it looks like you had a very, very strong Document Cloud, record quarter like you were saying, really strong year-on-year growth in those net adds. Creative Cloud, where we actually saw price increase and we have all the excitement in Firefly, that was actually down on a year-on-year basis. And this is the first time since 2018 we've seen Creative Cloud net new ARR below $400 million. I think that's the surprise for investors -- a negative surprise for investors that we're trying to figure out, was there something dragging the Creative Cloud side of the equation this year, or a tough comp from last year, or something that explains why the price increases in all the positive momentum and innovation out of Adobe MAX isn't translating into net new ARR growth for Creative Cloud in particular. David Wadhwani : Yeah. Happy to take that. Keith, David here. So first of all, as you've mentioned in the DME business, we're really excited about the results for '24, over $1.9 billion in net new ARR obviously well above the guide. We see an expanding base of customers and a lot of momentum coming from gen AI as you noted. As part of this, we delivered -- what we delivered in Q4 was net new ARR -- was a record net new ARR in constant currency. Now specific to your question on Creative Cloud momentum and how to interpret the numbers that you see there, underlying all of this is very strong momentum because we delivered a record Creative Cloud new commercial subscriptions number in the year. So that is really the foundation and the base of customers coming in and really benefiting from not just what we get in this quarter, but also how we build on that going forward. So it really just sets us up well for FY '24. As you look at the numbers for Creative Cloud ARR, net-new ARR in the quarter, you have to look at it relative -- Q4 FY '23 relative to Q4 FY '22 as you mentioned. You need to consider that FY '22 had two pricing actions, that accrued to Creative Cloud that are much lower now in Q4 FY '23. So, if you normalize for the impact of the pricing that rolled off and the pricing that came on, Creative Cloud net new ARR in Q4 grew on a constant currency basis. Shantanu Narayen : And Keith, just to punctuate the two points that David made -- David said, first, it was a record for Creative ARR as it related to subscriptions in Q4 of 2023 and Creative ARR would have grown if you had backed out the pricing. So, the business continues to be extremely healthy to your point. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe looking at next year, as we look at how much of the renewal base in Creative Cloud is potentially up for that type of the pricing uplift. And as we look at Acrobat, specifically the AI functionality that you're releasing into public beta. How should we think about the tailwind to both Creative Cloud from pricing and to Document Cloud, specifically from an AI product monetization perspective for '24 -- for calendar '24? David Wadhwani : Yeah. Happy to take that Alex, a lot packed into that question. So let me try to tease them apart. Let me first start with the question around FY '24 and impact of pricing. Before we jump straight into that I do want to take a bit of a step back and just remind everyone that Digital Media ARR is a mix of a few things, new subscriptions which as I mentioned we had a record number of new subscriptions in Q4, up-sell and cross-sell, which is transitioning people to higher plans from the plan that they're on. And then lastly offer optimization. And as you've noted in the last couple of years, we've really been broadening the number of offers we have all the way down from free price points to the all-apps price points, but even beyond that, we now have capabilities to sell add-ons to all-apps as well. And of course, all of this does include the pricing increases that you had mentioned where we've added more value. I do want to just stress, because I know there's a lot of attention on the pricing impact that we always have seen and continue to believe that the primary growth driver for ARR will be new subscriptions in '24. So, that's why we're so focused on the top-of-funnel and new customer acquisition. But specific to your question on pricing, you need to consider a few things. First, our recently announced pricing changes will impact less than half the Creative Cloud base. So there was a very specific question you asked, hopefully, that gives you the answer, but it also leaves us the opportunity to price in new value in the years ahead as we move forward. Second, the impact will be more visible in net new ARR in the back half of FY '24 as we lap the previous pricing actions that I was talking to Keith about from last year. And as we roll out the pricing over the next few quarters. So the second half of FY '24 we'll see more visibility into the benefits of that to net new ARR. Third, given that we're rolling out these prices across plans and across geos incrementally over the year, the benefit to ARR will actually be spread across FY '24 and FY '25. And fourth, if you really want to have sort of sharpen your pencil, the pricing impact on ARR in '24 is actually lower than the pricing impact was in '23 to Creative Cloud. So hopefully that gives you a sense, but again it comes back to this is why we're so excited about the momentum we're seeing in new subscriptions, which really bodes well for the business this year and in the long term. Hopefully, that gives you a pretty good sense on that. And then really quickly on Document Cloud, we're thrilled with the performance of Document Cloud, a lot of that comes down to our core strategy which has been around integrating the desktop, the web, and mobile into a single ecosystem. And really driving the monthly active usage of Document Cloud up through all of the product-led growth motions we have and converting people on the back-end of that. What we're really excited about as we bring the AI assistant to market, which by the way, as I mentioned, is now in private beta, expect it to come out in the next few months as a public beta and then, GA later in the year. But what we're really excited about there is being able to not just service that paid Acrobat based with that, but also start to bring that to the free reader base. So, lots of opportunity and excitement for the year ahead for Doc Cloud as well. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you for the very fine point and answer. David Wadhwani : No problem. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Hi. Thanks and congrats on the quarter and happy holidays. David, I guess I'll go back to you again, in the commentary, you all talked about enterprise strength and specifically up-selling of Firefly and Express in your enterprise customer base. Can you just give us some more, I guess, qualitative color on what those discussions are like, are they lead -- is this part of the reason you're seeing sort of an uptick in new subscriptions in the enterprise, in particular? And then on Express. Can you just talk again about sort of what you're seeing in terms of leading indicators of that being an enterprise product that can continue to expand into fiscal '24. Thanks. David Wadhwani : Yeah. Maybe I'll start and then Anil can add because does crossover our two businesses. So with Firefly and Express, very excited about the momentum that we continue to see. You heard that we crossed 4.5 billion generations now, so we continue to see really, really strong adoption and usage of it. Partially as a standalone business, but also integrated into our Photoshop and Illustrator and these existing workflows. And we're starting to see a lot of interest, not just in the context of using it as part of those existing products, but also using it as part of the ecosystem within enterprises. So, we've been working with a number of customers to not just enable them with Firefly, which is the predominance of the growth that we're seeing in Q4 for enterprise adoption but also have a number of pilot customers already engaged around custom model extension, so that they can bring their own assets and their own content into what Firefly generates. Second, we're also enabling the ability to expose it through APIs, so they can build it into their existing workflows and third, we of course connecting it in tying it all into Adobe Express, which now also has its own Firefly and additional capabilities like things, so that you can not just sort of create content using Firefly, but then start to assemble it, start to schedule, social posts around it, start to do multi-language translations that -- those are all features that are already in there and then create a stakeholder workflow from people working in Photoshop to the marketers that are trying to post externally. So, that's where things get very interesting and exciting in terms of the connection we have with GenStudio and everything that Anil is doing. Anil Chakravarthy : Just building on that, GenStudio since we announced it at MAX, we've had a tremendous amount of interest both from enterprise customers like Henkel and Pepsi and Verizon, as well as a number of agencies as well. And primarily it goes back to what we discussed at Summit. The demand for content is expected to grow 5x over the next couple of years, and every brand in the world is looking at, hey, how can we speed up the production of quality on brand content, how can we let a number of other people in marketing, other areas of the company create their own content according to the standards -- enterprise standards and the combination of what we have in the Digital Experience portfolio like Adobe Experience Manager and assets as well as what we have in the Creative Cloud, especially around Express and Creative Cloud really let's enterprises, get that kind of agility and the cost-effectiveness of producing content at scale. So that's what we're seeing and we're seeing a tremendous amount of interest for that. Shantanu Narayen : And maybe I'll just add a little bit to that, Kirk. I mean, I think the exciting thing about what people are doing is they're standardizing on Firefly and the fact that we have responsible generations for the entire enterprise. So the interest level has been around, how do we standardize that for all of the image or vector or other generations that they want to do for all the knowledge workers in the enterprise. So really good adoption of Firefly. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead. Karl Keirstead : Thanks. I'd like to ask about a different subject. And that's the creative Express product now that it's being sold into the enterprise. I'm wondering if you could offer some color on the adoption ramp, the competitiveness versus Canva and whether your plans around driving Express revenues versus driving user adoption have changed at all. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Great. Yeah. Happy to take that. Express is off to a great start. As you remember, we went general availability in August with the latest version of it, it's been getting a lot of very, very positive reaction response. And frankly, since then in Q4 too, we've added a ton of new innovation. Firefly integration started with Text to Image and Text to Effects, but we also added Text to Template that will create a fully-formed template for you and generative fill, so you can iteratively change things on the fly. We now let you drawing paint on the campus -- canvas, we've given users much more video support. We've really built an incredible best-of-breed PDF support and workflow with Acrobat in there as well. Some of the other things that now start to bleed into the enterprise also, we have integrated social workflows so that people can schedule their post, we've enabled people to do auto-translations, so you can post to multiple geographies and languages. We've opened up our ecosystem for partner plug-ins and we have now over 50 extensions. And we've added enterprise features like AEM integration and template locking, so that the core, brand police in an organization can manage and make sure that their brand elements that they don't want changing are locked when you disseminate this more broadly. What we've seen is really. I think some very exciting broad-based benefits from this. One is, we've seen new trialists coming in, growing very quickly after this launch, which is exciting to see, we've seen education, users starting to adopt this very quickly as well, the Creative Cloud probe paid base has been coming on and growing very quickly in terms of their usage and then enterprise, as we talked about from a usage perspective and again, Express is a core part of how Anil and team are now selling GenStudio. And the last thing is like this is just setting up the momentum for the year to come. We have a mobile release coming out, which will be very exciting for users to be able to use this on the go. We have thousands of people already using that beta. We announced our Chromebooks partnership. So, anyone that buys a new Chromebook is going to have this. We have partnerships with folks like Wix for their workflows. We're going to be doing deeper integrations into Acrobat. So we are very excited about where this goes. That is a long way to answer a very simple question. We want a lot of people using this. So, our primary focus continues to be around broadening the top of funnel. Of course, as part of that, we are constantly and continually, as I mentioned, journeying people for upsell and cross-sell opportunities to the paid plan, and over to Creative Cloud and other products, but our primary focus continues to be adoption and broad proliferation. Karl Keirstead : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks very much. This is for Dan or maybe Anil. As we think about the momentum within the DX business, it's great to hear things like the 60% increase in your AEP, and native apps book of business, the strong net dollar retention. And you talked about overall strong year-end bookings, but what does it maybe about the pipeline ahead, bookings conversion or perhaps other factors that account for the degree of decel that you're guiding for into next year? Thanks. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, Brad. I mean we are really excited about this massive multi-year opportunity, if we would look at any enterprise customers around the world, everybody recognizes the long-term imperative of transforming their customer experiences. And we're seeing that in these transformational deals that we talked about. And as you mentioned, for example, with AEP, our first $100 million net new business quarter and ending with over $700 million in our annualized book of business. With that said, definitely we're seeing macroeconomic impact, just like other enterprise software companies are. Every customer looks at the total cost of deploying the software and then what it would take to get the payback and ROI. And as a result, there is definitely some scrutiny and caution there. But that said, if we look at going into next year, we do see the pipeline across both our industry verticals as well as our mid-market customers. And we continue to be the leader in the market and we did get that recognition from both analysts and customers. Brad Zelnick : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Dan, if you could just review the broader assumptions in your guide. I think there's still a little concern from the Street in terms of why you're guiding, where you're guiding relative to where the Street was at. And maybe just tying in Shantanu to the guidance, if you could just give us your topline view of -- do you feel like the environment's improving, do you think it's just stabilizing? Just any thoughts in terms of from a high level, what you think is happening as we go into next year? Dan Durn : Yeah. So thanks for the question, Brent. When we take a look at the guide. If we think about where we're at, at this point in time as we're looking forward in FY '24, clearly we see a lot of momentum in the business, the company's engine of innovation has been incredibly strong. And you see the strong financial performance of the company. That's both from a top line standpoint, as well as profitability and cash-flow standpoint. So, clearly a lot of momentum around the business. As I think about where we sit today, we printed a 46.4% operating margin. As we look forward in to next year, we take into account everything we can see. As Shantanu said, we take the guidance seriously and we set expectations in a prudent way, there is an opportunity to do better than the expectations that we set. Clearly, the company is going to be driving towards that. As we think about the engine of innovation, we think the pipeline is strong, we're going to continue to invest in the drivers of growth. This company is going to orient towards growth. When I think about the investment profile, not only are we going to be disciplined. But we're going to continue to invest in those drivers of growth on the DX side. Anil talked about AEP and Apps strong book of business, strong growth, we're laying the groundwork and content supply chain with the GenStudio solution, scaling that motion, and engaging with customers to go from ideation, to creation to activation, delivering new technologies, products, AEM sites incorporating intelligence into those products. On the DME side, you can see it across the portfolio, AI assistant Acrobat, it's in private beta, and it's going to be in public beta in the coming months, you look at Firefly and Express, natively and deeply integrating these technologies throughout the product portfolio, there is going to be continual investment as it relates to that innovation. As you think about the momentum exiting this year and as you think about the guide into Q1, you can see that momentum continuing, get the operating margin up a little bit, and then throughout the year, as we said at our FA Day and the last year's earnings call, you can see a mid-40s expectation around operating margin for the company as we drive this investment cycle, as we drive leadership in our core markets and our key catalyst in the trends that are shaping those markets. So, again, taking a step back, it nets into account the macro that Anil talked about everything we see from a core business standpoint, and the investment profile that we're going to drive to lead, if there's an opportunity to do better than where we set those expectations we're certainly going to do it. Shantanu Narayen : And maybe just to add to that, Brent, since you asked. First, let me clarify, there is nothing as it relates to the economic indicators that we saw anything that would give us cause for concern. So, let me start off by saying that, I think at our Investor Meeting, we told you that we would expect a strong quarter, I think you would acknowledge, we posted some really strong numbers and the momentum continues. And I think as it relates to Creative Cloud, it's going to be driven by new customer acquisition, which is the engine that's driven the business and maybe perhaps the sell-side looked at some of the pricing and put more of that in '24 then in '24 and '25 and that will spread out and perhaps they put a little bit more in what percentage of the base that impacts. So from my perspective, the good news about Creative is it's being driven by massive new adoption into the platform. On Document Cloud, really strong results. I think as Dan said, as we put the AI pack on there as well, that should help fuel more adoption and Digital Experience, I mean, I know that Brad also asked that question. I mean it's great to see the adoption of AEP and Apps. I mean, that is clearly the future of digital experiences, driving $100 million quarter, the $700 million in the annualized book of business, which I think will reflect the next-generation customer experience architecture. So we're feeling positive. And we're going go execute against that Brent. So, nothing that we see on the horizon would tell us either from the economic or competition, that we're not poised to have another great year and profitability as well, I mean, look at the numbers that we posted both in terms of Q4, as well as for fiscal '24 and that is that does not in any way mean that we're not going to invest in all of the cloud and the foundation models. So I feel really good. Dan Durn : And then just one thing to add, Brent, If we were here a year ago, the expectations going into the year where FX was going to be a pretty decent headwind to the performance, you see that in the way we've reported our results and then compare it to a constant-currency basis. We started with a pretty decent spread between the as-reported numbers in constant-currency in Q1. By the time we got to Q4, you saw that spread compress, as I look forward into FY '24, it's more of a neutral footing to maybe a slight headwind. Too early to really call it with precision, but I see that setup being slightly different. And maybe just a slight headwind versus what we were seeing a year ago. Brent Thill : Thanks for the color. Operator : We'll will take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Yeah. Thank you. You noted the strength in RPO in the quarter, including the record sequential increase. Can you talk about how you're thinking about RPO for fiscal '24, would you expect it to continue to be able to outgrow revenue growth by several points as you did in fiscal '23 and perhaps talk about the ingredients that will continue to drive RPO, either by segment or any other considerations that you'd like to talk about in that. Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. Thanks, Jay. As I pull some of the threads together that we've heard on this call. Anil, talked about large transformational deals being the platform of choice with customer experience management, simultaneously driving topline and bottom-line productivity and the investments around driving those are an imperative in the market. We see a similar dynamic with the new technologies that we're bringing to market on the DME side at the business, we're streaming seeing strong pull from the enterprise. And so as I net out that environment and our performance against that opportunity, it goes to produce the type of sequential RPO progression that we saw Q3 to Q4. Every quarter won't be that large, but the backdrop around that dynamic for the company given the setup we see, it should be another strong year for RPO throughout the year. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Operator. We're getting close to the top of the hour. We'll take two more questions and then we'll wrap up. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. David maybe for you, I had a question just on Firefly and the subscription packets. I know that the commercial model for commercial -- I'm sorry, for Firefly credit packets, really just started about six weeks ago. But are there any early observations that you've seen just on customers' willingness to add those packets, or maybe how they're consuming the initial credit allocation that they get with the Creative Cloud subscription? David Wadhwani : Yeah. Happy to take that. First of all I think philosophically, going back to what we said at the investor meeting at MAX, our primary focus here is to drive usage of the generative capabilities and you see that with the 4.5 billion images generated, that strategy is working. Secondly, we price the generative packs -- sorry, we integrated the generative capabilities and credits directly into our paid plans with the Express intent of driving adoption of the paid subscription plans and getting broad proliferation of the ability to use those. And what we are seeing is heavy usage within those paid plans. I think as we've mentioned in the past. I think I mentioned earlier today as well, Generative Fill, for example in Photoshop is the fastest-growing feature that we've put into Photoshop in recent memory. So the usage is great, the utilization is great. I don't personally expect the generative packs to have a large impact in the short-term, other than to drive more usage more customers to our paid existing subscription plans. But what will happen over the course of the year, in the next few years is that we will be integrating more and more generative capabilities into the existing product workflows. And that will drive and we'll be integrating capabilities like video generation, which will cost more than one generation and that will drive a natural inflation in that market and that will become a driver for growth subsequently. But this year is really primarily focused on getting people into the right paid plans of our flagship applications, our Adobe Express, and then drive usage in that sense. And then as that happens, the rest will take care of itself in the years ahead. Saket Kalia : Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll take our final question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Mark Moerdler : Thank you for squeezing me in. I really do appreciate. Dan, I'd like to look a little bit at MAX we discussed how excited you were on Firefly and how it drives Creative Cloud seed and paid seed adoption. Now that you had a bit of time in market, can you explain how you think about how this will drive the paid seed growth, is it how strong it could be and should we expect to seeds going to be lower unit price because they're going to be entry-level, what do you think that we will get offset by these higher-priced Firefly driven sales into the enterprise. Thank you. Dan Durn : Yeah. Thanks, Mark. I think at the core of bringing this technology to life, as a standalone application to drive an ideation part of the process, but value in deeply integrating these capabilities into the flagship applications and the workflows that define the creation process, it gives us a lot of surface area with customers and meeting them where they are in their particular needs and use-case specific needs. And so bringing people efficiently top of funnel, establishing the segmentation across that product portfolio, driving efficiency into the creation process and allowing the velocity to enter the ideation, creation, activation and then instrumentation of that to really refine how companies engage with customers. So, it lays the groundwork for us to touch more customers where they are in the ecosystem, bring them on board in a use-case specific way and then take them on digital journeys which is something the company has very skilled at with our D-DOM to cross-sell and upsell over the life of their engagement with our ecosystem. Anil Chakravarthy : From a product perspective, when you think about it, Mark, for us, the biggest thing that we want to do is, how do we further make our products accessible, fun and affordable for increasing set of customers and I think Firefly is one of those inflection points that will help everybody get over the blank screen fear that they have and so first, as you think about Firefly as an ideation and people just coming and want to have creative inspiration. This is, whether you're an individual user, whether you're agencies, we're seeing a lot of adoption of Firefly to just start the entire Creative process and that sort of brings them as an on-ramp into Express, which would be the other part. Express is certainly the introductory pricing, the ability to get millions more into the fold and the ability, right now, it used to be that Express and other offerings in that is to all worry about, do I have the right templates. Well, AI is going to completely change that, we have our own models and so Firefly will allow anybody to take whatever creative idea that they have and make that available, so I think Firefly really helps with the Express offering. On the Creative Cloud, David mentioned this. I mean if you look at the adoption of that functionality and usage, that's being driven, whether it's in Photoshop right now, Illustrator as we add video, both in terms of providing greater value and we certainly will therefore have the uplift in pricing as well as the retentive ability for Firefly. That's where I think you're going to see a lot of the really interesting aspects of how Firefly will drive both adoption as well as monetization. And then if you go at the other end of the spectrum to the enterprise, GenStudio, every single marketer that I know and CFO and CMO, are all worried about how much am I spending on data, how do I get agility in my campaigns and the fact that Firefly is integrated into both Express as well as when we do the custom models for them, so they can upload their own models and then have the brand consistency that they want. So, Firefly really is the fact that we have our own models. A great catalyst for our business, all across the spectrum and the usage and the adoption shows that in emerging markets, as people there in emerging markets are increasingly used to create variance of content and localization of content, that's where we are also seeing a tremendous usage of these particular technologies. So really exciting. And then, you take the same technology that we have in Creative and think about its impact in both Document Cloud when we do that and the ability to have summaries and have conversational interfaces with PDF, thereby making every single PDF as David again said, both for communication, collaboration and creation far more compelling. I think you're going to see that same kind of uplift in usage and therefore monetization on the Acrobat side. And since it was the last question. I mean, for us, we look at FY '23, and we're really proud what we were able to accomplish across all spectrums topline revenue, RPO and driving book of business, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud and profitability, and we think '24 is going to be exactly more of the same, which is continuing to drive great innovation, great product growth, great profitability. Clearly, I think there has been a set of questions around the Digital Media ARR and what I'll take is on that and we're extremely confident about how that continues to be a growth business and perhaps the pricing impact was overestimated. And as we said, this is again new growth business and it will be a multi-year pricing benefit for us as we think about the uplift that we have. So we're really pleased. We appreciate you being on the call. And like many of you wished us, happy holidays and we hope to see you soon. Thank you for joining us. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, everyone. Happy holidays. This concludes the call. Operator : Once again, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Adobe had a strong first quarter. We achieved $5.18 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 12% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.36, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.48, representing 18% year-over-year growth. Our performance reflects the essential role that Adobe products play in driving the global digital economy. We're delivering on our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses. Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud are more critical than ever to the success of creators, communicators, students, entrepreneurs, and businesses of all sizes with AI serving as an accelerant for all. We are a leader in delivering generative AI across all our clouds. We're taking a highly differentiated approach across data, models and interfaces. Our proprietary data is built on decades of deep domain expertise across creative, documents and customer experience management. We leverage large language models, as well as have invested in building and delivering our proprietary models in the creative document and marketing domains. Our IP-friendly approach is a differentiator for creators and enterprises. In addition, we've innovated by delivering generative AI directly in products with releases in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Express across both desktop and mobile. AI Assistant in Acrobat and Reader unlocks the tremendous value of the trillions of PDFs around the world. We're bringing generative AI to Adobe Experience Cloud and will demonstrate our AI Assistant for Customer Experience Management at Adobe Summit. Every student, communicator, creative professional and marketer is now focused on leveraging generative AI to imagine, ideate, create and deliver content and applications across a plethora of channels. Adobe is uniquely positioned through the combination of Express, Firefly, Creative Cloud, Acrobat and Experience Cloud to deliver on this immense market opportunity. The success we are already seeing with our GenStudio offering in the enterprise is validation of our leadership, and we expect that success to translate into other segments as we roll out these solutions throughout the year. We are driving strong usage, value and demand for our AI solutions across all customer segments. We're successfully monetizing our innovations with particular strength in Q1 in the Enterprise segment across our Digital Media and Digital Experience businesses. This strength is reflected in our strong RPO growth of 16% year-over-year. We're pleased with a strong Q1. We have a phenomenal product roadmap that we're executing against to bring AI innovation across our global customer base and we're just getting started. I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our Digital Media business. David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q1, we achieved a net new Digital Media ARR of $432 million and revenue of $3.82 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. The world's information whether it's an enterprise legal contract, a small business invoice or a personal school form lives in trillions of PDFs. We were thrilled to announce Acrobat AI Assistant, a massive leap forward on our journey to bring intelligence to PDFs. With AI Assistant, we're combining the power of generative AI with our unique understanding of the PDF file format to transform the way people interact with and instantly extract additional value from their most important documents. Enabled by a proprietary attribution engine, AI Assistant is deeply integrated into Reader and Acrobat workflows. It instantly generate summaries and insights from long documents, answers questions through a conversational interface, and provides an on-ramp for generating emails, reports and presentations. AI Assistant is governed by secure data protocols so that customers can use the capabilities with confidence. We are pleased with the initial response to the English language beta and look forward to usage ramping across our customer base as we release other languages later in the year. We will monetize this functionality through a monthly add-on offering to the hundreds of millions of Reader users as well as the Acrobat installed base across individuals, teams and enterprises. In Q1, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $750 million, growing 18% year-over-year. We added $143 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, which was a Q1 record with year-over-year ending ARR growth of 23% in constant currency. Other business highlights include Acrobat Web continues to be an incredible source of customer acquisition with monthly active users up over 70% year-over-year and surpassing 100 million users in Q1. Acrobat extensions for Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome and our Acrobat Mobile offerings continue to accelerate free-to-paid conversion. Increased viral adoption through link sharing and stakeholder collaboration drove over 300% year-over-year growth in the number of PDF files sent. Key enterprise customer wins include Berkshire Hathaway, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Northrop Grumman, Porsche, and the U.S. Navy. On Creative Cloud, creativity is the currency of differentiation in our digital-first world. Every creator and business is focused on building their brand and engaging with their audiences through standout content. Creative Cloud remains the solution of choice for the world's creators, whether their medium is design, photography, video, illustration or 3D. Adobe Express is inspiring millions of users of all skill levels to design more quickly and easily than ever before. In the year since we announced and released Adobe Firefly, our creative generative AI model, we have aggressively integrated this functionality into both our Creative Cloud flagship applications and more recently, Adobe Express, delighting millions of users who have generated over $6.5 billion assets to date. In addition to creating proprietary foundation models, Firefly includes a web-based interface for ideation and rapid prototyping, which has seen tremendous adoption. We also recently introduced Firefly Services, an AI platform which enables every enterprise to embed and extend our technology into their creative, production and marketing workflows. Firefly Services is currently powered by our commercially safe models and includes the ability for enterprises to create their own custom models by providing their proprietary datasets as well as to embed this functionality through APIs into their email, media placement, social and web creation process. Early adopters like IBM are putting Firefly at the center of their content creation processes. IBM used Adobe Firefly to generate 200 campaign assets and over 1,000 marketing variations in moments rather than months. The campaign drove 26X higher engagement than its benchmark and reached more key audiences. In Q1, we achieved $3.07 billion in revenue, which grew 12% year-over-year. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $289 million. Other business highlights include new the launch of the new Adobe Express mobile app beta brings the magic of Adobe Firefly AI models directly into mobile workflows. The first-of-its-kind integration with TikTok's creative assistant makes the creation and optimization of social media content quicker, easier and more effective than ever before. Express Web usage continues to ramp nicely with total exports more than doubling year-over-year and overall Express adoption is expected to accelerate even further, given the positive reception we're seeing from the mobile beta. Generative Fill in Photoshop continues to empower creators to create in new ways and accelerate image editing workflows. Q1 saw the highest adoption of Firefly powered tools in Photoshop since the release of Generative Fill in May 2023 with customers adopting these features across desktop, web and most recently, iPad, which added Generative Fill and Generative Expand in December. The beta release of AI-powered Enhance Speech and new audio workflows drove premiere beta usage to record highs. Adobe video tools were the go-to choice at Sundance Film Festival with over 80% of this year's entrants using Adobe software. The introduction of Behance Pro, a new offering to serve the rapidly growing Behance community empowers members to build their brand and find opportunities, and for businesses to hire talented creators through the Behance platform. The unveiling of new research like the preview of our music generation models and editing tools last month and our video auto dubbing models earlier today have inspired our Creative Cloud and Express customers. The introduction of Firefly Services for enterprises drove notable wins in the quarter, including Accenture, IPG and Starbucks. Other key enterprise wins include AECOM, Capital Group, Dentsu, IBM, Nintendo and RR Donnelley. Given the size of opportunity we see with generative AI, we continue to focus on driving innovation, adoption and usage of our AI solutions. In Q1, we saw strength across both clouds with record new commercial subscriptions in Creative Cloud for Q1, and strong product-led growth in Document Cloud. You can expect to see the product advances and Express with Firefly on mobile. Firefly Services and AI Assistant in Acrobat drive ARR acceleration in the second half of the year. We're excited about our product roadmap. The 6.5 billion assets generated to date include images, vectors, designs and text effects, and we can't wait to share the work we're doing on audio, video and 3D through research sneaks and product announcements in the coming months. I'll now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Experience Cloud business had a great first quarter, achieving $1.29 billion in revenue and was our strongest Q1 on record for new business. Subscription revenue was $1.16 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth. Companies are prioritizing digital investments to improve marketing agility and customer engagement while driving growth and profitability. Adobe's holiday shopping report which analyzes trillions of data points, showed strong online spending during the 2023 holiday season, growing 4.9% year-over-year to $222.1 billion, a new record for e-commerce as well as mobile shopping, which surpassed desktop for the first time and drove 51.1% of online sales. Our Adobe Experience Cloud applications span the entire customer funnel from acquisition to monetization to retention. As the global leader in the Digital Experience Platforms category, Adobe offers businesses a single view of their customers' data across every channel, allowing them to create precise segments and deliver personalized experiences regardless of when and where the customer interacts with their brand. Over the last five years, our organic innovations in Adobe Experience Platform, Realtime CDP, Journey Optimizer, and Customer Journey Analytics have made us the leading platform for customer experience management given the scale of the profiles, campaigns and interactions we process, which now exceed 500 trillion segment evaluations per month. Today, rollout of personalization at scale has been limited by the number of content variations you can create and the number of journeys you can deploy. We believe harnessing generative AI will be the next accelerant with Creative Cloud, Firefly Services and GenStudio, providing a comprehensive solution for the current supply-chain, and generative experienced model automating the creation of personalized journeys. Adobe GenStudio is the generative AI first application that allows marketers to quickly plan, create, store deliver and measure marketing content in a single intuitive offering. With state-of-the-art generative AI powered by Firefly Services, marketers can create on-brand content with unprecedented scale and agility to deliver personalized experiences. Adobe GenStudio natively integrates with multiple Adobe applications across Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud, including Express, Firefly, Workfront, Experience Manager, Customer Journey Analytics, and Journey Optimizer. It can be used by brands and their agency partners to unlock new levels of creativity and efficiency in marketing campaigns. Business highlights include momentum with Adobe Experience Platform and native applications with the combined annualized book of business surpassing $800 million in the quarter. Demand for Adobe Experience Manager, Workfront and GenStudio to address the enterprise content supply chain. Global agencies, including Accenture, Havas, IPG, Omnicom, and Publicis have standardized on Adobe as their technology platform of choice for their own workflows and to optimize creative collaboration with the world's leading brands. Strength in Adobe Journey Optimizer on Adobe Campaign as companies look to deliver more personalized experiences across channels and surfaces. Adobe was recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms for the seventh consecutive year, as well as the Forrester Wave for Digital Experience Platforms. Adobe Experience Manager assets was also named a leader for the fourth consecutive time in the Forrester Wave for Digital Asset Management. Key customer wins include Carl Zeiss, Comcast, Home Depot, NASCAR, Nestle, PayPal, Rogers Communications, Santander Group, Starbucks and Walgreens. Later this month, we are excited to host Adobe Summit, the world's largest digital experience conference in Las Vegas, where we will be joined by thousands of customers, partners, and developers from around the world. We look forward to showcasing a number of product innovations, including a new generative experienced model, advances in Adobe GenStudio, a new AI Assistant in Adobe Experience Platform, new capabilities in RT CDP for first-party data activation and expanded Firefly Services offerings. We will articulate our vision and playbook for brands to achieve a new level of personalization at scale in the era of generative AI. We look forward to sharing our exciting product roadmap and hearing from our customers and how Adobe is helping them transform their business. We were off to a fast start in Q1 and look forward to continuing the momentum and leadership in Q2 and beyond. I will now pass it to Dan. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Today, I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q1 fiscal 2024, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. In Q1, Adobe delivered another quarter of double-digit top line growth with robust margins that result from product leadership, strong execution, and financial discipline. The pace of our product innovation across Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud is leading to customers making large multi-year commitments to Adobe. And you see the result of those customer investments in our RPO performance, which accelerated to 16% year-over-year growth. In the quarter, Adobe achieved record revenue of $5.18 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 12% in constant-currency. Business and financial highlights included GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $1.36 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.48. Digital Media revenue of $3.82 billion, net-new Digital Media ARR of $432 million, Digital Experience revenue of $1.29 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.17 billion, RPO of $17.58 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 3.1 million shares of our stock during the quarter. GAAP EPS came in lower due to the $1 billion payment resulting from the termination of the Figma transaction. Absent the termination payment, our cash flows from operations would have been $1 billion more, and GAAP EPS would have been $2.19 higher. The termination payment impacts both Q1 GAAP EPS and our full-year fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q1 revenue of $3.82 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth, or 13% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $15.76 billion of Digital Media ARR, up 14% year-over-year in constant currency. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $750 million, which represents 18% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. We added $143 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Q1 Document Cloud growth drivers included demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all customer segments and geographies. Continued growth of Acrobat Web demonstrating the success of our flagship products across multiple surfaces, growing monthly active users in our Acrobat Reader Funnel driving free-to-paid conversion. New user acquisition resulting from our Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome partnerships. Strength in our Teams business with up selling our new Acrobat offering which includes integrated signed capabilities, and strong demand from businesses of all sizes, demonstrating the mission criticality of our Document Solutions. We achieved Creative revenue of $3.07 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth, or 12% in constant currency. We added $289 million of net new creative ARR in the quarter with ending ARR growing 12% year-over-year in constant currency. Overall CC pricing actions performed as expected in the quarter. Q1 net new Creative ARR grew more than 20% year-over-year, excluding the impact of pricing actions associated with both Acrobat CC and All Apps in the year-ago quarter and Creative Cloud in Q1 FY '24. Q1 Creative growth drivers included new subscription growth, including strong adoption of Creative Cloud All Apps across geographies and customer segments. Strong single-app customer demand in creative categories such as imaging and photography, and continued growth of stock and Frame.io. We again saw strength in emerging markets, which we continue to believe is a massive growth opportunity and outstanding performance of Creative Cloud in the enterprise including early traction of Firefly services. Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.29 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $1.16 billion, growing 12%year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Q1 was a tremendous start to the year for our Experience Cloud business with growth drivers, including: success closing transformational deals across geographies and verticals with large enterprises that are choosing Adobe to be their end-to-end customer experience management platform, continued momentum with AEP and native applications with the annualized book of business growing more than 60% year-over-year, strong customer adoption of our content, campaign and Workfront solutions, and continued strength with customer retention and expansion across our products. Customer Experience Management remains an enterprise imperative. And as a leader in the category, we see a robust pipeline as we look into Q2 and beyond. Turning to the income statement and balance sheet. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 36% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The Q1 GAAP tax rate came in higher than targeted due to the Figma termination payment. RPO exiting the quarter was a record $17.58 billion, growing 16% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $6.82 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.17 billion. In Q1, we entered into a $2 billion share repurchase agreement, which effectively exhausted our prior $15 billion authority. As a result of our strong trajectory of growth and profitability, we are announcing a new $25 billion share repurchase program, which demonstrates Adobe's continued commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. In light of the momentum across our business and factoring in the macroeconomic environment, for Q2, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.25 billion to $5.30 billion; Digital Media net-new ARR of approximately $440 million; Digital Media segment revenue of $3.87 billion to $3.90 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.165 billion to $1.185 billion; tax rate of approximately 18.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.40, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.40. In summary, fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start. By combining the power of product innovation and executional excellence, Adobe is driving consistent profitable growth. We're delivering on our product roadmap, and we have the right strategy to monetize these innovations into the back half of the year and beyond. Adobe is incredibly well-positioned to capitalize on the secular trends that will shape the next decade. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. We're the leader in three large and growing categories and have delivered groundbreaking innovation across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. We believe that AI augments human ingenuity and expands our addressable market opportunity. I'm proud of the pace and the responsible manner in which we have embraced and delivered generative AI capabilities across our product portfolio. As a result of our strategy and execution, we're confident in our ability to attract new users and deliver value to existing customers to drive growth and profitability. I'd like to thank our 30,000 employees for their continued dedication and unwavering focus on innovation and execution. It is particularly exciting to be named to Glassdoor's Best Places to Work, Fortune's Most Admired Companies, and he JUST 100. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Go ahead. Kirk Materne : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess maybe this is for David or Dan. Obviously, you guys called out that new creative ARR was up more than 20% year-over-year when you exclude the pricing increases which infers a pretty major pricing headwind that we're seeing right now. Can you all just try to parse out how that's going to play out over the year? I know David you mentioned ARR will go up in the back half of the year, but that it\u2019s just tough I think to reconcile what's going on in the business on a normalized basis, and when we might see that sort of translate more into the metrics that everybody follows. Thanks. Dan Durn : Yeah. I'll start and others can go ahead and add on. First of all, we do -- as we look at the book of the business, it is a strong start to the year with Q1 coming in at a high watermark with $432 million across the entire business. As we look specifically at Creative Cloud, I just want to sort of make sure everyone takes a step back and looks at our strategy to accelerate the business because I think the growth drivers here are very clear. We are focused on expanding access to users with things like Express on mobile. We want to introduce new offers across the business with things like AI Assistant and also existing capabilities for Firefly coming into our core Firefly, our core Photoshop and Illustrator and flagship applications. We want to access new budget pools with the introduction of Firefly Services and GenStudio as we talked about. And the early signs, as you point out in Q1 results are really suggesting that those growth drivers are taking hold. As you talked about normalizing for FY '23, FY '24 pricing actions, we grew the CC business about 20% year over year. Other key things to look at is that we set another record for new commercial subscriptions in Q1, and the business growth remains stable at -- if you look back at revenue 12% -- if you look forward at ARR 12%. So the stability and the diversity of the business is strong. And as we enter the back half of the year, we have capabilities for Creative Cloud pricing with Firefly that have already started rolling out late last year, as we talked about, and we'll be incrementally rolling out throughout the year. We're ramping Firefly Services and Express and Enterprise. As we talked about, we saw a very good beginning of that rollout at the -- toward the end of Q1. We also expect to see the second half ramping with Express Mobile and AI Assistant coming through. So we have a lot of the back-end capabilities set up so that we can start monetizing these new features which are still largely in beta starting in Q3 and beyond. And as it relates to pricing, it's what we've talked about in the past. We had two pretty significant pricing actions that benefited FY '23, the first one being the Acrobat price increases that we had put out with the new value that we had introduced with sign capabilities, and also a CC price increase that we introduced in FY '22 that was rolling into FY '23. Both of those are rolling off as we have now introduced the new pricing for CC with Firefly, and overall, the roll-off of the prior pricing is more significant than the new pricing that we've introduced. Kirk Materne : Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thanks. Shantanu, the magnitude of the beat this quarter was -- there was roughly half the absolute beat you've had in past quarters and then the guide obviously, lower for next quarter. I think everyone is asking is this some type of AI headwind? Is this macro? Is this execution? Can you just comment on -- and maybe it's none of these things, but can you just comment on what you think you're seeing in the current quarter? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. Happy to, Brent. And again, I'll reiterate that as it relates to us taking our targets pretty seriously. I mean, when we guided to $1.9 billion for the year, I mean, we had factored in both, as David mentioned, what was likely to happen in the pricing and how that rolls off, as well as the product roadmap, and when AI Assistant and Acrobat would be available, when Express, which is now in beta, would be available. So I think it factored in all of those. I guess if you are looking at it from accomplishment, we look at it and say hey, we did $410 million. I think last year we did $432 million. If we look at the guide and we're on track as it relates to the $1.9 billion, and to hopefully exceed that guide. And so from our perspective, it's playing out. Maybe the other color, Brent, that I would provide is given the desktop products are still in beta, and there we look at value and there we look at utilization. And so I think we gave you some numbers on the $6.5 billion generations that we're seeing, the really positive feedback that we're getting in Acrobat that continue to give us optimism associated with how that is. I think where there's tremendous interest and where if you look at it from an AI monetization, the two places that we're monetizing extremely in line with our expectations. The first is as it relates to the Creative Cloud pricing that we've rolled out. And as you know, the generative packs are included for the most part in how people now buy Creative Cloud, that's rolling out as expected. And the second place, where we are monetizing it is in the entire enterprise as it relates to Content and GenStudio. And I'm really happy about how that's monetizing it. I mean, that's a combination, Brent, of when we go into an enterprise for creation, whether we provide Creative Cloud or a combination of Express, what we are doing with asset management in AEM, workflow, as well as Firefly Services to enable people to do custom models as well as APIs. We're seeing way more monetization earlier, but again, very much in line with expected. So again, I look at the quarter and I feel really good, both about the product delivery as well as the way monetization is turning out. I mean, it's clear, I guess, a little bit from sort of what we've seen that expectations were perhaps a little higher, both in terms of what we would guide for Q2, but I'm really optimistic about what we have done. Brent Thill : Thanks, Shantanu. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. My question is for Dan. You're not raising the full-year guide, and I appreciate it's still early in the year, but I think we're all hoping you can at least affirm it for us. But you also -- you pushed out the enforcement of generative credit limits for some products beyond April that were originally expected sooner. What's the thinking behind this decision? And what are you seeing thus far in terms of credit consumption and purchasing patterns of those credit packs? Thanks. Dan Durn : Yeah. Thanks, Brad. I'll jump in on the first part, then toss it over to David for the second. So we're not updating the targets. What the targets we provided for the full year, they're, as of the December call. What we did share on the call was the material change that we saw in Q1 as a result of the Figma termination payment. We talked about the GAAP EPS impact. It rolls through Q1 and it'll certainly have an effect for the full year. And it's $2.19 as a result of the $1 billion payment. And I think with that, I think you have everything you need relative to where we set our targets, but we're not going to be updating them on this call. David Wadhwani : Yeah. And I'm happy to add a little bit. Yeah, in terms of the timing of the -- when we start enforcing credits, don't read anything into that other than right now, we are still very much in an acquisition mode. We want to bring a lot of users in. We want to get them using the products as much as possible. We want them coming back and using it. One thing I do want to state because I know there's a lot of energy around how do these credits play out over time. In the last few weeks, we've done a couple of sneaks that could also be instructive. Last month, we snuck music composition, where you can take any music track, you can give it a music type like hip hop or orchestral or whatever, and it will transform that initial track into this new type of music. Just this morning, we snuck our ability to do auto dubbing and lip-syncing, where you give it a video of someone talking and saying English, and then you can translate it automatically to French or Spanish or Portuguese or whatever. As you can imagine those actions will not take one credit. Those actions will be much more significant in terms of what they cost. So right now, Alex, the primary point is about proliferation and usage. We're going to be bringing in a lot more new capabilities throughout the tools that will drive more usage, and we're going to be bringing in more expensive capabilities as well. And as we've talked about, you should start to see that ramp through the year, and we feel very comfortable with the adoption we're seeing. Just one last thing to call out, as we mentioned on the call, highest number of users using generative AI in Q1 ever so we're very excited about the trajectory. Shantanu Narayen : And maybe just to add a little bit more of how we're thinking about it as it relates to the monetization of AI. I think we're in early stages as it relates to experimentation. So we're looking at both what the value utilization is as well as experimentation. The value utilization is actually really positive for us. I think, as it relates to the monetization and the experimentation, we have the generative packs, as you know, in Creative Cloud. I think you will see us more and more have that as part of the normal pricing and look at pricing because that's the way in which we want to continue to see people use it. I think in Acrobat, as you've seen, we are not actually using the generative packs. We're going to be using more of an AI Assistant model, which is a monthly model. As it relates to the Enterprise, we have both the ability to do custom models, which depends on how much content that they are creating, as well as an API and metering that we've rolled that out and we've started to sell that as part of our GenStudio solution. So I think it's fair to say, and I certainly monitor what everybody else in the industry is saying. The good news about this is the interface integration that we've done in all our apps and the utilization, and I think the experimentation will enable us to determine how we best attract the largest number of customers that we can who are new to Creative Cloud. We've talked about that as it relates to Firefly attracting new customers. Certainly, I think the number of Q1 commercial subscriptions was another record. So we're absolutely doing everything that we intended to experiment as we roll this out, Brad. So I wanted to accentuate that as well. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much. Very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Turrin : Hey, great. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question David, couldn't help but notice you led off your prepared remarks section with the Document Cloud. Can you speak to the enthusiasm you're seeing on the document side? And when we think about the mix of Digital Media growth for the year, should we expect it will continue to trend towards that Document side? Or is it more the second half where some of the creative enhancements start to layer on more meaningfully we could start to see that shift back a bit? Thanks. David Wadhwani : Yeah. Happy to talk about that. We were very -- and continue to be very happy with the performance of Document Cloud. If you really look at trying to understand sort of how that plays out Document Cloud, the growth is a combination of both our go-to-market efforts and our product innovation. On the go-to-market effort side, think about the fact that Reader continues to be a top-of-funnel for us and we continue to see Reader monthly active user growth. So the potential of people we can convert over to paid subscribers continues to grow. We also talked about the fact that Acrobat Web has been a major contributor to our growth. So we're seeing 70% year-over-year growth in terms of Web MAU, and we crossed 100 million monthly active users for the first time on the website. And of course, we're doing a lot of work with product-led growth to drive the Journey users to some of that value that drives conversion. So that's all we're doing on the go-to-market side. On the side of product innovation, our strategy over the last couple of years has been to make PDF the starting point of a workflow, right? And so that's why we integrated Sign directly into that so that people could use their PDFs and start a transaction for their business. And that continues to grow very nicely, and it's a great selling point for an integrated service. We also introduced link sharing a few years ago for commenting and reviewing with groups and teams. We saw that link sharing grow 300% year-over-year so that's a huge point of value, but it's also a huge point of viral growth. That's also what when someone receives that, it's another opportunity for us to bring them into the value of the broader offering. And you can expect to see that with AI Assistant as well. So obviously, everyone is looking at AI Assistant in Acrobat. I certainly hope all of you are using it, should make your lives more effective. Not just for insight. We think that there's a lot of opportunity for monetization of insight for AI Assistant on our core base of Acrobat users, but also for the first time doing consumption-based value. So the hundreds of millions of monthly active users of Reader will also be able to get access to AI Assistant and purchase an add-on pack there too. So it's a really broad base to look at how we monetize that, but it's also the start of the ability to take your conversation and generate emails and presentations and continue that process. So the combination of all of that is a really potent combination of go-to-market efforts and product innovation. So we continue to be bullish about this. So the second part of your question, we are -- as we've said multiple times on the call, we are very excited about all the innovation that's coming out that's just starting to ramp in terms of monetization and/or still in beta on the Creative Cloud side. We expect that to come out in Q3 and we'll start our monetization there. So we continue to feel very confident about the second half acceleration of Creative Cloud. Michael Turrin : I appreciate all the details there. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here. Maybe for both David and Shantanu. Clearly, a lot of news around video creation using generative AI during the quarter, of course, with the announcement of Sora. Maybe the question for you folks is, can we just talk a little bit about how you think about the market impact that generative AI can have in the video editing market and how maybe Firefly can participate in that trend? Shantanu Narayen : Sure. Saket. I mean, I'll start and then David can add. I mean, firstly, I think the advances, whether it's in OpenAI or our own models that certainly, David and I have the pleasure of looking at on a weekly basis, the advances are amazing because you have to -- when you're thinking about video solve some other fundamental problems like physics, right, I mean, if you have somebody walking on a street, how do you make sure that they don't go through a building or go through the floor? And so I think some of those video advancements that we have seen within Adobe have really addressed some of those hard problems. A big picture, though, video I think will be even more of an accelerant for editing applications. I think this notion that the next Oppenheimer will be done using a text-to-video prompt is just -- it's not going to happen for decades. And so I think actually more so in video, there's going to be an accelerant for people saying how do I get an on-ramp as it relates to using text to video and then edit that using our applications. And so I think I'm really particularly excited about what we can do with premiere as well as with After Effects as it relates to video. So net-net, I would say, Saket, the technology is impressive. We have our models, we have integrated into our interfaces. We're also partnering. I had a really great conversation with Jensen recently about what we can do as they are investing in video. Certainly, he would love to partner with us, and we're looking together to see how we can push the envelope on video as well using their models, whether it's Edify or Nemo. And so I think really early days, we're seeing a whole bunch. I hope -- and David mentioned this look at some of the lip sync stuff that we've done as well, which allows you to auto-dub and translate into languages. So we intentionally released a little bit of that demo. So really great advances. But net-net video is going to be even more of a need for editing applications in order to truly take advantage of generative AI. David Wadhwani : Yeah. And maybe I'll just add a few things. First of all, as Shantanu mentioned, the research in the industry and certainly with Sora is very impressive and exciting. It's also very consistent with the models that we're developing. So we think that there is -- there will be, as there was with video -- sorry, imaging, there will be multiple models that come out, including the Adobe model later this year, and we should start to see a lot of innovation there like we've seen in imaging. We've already started to sneak a couple of things that Shantanu talked about. So you will see text-to-video capabilities from us later this year. But you'll also see it with transparency around the training data that we have, you'll see it with more tool ability and controllability. You'll see it integrated into our tools as well. Now, all of that said, I do want to be very clear with what Shantanu said, which is that we see the proliferation of video models to be a very good thing for Adobe. And we're going to work with OpenAI around Sora. You're going to see us obviously, developing our own model. You're going to see others developing model. All of that creates a tailwind because the more people generate video clips, the more they need to edit that content, right? So whether its Premiere or After Effects, or Express, they have to assemble those clips, they have to color-correct those clips, they have to tone match, they have to enable transitions. So we're excited about what we're building, but we're just as excited about the partnerships that we see with OpenAI and others coming down this path. And if you take a step back, you should expect to see more from us in the weeks ahead with imaging and vector and design, text effects, and in the months ahead with audio and video and 3D. We're very excited about what all of this means, not just for the models, but also for our APIs and our tools. Saket Kalia : Super helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And I just -- mine is going to be more of a clarifying question because it's clear that from a number of comments, whether it's outperforming Digital Media ARR in the quarter to accelerating Creative ARR in the second half to maybe doing better than $1.9 billion in the full year for Digital Media ARR. My question is very simple. Can you reiterate -- not update, but reiterate the guide that you gave in December for Digital Media ARR in net news specifically for this year, and maybe puts and takes around how we should think about to the question earlier, the second half versus first half tailwind, headwind around pricing? Shantanu Narayen : Yeah. So we take our guide seriously. Q1 played out as expected. It was ahead of where we were last year. Our Q2 guide is ahead of where the guide was in Q2. We're talking about acceleration into the back half of the year. If I didn't feel like our full-year guide was achievable, we would have a different conversation. We're confident in the targets that we put out there, our ability to meet them. If there's an opportunity to do better, we certainly will. So we feel good about where we sit in the first half. And as we look forward into the second half, the momentum we see from an innovation standpoint integrating into our products, what we see going from beta to GA, we feel good about the momentum into the second half. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Go ahead. Karl Keirstead : Thank you. Dan, maybe I'll continue with this subject that Alex was getting at. So I think what's tough about modeling ARR of late is it's very difficult to see the impact of the price actions. It feels like a black box to us. So I'm wondering if you could help us get aligned for the second half, and offer some qualitative color on the extent to which the prior period price actions roll off. Is that more of a 3Q or 4Q phenomenon? Is there any way you could help size that impact, just to feel good about David's earlier comment about that roll-off being a big part of the second-half ARR acceleration? Thank you. Dan Durn : Yeah. So there was two pricing actions that we had taken in 2022. In May of 2022, we pushed forward a pricing action, and then October of 2022, we pushed forward the Doc Cloud line optimization, where we integrated Sign. The one-year anniversary of those pricing actions from May of 2022 and October of 2023, or -- I'm sorry, October of 2022 will be behind us on the one year anniversary. So you will still see some Q3 impact from pricing actions in the year-ago period. Q4 will be a clean look for the company, at least two months in Q4 will be a clean look. The actions that we're taking right now from both a pricing and a product standpoint on the Creative side will be more apparent in the back half of the year into the end of the year. Karl Keirstead : Okay. That's helpful. David Wadhwani : I think the other way I would look at it, honestly -- sorry, go ahead. Dan Durn : Go ahead, David. David Wadhwani : Well, the way I would look at it, in terms of the rhythm of the numbers and how you've seen sort of what transpired in 2023, and how we look at 2024, and the path to $1.9 billion and beyond, the way I would look at it is we're ahead in Q1. We're ahead in Q1. We're giving you all the reasons why we think there's more product coming and more monetization coming in the rest of the year. And that's what gives us the confidence associated with the targets. I guess there's this question of every quarter, do we reiterate targets? Do we update targets? What does that mean? And the way we've always thought of it is, if it was a way -- if we didn't have confidence, we would give you that. We have confidence associated with the numbers, but we're not in the business of every quarter, looking at every number. And let's go down one other number, which was the GAAP EPS. Certainly, there's an impact, as you know, in the GAAP EPS associated with what we did as it related to the Figma sort of transaction, and therefore the impact to GAAP EPS in Q1. So I think, from my perspective, the quarter and the year is playing out just as we did, and I feel more confident now than I did when we gave you our annual targets. I'll leave it at that. Karl Keirstead : Yeah. We got it. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. And with respect to Firefly, it's obvious that you are significantly ramping up your investments there, at least judging by the number of relevant open positions you're looking to fill for Firefly development, many of which are seemingly fairly senior. Could you comment on your pipeline of being able to bring in the requisite amount of developmental capacity to support everything you're doing with Firefly and everything else that David in particular talked about? And relatedly, on go-to-market in the last few months, you've been opening up the aperture for sales positions globally. Could you comment on what the thinking is behind that? And again, whether the population is there for you to bring in to meet your sales headcount needs? Thank you. David Wadhwani : Yeah. Let me take the first one and then Anil can answer the question on sales. As it relates to the momentum we're seeing with Firefly, I think there are multiple layers of it. One is obviously, we're seeing the quality of the models. We're seeing a differentiated approach as it relates to the training data, as it approaches contribution of assets from our community and how we compensate those folks. And so that's not just an Adobe perspective, but it's playing out obviously, in enterprises as they look at what are the models that they can consider using for production workflows. We're the only one with the full suite of capabilities that they can do. It's a really unique position to be in, but it's also being noticed by the research community, right? And as the community starts looking at places as if I'm a PhD that wants to go work in a particular environment, I start to ask myself a question of which environment do I want to pick. And a lot of people want to do AI in a responsible way. And that has been a very, very good opportunity for us to bring in amazing talent. So we are investing. We do believe that we have the best -- one of the best, if not the best, research labs around imaging, around video, or around audio, around 3D, and we're going to continue to attract that talent very quickly. We've already talked about we have the broadest set of creative models for imaging, for vector, for design, for audio, for 3D, for video, for fonts and text effects. And so this gives us a broad surface area to bring people in. And that momentum that starts with people coming in has been great. The second part of this too is managing access to GPUs while maintaining our margins. We've been able to sort of manage our cost structure in a way that brings in this talent and gives them the necessary GPUs to do their best work. Anil Chakravarthy : And regarding the sales positions in Enterprises. In Enterprise, we're in a strong position because what we -- I mean, this area of customer experience management, it remains a clear imperative for Enterprise customers. Everybody is investing in this personalization at scale, and current supply chain. These help drive both growth and profitability. So when you look at these areas, these from an enterprise perspective, these are a must-have. This is not a need to have. And that's helping us really attract the right kind of talent. We just onboarded this week a VP of Sales who have prior experience and a lot of experience in Cisco and Salesforce, etc. So that's an example of we're really bringing on some excellent enterprise sales talent. David Wadhwani : And I don't know if Jay, you were asking for -- building your model, or if you were looking for a job? But if you're interested in any of these positions, let us know more. Jay Vleeschhouwer : More the former. David Wadhwani : Okay. Jonathan Vaas : Hey, operator, we're coming up on the hour. Let's try to squeeze in two more questions. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Hey, thank you very much. Looks like there is more trust in AI and Excel models than what you're actually saying qualitatively on this call. I just wanted to give you an opportunity to debunk this hypothesis that is going around, that AI, it is generating videos and pictures, but the next step is it's going to do the actual editing and put out Premiere Pro use or whatnot. So that is probably the existential threat that people are debating. So why don't you see if we could take a shot at why that scenario is very unlikely that right now it's about generation of images and then your tools pick up where the generation stops and you do the processing, right? So help us understand why this can coexist with AI. That's a philosophical question. And Dan, one for you. Besides the net new ARR that you've already reported on Creative and DM, what are the other indicators such as new business bookings that you don't quantify necessarily that you qualitatively saw in Q1 that makes you feel good about the year? Thank you so much. David Wadhwani : Great. So maybe I'll take your first part, and Dan obviously, can take the second. So as it relates to generated content, I'm going to sort of break it up into two parts. One is around the tooling and how you create the content, and the second is around automation associated with the content. I think if you take a step back before we even get into either one of those, there is no question that there's a huge appetite because of personalization at scale, the need to engage users, the need to build your personal brand online. That content is going to explode in terms of the amount of content being created, and it's going to explode because of one of two things. The first is around the ability to create audio clips, video clips, images, vectors. These are things that get users started. It's a great for ideation. You'll see in a few weeks that some of the incredible work the team has been doing around ideation on Firefly.com. And once those things are created, they do flow into our tools for the production, work and process. We're clearly seeing a huge benefit from that because the more content that gets created, the more editing that's required, and that's what's driving more commercial CC subscribers this quarter than any other Q1 before. So that's the foundation of it. The second part of this, though, from an editing perspective is the controllability of -- and the editability of not just pixels and vectors and timelines, but also the editability of the latent space itself. The latent space being the core capability -- core model capabilities that actually generate the output. We have a lot of research that we've already started releasing, the first of which was Style Match, and you'll start to see more and more of that actually coming out at summit and beyond. But we are, in my mind, very, very clearly the leader in terms of creating models that can also be tooled on top of. So that combination of the models getting better and the controllability of those models, we're in a remarkable position for that. So we benefit from that. The second part, Kash, is around automation. So as people are generating more content, you clearly need to be able to automate that content and how it's created. And that's really where Firefly Services come in. First, it's built on the strength of our Firefly models, say for commercial use integrated into our tools, but it also adds the ability to have custom models so control what kinds of information or brand and content it's trained on for both brand styles and product replica, and it's also part of an ecosystem of API services, not just generate something which is a core part of it like text to image, or Generative Fill or Generative Expand, but also process. So once you generate some images through APIs and automation, you want to be able to remove the background, you want to be able to blur the depth, you want to auto tone, you want to apply actions to that image. And then the last is you want to be able to assemble that for delivery. Firefly services don't just generate something, but they let you have that entire ecosystem, and then you can embed that using low code, no code environments into your flows, and we are already embedding it into GenStudio and all of the capabilities that we're shipping. So I think the core part of this is that as more of this content creates, you need more tool ability. The best models are going to be the models that are safe to use and have control built in from the ground up. And I think we have the best controls of anyone in the industry, and they need to be able to be done in an automated fashion that can embed into your workflow. So I think all three of those vectors point to benefits for Adobe. Kash Rangan : That's very convincing. Dan Durn : And then as we think about the forward-looking, a couple of points I would turn to, just think about cash flow in Q1. Strength of our cash flow, once you normalize for the $1 billion termination payment, that's up 28% year-over-year. When you think about RPO, 3 point acceleration sequentially, and when I break that up on deferred revenue, unbilled backlog, you saw that acceleration in each of those subcomponents, which as you look through that acceleration, the near-term underscores the strength of the business and it underscores the longer term strength we have around the momentum of the business. When I think about individual product commentary, we talked about it a lot on this call. You see record commercial subscriptions in the Creative business. In Q1, you see engagement going up on the products. Usage of Firefly capabilities in Photoshop was at an all-time high. In Q1, Express exports more than doubling with the introduction of Express Mobile in beta now going to GA in the coming months, AI Assistant Acrobat, same fact pattern. You can see that momentum as we look into the back half of the year. And from an enterprise standpoint, the performance in the business was really, really superb in Q1, strongest Q1 ever in the enterprise. So there's a lot of fundamental components that we're seeing around performance of the business that give us confidence as we look into the back half of the year. Kash Rangan : Super. Thank you so much, Dan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys, and I appreciate you squeezing me in. I'm going to take one last crack at this. Shantanu and team, we definitely, hear your confidence in the business, but obviously, the stock market reactions reflecting investors are worried about something. And the two things that worry investors more so than anything is uncertainty number one, and number two is back half ramps, right? And so I think what investors would really love to hear is Dan Durn actually say we still expect to do $1.9 billion in net new Digital Media ARR, and get some certainty there, and then also have a little bit more certainty or a little bit more explanation of what are the building blocks to that second half ramp? Which products are expected to go GA? Are we including stuff like document intelligent -- intelligence? Is there new monetization avenues that we're putting into the back half? Or is there just some mechanism within sort of the Creative Cloud pricing that's going to turn on in the back half of the year? Any further specifications in there, I think would help sort of close the gap between your confidence and sort of the lack of confidence exhibited by the after-hour reaction. Shantanu Narayen : And let me tackle that, Keith, and maybe I'll just tackle it by taking a couple of the other questions as well, summarizing that and ending with your question associated with the financial results. I think the first question that I hear across many folks is, hey, with the advent of AI and the increase in the number of models that people are seeing, whether they be image models or video models, does that mean that the number of seats, both for Adobe and in the world, do they increase or do they decrease? To me, there's no question in my mind that when you talk about the models and interfaces that people will use to do creative content, that the number of interfaces will increase. So Adobe has to go leverage that massive opportunity. But big-picture models will only cause more opportunity for interfaces, and I think we're uniquely qualified to engage in that. So that's the first one. The second one, I would say, is that does Adobe innovate, and when we do that, do we only leverage the Adobe model, or is there a way in which we can leverage every other model that exists out there? Much like we did with plugins, with all of our Creative applications, any other model that's out there, we will certainly provide ways to integrate that into our application. So anybody who is using our application benefits not just from our model creation, but from any other model creation that's out there. The way we first started to execute against that is in the enterprise because for us, the enterprise and the ability to create custom models so people can tweak their models to be able to do things within Photoshop that are specific to a retailer or a financial service was where we focus. But long term, certainly, as I've said with our partnerships, we will have the ability for Adobe in our interfaces to leverage any other model that's out there, which again, further expands our opportunity. I think as we play out the year, when we gave our targets for the $1.9 billion in ARR and the $410 million in Digital Media ARR for Q1, it factored in both our product roadmap and how things would evolve in the year. All of the product roadmaps we knew whether it was Acrobat, whether it was Express, whether it was Firefly, whether it was Creative Cloud, or whether it's GenStudio that brings all of these together, we knew the product roadmap, which we're executing against. In the first half of the year, a lot of that was beta, and in the second half of the year, a lot of that's monetization. It's playing out as expected. If anything, I would say the excitement around that, and in particular, the enterprise is faster than expected. And so I think our ability to monetize it just -- not just through new seats but also through these new Firefly services is expanded as it relates to what we are doing. And then as it relates to your question around financial results and the go-forward execution, we gave a Q1 target, we beat the Q1 target. And that gives us confidence that the financial target that we gave at the beginning of the year, we're ahead of that. And that's how I'll play it out. You're right. You have to model it. You can look at last year's model and look at last year's model and say, hey, they got to $1.913 billion. If they're ahead, does that fundamentally change Adobe's thesis on why we get to $1.9 billion and beyond, and in my mind it doesn't. And so that's the way I would answer that question. We have to go execute against the opportunity that we have. I look forward to those who are at Summit. I'm sure we'll have a little bit more conversation. But Q1 was a strong start. It was a strong start against product execution. It was a strong start against the financial metrics that we outline, and we're going to go do it again, Keith. So that's how I'd answer your question. So thank you all for joining. Keith Weiss : Excellent. That's super helpful. Shantanu Narayen : And with that, I'll hand it back to Jonathan. Jonathan Vaas : All right. Thanks, everybody. I look forward to speaking with many of you soon. And this concludes the call. We look forward to seeing you at Summit.",

Given this rich product roadmap, focus on execution and customer demand in the first half of the year, we are pleased to raise our annual Digital Media net new ARR, Digital Experience subscription revenue and EPS targets. I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our Digital Media business. David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu. Hello everyone. In Q2, we achieved net new Digital Media ARR of $487 million and revenue of $3.91 billion, which grew 12% year-over-year. On the Document Cloud side, PDF has become a global standard for automating business and consumer workflows, and Acrobat is the platform of choice to view, edit, share and collaborate with these documents. We continue to see steady growth in monthly active users of our Document Cloud solutions, including Acrobat Reader, Acrobat Standard and Pro, and our signature, share and review workflows across mobile, web and desktop. The introduction of Acrobat AI Assistant, made generally available in April for English documents, marks the beginning of a new era of innovation and efficiency for the approximately 3 trillion PDFs in the world. Acrobat AI Assistant is empowering everyone to shift from reading documents to having conversations with them in order to summarize documents, extract insights, compose presentations and share learnings. AI Assistant is available as a standalone offer for use in Reader and as an add-on to Acrobat Standard and Pro. We're seeing early success driving adoption of AI Assistant as part of our commerce flows and remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities. In Q2, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $782 million, growing 19% year-over-year. We added $165 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, which was a Q2 record, with year-over-year ending ARR growth of 24% in constant currency. Other business highlights include, general availability of Acrobat AI Assistant support for document types beyond PDF, meeting transcripts and enterprise requirements; Acrobat link sharing for PDF-based collaboration continues to grow rapidly, more than doubling year-over-year and driving viral new user adoption; free monthly active users of Acrobat Web grew over 60% year-over-year, as a result of link sharing and our Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome extensions; continued strength with free-to-paid digital conversion, as a result of product led growth optimizations; strong growth in the SMB segment for our Teams offering, driven by a combination of seat expansion and new account wins; Key enterprise customer wins with AstraZeneca, Chevron, State Government of Florida, State of Illinois, United Healthcare Services and Wells Fargo. Turning to Creative Cloud, creative professionals are leading the global charge to meet the everincreasing demand for engaging content across a variety of platforms and channels. Enterprises rely on creative professionals to produce differentiated content to drive increasingly personalized marketing campaigns. Solopreneurs and small businesses need to stand out in a crowded digital landscape with engaging videos and designs. Educators are passionate about providing students with the visual communication skills needed to thrive in the decades ahead. Consumers are increasingly looking for ways to share their stories digitally. Creative Cloud, Express and Firefly Services are uniquely positioned to catalyze this opportunity for everyone, by leveraging the promise of generative AI. Our Creative Cloud flagship applications continue to release new features that are significantly improving user onboarding while simultaneously delivering an unprecedented level of power and precision. Generative Fill and Generative Expand are already two of the top three features used by customers on the latest version of Photoshop. Text to vector support is off to a great start in Illustrator. Remove Object is the fastest growing feature in Lightroom mobile. Our preview of generative AI capabilities in Premiere won Production Hub Award of Excellence at NAB, the largest video show in North America. We are integrating our leading applications with Firefly and third-party generative AI models to deliver the richest, most engaging content. Our vision for Adobe Express is to provide a breakthrough application to make design easy for communicators worldwide, leveraging generative AI and decades of Adobe technology across web and mobile. Our launch of the all-new Express application on iOS and Android earlier this quarter is off to a strong start, with monthly active users doubling quarter over quarter. This week's Design Made Easy event, which focused on Express for Business, was another big step forward for us. Companies of all sizes are excited about the integrated power and commercial safety of Firefly, the seamless workflows with Photoshop, Illustrator and Adobe Experience Cloud and enterprise-grade brand controls that are now part of Express for Business, making it the optimal product for marketing, sales and HR teams to quickly and easily create visual content to share.

We're excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the Digital Media business and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services and Express. We're pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half. I'll now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. In Q2, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $1.33 billion. Subscription revenue was $1.2 billion, representing 13% year-over-year growth. We are the industry leader in helping enterprises deliver personalized experiences at scale to their customers by combining the right content, customer data and journeys in real time. When we introduced Adobe Experience Platform five years ago, it was a revolutionary approach to address customer data and journeys. Today, we're the number one digital experience platform, and AEP with native apps is well on its way to becoming a billion-dollar business. We're now transforming the content supply chain for enterprises with Adobe GenStudio, enabling them to produce content at scale, leveraging generative AI through native integrations with Firefly services and Adobe Express for Business. Enterprise customers, both B2C and B2B, view customer experience management and personalization at scale as key areas of differentiation, making it a priority investment for Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Information Officers and Chief Digital Officers. We are excited by the customer interest and adoption of our latest innovations, including AEP AI Assistant, a generative AI-powered conversational interface that empowers practitioners to automate tasks, simulate outcomes, and generate new audiences and journeys. For example, customers like General Motors and Hanes brands have been working with AEP AI Assistant to boost productivity and accelerate time to value, while democratizing access to AEP and apps across their organizations. Marriott International is a great example of a customer that's expanded its decade-long relationship with Adobe and turned to Adobe Experience Cloud to orchestrate highly personalized guest experiences across online reservations and the Marriott Bonvoy mobile app. Adobe Real-time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer enabled Marriott to connect data from disparate sources and activate relevant experiences in moments that matter, helping the company match individuals with the best options across its portfolio of more than 30 brands and nearly 9,000 properties. Other business highlights include : continued momentum with AEP and native applications, growing subscription revenue 60% year-over-year in Q2; AEP innovations announced at Summit include Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B addition, a new application for B2B customers built on AEP to orchestrate account-specific buying group journeys; federated audience composition, which enables enterprises to minimize data copy and generate audiences directly from their enterprise data warehouses; and real-time CDP collaboration, a new clean room application for brands and publishers to collaborate in a privacy safe way to discover, reach, and measure their high-value audiences in a world without third-party cookies. GenStudio innovations to address enterprise content supply chain needs across workflow and planning, creation and production, asset management, delivery and activation, and reporting and insights. Recent advancements include contextual search in Adobe Experience Manager assets, which enables users to find the right asset and variation in their growing digital libraries. Adobe Workfront Planning, which provides every user with a unified view of all activities across the marketing life cycle through highly visual marketing campaign calendars and dynamic briefs. And AEM Generate Variations, which accelerates the creation of audience-specific content variations to drive personalized web experiences. Strong industry analyst recognition including Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Content Marketing Platforms and leadership for both IDC's B2C and B2B MarketScapes for digital commerce applications. Key customer wins include Amazon, British Telecom, Comcast, Mercedes-Benz, Maruti Suzuki, Nationwide Building Society, Novo Nordisk, ServiceNow, Stellantis, Ulta Beauty, and U.S. Department of the Treasury. We have enabled our vibrant partner ecosystem of system integrators and agencies to deliver advisory and implementation services across our product portfolio. We look forward to engaging with customers and major agencies at the Cannes Lions Festival later this month. Our category-leading solutions, robust pipeline, and tremendous scale position us to drive strong growth in the second half, and we are raising our subscription revenue target for the year. I will now pass it to Dan. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Today, I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q2 fiscal 2024, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. In Q2, Adobe delivered strong top line growth and industry-leading profitability while accelerating the pace of innovations we're delivering to market across Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud. In the quarter, Adobe achieved record revenue of $5.31 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 11% in constant currency, with strength across all three clouds. This performance stems from the diversification of Adobe's business across our market-leading products, business models, customer segments, and geographies. When combined with our talented employees, strong execution and world-class financial discipline, you have the ingredients that make this company incredibly resilient. Second quarter business and financial highlights included : GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.49 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.48; Digital Media revenue of $3.91 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $487 million; Digital Experience revenue of $1.33 billion; cash flows from operations of $1.94 billion; and RPO of $17.86 billion exiting the quarter. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved Q2 revenue of $3.91 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 12% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $16.25 billion of Digital Media ARR, up 13% year-over-year in constant currency. Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $782 million, which represents 19% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. We added $165 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, which was a record for Q2. Q2 Document Cloud growth drivers included : demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all customer segments and geographies; new user acquisition resulting from increasing Reader MAU; a great start monetizing AI Assistant through our digital channel; strong usage and engagement from Acrobat Web as well as through our Chrome and Edge partnerships, which are driving free-to-paid conversion; growing team subscription units sold to SMBs, both through adobe.com and our research channel; and strength in our enterprise solutions, demonstrating the importance of PDF as a source of unstructured data in business workflows. We achieved Creative revenue of $3.13 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 11% in constant currency. We added $322 million of net new Creative ARR in the quarter. Q2 Creative growth drivers included : new subscriptions for Creative Cloud All Apps with particular strength in digital acquisition on adobe.com, with multiple product releases during the quarter driving customer engagement and demand; strong growth of single apps, including in imaging, photography, design, and stock; accelerating customer interest and usage for our new Express Mobile and Express for Business offerings; strong renewals as customers migrate to higher-value, higher ARPU Creative Cloud plans that include Firefly entitlements; continued subscription unit growth, with particular strength in emerging markets; and strength from SMBs adopting our team offering as well as in the enterprise segment with ETLA adoption. We're pleased with the performance of the Creative business in the first half of the year, fueled by strong commercial subscriptions in both Q1 and Q2. As we look at the momentum we're carrying into the back half, we expect to deliver year-over-year growth of Creative net new ARR in Q3 and Q4 and are raising our Digital Media net new ARR target for the fiscal year. Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q2, we achieved revenue of $1.33 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $1.20 billion, growing 13% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Q2 Digital Experience growth drivers included : subscription revenue strength from transformational accounts; market leadership with AEP and native applications, with subscription revenue growing 60% year-over-year; additional subscription revenue strength across the data insights and audiences and customer journey categories; and accelerated adoption of our AEM and Workfront solutions from businesses looking to solve their content supply chain challenges. Turning to the income statement and balance sheet. In Q2, Adobe delivered year-over-year EPS growth of 24% on a GAAP basis and 15% on a non-GAAP basis. This was driven by revenue growth and disciplined prioritization of our investments, which resulted in non-GAAP operating margin strength in Q2. The company continues to deliver world-class gross margins while investing in groundbreaking AI capabilities. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q2 was 18.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, in line with our expectations for the quarter. RPO exiting the quarter was $17.86 billion, growing 17% year-over-year as reported or 18% when factoring in a 1-point currency headwind. Current RPO grew 12% exiting the quarter. Our ending cash and short-term investment position at the end of Q2 was $8.07 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.94 billion. In Q2, we entered into a $2.5 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $22.7 billion remaining of the $25 billion authorization granted in March 2024. We will now provide Q3 targets as well as updated fiscal 2024 annual targets, factoring in current macroeconomic conditions as well as strong momentum across our business, our current FX outlook into the back half of the year with the U.S. dollar remaining stronger as compared to our original expectations when we set our FY 2024 targets in December, and an expected strong seasonal finish to the year in Q4. For Q3, we' re targeting : total Adobe revenue of $5.33 billion to $5.38 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $460 million; Digital Media segment revenue of $3.95 billion to $3.98 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.325 billion to $1.345 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.20 billion to $1.22 billion; tax rate of approximately 18% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $3.45 to $3.50; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.55. For fiscal 2024, given our first half performance, we are now targeting : total Adobe revenue of $21.40 billion to $21.50 billion; Digital Media net new ARR of approximately $1.95 billion; Digital Media segment revenue of $15.80 billion to $15.85 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $5.325 billion to $5.375 billion; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $4.775 billion to $4.825 billion; tax rate of approximately 20.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of $11.80 to $12; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $18 to $18.20. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the company's performance in the first half of the year and the momentum we see in our business. Adobe's product leadership, velocity of innovation, diversity of our business, and financial discipline make us unique, enabling us to deliver strong top and bottom line results through dynamic market conditions. I'm confident in our ability to catalyze transformative long-term trends that will position us to win over the next decade. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. Adobe remains one of the greatest places to work in the industry, and I want to thank our employees for their relentless dedication to supporting our customers and communities. We continue to invest in hiring, including new college grads and interns to bring the best and brightest talent to Adobe. This quarter, Adobe was recognized among Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, Glassdoor's Best-led Companies and the Civic 50 List of the Most Community-minded Companies in the U.S. Demand for our category-defining products and services continues to grow. Our business fundamentals and market tailwinds are strong, and we look forward to building on our momentum in the second half and beyond. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much and congratulations on the quarter and especially the strong net new ARR. I'd like to ask a little more color on specifically the net new ARR that we saw in Creative Cloud. Can you give us a sense of what the contribution near term, medium term to Digital ARR from seat growth versus upsell versus consumption, things like Adobe Stock and AI credits, even rank ordering or quantifying? Anything you can give us -- to give us a sense of what's driving that number? And that would be very helpful in really understanding what's going on in the drivers of that number. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Mark, let me start and then certainly, David and Dan can add. To your point, we had a strong quarter. And I think what's really driving the quarter, big picture, continues to be the innovation that we're delivering. And the way AI is actually making our applications both more affordable, easy to onboard as well as, frankly, higher-value users. New users are still a big driver of the growth that we continue to see in the business. On the Document Cloud side, a lot of that has to do with the introduction of AI Assistant and the fact that people are migrating to the higher-value products. And on Creative Cloud, I would say the things that we're doing on imaging with Firefly and what we've seen both in Photoshop and Lightroom. I think in the prepared remarks Dan certainly talked about what's happening with also each of the different segments. So the SMB segment actually had a strong quarter. Enterprise continues to have a strong quarter. So across the board, Mark, we actually saw strength in the business. Operator : And our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Aleksandr Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on this incredible result. I wanted to ask kind of just similar to Mark's question, just how much gen AI demand did you see in the quarter in terms of -- for sort of both the Creative Cloud portfolio and Digital Media, in Creative Studio as well as in GenStudio? And how does it kind of help to pick up more on the enterprise side of the business, on the SMB side of the business? Help us understand that progression and maybe how you're planning for it in the back half of the [indiscernible]. Shantanu Narayen : Sure, Alex. Again, maybe I'll start with that. And just taking a step back, I think we've talked about the platform that we have for gen AI that constitutes data, as well as models and finally, interfaces. On the models, we released Firefly services. We've started to see some customer wins in Firefly services. So they're using it for variations, and these are the custom models that we're creating, as well as access to APIs. I would say that's early in terms of the adoption, but the interest as customers say how they can ingest their data into our models as well as custom models, that's really ahead of us, and we expect that to continue to grow in Q3 and Q4. I think the biggest opportunity for us and why we're really excited about gen AI is in the interfaces, because that's the way people derive value, whether it's in being able to complete their tasks faster, whether it's being able to do new workflows. And I would say in that particular space, Acrobat has really seen a significant amount of usage as it relates to AI Assistant. And Photoshop, I'll have David again add, but Generative Fill and what we are doing there, what we are doing in Illustrator. And that both for existing customers as well as for prospects who now come in and say, the products are becoming increasingly more productive for us, that's what's really driving the value there. And last but not least, the AI-first applications. When we think of an application like Express, Express is all about reimagining what we can do for creatives by sort of leapfrogging existing technologies and providing an AI-first application. And so that's also off to a good start. David Wadhwani : Yes. And just to add to a little bit of what Shantanu said, Alex. We've talked a lot about how FY 2023 was the year that AI was in the playground, and this is the year we need to bring it into production. And a lot of that is industry-wide, but we're in a pretty special position as it relates to that. So to Shantanu's point, a lot of active releases this quarter, right? Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly updates in Photoshop, Firefly was introduced for the first time into Lightroom, Express Mobile launched, Express for Business launched. We launched Firefly services for enterprises to produce content at scale. So, as you can see, there was a ton of innovation of our core -- in our core applications around generative AI. You put that together with some of the activations that we've done at Summit, and we did at Max London and we're getting our word out very broadly. It starts to create this ability to not just look at and play with AI, but actually use it as part of your workflow. So that's been deeply integrated into everything we do. And that's the key point, the interfaces that people work out if we bring AI there, everyone becomes more productive. Shantanu Narayen : And maybe one last thing, Alex. Sequentially, if you look at it from a route to market, Digital had a very strong quarter as it relates to what we did on adobe.com. We had talked about enterprise doing well in Q1 as well, that continued. And SMB also, the interest in our teams product also continued to do really well. So I think sequentially, I would point to SMB and Digital's strength as driving the further growth. Aleksandr Zukin : That's super helpful. And then maybe just one on the macro. Just given your guys' purview, like what is the story that you're seeing in terms of the macro on the demand environment? Clearly again, you're commenting on solid performance in the SMB and in the enterprise. Is there any areas that you're seeing pockets of weaknesses that's really vertical-dependent? Just maybe give a comment on kind of how we should think about it as we look to the rest of the year. Shantanu Narayen : I think from a macro perspective, what I think differentiates Adobe more than any other company is how differentiated and how diverse the set of products that we have. And again, from individual consumers all the way to enterprises, our products are mission-critical. And so at this scale, it's all about execution. And the business cycles will come and go, Alex, but we're actually continuing to focus on execution and converting the pipeline and the interest and the awareness of AI into monetization. And so, we just will be ruthlessly focused on continuing to execute against that. So nothing really to report different on the macroeconomic environment from our perspective. Aleksandr Zukin : Awesome. Keep doing what you're doing, guys. Operator : And our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here and echo the congrats on the quarter. Maybe for both, Shantanu and David. There are clearly just so many layers to the Firefly monetization story. But I think one theme that's coming out a little bit in this call and particularly interesting route to monetize is just the increased engagement that Firefly helps drive in your flagship products, right, or I think we call it sort of the interfaces, right? An example there would be like Generative Fill for Photoshop. And you've clearly started expanding that to other flagships like Premier and Illustrator. Maybe to go one level deeper, is there a way that you think about the potential opportunity from things like higher retention rates? Or any other way that -- I know it's really tough to size, but how have you sort of thought about it even qualitatively? David Wadhwani : Yes, it's a great question. And yes, the core has been -- from the very beginning, we've talked to you guys about our primary focus for generative AI is about user adoption and proliferation, right? And that has continued to be the primary thing on our mind. And it's the primary thing on our mind for multiple reasons. And to your point, there are many different ways that we can monetize this. First is, as you think about the growth algorithms that we always have in our head, it always starts with, as Shantanu said, new users, right? And then it's about getting more value to existing users at higher ARPU, right? So in the context of new users, first and foremost, we want to make sure that everything we're doing generative AI is embedded in our tools, starting with Express, right? So we have Express in the market. We're seeing a lot of adoption and usage of Express in the market. As that's happening, we're infusing generative AI more and more into Express in a whole host of ways. And that's really helping, everything from our marketing message for the completeness of the AI offering in there, all the way through to user engagement and success in onboarding and retention. Similarly, though, this is having the same effect in our core Creative products as well, right? The introduction of Firefly combined with some of the product-led growth work we've been doing, in particular, something called the Context Bar makes it easy for new users coming in to just be more successful out of the gate which then, of course, helps with both conversion and retention. And then with AI Assistant, the ability to sort of embed that into the purchase flow for Acrobat and get a high attach rate, we always talk about that as a would you like fries with it moment at Adobe when someone's going through the checkout flow, it's just a great way for people to say, look, this is value I want, I want to add it and buy up to the higher plans. So there are a lot of different mechanisms that we see. But by far, the strongest is going to be the fact that we are seeing people like in Creative Cloud migrating to the higher-priced plans because they include Firefly. And so we just want to get more value to these users as well. Shantanu Narayen : And in terms of the generation, Saket, I think we talked about it. We did a great job at MAX in London talking about some of the new functionality and releasing. Photoshop, I think we're up to 9 billion generations, and actually, I think the greatest amount of generations was in May. So the momentum clearly is the more we integrate this functionality into our interfaces, the more that usage is really driving adoption as well as retention. Saket Kalia : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : David, on Express, you mentioned the success you're seeing. Can you maybe drill into some of the other metrics and accomplishments that you're seeing out of Express this quarter? David Wadhwani : Yes. For starters, there's a lot of buzz of Express here at Adobe coming off the event we just had earlier this week, but it's really based on the fact that the innovation in Express is on a tear, right? A few months ago, we introduced an all-new Express for the web. This quarter, we introduced an all-new Express for mobile. We introduced Express for Business. We also now have, as we've just talked about, been more deeply integrating AI features, whether it's for imaging generation or generative fill or text effects, character animation, design generations more deeply into the flow for Express. And that combination has led to an incredible set of metrics over the last quarter, in particular, but building throughout the year. Express MAU is growing very quickly. We talked about on the -- in the script earlier that MAU on mobile has more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, which is fantastic to see. And cumulative exports, if you look at year-over-year it has grown by over 80%. So really feeling good about sort of the momentum we're seeing. But if you take a step back, I think it is important to take a step back and understand our vision. Express that is now in market is built on a brand-new platform, right? And that brand-new platform lays the groundwork for the AI era. And this will be -- Express will be the place that anyone can come and create through a combination of conversational and standard inputs. That's the vision that we have. And I think it's an opportunity for us to really leap forward in terms of what we can do on the web and mobile at Adobe. And it's taken us a little time to get here. It hasn't happened overnight. But now that we are here, we are going to pour the gas on go-to-market, right? You know what we can do with our data-driven operating model. We've been ramping up what we're doing in Digital and Adobe.com journeys. We now can do the same thing and unleash all of that expertise in the mobile app store. You know what we're capable in terms of our product-led growth motions. We've now embedded Express Workflows into Acrobat Editor. We obviously have been embedding it into Creative Cloud workflows. And also, as we showed at Summit with Anil, we've embedded it into our Experience Cloud workflows as well. In addition to all of that, we're now unleashing our inside sales force to target the small/medium businesses. Our education teams are really gearing up for the back-to-school launch for K-12 and higher ed. And our field and enterprise sales now have Express for Business. So -- and we're doing all this globally, right? It's a massive market, and we're ramping up and we're ready to go. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Gregg Moskowitz : Hey, thank you very much. And I'll add my congratulations. For your Creative business, how are you thinking about the Q side of the P times Q equation over the balance of the year? Based on these numbers anyway, I would certainly assume that you had really healthy unit growth in Q2. And I'm wondering if you expect that to continue. David Wadhwani : Yes. I mean, again, I think what -- it is this mix of product innovation that we've been putting out there and the steady drumbeat of that. A lot of it getting attention because of the quality and the hooks of AI and being able to sort of bring people, onboarding them quickly and successfully into the product. And then as we talked about, the more they use these AI features, the more they retain. And we feel really good about really that whole workflow. So yes, the new user growth continues to be our primary focus. And when you add in everything we're doing with Express, we're -- again, like I said, we're off to the races and we feel very good about the momentum on new user acquisition and existing member retention. Shantanu Narayen : And Gregg, as you're aware, I mean, certainly with Express, we also have the model of customer acquisition as it relates to people coming in through trial and free and then conversion. So we are seeing the interest level as it relates to Express, in particular, significant interest. Gregg Moskowitz : And Shantanu, since you also called out the strength in Digital earlier, including driving new Creative All Apps subscriptions from your website, are you doing anything different that's helping to drive that behavior? And if so, is that something you think can continue as well? Shantanu Narayen : I would, Gregg, sort of modesty say, we've been world-class at sort of driving that for a long time now. But the team, I think, continues to do an amazing job. And I would say David referred to the DDOM. Adobe Home is now sort of increasingly the way that we're driving a lot of people to get aware of our new products. And so, I would say the mobile part as well and the mobile journeys, as we've got these mobile products, whether it's Lightroom or whether it's certainly, Express, that's an area of increasing focus for us. And the traditional sort of understanding where search terms are, I think we're getting better and better at that, which leads to way more digital traffic for us. So I think it's across the board. But I'd also highlight, I mean, the commerce team that we have at Adobe that understands what the segments are and how for those particular segments we can attract people, that's great. I mean, I think in the prepared remarks, Dan also talked about the strength in emerging markets. And I think the beautiful part about AI is that since they need access to the cloud to get all of the AI functionality, emerging market growth has been really strong for us. Gregg Moskowitz : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And moving on to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you guys for taking the question. And again, congratulations on a really solid set of results in an environment where not very many software companies have been able to beat and raise in this type of uneven environment. I wanted to maybe focus in a little bit on the question that Mark Moerdler asked, in particular on what gives you guys the confidence to see a return to year-on-year growth and Creative Cloud net new ARR. It declined in Q2, it declined in Q1. And if I'm not mistaken, the decline in Q2 was a little bit steeper than what we saw in Q1. So what are the particular drivers and maybe some detail on those drivers that give you guys the confidence that, that trend line that has been actually heading in the wrong direction is going to head in the right direction now? We're actually going to see growth in those metrics in Q3 and Q4? David Wadhwani : Yes. Thanks, Keith. This is one of the areas that I think we've shared with you the complexity of the year-over-year comparisons in the first half based on prior pricing marks that we had. But more importantly, to your point, the year-over-year complexities are now behind us. And we're very excited about the momentum of the first half and how it sets us up for the second half, frankly, across both Document Cloud and Creative Cloud. Both are really momentum stories. The 478 -- the 487, sorry, just to be clear, the $487 million that we printed this time is obviously strong performance, and it implies that both CC and DC came in over what the growth -- the guide would have implied otherwise, right? So it's giving us a lot of good momentum going into the back half. Now the momentum is really driven by three things, and just I'll try to share a little bit more context here and hopefully gives you. First is new user acquisition, right? We're seeing Express starting to perform well in terms of bringing a lot of new users into the franchise across mobile and web. AI Assistant in Reader has been a really nice start for us, and we've been very pleased with how the uptake on that's going. And then Firefly itself, as I mentioned, has been increasingly more productive in terms of bringing in onboarding users and then retaining users because of the growth. We continue -- as we drive that more holistically throughout the product set, we start to see more people using it, including, as Shantanu mentioned earlier, in emerging markets. So we are seeing very good strength and usage in emerging markets, and that has certainly been a bright spot for us, which is something that obviously represents a lot of potential and upside for us. In terms of existing customers, the migration has been going very well for us as well. So, more people are moving to the higher-priced, higher-value plans because of the Firefly capabilities. We're even seeing this in enterprises where people are moving up to the highest versions of Creative Cloud, which is what we call it, Creative Cloud Enterprise 4, because they get more access to features beyond just generation. They have more collaborative capabilities beyond just kind of sharing via e-mail. And we're starting to see that create a nice momentum in upgrade cycles in the enterprise segment as well. And then certainly, let's not forget the new offerings, too. While still early, automation and content production is something that we're driving effectively in a lot of these accounts with Firefly services. So that mix of new users, existing user migration, and also the new offerings that we have in market are driving that growth formula that we talked about, which is now P times Q plus V for value with these automation systems. Keith Weiss : That is a great answer. Thank you so much. Operator : And we have a question from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Bradley Sills : Oh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around the generative credit component to your pricing here. It seems like with all the progress you've made embedding Firefly across the key flagship products and the engagement levels that you're seeing, we should start to see perhaps some ramp in that generative credit component to your pricing. Is that a fair assessment? Would you expect to start to see that coming in? Or should we look to other services like the video capabilities that you're going to be launching shortly as a key catalyst there? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I think you're right, Brad. When we think about what we've done with imaging and video, we've done the right thing by making sure the higher-value paid plans that people don't have to think about the amount of generative capability. And so there, the balance between for free and trialist users, they're going to run into the generative capability limits and, therefore, have to subscribe. But for the people who actually have imaging and vector needs, that they're not constantly thinking about generative, I think we actually got it right. To your point, as we move to video, expect to see different plans because those plans will, by necessity, take into account the amount of work that's required to do video generation. So you're absolutely right as a sort of framework for you to think about it. The two other things that I would say is, I mean, clearly, Express is really being driven by sort of the need for AI and how people are able to describe what they want and get the final output. When David talked about exports, just to clarify what that means is people who have successfully got what they want to get done, done. And that's a key measure of how we are doing it, and AI is certainly facilitating and accelerating that. And last thing I would say, Brad is, as you know, on the Acrobat side, it's a slightly different model which we like, which is anybody who has Reader and is looking at a document, they can have an upsell to their AI Assistant. If you have Acrobat Pro, you can upsell to the AI Assistant. And if you're a brand new acquisition of a user when you're coming in, the adoption of the highest-value products, so between Standard Pro and Pro Plus Assistant, we've been pleased to see how many people are migrating to the Pro Plus Assistant. So hopefully, that gives you some color of how we think about it differently by product. Bradley Sills : Very helpful. Thank you, Shantanu. Operator : And we'll take a question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much and congrats to all of you. I don't want Anil to feel left out, so I'm going to ask a DX question. Anil, it's good to hear AEP is on track to become the next billion-dollar business for Adobe. Can you expand on the journey and drivers that get you there? And in particular, how important are cloud migrations? And how do you see AEP AI Assistant perhaps accelerating the journey to $1 billion? Thanks. Anil Chakravarthy : Thank you, Brad. Appreciate it. As you know, I mean, customer experience management and especially it's been a hugely important priority area for Chief Marketing Officers and with CIOs and Chief Digital Officers as well. And for us, we are focused on personalization scale, which is really built around the AEP platform. We're the largest provider in this space. We're growing faster than any of our peers, and we're the number one Digital Experience platform as a result. And that has really helped us keep the momentum. When you think about the AEP AI Assistant, it's doing a couple of things. One, it's really making it easier for customers to deploy use cases. When you think of use cases that they have around, for example, generating audiences and running campaigns around those audiences, these are things today that require some data engineering. They require the ability to put these audiences together. So they require marketing and IT teams to work together. The AEP AI Assistant is making it much easier for marketers to be able to do it themselves and be able to deploy a lot more use cases. So as there's more usage, it will help drive more consumption and help drive the growth in terms of number of profiles, number of users, and we help -- we see it helping us grow towards that billion-dollar business. Brad Zelnick : Great to hear, and keep up the great work, guys. Thanks. Jonathan Vaas : Hey, operator, we're almost at the top of the hour. We'll take two last questions and then wrap up. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take a question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. You guys could have three separate earnings calls because you have three different businesses that even the smallest one is very large. So yes, sorry, Anil, Dave, and Shantanu, I may not be able to ask all the questions that I want. I'm sure we have plenty. But I'll just keep it super high level, Shantanu. Generative AI, it seems to swing back and forth. Just so early in its evolution, the possibilities seem magical sometimes, endless sometimes, sometimes it feels very disappointing. But with every quarter that Adobe is executing on this path, where do you stand with the question that we do get from investors? Will generative AI be so good that it's the end of the creative process? So we don't need creative folks, that software will do everything? That sounds a little far-fetched, but I'm just throwing it out there to see how you would react that proposition. Same in Experience Cloud as well. Could generative AI create its own marketing campaign, put marketing people out of business? Or maybe it doesn't. I'm sure you have strong views. Maybe flipped on the other side, it does create category growth on the other hand, not category compression. So sorry for that super high-level question, but that seems to be a big debate on the stock here, at least from the long-term perspective. Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Yes, Kash. I think there are two things when we talk to investors that are perhaps on their mind. I mean, I think the first is it's fair to say that the interest that exists right now from investors as it relates to AI is all associated with the infrastructure and chips and perhaps rightly so because that's where everybody is creating these models. They're all trying to train them. And there's a lot of, I think, deserved excitement associated with that part of where we are in the evolution of generative AI. If the value of AI doesn't turn to inference and how people are going to use it, then I would say all of that investment would not really reap the benefit in terms of where people are spending the money. And so we're always convinced that when you have this kind of disruptive technology, the real benefits come when people use interfaces to do whatever task they want to do quicker, faster, and when it's embedded into the workflows that they're accustomed to because then there isn't an inertia associated with using it. So with that sort of as a broad segment, I am a big believer that generative AI is going to, for all the categories that we're in, it's actually going to dramatically expand the market because it's going to make our products more accessible, more affordable, more productive in terms of what you -- what we can do. I'm still acting CMO at the company, and I see the excitement around how we can, with agility, create way more content, create variations. When Anil talked about personalization at scale, I think there are two aspects to it, right? I mean, the first was always data, and Anil and the team have done a great job with sort of the real-time customer data platform to get that. And that's hydrated with users. But the real value is when you infuse that with the right content to make that personalized experience. So I think the demand is there for way more content than people can do, and generative AI is going to be an accelerant in that as well. And so net-net, I am absolutely betting on the fact that five years from now, there will be more people saying, I'm using creative tools to accomplish what I want, and there'll be more marketers saying, I can now, with the agility that I need, truly deliver a marketing campaign and an audience that's incredibly more specific than I could in the past. And that's Adobe's job to demonstrate how we are both leading in both those categories and to continue to innovate. But I recognize and I understand the question that exists in the industry associated with AI. If the value doesn't accrue to interfaces, I'll leave you with that. I think the investment would not be as beneficial as I believe it can be. David Wadhwani : And maybe one thing to add to that, Kash, just to build on what Shantanu was talking about. I think the other thing we get asked a fair amount is about the comparison between different models, right? So Firefly might be better at something. Midjourney might be something at something else. DALL-E might do something else. And the key thing here is that around this table, we get excited when models innovate. We get excited when Firefly does something amazing. We get excited when third-party models do something because our view, to Shantanu's point, is that the more content that gets generated out of these models, the more content that needs to be edited, whether it's color correction, tone matching, transitions, assembling clips, or masking composite images. And the reason for this is that this is not a game where there's going to be one model. Each model is going to have its own personality, what it generates, what it looks like, how fast it generates, how much it costs when it generates that, and to have some interface layer to help synthesize all of this is important. And so just sort of to note, we've said this before but I'll say it again here, you will see us building our products and tools and services leveraging Firefly for sure, but you'll also see us leveraging best-of-breed personalities from different models and integrate them all together. Kash Rangan : Awesome, the message here is that, gen AI is going to create more growth in the category. And Shantanu, you did that with the pivot to cloud. You grew the category, so here we go again. Thank you so much. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Kash. Operator : And next will be Jake Roberge with William Blair. Jacob Roberge : Hey, thanks for taking the question and I'll echo my congrats on the great quarter. I know it's early, but what's been the feedback and customer behavior for those users that are on Firefly services and GenStudio? And then thinking more longer term, what type of price uplift could you see from those customers over time, just given what you said about the acceleration in Firefly generations being driven by those products? Thanks. David Wadhwani : Maybe I'll start with customer zero. Right before this meeting, I was in a meeting with our CMO. And well, sometimes it's hard to tell, he's running the CMO or CEO head, but CMO this time. And we were reviewing a full-funnel campaign that we're planning on launching later this year. And exactly as Shantanu mentioned earlier, we saw benefits in terms of cost of the campaign, faster time to market for the campaign, and the amount of content that we can create to personalize that campaign. And that is one of those things that we've been doing more and more around our DDOM, which has actually been very productive for us, as you can see this quarter, and what we're pitching to other customers. So we've been working with -- we listed some of the customers earlier, but we've been working with a long list of customers on everything from accelerating the content creation for social, accelerating content creation for regional, and then increasing the number of amount of content that's created for increased personalization, which then, of course, flows through all of the Experience Cloud products that Anil is working on to get targeted better. Shantanu Narayen : And Jake, maybe in terms of what I would say we're seeing usage of, I think the initial usage of Firefly services in most companies was all around ideation. How can they create multiple variations of them and in the ideation process really just accelerate that ideation process? Most companies are then starting with as they're putting it into production, how can they, with the brand assets and the brand guidelines that they have, do this in terms of the variations, whether they be geographic variations or they be just variations? I mean, if you take a step back also, every single ad company right now will tell you that the more variance that you provide, the better your chances are of appropriately getting an uplift for your media spend. So I would say that most companies are starting with creating these variations for geographies. The other one that we see a fair amount of is engaging with their communities. So when they want their communities to have assets that they have blessed for usage within community campaigns, that's the other place where Firefly services are being used. And a company has a community portal where the community can come in, take something and then post whether it's on whatever social media site that you want. So I think that's the initial one. All of the agency companies are companies that have actually even publicly said how GenStudio is something that they have embraced. But even the large media companies, because the media companies are certainly interested in understanding how all of this gen AI could be used to automate as well as accelerate the amount of content that they can produce. So hopefully, that gives you some color of it. If there's been sort of the questions that they ask along the way, which hopefully and actually, luckily, we have great answers, it's all around the indemnification and how they can use it. And I would say that continues to be a really key differentiator for us. But since that is the last question, let me just say I'm proud of how we executed in Q2, both across the product innovation, delivery as well as the go-to-market because clearly, a number of you asked how we were able to put together these numbers where others have perhaps talked about the macroeconomic environment. We certainly remain focused on leveraging technology to light a broader set of customers. And at the end of the day, to the questions that we were asked, we believe that the real value of AI will be in the interfaces that individuals, enterprises use to accomplish their tasks and workflows. And we think we're incredibly well positioned. So thank you for joining us. Jonathan Vaas : Thanks, everyone. This concludes the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation, and have an excellent day.",

I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our Digital Media business. David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu. Hello everyone. In Q3, we achieved net new Digital Media ARR of $504 million and revenue of $4 billion, which grew 12% year-over-year, fueled by innovation in both our Creative and Document businesses. With Document Cloud, we continue to reinvent how people create, edit, share, review and sign digital documents with PDF and Acrobat across mobile, web and desktop. For decades, PDF has been the de facto standard for storing unstructured data, resulting in the creation and sharing of trillions of PDFs. The introduction of AI Assistant across Adobe Acrobat and Reader has transformed the way people interact with and extract value from these documents. In Q3, we released significant advancements including the ability to have conversations across multiple documents and support for different document formats, saving users valuable time and providing important insights. We're thrilled to see this value translate into AI Assistant usage, with over 70% quarter-over-quarter growth in AI interactions. In addition to consumption, we're focused on leveraging generative AI to expand content creation in Adobe Acrobat. We've integrated Adobe Firefly image generation into our Edit PDF workflows. We've optimized AI Assistant in Acrobat to generate content fit for presentations, emails and other forms of communication. And we're laying the groundwork for richer content creation, including the generation of Adobe Express projects. The application of this technology across verticals and industries is virtually limitless. Tata Consultancy Services recently used Adobe Premiere Pro to transcribe hours of conference videos and then used AI Assistant in Acrobat to create digestible event summaries in minutes. This allowed them to distribute newsletters on session content to attendees in real time. We're excited to leverage generative AI to add value to content creation and consumption in Acrobat and Reader in the months ahead. Given the early adoption of AI Assistant, we intend to actively promote subscription plans that include generative AI capabilities over legacy perpetual plans that do not. In Q3, we achieved Document Cloud revenue of $807 million, growing 18% year-over-year. We added $163 million of net new Document Cloud ARR. Other highlights include. Expanded Acrobat customer value with multi-document support for AI Assistant, enhanced meeting transcript capabilities and support for larger documents. Optimized AI Assistant for mobile, web, and desktop experiences, including voice-enabled conversations on Android. Continued strength of PDF-based collaboration, with shared links growing greater than 70% year-over-year. Increased top of funnel through Acrobat Web, with monthly active users growing over 35% year-over-year as a result of link sharing and our Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome extensions. Key enterprise customer wins include Amazon, Charles Schwab, Disney, Home Depot, KPMG, RedBull, Sutter Health and the US Treasury Department. With Creative Cloud, the demand for creative expression and design across media types and surfaces has never been greater. Consumers are sharing edited photos more than ever. Students need to create school presentations that stand out. Creative professionals are being asked to create more images, designs and videos faster than ever before. Small businesses are looking to engage prospects on social channels. And large enterprises are defining their content supply workflows to deliver personalization at scale. AI has the potential to empower creative professionals, communicators, consumers and organizations of all sizes to be more creative and productive. Our strategy is to build technology that will create more streamlined and precise workflows within our tools, through features like Text-to-Template in Express, Generative Fill in Photoshop, Generative Recolor in Illustrator, Generative Remove in Lightroom and the upcoming Generative Extend for video in Premiere Pro. We're exposing the power of our creative tools and the magic of generative AI through Firefly Service APIs so organizations can generate and assemble content at scale. As we integrate Firefly innovations throughout our tools, usage continues to accelerate, crossing 12 billion generations since launch. The introduction of the new Firefly Video model earlier this week at IBC is another important milestone in our journey. Our video model, like the other models in the Firefly Family is built to be commercially safe, with fine-grained control and application integration at its core. This will empower editors to realize their creative vision more productively in our video products, including Premiere Pro. With Express, we're on a multi-year strategic journey to dramatically expand our reach across customer segments. Adobe Express is our AI-first content creation application fulfilling our mission to enable creativity for all. The all-new release of Express across web and mobile earlier this year has been embraced by millions of users. They love how easy it is to create anything in Express with strong enthusiasm for our image editing features, powered by Photoshop, video editing capabilities, powered by Premiere Pro, document and presentation workflows, powered by Acrobat, and unparalleled generative AI features, powered by Adobe Firefly. Our integration of Adobe Stock and design templates with our unique Firefly Design Model ensures that content created in Express can stand out. Express empowers a broad array of individuals and businesses, from solopreneurs to the largest enterprises in the world. We're continuing to grow Express as we ramp our go-to-market activities to support recent product releases, including Express for individuals, Express for Education, Express for Teams and Express for Enterprises. As a result, in Q3 we drove 70% year-over-year growth in cumulative exports. We onboarded over 1,500 businesses and millions of students. In Q3, we achieved $3.19 billion in revenue, which grew 11% year-over-year in constant currency. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $341 million. Other highlights include. New AI-powered features in Photoshop that accelerate core creative workflows and streamline repetitive tasks. Generative Fill in Photoshop was upgraded to Firefly Image 3, Generative Image was made generally available, and the new Selection Brush and Adjustment Brush Tools were introduced, making selective edits easier than ever. Broad-based innovations in Illustrator, including significant improvements to vector generation, enhancements to text-to-pattern and the all-new Generative Shape Fill. These advances unlock new ways for pro designers and illustrators to quickly bring their vision to life. Strong adoption of the latest version of Lightroom and Lightroom Mobile, which now includes the new Generative Remove feature. Millions of users have non-destructively removed unwanted objects from their photos with a single click. Strong demand for Firefly Services, which provide APIs, tools and services for content generation, editing and assembly, empowering organizations to automate content production while maintaining quality and control. Total API calls tripled quarter-over-quarter. Acrobat Pro single app continues to be a growth driver in Creative Cloud, reflecting the increasing adoption of PDF as a preferred format to create, collaborate and share visually compelling content. Key enterprise customer wins include The Brandtech Group, Dentsu, Estee Lauder, Google, MediaMonks, Meta, MLB, Newell Brands, PepsiCo, Stagwell Group and the US Navy. We look forward to hosting Adobe MAX, the world's largest creativity conference, next month in Miami, where we will welcome more than 10,000 members of our global community and engage with hundreds of thousands more online. We will hear from inspiring creators and unveil innovations across our clouds. In summary, we are excited about the pace and caliber of innovations across our Digital Media products and the continued execution across multiple growth drivers. I'll now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello everyone. In Q3, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $1.35 billion. Subscription revenue was $1.23 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth.

Given the massive markets we are catalyzing, I am confident in our ability to drive growth and industry leadership. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. Adobe's focus on responsible innovation, with customers at the center, continues to be a unifying purpose for the company. The Content Authenticity Initiative, which we founded in 2019, now counts over 3,300 members across the digital ecosystem, all committed to enhancing trust and transparency with Content Credentials. In five years, this mission has gone from a vision to reality with companies including Amazon, Google, Leica, Meta, Qualcomm, Sony, TikTok and others all committing to implementing Content Credentials. The US Department of Defense became the first federal government agency to implement Content Credentials by applying them to official DoD images. We're teaming up with Governor Gavin Newsom on a new initiative to boost digital and media literacy skills in K-12 schools and higher education institutions in California. By providing educational content, programming, and resources to schools across the state, we can help empower California's future workforce for success in an AI-powered world and use this as a blueprint for other states and countries. Next week, we will bring employees together for our annual Adobe for All conference to celebrate our vision and purpose and the impact that has on our customers and communities. I am confident that Adobe's culture, innovative product roadmap, global market opportunity, trusted brand and the unwavering commitment of our employees will continue to drive our success. Thank you and we will now take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on what looks like a very strong quarter. It's one question, but it's a two-parter. The quarter itself, particularly on the Digital Media ARR looked very strong. It looked unseasonably strong because you haven't grown net new ARR sequentially in the 3Q, I think, in almost four years. So maybe just comment like what drove this unseasonable strength. Is it pricing, AI traction, and particularly the Document Cloud net new ARR? But at the same time given all the product momentum you went through in the script, it's a bit confusing to understand why the Q4 guide is the lowest it's ever been sequentially for Q4 on net new Digital Media ARR, which I think makes people a little nervous about maybe the go-forward, the next year performance. And so maybe just address this dichotomy because it looks kind of seasonally a little bit different than what we're used to. And I think it's weighing on the stock after hours. Shantanu Narayen : I'm happy to start Alex and then David can certainly also add to that. I mean, to your point, we had a strong quarter, when I think about Digital Media, Document Cloud to the point that you made, Acrobat continues to perform the AI Assistant, and the SKU that we have associated with Acrobat continues to perform well. As we had said, we expect Creative to show a growth-on-growth year-over-year, and so that also played out exactly as we expected. And you know it was a strong end, when you look at it as it relates to the last few weeks' performance, we saw the typical strength that we would see going into Q4. I can see how you're saying, you're looking at the sequential guide. We're looking at it and saying it's the strongest ever Q4 target that we have put out there for Q4, Alex. And so I think we just continue to focus. We would expect Creative to again grow when you talk about growth-over-growth, net new ARR in Q4. And all of the new initiatives that we're talking about, AI, et cetera, continue to perform. So from our perspective, when we look at what we guided to the second half of the year, to your point, Q3 is stronger. We expect a seasonally strong Q4 and then continued innovation should continue to drive growth. David Wadhwani : Yeah and maybe I'll just add a couple of things to what Shantanu, said. Again, just a little bit more context behind the strength in Document Cloud. Obviously, link sharing and what we've done with reader distribution across mobile, web, and desktop, that's really what continues to drive this business, and that underlying strength is going to continue not just in Q3, but it's going to be something that we're able to bet on and grow on going forward because we've got a lot of flow optimizations associated with that. As we look at Creative Cloud, again, we have a broader set of offerings than we've ever had, right? We have things like with Creative Cloud, we have higher-value, higher-priced offers, thanks to AI innovation that's happening in the base plans that are impacting how the Creative Cloud business is doing. We also have a broader set of offerings than we've ever had now with web and mobile, including Premium and lower-priced offerings that are driving more proliferation. And the blend of those two things also sort of comes into the strength of the quarter and how we see things going out. But as you look at the second half overall, we came into the second half with a strong expectation of how the second half is going to play out. And frankly, it's playing out as we expected in terms of the aggregate Q3, Q4 numbers. In terms of the specifics on timing, Q3 was a little stronger than you expected, and for a good reason given seasonality. I think a lot of that can be explained by a few deals that would have historically just closed in Q4, closing earlier than expected in Q3, and that changed the dynamic in terms of the linearity that you would typically see between Q3 and Q4. Alex Zukin : Very helpful guys. Thanks again. Operator : And our next question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Thank you so much and I'll have my congrats. David, I'm wondering if you can compare the AI monetization opportunity that you're sensing with the image models relative to the future potential with your audio and video models, just for instance, how many tokens might be consumed when someone is generating a video versus an image. And then tying in with that, just how optimistic are you maybe being able to solve some of the limitations with the current video generation models where the facial expressions can lack realism or they can't handle the object interactions or they don't provide enough detail or resolution in the videos? David Wadhwani : Yes. Happy to take that. Let me just sort of take a little bit of a step back and talk about the core strategy that we have for AI and the conversion then in terms of how we think about monetization. So I think we've been incredibly consistent with what we've said dating back a year, year and a half ago where we talked about the fact that we were going to develop the broadest set of models for the creative community and we were going to differentiate the models based on quality, commercial safety, integrateability into our tools and controllability. And as you've seen very methodically over the last 18 months, we continue to bring more and more of that innovation to life. And that fundamentally is working as we've now started to integrate it much more actively into our base. If you look at it with photography, we now have in our tool generative remove, we have AI-assisted edits. In design, we have Generative Pattern, Generative Fill Shape. We have, in Photoshop, we have Gen Remove. We also have Gen Fill and I can continue on with all the generations, but we've also now started to integrate it in Firefly services for what we're enabling enterprises to be able to access and use in terms of batchwork and through APIs. If you look at sort of how that's played out, as we talked about, we're seeing accelerated use and generative credits being consumed because of that deeper integration into all of our tools. And that is playing out as we expected. When you look at then how that converts to monetization, first and foremost, we've integrated it, a lot of that value into our core products and with more value and more pricing. We're also seeing that when people use these generative features, they retain better. We're also seeing that when people come to Adobe to try our Creative Cloud applications or Express application, they're able to convert better. And so there are all these ancillary implied benefits that we're getting. But in terms of direct monetization, what we've said in the past is that the current model is around generative credits, which is, I think, where you're going with this. And we do see with every subsequent capability we integrate into the tool, total credits consumed going up. Now, what we are trying to do as we go forward, we haven't started instituting the caps yet. And part of this is, as we've said all along, we wanted to really focus our attention on proliferation and usage across our base. We see a lot of users excited about it. It's some of the most actively used features that we've ever released. And we want to avoid the generation anxiety that people feel. But we're watching very closely as the economy of generative credits evolves. And we're going to look at instituting those caps at some point when we feel the time is right and/or we're also looking at other alternative models. What we did with Acrobat AI Assistant has proven to be very effective. And so we're also considering other opportunities like having standard CC plans that have a core set of generative capabilities, but also having premium API, sorry, premium AI plans that will include things more like video and other things. So, we're very happy about the innovation that's coming. And we see the opportunity to engage very deeply in the monetization. But we want to play it out over time and proliferation continues to be our primary guide. And then lastly, in terms of quality, I don't know if you had a chance to see some of the videos we put out there, integrated directly into Premiere, also text to video, image to video, more controllability. We have also the ability now to generate not just scenes with humans and dogs and organic animals, but all these like overlays and things that creative professionals actually want to work with. And so we're very excited about the set of things that they can get out of the box and get going. And human faces and things will just continue to get better. We have a lot of great research that you'll start to see. And I hope you get to play with the models because we've taken a huge step forward there. Shantanu Narayen : Mark, maybe I'll just add a little to what David said, which was great. I spent a couple of hours with our video team. They have just absolutely hit it out of the park. I mean, the work that they've done, which is leveraging the image models with video. And again, I think to David's point, the integration with Premiere, that's what we've always said. It's the integration of the model and the application that differentiates it. I think when other models first came out, people were like, wow, you can describe it. That's just such a small part of where the value is. And the real value is you have a video, you want to extend it. It's a game changer in terms of what we can do. So really excited about the stuff that we're doing in video. And again, to David's point, this will be monetized differently from the way we have for images, which was part of the sort of base value pricing. So, the way I answer your question is, and the third thing I would say is, remember, we have the ability to create custom models as well. And so when you ingest the video that people want to edit, the ability to extend that is not just dependent on what the model is, but also on what the new data is. And again, that represents really a unique ability for us. So, hopefully all those three demonstrate why we're leading the pack in terms of how people can derive value in the nonlinear editors, which is where the action is going to be. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. Operator : And moving on to Keith Bachman with BMO. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you very much. I appreciate taking the question. I wanted to pick up a little bit on how we should be thinking about, David, you just mentioned monetization. And will consumption, you think, as we start to turn the year, can consumption contribute to ARR growth as we look at FY'25? Because I think there's pervasive fears that the state of competition may in fact limit your ability to turn on that monetization, if you will, from either consumption or price. And I just wanted to see if you could lace in consumption against the backdrop of competition. Shantanu Narayen : From our perspective, Keith, I think when you look at what we have with the apps and the models, we just continue to think that's uniquely differentiated. Firefly services, which is, you can think of that also as a consumption model where we have that, it's off to a really good start. Our ability to give enterprises the ability to automate content, create custom models within enterprises, we're seeing real traction because it's a differentiated solution in that it's designed to be commercially safe. And as it relates to the core subscription models, again, David said this, but I'll reiterate it, which is, the core subscription models for products like Photoshop and Illustrator, I think, the differentiation is the combination of the model and the technology. And in video, I think, we will find additional ways to monetize it. So, I'm not sure who specifically you're referring to as it relates to competition in this space, but from our perspective, it's just unique. I mean, if you look at the acceleration of what we've seen of generations in Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, it's clear that we're actually extending the value rather than having other people to catch up. David Wadhwani : And then one other thing I'd just emphasize there is that the commercial safety is so important to businesses of all sizes frankly and that is something that we feel very, very, very differentiated in addition to everything Shantanu said. Keith Bachman : Okay, great. And then perhaps for my follow-up, I wanted to pick up on Alex's first question. But you're guiding net new ARR down 3% year-over-year in Q4. And I think investors are, but thereby taking that as perhaps a framework when you look at next year, but is there anything that net new ARR will be down next year? And I know you don't want to give guidance for next year, but just any kind of thoughts you want to address as it relates to the guidance associated with net new ARR being down in Q4 versus a framework that we might want to apply for the FY'25 net new ARR? Shantanu Narayen : You're right, Keith. We're not going to give FY'25 guidance. We'll certainly share more at MAX and we would expect like we did last year that at the December earnings call, we'll give color on fiscal '25 ARR, but I'd say a couple of things. First, as it relates to again the performance of the second half because to Alex and your question, if there are questions around Q3 and Q4 and what that trend means, again, we will hope to have record net new ARR in fiscal '24, which I think is a great thing. We gave 1,950 at the end of Q2. We're clearly on track to beat that number, which we take as a positive sign. And the other thing, maybe perhaps, tactically for you folks to think about as well, as it relates to the Q4 guidance, typically, you have Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the same quarter. This time, Cyber Monday, I believe, is in Q1. And so as it relates to our Q4 performance, it's the highest target that we've ever issued. We will go out and then continue to execute and continue to innovate. So that's the way I look at the business, Keith. Keith Bachman : Okay. Thank you, Shantanu. Operator : And the next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Saket Kalia : Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. David, maybe for you. You touched on some of the drivers in Document, which was super helpful. But I'd love to maybe go one level deeper into some of the dynamics in that business, which of course continues to grow net new ARR at a really nice clip. So maybe we can just talk a little bit about, are there any pricing headwinds or tailwinds that we should keep in mind specifically for Document Cloud. And also maybe you can give us a sense for sort of where Document Cloud is in its journey to maybe becoming more of a subscription-heavy business. Do those make sense? David Wadhwani : The first part does. Let me try to address the whole thing. The question on subscription-heavy, it is a very strong subscription business for us already, but I'll touch on that and hopefully, I'll address your question. So first, if we take a step back and look at Document Cloud, I mean the foundation of everything we're doing here is incredibly strong and it's a machine we've had for a long time, but it continues to perform incredibly well. And what I mean by that is the platform proliferation of what we have with Acrobat and Reader. The fact that we have 40 years into this business, the rise of PDF and PDF becoming the de facto standard for content as a unstructured content as a whole is a remarkable foundation for us to be building on. And the distribution we have across desktop, web, mobile, including web extensions is really the foundation of everything we do because that becomes the top of funnel for us. You layer on top of that the fact that generative AI in general has come out where unstructured content, especially PDF unstructured content, the 3 trillion PDFs out there that we believe are out there has suddenly inherently much more value than it did a year ago. And this whole ecosystem is set up well for us. In addition to that foundation, we've also been over the course of the last few years, really transitioning the way people share because if you think about PDFs and Acrobat in general, one of the most important things people do is they produce the PDF to share it with others, often for comment and review engagement and by increasing sharing via links versus sharing as an attachment, we see a lot more engagement and interaction that we're able to benefit from and that also helps with the top of funnel and we can provide more value. Then on that platform, what we've done is with AI Assistant, we focus on consumption for the last nine months, starting with the ability to look at a single PDF and ask questions of that PDF. Then we sort of then we added support for multi-docs, so you can now have five or six PDFs that you're having a conversation with. We added support for multiple formats. So you can look at PDFs, but you can also drag in Word documents or PowerPoint documents or a link to a meeting transcript that you have. We are adding in the process of adding language support for other languages optimizations. We're now starting to work on document type optimization. So if it's a contract, we know how to optimize the results even better than if it's a marketing document. And that's all about consumption. But in addition to consumption, we're now expanding because these conversations that happen with these documents are inherently about getting some insight and then sharing that insight. We've also started to do things that you can create richer content on the back end of it. So Firefly is embedded now in Edit PDF workflows. We have the conversational content and now able to generate emails and presentations and those kinds of things. We've now embedded in the Convert PDF workflows, the ability to output to Express and create richer media outputs and you can start to see all of this stuff coming together in a very real way already, but also in the months ahead. The last thing I want to say on this too is that what's really working out well for us is that when we are outpitching this opportunity, not just in terms of the individuals that use it, but also businesses, is that we don't have any security concerns, right. Our data governance model is the same data governance model that's happened. If you have access to the documents, you can have conversations with the documents. And so it makes it a much easier thing for enterprises to adopt because there's no systemic or governance changes. And so all of that continues to drive more adoption. And as I said on the prepared remarks, Document Cloud is substantially a subscription business, but now with AI Assistant being available to subscribers and not as directly to perpetual users, we expect that to continue to transition even further. Saket Kalia : Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And the next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Yeah. Thank you. Good evening. David, I'd like to follow up on something that you said on the second quarter call. And that was that you said at the time that you were for the rest of the year going to quote, pour gas on your GTM, and as well engage in a full-funnel campaign later in the year. So the question is, could you update us on that? I mean, it does seem to be in no small part corroborated by some of your internal investments that we've been able to see, for example, in your ICX team, your go-to-market positions across multiple products, strategy positions and so forth. But you've made this commitment for a substantial expansion, but do you think you need going forward to continually accelerate the pace of investments in go-to-market or do you think at some point, perhaps soon you can begin to taper that off and then leverage that capacity to revenue growth and thereby margin expansion? David Wadhwani : Jay, I think, we might have to have you join our marketing organization, given how much you know about the market dynamics. But great question. And so first and foremost, again, if we're going to talk about Express, let's take a little bit of a step back and understand the dynamics of where we are in the evolution. I think what we had talked about in Q2 was that not only do we feel like we have an incredible product now, but that product is built on a brand new platform, that has the ability to develop AI functionality as a native part of that platform. So the speed of innovation that we've been adding capabilities to Express is really been a breakneck speed and we're very excited about that. Features like native integration of Firefly, so that everything that's generated here is commercially safe, which again like I said, is important to individuals and to businesses, but doing it with more control, things like style and structure match and integrated into the image viewer, the video viewer, editor and the design surfaces. So very excited about that. In addition to those basic capabilities that are so foundational, this is really the design model that we've been talking about Firefly design model. This is where it's surfacing the most, and so you combine what we're doing with templates and design model and people are able to create and they effectively get access to an infinite number of templates, right. We believe that we're moving from a template-centric, a set of tools for communicators to an AI-centric set of tools and we feel that with our design model and everything we have, we're fundamentally going to create better content that stands out ultimately. We also have great workflows that we've developed with Photoshop and Illustrator and Acrobat. And we've integrated all of this in ways that are fundamentally effective for businesses, including bulk creation and assembly capabilities. So small businesses all the way through enterprises are able to leverage this for their designer-to-marketer workflows. In addition to all of that innovation, to your point, we've really been focused on the go-to-market since last time. Since we last spoke or right before we last spoke in Q3, we expanded the offer set significantly. We've always had Express for individuals in market, but we added Express for Teams, Express for Enterprise and we just launched Express for Education, this back-to-school year with a lot better support for classrooms and teacher student workflows as well. On the marketing side, we've been ramping that very actively. It's a net new audience to Adobe. I mean, that's something to really recognize. This isn't about shifting existing audience over solely. It's about getting access to a new audience. And so for that, we have to employ both traditional means with a focus on awareness campaign, but also leveraging social, because that's where this audience is. So, you'll see us doing a lot more on social as a result. And then on the back of all that, we're ramping our direct sales. We have a very at-scale inside sales motion that we're starting to lean into. We have a very significant direct sales motion that we have in enterprises and mid-market that we're leveraging. Adobe.com journeys, we have a lot of businesses and individuals coming on Adobe.com and doing a lot more optimization in the App Store. And that's really what you're starting to see in the numbers we shared with strong usage at 70% year-over-year. Cumulative exports, strong business momentum with over 1,500 businesses sold and really great our best back-to-school season ever with millions of students now enabled on it. So, that's the foundation. And if you're, the one thing I would say is, yes, we started pouring gas on it and we're going to pour more gas on it, not less in the months and years ahead. Shantanu Narayen : Maybe two other things, Jay, just big picture. I mean we continue to invest in all of the key long-term things, whether it's training of models, whether it's Express, whether it's AEP and apps, whether it's GenStudio, while delivering what I think are phenomenal margins. And so we'll continue to make those trade-offs in terms of growth and profitability and maybe a little tongue-in-cheek. Part of the reason why David has the ability to invest as much in marketing is he uses the best marketing technology in the world from Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : That is true. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi. Tyler Radke : Yes. Thanks very much for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about the Digital Experience side of the business. So RPO looks pretty strong in terms of sequential additions. The implied guide for Q4 was a bit lighter than consensus. I know you did talk about some unusual dynamics in terms of seasonality, Cyber Monday, but could you just talk about the strength and underlying dynamics you're seeing in the business heading into Q4? Thank you. Anil Chakravarthy : Yes. When we look at the Digital Experience business, we are pleased with the overall execution of the business. We have a big opportunity with what we call personalization at scale where whether it's a B2C company or a B2B company, the ability to deliver personalized customer experiences to consumers or to hundreds of thousands of business customers, individuals within businesses. This is important for every company in the world and we have the integrated platform and the applications to be able to help them deliver those kinds of experiences. And we have the unique ability to bring together the right content, the data, customer data and the customer journeys across our Experience Cloud and the integration with Creative Cloud to deliver those personalized experiences. And that's pretty unique to what we can do at Adobe. And that's one of the things that we are seeing in the dynamic in the enterprise market is the enterprises are scrutinizing all the deals that they want to do. I think in this case, they look at our offerings and see the ability to not only help with growth, they also look at the efficiency gains that we can help them create. And that's helping us as enterprises scrutinize the spend. And when you look at our guide, we're obviously, we are focused on, most closely on our subscription business and that's the business that continues to grow strongly and we're showing good performance on the subscription business. And our overall revenue is a combination of subscriptions and services where we really are focused on working with a broad global partner ecosystem to make sure that we deliver services to our customers and help them realize value from our offerings. Tyler Radke : Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : Hey, operator, we're at the top of the hour. We'll sneak in one more question and then wrap up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Thanks. Dan, just back to the guide. Can we just drill in? I know that you mentioned there were a couple of factors that were at contemplated. I'm just curious if there's anything else that you're seeing that is different in terms of end demand or any softness. I know the US decelerated a little bit, EMEA accelerated. Shantanu Narayen : No, Brent. I mean I think we had a strong Q3 and we continue to see the momentum in the business. And it's our typical considered targets that we do and I focus on execution. So, we're not seeing anything as it relates to a change in the business dynamics. I also mentioned that the last few weeks of Q3, as you know, the summer seasonality ends, we saw the traditional strength that we expect to see on our web traffic. So, I think, MAX is coming up. We have an exciting agenda in terms of what we are going to be talking about in terms of MAX. And so I mean if I take a step back and think about it, given this is the last question, I mean, from my perspective, strong Q3 across every aspect of our business, revenue, EPS, Digital Media ARR, DX, Subs revenue, Acrobat certainly also continued to show the strength. We have momentum in the business and the innovation roadmap, I mean, across all of the key initiatives that we've been talking about, whether that's Express, GenStudio and the excitement that people have associated with automating all of that content, AEP and Apps on the data side, imaging and video, the work that the Digital Media team has done on Photoshop and on Illustrator and then what's coming down the pike on video. And Firefly Services, I think, the AI monetization as well, which I know is a theme of a number of people that have asked, whether it's Acrobat, whether it's the Premium SKUs as it relates to Experience Cloud, whether it's what's happening on Gen Fill and the usage of Gen Fill, Lightroom and Lightroom Mobile. I think we're clearly demonstrating how AI can both drive value for our customers and therefore, we acquire new customers and retain customers better. So, yes, it feels good. We look forward to seeing all of you at MAX and we're going to just continue to focus on innovation and delighting our customers. But thank you for joining us. Jonathan Vaas : Yes. Thanks, Shantanu, and we do look forward to the Investor Event that we'll be holding in Miami at MAX on October 14th, where we will be doing a Q&A with management. We hope to see many of you there. And with that, thank you for joining the call, and this concludes the event. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

In our digital media business, we delivered record net new ARR of $578 million, and our digital experience business achieved subscription revenue of $1.27 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth. 2024 was a year of records for Adobe. We achieved record revenue of $21.51 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share was $12.36, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $18.42, representing 5% and 15% year-over-year growth, respectively. We had several new milestones with our AI innovations enabling us to add more than $2 billion in digital media net new ARR and surpass $1 billion in the ending book of business for Adobe Experience Platform and native apps. The digital experience business crossed $5 billion in revenue, making us one of the mission-critical providers of marketing technology in the world. We exited the year with $19.96 billion in RPO and cash and short-term investments of $7.89 billion. 2024 was also a transformative year of product innovation. We delivered foundational technology platforms and introduced multiple generative AI models in the Adobe Firefly family, including imaging, vector design, and most recently, the Yo. Adobe now has a comprehensive set of generative AI models designed to be commercially safe for creative content, offering unprecedented levels of output quality and user control in our applications. We reimagined creativity and productivity for a broader set of customers with Adobe Express, the quick and easy create-anything app. The deep integration of Fireflies across our flagship applications in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud is driving record customer adoption and usage. Firefly Power Generation's across our tools surpassed 16 billion, with every month this past quarter setting a new record. We enhanced document productivity with AI assistant in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, unlocking even greater value from the trillions of PDFs around the world. We've successfully scaled Adobe Experience Platform and native apps to deliver the fundamental infrastructure required for customer engagement. We're accelerating automated decisioning, empowering audiences, journeys, and channels to deliver truly personalized experiences at scale. We set the stage to drive an AI content revolution by bringing content and data together in Adobe Gen Studio, integrating high-velocity creative expression with enterprise activation. The release of Adobe Gen Studio for performance marketing integrates Creative Cloud, Express, and Experience Cloud and extends our end-to-end content supply chain solution, empowering freelancers, agencies, and enterprises to accelerate the delivery of content, advertising, and marketing campaigns. I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our digital media business. David Wadhwani : Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q4, we achieved net new digital media ARR of $578 million and revenue of $4.15 billion, which grew 12% year-over-year, fueled by innovation in both our creative and document businesses. We ended the year with just over $2 billion of net new digital media ARR for the first time ever as a result of accelerated product innovation, record traffic to adobe.com, and engagement on social and mobile, as well as increasing value for enterprise customers through Firefly Services and GenStudio. We bring together our creative and experience clouds. On the document cloud side, PDF continues to be the global standard for digital. Adobe Acrobat is revolutionizing the way people engage with them across mobile, web, and desktop. We took a major step forward in FY2024 with the introduction of AI Assistant in Acrobat and Reader. AI Assistant and other AI features like liquid mode and Firefly are accelerating productivity through faster insights, smarter document editing, and integrated image generation. A recent productivity study found that users leveraging AI Assistant completed their document-related tasks four times faster on average. AI Assistant is now available in Acrobat across desktop, web, and mobile, and integrated into our Edge, Chrome, and Microsoft Teams extensions. In Q4, we continued to extend its value with specialized AI for contracts and scanned documents, support for additional languages, and the ability to analyze larger documents. In Acrobat Web, our integrations with Adobe Express allow users to generate images and quickly stylize content. We saw AI Assistant conversations double quarter over quarter, driving deeper customer value. In Q4, we achieved document cloud revenue of $843 million, growing 17% year-over-year. We set a record for net new Document Cloud ARR of $173 million, with ending ARR of $3.48 billion, growing 23% year-over-year. Other highlights include continued growth of monthly active users, which grew over 25% year-over-year, surpassing 650 million paid and free users. Strong top-of-funnel momentum through Acrobat web with monthly active users up nearly 50% year-over-year. Strength in Acrobat Pro single app, in both Document Cloud and Creative Cloud offerings. A great back-to-school season with a new AI Assistant in education for students. Key enterprise customer wins include Abbott Laboratories, BWI GmbH, Defense Information Systems Agency, Kaiser Permanente, Novo Nordisk, Truist, UScellular, and the US Department of State. Creative Cloud also had a strong year. As demand for content continues to grow across mobile, desktop, and streaming platforms. Adobe MAX, the premier creativity conference, showcased our FY2024 innovation and drove over 0.5 billion video views across all channels. We have made major strides with our generative AI models with the introduction of Firefly image model three enhancements to our vector models, richer design models, and the all-new Firefly video model. These models are incredibly powerful on their own, and their deep integration into our tools like Lightroom, Photoshop, Premier InDesign, and Express have brought incredible value to millions of creative professionals around the world. We have brought our creative and experienced clouds together through the introduction of Firefly services in GenStudio, addressing the growing need for scaled content production in enterprises. Firefly generations continue to accelerate and have now crossed 16 billion cumulative generations. In Q4, we achieved $3.3 billion revenue, which grew 11% year-over-year. Net new Creative Cloud ARR was $405 million. Other highlights include adoption of Adobe Express by approximately 4,000 businesses in the quarter, and an 84% year-over-year increase in the number of students with access to Express Premium as part of this year's back-to-school season. Adobe Express saw strong ecosystem growth with over 180 plugins available in the Express marketplace and integrations with leading social productivity and collaboration apps like ChatGPT, Google, Slack, Wix, Box, HubSpot, and Webflow, significantly increasing our customer reach. The launch of the Fireflies video model and its unique integration in Premiere Pro unlimited public beta garnered massive customer interest, and we look forward to making it more broadly available in early 2025. This feature drove a 70% increase in the number of Premiere Pro beta users. Enhancements to Firefly image vector and design models include four times faster image generation and new capabilities integrated into Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Adobe Express. Strong adoption of Lightroom mobile with customers embracing innovations like generative remove and lens blur, as well as quick actions, which streamline editing and increase discovery and adoption of premium features. Just this morning, Adobe Lightroom was recognized as the Mac app of the year in Apple's annual App Store Awards. The launch of the new Frame.io v4 streamlines creative management for video projects, enabling end-to-end editing capabilities and seamless collaboration between editors and their stakeholders. Firefly services adoption continued to ramp as enterprises such as Pepsi and Tapestry use it to scale content production given the robust APIs and ease of creating custom models that are designed to be commercially safe. Key enterprise customer wins include Alphabet, American Express, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, LVMH, Nestle, Procter & Gamble, T-Mobile, and the US Department of Defense. Our AI product releases and business evolution in FY2024 have set the stage for another strong year ahead as we expand to new audiences, deliver more value to existing users, and increasingly integrate our digital media and digital experience clouds to create differentiated business solutions. We will do this by accelerating the adoption of freemium offers, including Express, Lightroom, and Acrobat on web and mobile, as well as expanding access to Acrobat AI Assistant delivered strong financial performance in FY2024. Growing our core creative business by continuing to expand our AI innovations in our flagship applications as well as bringing them to web and mobile. In addition, we will soon introduce a new higher-priced Fireflies offering that includes our video models as a comprehensive AI solution for creative professionals. This will allow us to monetize new users, provide additional value to existing customers, and increase ARPU. And further accelerating Fireflies services, which saw significant demand in FY2024, integrating it into GenStudio to provide enterprises with solutions to exponentially scale their content production capabilities with AI. We're thrilled with the response to our innovations in FY2024, excited to release new capabilities, and look forward to delighting customers in the year ahead. I'll now pass it to Anil. Anil Chakravarthy : Thanks, David. Hello, everyone.

With the availability of our new offerings in FY2025, Adobe has a unique opportunity to capitalize on the breadth of these solutions to further optimize our integrated go-to-market field organization. We're expanding our enterprise go-to-market teams to sell these integrated solutions that cut across digital media and digital experience globally under the new Gen Studio umbrella. We've seen early success for this strategy that included Express and Firefly services in Q4. As we enable our worldwide field organization in Q1, we anticipate acceleration of this pipeline throughout the rest of the year and beyond. We are confident of continuing our leadership and momentum into 2025. I will now pass it to Dan. Dan Durn : Thanks, Anil. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and FY2024 results, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. We are proud of the performance we have driven in FY2024, delivering record revenue, EPS, and operating cash flows while aggressively investing in AI product innovation. New AI releases, including Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly services, DX premium tiers, and Gen Studio for performance marketing, have expanded the portfolio of products, driving proliferation and meaningful Gen AI monetization. We had a strong finish to the year, with records in digital media net new ARR and digital experience bookings. In FY2024, Adobe achieved record revenue of $21.51 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. GAAP EPS for the year was $12.36, and non-GAAP EPS was $18.42, growing 5% and 15% year-over-year, respectively.

GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $3.79, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a record $4.81, growing 17% and 13% year-over-year, respectively. Q4 business and financial highlights included digital media revenue of $4.15 billion, net new digital media ARR of $578 million, digital experience revenue of $1.40 billion, cash flows from operations of $2.92 billion, and added $1.82 billion to RPO in the quarter. In our digital media segment, we achieved Q4 revenue of $4.15 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $17.33 billion of digital media ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 13% year-over-year in constant currency. Adobe achieved document cloud revenue of $843 million, which represents 17% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. In the quarter, we added $173 million of net new Document Cloud ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 23% year-over-year in constant currency. Fourth quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included strong growth across Reader and Acrobat on web and mobile, and extensions such as Edge and Chrome, Acrobat subscription demand across all customer segments, routes to market, and geographies. Accelerated adoption and monetization of AI Assistant driven by product enhancements and delivery of French and German language support. And year-end seasonal strength in the enterprise. We achieved creative revenue of $3.30 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 11% in constant currency. In the quarter, we added $405 million of net new creative ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 11% year-over-year in constant currency. Fourth quarter Creative Cloud growth drivers included strong demand for new subscriptions for Creative Cloud all apps, across individuals, teams, enterprise, and education. Strength and Creative Cloud single latch for Acrobat Pro, Lightroom, and Photoshop. Momentum with new subscriptions in emerging markets, demand for Adobe Express across education, SMB, and enterprises. And adoption of Firefly services in the enterprise. Turning to our digital experience segment. In Q4, we achieved revenue of $1.40 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $1.27 billion, growing 13% year-over-year, or 12% in constant currency. Fourth quarter digital experience growth drivers included a strong finish to the year with the largest ever bookings quarter, and robust performance across geographies, including the US and EMEA, and multiple verticals, including financial services. Strong subscription revenue growth led by Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Journey Optimizer, real-time customer data platform, customer journey analytics, and work front. Continued strength in retention and expansion across our enterprise customers with digital experience solutions being leveraged by 85 of the Fortune 100 companies. Momentum with AEP and native apps, with FY2024 ending book of business surpassing $1.0 billion and growing greater than 40% year-over-year. And strong bookings for our Umbrella Gen Studio solution with interest and momentum for our new Gen Studio for performance marketing offering. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q4 was 15.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. RPO exiting the quarter was $19.96 billion, growing 16% and CRPO growing third percent year-over-year as reported. Our cash flows from operations in the quarter were $2.92 billion, and ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $7.89 billion. In Q4, we entered into a $2.5 billion share repurchase agreement, and we currently have $17.65 billion remaining of our $25 billion authorization granted in March 2024. Now turning to our FY2025 financial target. We measure ARR on a constant currency basis during the fiscal year and revalue ending ARR at year-end. FX rate changes between the end of FY2023 and the end of FY2024 have resulted in a $117 million decrease to the digital media ARR balance entering FY2025, from $17.33 to $17.22 billion, and is reflected in our investor data. We expect an approximate $200 million headwind to FY2025 revenue as a result of the effect of foreign exchange, and a smaller impact of the continued move to subscriptions from perpetual offerings. Factored into our financial targets is an ongoing strategy to introduce new tiered subscription offerings and add-ons. For FY2025, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $23.30 to $23.55 billion. Digital Media segment revenue of $17.25 to $17.40 billion. Digital media ending ARR book of business growth of 11.0% year-over-year. Digital Experience segment revenue of $5.80 to $5.90 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $5.375 to $5.425 billion. GAAP earnings per share of $15.80 to $16.10. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $20.20 to $20.50. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 46% and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5%. For Q1, fiscal 2025, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $5.63 to $5.68 billion. Digital media segment revenue of $4.17 to $4.20 billion, digital experience segment revenue of $1.38 to $1.40 billion, Digital Experience subscription revenue of $1.27 to $1.29 billion. GAAP earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.90. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.95 to $5.00. For Q1, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 47% and non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5%. In summary, I'm proud of our outstanding performance, which combines robust product leadership, velocity of innovation, and financial discipline, positioning us to achieve strong revenue and EPS growth in the year ahead. Shantanu, back to you. Shantanu Narayen : Thanks, Dan. This quarter, Adobe was once again recognized for our exceptional culture and leadership, including on Forbes' World's Best Employers, Fortune's 50 AI Innovators, and Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology in the Wall Street Journal's Best Managed Companies list. At MAX, we announced a new global initiative aimed at helping 30 million next-generation learners develop AI literacy, content creation, and digital marketing skills, using Adobe Express to thrive in the modern workforce. Working with education partners in schools, nonprofits, and online learning platforms to provide training, certifications, and career pathways.

Adobe continues to build on its strong foundation of transformative innovation, category and brand leadership, financial performance, and profitable growth. We're delivering Adobe Magic to an expanding set of global customers and executing on the massive market opportunity ahead. Adobe couldn't be better positioned for 2025 and beyond. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator, Operator : Thank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press star one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're joined today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that is star one if you would like to signal with questions. And the first question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Again, Kash, if you could press star one on your touch-tone telephone. Again, star one on your touch-tone telephone. We'll go next to Michael Turn with Wells Fargo. Michael Turn : Hey. Thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the question. David, you mentioned in your prepared remarks a few things focusing on expanding innovations, including newer higher-priced Fireflies offerings and actually accelerating Firefly by integrating further into Gen Studio. I was hoping you could just maybe expand on how you're thinking about the adoption curve of those efforts. And as a second part, Dan, if you can just add any commentary on how you're incorporating some of these newer efforts into the forecast if there's conservatism just given they're newer or just how to think about that, also useful. Thank you. David Wadhwani : Sure. Yeah. I'll go ahead and get started. So AI obviously has been a huge area of focus for us, and, frankly, our community has been using it at amazing rates. So we're very excited you heard that 16 billion generations that we talked about in the prepared remarks. And that's really a function of the investments we've made in creating the broadest set of models. We've talked about imaging vector design in the past. We now have video and audio in beta form as well. And the foundational difference between what we do and what everyone else does in the market really comes down to three things. One is commercially safe, the way we train the models. Two is the incredible control we bake into the model. Three is the integration that we make with these models into our products. Increasingly, of course, CC flagship applications, but also in Express and Lightroom and these kinds of applications, but also in Anil's DX products as well. So that set of things is a critical part of the foundation and an adorable differentiator for us as we go forward. Now as we introduce the video model, which we expect to have in market early next year, that's going to create an opportunity to further tier our creative cloud offerings. As you surely understand, video generation is a much higher value activity than image generation. And as a result, it gives us the ability to start to tier creative cloud more actively there. In addition to that, we introduced this year, we introduced Fireflies services. That's been off to a great start. We have a lot of customers that are using that. A couple we talked about on the call include Tapestry. They're using it for scaled content production. Pepsi, for their Gatorade brand, is enabling their customers to personalize any merchandise that they are buying, in particular, starting with Gatorade bottles. And these have been very, very productive for them, and we are seeing this leveraged by a host of other companies for everything from localization at scale to personalization at scale to user engagement or just raw content production at scale as well. And then last, not to get missed in all of this, is everything we're doing with AI Assistant. AI Assistant for Acrobat is off to an incredibly strong start. And we see it continuing to accelerate. So all of this has built a great foundation for us in FY2024. It's given us a lot of signal from our customer base, and it's really we've learned a lot that we intend to apply as we optimize the value and, you know, the tiering for our customers going forward. Dan Durn : Yeah. And just building on David's comments as it relates to the FY2025 guide, we talk about all of the great innovation that's in flight. I would say the velocity of innovation is greater today than it's ever been. We called out products like Express, AI Assistant, Firefly, premium tiers in DX, Gen Studio. The good thing is they're meaningful contributors today to the financial performance and extrapolating the momentum that we see in those products, taking a point of view on the future pipeline of innovation, how we bring that to life, deeply natively integrated into our products and further extend the value we offer to customers as well as the additional segments we can access. All of this comes together to take a perspective of what 2025 looks like based on the strong start that we have and the meaningful contribution in FY2024. Michael Turn : Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe to the point that you just alluded to in terms of AI being meaningful as part of the broader roadmap for business. Can you maybe talk about how you're thinking about the growth driver from Fireflies from Gen Studio and when kind of how will we see that percolate through the year in terms of the net new digital media ARR? Is that something that you think is more going to be showing up in the DX business? It'd be great to get some color there. And then anything, Dan, that we should think through given the new guidance methodology around seasonality, linearity, for the digital media business. David Wadhwani : Sure. I'm happy to take that. So first of all, yeah, as we mentioned, we're really excited about the FY2024 momentum that we're seeing that we're carrying into it. And you know, we've had this conversation in the past around, you know, how we about the growth algorithm for the digital media business. So maybe let me reiterate a little bit of that. We've talked about this in the context of p times q plus v in the past. You know, where p is new users bringing in more people into the franchise. We're continuing to do that. Obviously, with the introduction of Express, we're seeing a lot of great growth there, whether it's through our phones channel reaching out to SMB, whether it's reaching out to the mid-market or whether it's working more closely with Anil and the DX business and the integrations we have between Express and the DX business reaching into large companies. We're doing a lot in terms of proliferation of Express into education. We've done a number of partnerships that we talked about with Box, ChatGPT, HubSpot, and others, but also our own products like Acrobat Workflows, from Acrobat and Reader into Express. So really pushing to drive more new customers into the franchise in addition to the continued growth that we're getting in our core creative products. Second, in terms of the core creative products, this is where the queue, the price actually increases with core value because when we're introducing Firefly models into the mix, we get the opportunity to integrate them more into the flagship applications. And as I mentioned earlier with the Fireflies web application, we have the opportunity to create more tiers across the creative products so that we can get people in the right plan for their needs. And we're very bullish about video and the breadth of our customer base that are going to need access to these video models. Again, remember, they're integrated deeply into our applications, including Premiere. We're very excited about what that could mean for us. And then lastly, the business value for customers and enterprise or corporate, that's where the value-based selling that we do along with the digital experience business really plays out. Firefly Services, as I mentioned, with Gatorade, Tapestry, and a whole host of others that have come. Everyone in this space is driving towards personalization of that content, and they absolutely need a scaled production and automation pipeline to generate more content. And that's where Firefly services does. And as it has hit this level of escape velocity, and in particular, Gen Studio so that it becomes a more holistic solution as we go into FY2025 and accelerate that. And that's, you know, Alex, that's what's leading to the guide of 11%. If you really take a step back, that's one of the best guides we've given in terms of, you know, next year ARR growth. But one thing maybe to keep in mind is the composition of growth is going to be a little different next year compared to FY2024. Again, the growth algorithm is new users, new products, and value and pricing. New users and new products will be a more significant part of the mix as we go into FY2025. And we look forward to sort of that foundational base of the business growing and driving the business. Dan Durn : And then just to build on that, Alex, and I appreciate the question around the shape of FY2025. Here's what I'll share about it. We all know we changed the guidance methodology into 2025. The guide around the ending ARR book to business growth. We just have a strong point of view. It's a better indicator of business health trajectory. David talked about the growth algorithm, the growth agenda at the company, new subscribers, is the predominant driver of growth. Has been continues to be. The second leg Cross sell. Upsell. This is something the company is trying to really great skill at over time. Once we bring people into the Adobe ecosystem to journey them through the rich set of technologies and products that we have to bring them deeper into the ecosystem, that's an important element. And then lastly, you know, David mentioned pricing. This is about how we segment the product portfolio, the value, that we deliver to our customers. So as we think about the innovation, as we think about the growth algorithm, and as we think about increasingly monetizing the rich set of innovation that we've already brought to market, as well as in the pipeline to be brought to market. Quarterly profile, we view it as less important. Really wanna focus on revenue, and EPS. Focus, on the annual book of business growth. We think that's the most important way to look at the business. It's also how we as the management team run the business. Alex Zukin : Understood. Thank you, guys. Operator : And the next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Yeah. Thanks very much. David, I was wondering if I could just follow-up on your last comment on sort of obviously driving new users, new adoptions, you know, incredibly important. I just is there pricing sensitivity, meaning you're delivering so much value. I think that pricing given the value you're delivering, would be a bigger lever. You know, unless there's pricing sensitivity. Could you just walk through that a little bit more? Because it feels like you should be able to get sort of all three vectors going at the same time, whereas I know you're gonna focus more on bringing people in and making them successful. But I'm sort of I guess, is there something else on the pricing side that I'm missing why you're not getting that as well? Thanks. David Wadhwani : Yeah. And we've talked about this in the context of proliferation versus short-term monetization and how we have to balance both of those, and that's something that we take very seriously and we look at that. If you look at the lower end of the market as we have entered with Express and Lightroom Acrobat. And by the way, this the web and mobile motion for us has been productive in bringing in a lot more new users. And so you'll expect to see us do more of that and introduce more products in that segment. In FY2025 as well. And there is certainly price sensitivity at that side of the market. When it comes to both premium users and also converted to paid users. We'll continue to enable that. When it comes to the core business, and this is the business of creative professionals, we are very focused on introducing new value that is going to create more segmentation and more tiering and, you know, get aligned value and pricing to what we are delivering there. So we do see a tremendous amount of opportunity there going forward. Because the value that we bring and the efficiency we bring to the content creation process there is very significant. Again, and then last and certainly not least, as we talked about in core enterprises, that's where we've been able to sort of cross that chasm from p times q business over to a value sale business, and we are able to start to get more automation and workflows in place there as well. So it's a mix of these things. You know, we are gonna continue to balance. We are obviously tracking, and we believe that proliferation as we've said, you know, for some time maintains is one of the top priorities because we know that if people start using our products today, we have the opportunity to continue to deliver value two for a long time to come. And so that balance is what we try to do, and it's a management judgment call, but we think we're getting it right. Kirk Materne : I guess a quick follow-up for Dan. Dan, obviously, Black Monday fell into your first quarter, this current year. Any color you can offer in terms of what that meant, if at all, to create a cloud net new ARR this quarter? Dan Durn : Yeah. The Black Friday, Cyber Monday played out about as expected. You know, we've been talking about a multiyear trend where commercial activity shifting left in terms of timing. We run our promotions over a larger window of time to reflect consumer behavior, and we see similar pattern commercially from our customers this year. That we've seen in prior years. If we think about online shopping this year, up 8.4%. You can see last year, that's up from 4.8%. So a nice step up this year versus last year. But you can see Cyber Monday from a contribution standpoint. Even though the growth last year was down relative to this year, Cyber Monday grew at 9.6%, this year at 7.3%. Just illustrates the flattening of the profiling consumer behavior around that. So you know, performance as expected. Kirk Materne : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. A lot of excitement from you guys on the conference call about the pace of innovation going on in the business. And we hear excitement from creative professionals, and they talk about an acceleration in the pace of innovation. But apologies to state the obvious, but investors aren't feeling that excitement or aren't showing that excitement. Stock is a major underperformer on a year-to-date basis. Down again on an after-hours basis today. And I would point to it's the lack of acceleration that we're seeing in their numbers. Right? Digital media net new ARR this quarter grew just organically, grew 2%. You're guiding to decelerating growth into the forward year despite all this innovation. And I think the question that it brings up in investors' mind is there some leak in the bucket. Right? All this innovation, new monetization avenues, pricing going up, but the growth is going in the wrong direction. Like, is there a part of the equation that's not working? Is there share losses? Is there something that we're not seeing that is taking away that momentum in the numbers that's not it? We're not seeing the acceleration in the numbers if you will. Shantanu Narayen : Okay. So maybe I'll talk about I mean, if you take a step back and think about the year, and I'll certainly address the feedback that you're sharing. From our perspective, you know, when we guided at the beginning of the year, when we reguided then in the middle of the year to $19.50 and then when we guided in Q3. I mean, the reality is we beat all those three targets that we had issued, beginning of the year, middle of the year, and end of the year. I think specifically maybe as it relates to the Q4 digital media net new ARR and thinking about it from the creative, the one thing that I'll point out there is that, actually, creative did better than probably is evident in that if you think about the contribution of Acrobat that went into the creative bucket. Versus the document cloud business. So certainly, Acrobat continues to do well. Record, as you saw, but the non-Acrobat contribution in creative actually had more growth. Than what you would see if you just look at it from a Creative Cloud ARR. I think to your bigger question about what's happening in the business, and as we think about it, you know, at the scale of the business right now, certainly, as this entire world moves towards generative AI, as David said, we're executing on both the proliferation play at the bottom with Express and Acrobat. And at the high end, with the Creative Pro and with the enterprise, we are seeing significant adoption of that. And I think Gen Studio will also be a good unlock because Gen Studio actually brings this all together in the enterprise in a way that nobody else can. And so when we think about Firefly services, you think about the custom models, you think about the ability to move all of that into campaigns at pace, we are seeing significant traction in that particular space. So you know, the business is going through a change as it relates to the lower end. But for the core creative as well as for the enterprise, it's actually, you know, headed absolutely in line with our expectations. With good acceleration. And on the consumer communicator space, I think the traction that we're seeing with Express on proliferation also gives us a lot of optimism for how that part of the business is also doing well. And so, you know, we take our target seriously. It's the beginning of the year. We wanna go keep executing and innovating on it. To the point that I think you as well as others have asked, is there, you know, opportunity in the growth agenda, not just to think about the innovation and the offerings, but to make sure that as we tier these, that the pricing and the value is appropriate, absolutely. And, you know, I think you'll continue to see us. I think David mentioned that in his prepared remarks as well as Dan did. That you'll see us also have new tiered offerings. That reflect that value that we're providing. To the creative pro as well as to the business segment. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thanks for the feedback. Operator : And moving on to Keith Bachman with BMO. Keith Bachman : Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask David to you if I could on Doc Cloud specifically. Growth was certainly strong this quarter. And I just wanted to understand some of the context associated with durability. And if you could break it into some of the parts, it looks like your monthly active users, it continues to grow well. And in addition to that, how are you thinking about leveraging the value there in terms of price, specifically within the growth of Doc Cloud. And again, the broader question is just on the durability of Doc Cloud grew 23% over the course of the quarter in terms of ARR, trying to understand how durable it is and what the pieces are, and then I have a follow-up. David Wadhwani : Yeah. I think Document Cloud has been, you know, if you think about the fact that we're 40 years into this business, it's really just the foundation is the fact that PDF has become the de facto standard for unstructured data. The world. And Adobe and Acrobat are the most trusted providers of solutions for that, and that's really what is the foundation of what is driving the business, including the fact that it's the most secure platform for leveraging and accessing the content. I think what is there are two things that are really the growth drivers of this business or a number of things. First is exactly like you said. I mean, monthly active users and free and paid is a key stat that we keep looking at. You know, we are very effective at picking free users of Reader and converting them to paid users of Acrobat. And we continue to do that across more surfaces that used to be predominantly a focus on desktop applications. As we've noted in the past, we now have edge integrations, Chrome integrations. We're also available in Teams. We're also available on mobile devices for, you know, iOS and Android. And the mix of all those continue to grow on a monthly basis. Of the things that we are doing to drive that growth is helping people see the value of sharing a link to the PDF as opposed to sharing the document itself, that in doing so, you get a lot more control in terms of the conversation and feedback and review around that. But it also drives the fact that the recipient is then guaranteed to be viewing the PDF in an Adobe surface that we can then use to close that viral loop and drive, you know, further top of funnel opportunity to convert. So that foundation is very strong. In addition to that, AI Assistant has been really a phenomenal ad, you know, unlike many other players in the space, we don't require significant, you know, security and governance reviews because people can have conversations around the documents that they view. And one of the big things that I think has been unlocked this year is moving not just by looking at a PDF that you happen to be viewing, but being to look at and have a conversation with multiple documents, some of which don't even have to be PDF. So that transition and that, you know, gives us the ability to really take Acrobat and make it more of a general-purpose productivity platform. And that's really what drove the adoption that we saw in education this year. So another way of saying that the core foundation of Acrobat continues to be strong and is actually getting stronger with the MAO increasing. But the new value we're adding with AI Assistant takes Acrobat to an entire new level in terms of value. Shantanu Narayen : Maybe the thing I'll add to that is the durability of that to your point in languages as we roll that out in languages. As we roll it out across multiple documents, and as we roll it out in enterprises and B2B specifically. So again, significant headroom in terms of the innovation agenda of how Acrobat can be made even more meaningful as a knowledge tool within the enterprise. Keith Bachman : Okay. It just sort of leads into my follow-up question if I could sneak it in as we've talked about during the course of this call tonight the various drivers of growth for ARR. And I just wanted to specifically ask about consumption as we think about FY2025 and the question is, is that gonna be a contributor towards ARR growth, or should investors really be thinking about trying to match my seats, if you will, and really shouldn't it be about consumption being additive growth in 2025. That's it for me. Thank you. Shantanu Narayen : I think, Keith, you're gonna see, quote-unquote, consumption, add to ARR, in two or maybe three ways more so in 2025 than in 2024. The first, and David alluded to this, is if you have a video offering and that video offering that will be a pure consumption, you know, pricing associated with it. I think the second is in Gen Studio and for enterprises. And what they are seeing with respect to Firefly services, which again, I think David touched on, you know, how much momentum we're seeing in that business. So that is in effect a consumption business as it relates to the enterprise. So, you know, I think that will also continue to increase. And then I think you'll see us with perhaps, you know, more premium price offering. So the intention is that consumption is what's driving the increased ARR, but it may be as a result of tier in the pricing rather than a consumption model where people actually have to monitor it. So it's just another way much like AI assistance is of monetizing it. It's not like we're gonna be tracking every single generation for the user. It'll just be at a different tier. And we think that that's both a better way to deliver value as well as to get the monetization. Operator : And moving on to Brad Zelnick with Bank of America. Brad Zelnick : Okay. Wonderful. Thank you. I'll ask a question, David, of you, please. You in the past, you've provided some good color. It sounds like there's momentum there. It seems like this would be the year with all the Firefly services integration into the core franchises. We could see some acceleration and conversion of that funnel. So we'd love to get some update from you on that effort and how you see that unfolding throughout the year. Thank you. David Wadhwani : For a second, you actually cut out. And so you said Firefly. We heard that. Did you mention any other product before we answer that question, Brad, just to make sure we capture your question? Brad Zelnick : Really just Firefly services across all the franchises, you know, Photoshop, Lightroom, etcetera. You know, what could that integration effort do to the conversion activity with the top of funnel? David Wadhwani : Yeah. So a number of So first of all, you're exactly right in terms of, you know, Firefly is a platform and a foundation that we're leveraging across many different products. As we talked about, everything from Express and Lightroom and even in Acrobat on mobile, for our broad base, but then also in our core creative products. Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and, you know, as we've alluded to a number of times on this call with the introduction of video, even a standalone offer, for Firefly that we think will be, you know, more valuable from a tiering perspective there. And then into Firefly services through APIs and connection to Gen Studio. So we are looking at leveraging the power of this AI foundation in all the activities. As it relates to top of funnel and conversion, we're very excited. Let's start with new users and more closer to the low end of the market. We're very excited with the signal we're getting from Express and Lightroom on mobile and web. Again, you know, as we've talked about Express is seeing some really good new user acquisition. We added 4,000 new businesses this year. We increased education, you know, access by 84% this back to school versus last back to school. We're seeing, you know, really strong adaption through social, digital, mobile traffic as well. So we see that when we invest in mobile and web, we are getting some very positive signals. In terms of user adoption and user conversion rates. So we're using Firefly very actively to do that. And by the way, the fact that Firefly continues to be the only commercially safe, you know, model integrated into these apps does matter when it comes to, as I said, adding 4,000 new businesses. The second thing is we are seeing in the core creative business, when people try something like Photoshop, the onboarding experience is faster to success because of the use of generative AI and generative capabilities. So you'll start to see us continuing to drive more proliferation of those capabilities earlier in the user journeys, and that has been proven very productive. But we also noticed that more people use generative AI, again, we've always had good retention rates, but the more people use AI, the longer they retain as well. And so we are definitely leveraging generative AI for that entire flow in the funnel. Operator : And as we're past the top of the hour, I just have time for one more question. Thank you. Operator : And that question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer : Thank you. Good evening. Dan, you noted that your current RPO was up 13% in the quarter. Which results in a 10% three-year CAGR for current RPO. Would you expect that over time or at least in fiscal 2025, that your current RPO growth be closer to what you just reported for Q4 or might revert more to the lower three-year CAGR? And then for David, if I could, just since there were so many mentions of tiered offerings, is the concept there more around functionality at the product level as compared to the olden days of tiering that was more about segmentation and packaging, as in the old CS days or is it more currently around the functionality that you're offering on a product-by-product basis? Dan Durn : Yeah. Thanks, Jay. And what I definitely don't wanna do is get into guiding of CRPO. But when I take a step back and think about the rhythm and flow of the business, what we're seeing on the enterprise side, winning large transformational deals, exiting the year with the largest bookings quarter ever, having premium tiers in that product portfolio momentum around AEP and apps continuing to grow at scale, when we think about content supply chain and bringing cross-cloud opportunities together that really get at meaningful pain points of customers over time. And then we think about the innovation that we're driving through the digital media business, I feel really good about our ability to continue to drive the business going forward, and I'm very encouraged by what I see. David Wadhwani : Yeah. And then just adding on briefly to the question on tiering. Yeah, Jay. It's if you think about what we've done over the last year, there's been a bit of experimentation. Obviously, a the generative credits model. What we saw with Acrobat was this idea of, you know, it's a separate package and separate SKU that created a tier. That people were able to access the feature through. And as we learn from all of these, we think, as Shantanu had mentioned earlier, that the right tiering model for us is gonna be a combination of feature, access to certain features, and usage limits on it. So the higher the tier, the more features you get and the more usage you get of it. Shantanu Narayen : And since that was the last question, let me again maybe in quick summary just talk about first, you know, we had a strong 2024. But I think that really sets us up even better for a strong 2025. Given the innovation that we've had, I think as it relates to all three businesses that we have, the Creative Cloud with everything that we've done around AI, we have a lot of momentum going into the business and a really great diverse portfolio in terms of both the customers as well as our offerings. Acrobat continues to perform really well with AI Assistant as we bring it to other languages, get more vertical, use cases for that particular solution and extend it beyond a single document, we continue to think that the Document Cloud has significant opportunity ahead of us. And I think bringing that all together with digital experience, Q4 was really an extremely strong quarter as it related to us bringing all these solutions together in Gen Studio. I think much like we did with AEP and apps and data and have driven that to a billion-dollar business. I feel just the same amount of excitement with what we can do with content and AI and how we can accelerate the creation of that all the way from ideation to the multiple variation that's required. So we look forward to sharing more with you. At the end of our Q1, but in the interim, thank you for joining us. And happy holidays. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation today.",
