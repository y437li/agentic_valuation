Meaney - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Analysts : George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Josh James - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q1 2014 Earnings Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Melissa Marsden. You may begin your conference. Melissa Marsden : Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights of the quarter and strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As is our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can be found at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. Before I turn the call over to Bill Meaney, I would like to add that, on February 28, we stated that we were in discussions with the IRS on a number of our PLR requests and we did not intend to provide additional interim updates with respect to any of the specific PLR requests, or generally, our progression through the IRS's PLR process. Accordingly, we will not be discussing the status of our PLR request on today's call. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William L. Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. I would like to thank those of you who attended our investor conference last month. We very much appreciate the opportunity to present our strategy for future growth and to demonstrate the durability in low volatility, which have become a hallmark of Iron Mountain. Before I discuss our results for the quarter, I want to knowledge that many, if not all, of you who are looking for an update with respect to our conversion to a REIT. As Melissa just said in our forward-looking statements, we will not be discussing the status of our PLR request on today's call. Turning now to the performance of our business. Total revenue for the quarter was $770 million, up 4.7% on a constant dollar basis with adjusted OIBDA of $229 million and adjusted EPS of $0.26 per share, all of which were in line with our expectations. We maintained our high enterprise adjusted OIBDA margins of roughly 30% during the quarter with consistent performance in our North American segments and international margins coming in slightly ahead of our targeted level of about 25%. In addition, we achieved solid operating results as we advanced our strategic plan to sustain the durability of our high-return business in developed markets, expand into high-growth emerging markets and invest in emerging business opportunities, the most advanced of which is our data center business. Storage rental revenue, the key economic driver of our business, was up 5.3% in constant dollars, reflecting strong growth of nearly 13% in our international business and constant dollar growth of roughly 3% in both North American Records and Information Management or RIM and North America Data Management or DM. This breakout for North America is consistent with the way we manage our business and is reflected in our new segment disclosure, which I discussed during our Investor Day. Rod will have more detail on our segmented results shortly. Total storage rental internal growth was 1.4% for the first quarter. North America RIM internal growth was impacted by a mix shift to slightly lower average pricing on some contract renewals, which were biased towards a mix of enterprise customers. These contract renewals have led to better retention rates and we have seen North America RIM volume up approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the end of Q4 on an internal basis. As we noted at our recent event, there are several elements to driving storage growth in our developed markets. It is a mix of organic volume growth from existing customers; sales from new customers, including those that were previously un-vended; and some fold-in M&A at the right price with solid returns. And on top of that, you have price. We continue to analyze optimum pricing across our customer base and that sometimes means taking some deliberate price dilution to win long-term volume and/or sustain the durability of our customer relationships. All this being said, we continue to be able to invest in our customer relationships and product development through ongoing productivity enhancements. We maintained our North American RIM margins with a 37.5% margin versus 37% last year through continuous improvement initiatives, which we undertake to yield both real productivity gains and to modify our cost base as the business becomes more archival for certain segments. Our financial and operating results were further enhanced by the successful integration of acquisitions completed in 2013. Acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy. They enable us to achieve leadership positions in emerging markets and leverage our unparalleled platform of people, properties and services in developed markets. As always, our acquisition strategy is guided by our capital allocation approach through which we must exceed our cost of capital and achieve targeted returns in excess of our hurdle rates. Moreover, we always undertake acquisitions with a view how an investment can further both our market leadership, as well as the continued durability of our business. We've been actively executing against our deal pipeline since the beginning of the year, completing 5 international transactions representing $60 million of total consideration and another $5 million of tuck-in acquisitions in the U.S. In developed markets, our leading platform allows us to quickly and accretively integrate acquisitions and achieve targeted returns. These tuck-in acquisitions have very attractive fold-in economics with ROIC of 10% plus or roughly mid-teens equity returns. Internationally, we closed 3 deals in Turkey and Poland. Both are emerging market transactions with attractive growth characteristics where we have achieved or are developing market leadership positions. Constant dollar storage rental growth from emerging markets was 32% in the first quarter with an internal storage rental growth of 13%. As we recently highlighted, we have a strong pipeline of additional opportunities in emerging markets, representing more than 3x the level needed to achieve our goal of generating an incremental $100 million to $120 million in revenue from emerging market acquisitions by the end of 2016. Combined with 10% plus compounded annual growth in revenue from our existing base, we believe we can grow this portion of our business to 16% of total revenues by the end of 2016 from 11.6% of total constant dollar revenues today and from a previous base of 10% less than a year ago. With regard to emerging businesses. We are on track with bringing our first data center near Boston online by the end of the second quarter. We invested an additional $6 million in the first quarter to complete the first phase of the construction and we are pleased with the interest we are seeing. Since applying a focus on the business a year ago, we have seen all of the existing customers in our underground data center in Pennsylvania increase their custom with us by 10% to 15%, in line with industry averages. We completed our first foray into the colo market in the underground last December, and we have already contracted for 30% of the space with a pipeline equal to approximately 10x the remaining space available. Additionally, we are seeing more deals and larger deals in our pipeline. For the first phase of our 3-phase, 6-megawatt campus near Boston, we have strong customer interest with a pipeline of about 3x our initial capacity there. We are still in the early stages of developing this business, but we are pleased with what we're seeing in terms of interest and expect to achieve attractive returns on investment. We continue to monitor our progress and invest capital in a success-based manner. As we look forward to the remainder of 2014, we anticipate continued solid constant dollar revenue, storage rental revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth in line with the long-term goals we've discussed in the past. We expect consistent trends for durable storage rental revenue in developed markets and a moderation in the rate of service revenue declines. In our emerging markets, we are maintaining and modestly improving our profitability even as we add to our emerging market base. We are on track to make this segment, which achieves low double-digit internal storage growth rates, a more significant portion of our overall sales mix. Moreover, in our emerging business area, we continue to identify and test opportunities, which are near adjacencies to our core business and resonate with our customers. Overall, it was a solid quarter anchored by further progress on our strategic plan. We believe we are on track to deliver against our 2014 goals, as well as our longer-term objectives. As a reminder, those are to : first, deliver total shareholder returns in the range of 8% to 9% in line with the S&P 500, provide predictable earnings and dividend growth with low volatility and nurture our ability to generate potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities. On a final note, whilst we are not providing any PLR updates, as we have said and reiterated at our Investor Day, we believe we fit well as a REIT due to our sizable real estate portfolio and attractive characteristics such as a high net operating income per square foot, low turnover costs and high customer quality and retention. The REIT structure also complements our strategy whilst enhancing payouts to our stockholders and highlights our highly disciplined approach around asset allocation. As a REIT, we would continue to generate the cash flow necessary to sustain the durability of the business and support attractive stockholder returns in line with our long-term strategic plan. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod. Roderick Day : Thanks, Bill. Let's now turn to Slide 3, which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid results in Q1, which were supported by strong constant dollar storage rental growth, good profit performance and the benefits from recent acquisitions in emerging and developed markets. As Bill stated, storage rental growth grew 5.3% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter. This was supported by 3.0% and 2.8% growth in the North American Records and Information Management and Data Management segments, respectively, as well as 12.7% growth in the International segment. Adjusted OIBDA was in line with expectations in Q1. Included in our first quarter adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS is $2.4 million of restructuring charges, as well as $3.5 million in charges for the insurance deductible associated with the recent fire in one of our facilities in Argentina. We expect to incur an additional $3.3 million in the remainder of 2014 in connection with the organizational realignment. Our Q1 '14 CapEx of $47 million, excluding real estate and REIT costs, was in line with our expectations. Free cash flow of negative $20 million was primarily driven by higher cash interest expense, the payment for restructuring charges accrued at the year end, as well as the timing of payables. Looking at the free cash flow on a rolling 12-month basis, this was $320 million, in line with our projections. At this time, we are not making any changes to our guidance. Although 2014 full year results will be boosted by recent acquisitions, this increase to revenue will be partially offset by the FX losses based on current rates. In addition, there is some volatility relating to costs in Argentina, but at this time, our best view is these fall within the range of our guidance. Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. As we discussed previously, during this quarter, we amended our reporting structure to align the way we manage the business. We changed the composition of our North American segment to the following 3 operating segments : first, North American Records and Information Management or RIM; second, the North American Data Management or DM; and finally, the emerging businesses. Emerging businesses are currently a component of the corporate and other segment. As we break down the numbers, Q1 operating results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. Enterprise revenues grew 4.7% on a constant dollar basis as our International segment continued to produce strong results. Indeed, International posted 12.8% constant dollar total revenue growth helped by benefits from our recent acquisitions in emerging and developed markets. North American RIM posted 2.7% constant dollar total revenue growth. North American DM posted a 1 .5% decline in constant dollar total revenue. As we mentioned at our recent Investor Day, this business is becoming more archival in nature, which has created headwinds in the service revenue, although, to be clear, we continue to see consistent growth in DM storage revenue. Our corporate and other segment reflects revenue from our data center business. FX rate changes reduced total growth by approximately 160 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted OIBDA was $229 million, up 0.5% including the previously mentioned $2.4 million restructuring and the $3.5 million insurance deductible charges. A key driver of profit performance was the continued improvement in our International segments, as well as margin improvement in our North American RIM segments. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.26 per share compared to $0.27 in Q1 2013. GAAP earnings per share were $0.22, including $10 million of REIT costs, $5 million of other expense and $8 million of gains primarily from the disposal of property assets in the United Kingdom as we continue to consolidate our operations. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39.4%. Let's now take a closer look at the components of revenue growth on Slide 5. Overall, total revenue internal growth was 0.5%. When we add the benefit from acquisitions of 4.2% and the offsetting 1.6% impact from negative foreign currency movements, total revenue reported growth was 3.1% for the quarter. Storage rental growth of 1.4% reflects the pricing mix that Bill described. However, we maintain solid margins in the business due to our speed and agility initiatives. Looking at the storage service split. Total storage rental growth of 5.3% on a constant dollar basis drove overall revenue performance. North American RIM reported 3.0% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting flat records management volume, pricing of 0.8% and the benefits from recent acquisitions. Records and Information Management pricing gains were below historical quarters, which reflects taking some appropriate pricing management to win and/or sustain the durability of customer relationships. North American DM reported 2.8% constant dollar storage rental growth driven by organic revenue, which was 2.3% for the quarter. International storage rental growth was 12.7% constant dollar for the quarter, reflecting 32% storage rental revenue growth in emerging markets, supported by strong organic growth and the benefits from acquisition. Internal storage rental growth remained strong with a 5.2% gain in the quarter. Total service revenues were up 3.8% on a constant dollar basis, supported by recent acquisitions, as well as increases in imaging projects and shredding activity, offset somewhat by a decrease in paper pricing when compared with the period 1 year ago. In North American RIM, paper-related revenue increased due to volume increases, but this was partially offset by average paper price declines approximately 5% year-on-year. On a more general level, as noted in recent quarters, we have seen a moderation in the rate of decline in our North American RIM service business. DM Service revenues are experiencing headwinds associated with the trend towards reduced activity levels and related transport revenues. International service growth was boosted by acquisitions and special projects. Let's now move to Slide 6 to discuss our volume growth. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, our proprietary customer insights platform is giving us a better view on customer thinking and that's resulting in lower levels of termination. Also as noted, despite secular trends in the use of paper, we continue to see roughly the same amount of incoming volume from existing customers. In addition, we are seeing an uptick in new sales, and of course, volumes are bolstered by acquisition activity. The resulting worldwide net volume growth of 6.7% in Q1 '14 is compared to the previous year. Let's now move to Slide 7 to discuss our segments in more detail. Consistent with our strategy, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segments as we continue to build out our International segment as a significant driver of profit. North America Records and Information Management delivered solid profits and reported revenues of $446 million increasing 2.7% on a constant dollar basis. This increase was driven by acquisitions. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 50 basis points year-over-year due to reduced overhead costs as a result of our restructuring efforts. We're also sustaining capital efficiency with spending at 3.8% of revenues excluding real estate. North American Data Management delivered revenues of $97 million for Q1, which declined by 1.5% on a constant dollar basis, primarily due to the decline in service revenues. This service decline was the result of a trend towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as the business becomes more archival. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined by 400 basis points year-over-year due to the service revenue headwinds and cost reductions not yet being in proportion to the decline in revenue. Our International segment continues to post strong revenues and contribution progress. Adjusted OIBDA increased 23.8% on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from good global growth and cost improvement initiatives in developed markets. The International business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis, in line with our mid-20s target with adjusted OIBDA margins of 26.2% for the first quarter. Finally, corporate and other revenue was down due to a change in contract terms with an early-stage customer as we continue to build out our pipeline in the data center business. Adjusted OIBDA was down compared to prior year levels, driven by the insurance deductible, restructuring costs, compensation and consulting fees relating to various strategic initiatives. Let's now talk about our acquisitions for 2014 on Slide 8. Acquisitions are an important element of our stated business strategy to drive continued profitable growth in our developed markets and to further penetrate attractive emerging markets. Through the end of April, we have completed 5 core transactions, investing approximately $60 million. These include 3 deals in Turkey and Poland, which enhanced our leadership position in these emerging markets, and the acquisition of a leading provider of off-site data storage and data protection services in Australia. In addition, we increased our ownership of a joint venture in Denmark. Post-acquisition, we generally realize the benefits of operating efficiencies within the first year or so. However, acquisition integration costs impacts our adjusted OIBDA for the first year. Benefits derived from rationalizing the real estate portfolio in an acquisition may take up to several years depending on the size of the business, lease expiration dates and the volume that needs to be moved. All of this is factored into our valuation models as we make our investment decisions. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust and we will continue to evaluate these opportunities through disciplined capital allocation and a return on capital lens, ensuring we create value for our shareholders. Let's now turn to Slide 9 and look at our current debt. Solid cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We are well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At the quarter end, liquidity was about $560 million with $170 million in cash and $390 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 5.1x, which is the high end of our targeted range, has increased over the past 3 years as planned to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. Further, as previously stated, we expect leverage to temporarily exceed our target range in the short term due to costs associated with the REIT conversion. Our strong cash flows support continued advancement of our capital allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. In Q1, we paid $53 million in cash dividends and $10 million of REIT costs including REIT-related CapEx. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy while advancing substantial payments to shareholders, and we remain well positioned to fund our business. So this concludes our review. In summary, Q1 was a good quarter, supported by sustained storage rental performance, continued high levels of profitability in our North American segments and strong International performance and recent acquisitions. We continue to execute against our strategy, extending our reach into high-growth emerging markets, driving continued profitable growth in our developed markets and prudently pursuing new business opportunities that are adjacent to our core business. And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from George Tong. George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Could you provide some color on your organic storage revenue trends? I see they improved fractionally from last quarter, but the organic internal growth remains below your 2% historical range. Just some color on what drove performance in the quarter or when you might expect growth to return back to your 2% historical level. William L. Meaney: George, thanks for your question. The 1.4%, and if you see our historical trends which were kind of 2%, 2.5%, I think we made a deliberate decision and you can see it in terms of our retention rates. Our retention rates are up about 30 basis points and when we were looking at renewing large enterprise customers, we look at retention, obviously, which is a key driver in terms of our long-term economic performance, the terms, in other words, how long those are. So for example, we just renewed a financial service client where we not only increased the volume that we have with that client, but we went from a normal 5-year contract to a 10-year contract. So we put all that into the mix when we look at that. So overall, what we're trying -- what we look at is optimizing or maximizing the revenue and profitability of our customers and we look at price, we look at volume and retention, we look at the length of the contract and the contract terms, all with a view in terms of building the durability of our business. So if you put that in the mix and you see where we've delivered on the OIBDA, so you said, well, historically, we were at 2%, 2.5%. We were at 1.4%, but we increased retention by 30 basis points and we still hit our OIBDA target. So it's a number of things, the variables that we look at. And when we look at these specific renewals, it made a lot more sense to make sure that we improved our retention rate, especially with a view of signing up longer contract terms. George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : That's very helpful. And could you provide some additional detail on the organization realignment actions you've taken in the quarter and what benefits from a cost perspective you expect to see as a result? William L. Meaney: I think that the -- first, it's consistent with what we said on an earlier call, I think, it was back in October when we discussed our reorganization, is that whilst there is a reduction in our cost base associated with it, that was not the motivation for our realignment. And the realignment was triggered back in October, but some of that is just falling through in terms of the restructuring costs in quarter 1 of 2014. So the reorganization was, for the most part, completed last year, but there were some kind of carry-on in terms of the first quarter. The main part of that was taking out 2 layers in our North American organization and mimicking what we have probably internationally that comes naturally around the country organization and we've instilled this -- installed something similar in the United States where we've put a lot more accountability into the local markets and that was really with a view to be more competitive in the mid-market segment. Combined with our acquisition of Cornerstone, those 2 things came together with the reorganization, as I say, again with a view to be more competitive and have more accountability going after the mid-sized segment. Operator : I'll go to the next question. It is from Scott [indiscernible]. Unknown Analyst : I guess, following up on George's first question, I think you partially answered it. But we've seen a nice trend in terminations and destructions and you were talking about retention, but could you delve in a little bit more on the progress you've made there and what you're seeing? William L. Meaney: I can -- maybe I'll give the first part of the answer and then let Rod emphasize because he was also referring to some of the tools that we've introduced. But we have brought in some more, I would say, sophisticated tools and then made some investments to better predict when we seem to be losing traction with customers. And when we go in early on, you have a much more, I would say, robust discussion, which includes how long we can renew the contract for. So we saw some contracts, which normally renew for 3 years and we renewed them for 5 years, as I highlighted just previously. We had a contract where we didn't have anywhere near the share of wallet that we do now. Actually, we went from having a fraction of their wallet to 100% of their wallet and instead of a 5-year contract to a 10-year contract. And when we look at that, that leads to not only better retention rates, which as we said you can see the results in this quarter. Whether you look at North America or you look at our overall business, we've improved retention rates by about 30 basis points. But in addition is we are gaining better terms and conditions in terms of the length of those contracts, which, as you know, for us, this is a -- it's all about the durability and low volatility of our business. And then, Rod, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Roderick Day : Well, just to build on that a little bit, Bill, there's really 2 sides to the equation here. Scott, one is we've invested in sort of predictive analytics to better understand the likelihood of customers terminating or destroying then trying to work with them in a more proactive way, both for our benefit as well as their benefit. And I do think we're seeing the consequences of that starting to come through in some of our key volumetrics. The other thing that we use to sort of build from that is to think more about the long-term value of the customer relationship rather than as sort of just a short-term quick win that we might try and get. So by thinking about that and then structuring that value into the contract over a longer period of time, again we think it's better for us and better for the customer. So hopefully, and I think we are operating in a more sort of sophisticated manner. Unknown Analyst : Is this fairly broad based? Are you seeing any variances across the end markets, which you serve with regard to destructions and terminations, and for that matter, new business wins? William L. Meaney: I think that probably the best way, you have to have a little bit of a helicopter view, especially our exposure to financial services where you have legal holes in specific markets that can skew the data one way or the other on any given period. I think we have to look at -- I think probably the better way to look at it is do we see a different trend, say, in North America versus our other developed markets, say, in Western Europe or Australia. And I would say that we see very consistent -- we're using similar approaches to the market that Rod just described and I would say we're seeing similar trends, almost identical trends, across both of those markets in the improvement that we're getting. Unknown Analyst : And then, finally, if I could slip in one more. Just how is the pricing environment across storage and service, what you're seeing, what may be some of the pushbacks you're hearing from customers or are they fairly open to the strategies you're applying? William L. Meaney: I think the price -- again, I'm going to let Rod maybe follow up. But I think, first of all, on the price is that, from our customers, is it's much more important in terms of what their overall, both quality and cost, of their whole records program is. And quality is about, obviously, making sure -- if you think about this as a safety deposit box for some of the most valuable documents for our customers, it's making sure that those things are stored in a way and can be retrieved in a timely fashion when they need them. And the other thing is to make sure they have a robust records management program, which means that they retain the things that they need to and they don't retain the things that they don't need to. So that's -- and then the other aspect is how much does that whole program cost? So those are the types of discussions that we have with our customers rather than on a specific price. I think, in any low-inflation environment is that everybody is driven by trying to get more productivity out of their operations and we're not immune to that like any other vendor. But the conversation we're having with our customers is how can we reduce the cost of their total program and at the same time, improve the quality of that program, which may mean lower volume for some customers in certain areas, but it definitely doesn't mean lower margin from our standpoint. Roderick Day : I think that's right, Bill. Really, what we're trying to get at is what value can we bring to the customer? It's a complicated mix. It's not just storage, there's a whole lot of service elements that we provide as well. And as the industry leader, we're concerned to make sure we bring that value and demonstrate that value to the customer. So as part of our negotiations, it's a sort of wider and more holistic discussion, I suppose, rather than just a simple price discussion. And I think by doing that, it's good for us and it's good for the customer. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum. Josh James - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : This is Josh James, actually, filling in for Shlomo. I just wonder if you could give us an update... William L. Meaney: Shlomo, I'm sorry, can you just speak up? We're just barely hearing you. Josh James - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : This is actually Josh James filling in for Shlomo. I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on how the Cornerstone acquisition is progressing? William L. Meaney: I think in terms of the integration, Josh, it's ahead of plan. I think the revenue is slightly lower than what we originally expected. But in terms of overall OIBDA delivery, it's -- we're comfortably ahead of plan. I mean, that was, in effect, much more similar to a large pickup and move. The other thing, as I alluded to earlier on the call, is where we've picked up significant benefit is insight on how our commercial operations can be better aligned to serving customers in what I would call the mid-market. So I think between those 2 things in terms of our ability to integrate and synergize it quicker than we thought and then also pick up some DNA about going after or aligning some of our commercial operations to the middle market, I would say it's gone quite well. I don't know, Rod, if you want to comment about on any of the financial? Roderick Day : Yes, I mean, I think just on the revenue point, just to be clear, it was never that far off in terms of our expectations when we went into the deal sort of few hundred thousand. And actually, as we've been able to work with the business, that gap, if you like, has been closing as the months have progressed. So actually, I think we're encouraged by their performance, by what we've seen top line and bottom line pluses, as Bill said, very sort of secondary benefits in terms of better understanding of small and mid-market that we can gain from. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Dolev. Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Question about North American OIBDA margins. They've been down a few quarters in a row. What would need to happen for North America margins to maybe bottom or start to reaccelerate at some point? William L. Meaney: I think, it's really -- I'll let Rod comment more specifically, but it's really a tale of 2 stories. I think the OIBDA margins of North America haven't gone down when you look at our storage business. But as the business becomes more archival, then the service side of the business does take certain headwinds and there are 2 things going on : one is paper prices makes a fairly large impact on that, but the other thing is that as the business becomes more archival, whether you look at the RIM business or the DM business, is that you can only -- you can only be so proactive in terms of restructuring your cost base because you still have to service the customers until they become that less active. So it is kind of a thing where we can be proactive to a certain degree, but during this transition, until the declines in service revenue or the archival nature kind of flattens out in the business, there will continue to be pressure under the service side of the margins. But to be clear on the storage side is we are maintaining our margins on the storage side, and in fact, in most cases, improving them. So I don't know, Rod, if you want to... Roderick Day : Yes, I think that's right. And you can see that a little bit in our numbers for the quarter actually. Because on the RIM side, the Records and Information Management side, if you look year-on-year, our margins actually improved by 50 basis points. And there's sort of 3 drivers of that, if you like. One is sort of ongoing good performance within storage. Two is the sort of slowdown in the rate of decline that we've seen in service within the RIM side of things. And three, sort of within that context, we've also been very proactive about taking out costs to try and sort of make sure we can maintain and enhance margin. So you can see that coming through in the RIM segment. If you look at Data Management, though, you do see a decline in margins, which is where the service decline is more accentuated at this point. And that presents us with a challenge, if you like, in terms [ph] of having to sort of take costs out as quickly as we can, so at least try and mitigate that impact. So it depends a little bit in terms of where we're at within the segment. But at least on the RIM side, we're up. And Data Management where we are seeing more of these service headwinds, we're down, but taking action on the cost side. William L. Meaney: And I think on the -- the only thing I would just add to what Rod said is on the -- and if we look at Data Management, remember, we're talking about a base of 60% OIBDA margins on that business. And the storage component, whilst we've seen a decline as the business becomes -- tape is used much more for archive than backup purposes, we've seen an increase in our storage volume even though that tape format is becoming more efficient, et cetera. So we actually -- the amount of data that we're storing continues to grow. It's not for backup as much anymore, it's much more for archival. And you need to do this in the context that we're talking about at 60% margin business. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Andy Wittmann. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I didn't want to ask about your IRS process, but I did want to get your view on any implications or your thoughts really around the successful conversions of Lamar, CBS Outdoor and what that could potentially mean for the kind of overall thinking? William L. Meaney: Well, that was a good way of, Andy, not asking a question about the REIT process. All I can say is we congratulate them both. I mean, we're in a completely different business segment, so I don't think you can read much into their process versus ours. But I appreciate the question. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I mean, what you gave us is fair and to hear that is actually helpful. Also wanted to get a thought, just kind of on that sales strategy for the mid-market, as well as what you did with the verticalization. Are you seeing benefits from that already or is that still yet to come? Just kind of your view of the success there. William L. Meaney: I think that there's still a lot more to come. I think we are clearly seeing some. I mean, I think that the 30 basis points of improvement on retention -- don't forget, retention is almost the same as selling for us because of our presence and leadership in a lot of these segments, right. So retention is an important bellwether and it is getting closer to the customers through verticalization, through using better analytical tools that Rod discussed in his remarks. I think this is all starting to have a benefit. That being said, some of the things that we're doing around the middle market and even for a large enterprise customers, I think it's early days. As we discussed at Investor Day, we're in the process of standing up a central marketing operation under a chief marketing officer that's still being implemented. So I do think there are ways where, as a company, we can use our unique scale to further our leadership position and I think that there's more to be done, but we are starting to see some benefits, as we've highlighted, around retention. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And then maybe just a final question, Rod. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a flavor as to the acquisitions that you've done this year. I guess, we've kind of heard you've added some acquisitions, you've had some FX headwinds. No change to the guidance because, obviously, the annuity is large. But can you help us -- can you put a pencil to the paper on what the FX dollar headwind and the revenue benefit is from the acquisitions for the year? Roderick Day : So approximately, for the acquisitions, we'd be looking at around $20 million, something like that. And there will be more detail in the 10-K on this. And similar kind of offset on the FX side. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And to be clear, the 2014 contributions, so it's partial year contribution from these acquisitions, not the run rate annualized contribution of revenue? Roderick Day : No, sorry, that's annualized. But the fact is we sort of made these acquisitions fairly early in the year, so actually wouldn't be far off that number. Operator : There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to CEO, Bill Meaney, for closing remarks. William L. Meaney: Thank you, operator. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter with strong constant dollar growth and margins. We have many attractive investment opportunities in order to grow our business over the long term and we'll do so prudently, consistent with our focused capital allocation approach. At the same time, we will continue to sustain the durability of our storage rental business, expand our presence in emerging markets and pursue attractive emerging business opportunities. We believe our durable platform and deliberate growth plan will continue to deliver opportunity and maximize total returns for our shareholders. Moreover, the value of these returns are further enhanced due to the higher certainty and lower volatility inherent in the nature of our business, which combines a durable and global customer base with superior scale. Thank you for joining us this morning. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Kimberly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 Earnings Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Marsden, you may begin your conference. Melissa Marsden : Thank you, Kimberly, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for the company. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and progress toward our strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and discuss elements of our new supplemental reporting package. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2014 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, Slide 2 of the supplemental reporting package, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those on our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in these supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William L. Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. This was a good quarter for the company, highlighted by the receipt in late June of the favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and our conversion to a REIT. As we've said from the beginning of the process, we believe we fit well as a REIT due to our sizable real estate portfolio. We have a very attractive business model, through which we incur occupancy costs on a square foot basis and generate storage rental revenue on a cubic foot basis. This significant spread between our cost and our return on investment generates high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders. We also distinguished ourselves through low turnover costs per square foot. We have no TIs, or tenant improvements, required if a customer terminates and we bring in another customer's records. We also have a low customer churn of less than 2% per annum as well as maintaining high quality receivables giving our service to 950 of the Fortune 1,000. The REIT structure complements our strategy whilst enhancing payouts and it highlights our highly disciplined approach around asset allocation. As a REIT, we expect to continue to generate the cash flow necessary to support attractive stockholder return and to invest -- to sustain the durability of the business while continuing to identify opportunities for enhanced growth in line with our long-term strategic plan. We also see the potential to purchase a significant portion of our leased real estate over time, thereby reducing our cost of debt and enhancing residual values. The recent roadshow presentation available on our website addresses many of the common questions related to our conversion. So we're not going to spend a lot of time on that in prepared remarks today. Rather, I'll focus on what we're seeing in the business and the progress on our strategic plan and then Rod will cover financial and operating specifics whilst directing you to the relevant sections of our new supplemental reporting package. Turning now to financial highlights. Total revenue for the quarter was $787 million, up 4.4% on a constant dollar basis, with adjusted OIBDA of $242 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 per share, up roughly 5%. These results were in line with our presentation during our Investor Day in March and demonstrate the same growth rate on a like-for-like basis, both as a C-corp as well as now as a REIT. We maintained our high adjusted OIBDA margins for the total enterprise of roughly 31% during the quarter, with consistent performance in our North American segments and international margins in line with our targeted level in the mid-20s percent range. In addition, we achieved solid operating results and are making good progress on our strategic plan to sustain the durability of our high return business in developed markets, having added a net 1.3 million cubic feet of internal growth in the first half of the year in North America. Moreover, having reached 12% of our sales coming from emerging markets by the end of Q2, we are on track to our goal of having 16% of our sales from this high-growth segment by 2016. Finally, we continue to identify and test new and emerging business opportunities as well as further scaling of our data center opportunity. Total storage rental revenue, the key economic driver of our business, was up 5.7% in constant dollars, driven by strong growth of 14% in our International business and constant dollar growth of 3.3% in North American Records and Information Management, or RIM. Storage rental internal growth of 1.6% for the quarter reflected solid growth in Records Management volume of 1.7% in terms of internal growth and 7.6% if we include acquisitions year-on-year. We continue to see improvement in retention in North America, where a total records management storage volume outflows dropped to 6.6% from 6.8% in the first quarter and 7.1% in the fourth quarter 2013. We are pleased with this progress, as the reduction and terminations supported by our first quarter of net positive volume growth in North America Records Management since 2011. Importantly, we maintained strong North American Records Management margins of more than 38% during the quarter through ongoing productivity enhancements whilst continuing to invest in strengthening customer relationships and product development. In our internal -- International business, constant dollars storage rental growth was about 14% overall, with 32% constant dollar growth in emerging markets. These emerging markets, which, as I mentioned, represent just 12% of our total enterprise revenues today, have very favorable growth dynamics. Emerging market storage rental internal growth was 12% in the second quarter whilst volume expanded by 10% excluding acquisitions, or 33% in total, reflecting the successful integration of acquisitions completed in 2013. Acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy overall, with a particular emphasis in these high-growth markets. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities in emerging markets, with more than 3x the coverage needed to achieve our goal of growing this part of our business to 16% of total revenue by the end of 2016. We evaluate acquisitions in terms of how they can both further our market leadership and sustain the durability of our business after first establishing that we can exceed our cost of capital and achieve our targeted returns. During the second quarter, we completed a few small customer acquisitions in the U.S., as well as tuck-in -- a tuck-in acquisition in Brazil and closed the previously announced transaction in Poland, bringing us to about $60 million of company acquisitions and another $10 million of customer acquisitions year-to-date. Within our emerging business opportunity area, we are pleased with the early interest in our data center operations. We have booked more than 70% of the inventory space we developed in our underground facility and are kicking off our next phase of development there. Additionally, we have signed our first few small deals in our data center near Boston, which we just completed last month. It is early days, but we have a good pipeline building up. Our targeted segment of the data center market has good growth dynamics and the potential to generate very attractive returns, and we will continue to employ a success-based approach to investment as we look to scale this business. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued solid constant dollar storage rental revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth in line with the 4% longer-term goals we've discussed in the past. We expect consistent trends with what we're seeing for durable storage rental revenue in developed markets and a moderation in the rate of activity-based service revenue declines. We are on track to make emerging markets, which achieve low-double digit internal storage growth rates, a more significant portion of our overall sales mix. And in our emerging business area, we continue to identify and test opportunities which are complementary to our core business and resonate with our customers. Overall, Q2 was a very solid quarter, anchored by our favorable REIT news and further progress on our strategic plan. We believe we are on track to deliver against our 2014 goals, as well as our longer term objectives. As a reminder, those are to : deliver shareholder total shareholder returns in the range of 8% to 9% in line with the S&P 500; provide predictable earnings and dividend growth with low volatility; and generate further upside over and above the 8% to 9% returns from our investments and additional emerging business opportunities. Currently, it is interesting to note that we are well on track with this overall goal given our current dividend yield of approximately 6%, combined with our growth in OIBDA of 5%, or what translates loosely into a total shareholder return, or TSR, of 11% plus any upside from emerging businesses. The REIT supports these goals as the yield component is now a bigger contributor to our targeted returns and supports our capital allocation approach. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod. Roderick Day : Thanks, Bill. In keeping with our conversion to a REIT, we have begun to transition our financial disclosure to provide information that we believe will be useful to both current investors, as well as potential new investors. Going forward, rather than issuing a standalone press release and posting slides, supplemental debt statistics and GAAP reconciliations on the website, we will provide all these disclosures in 1 comprehensive supplemental reporting package. We anticipate enhancements to this package over time and would welcome your feedback. With that, let me direct your attention to the financial highlights on Page 7. We delivered solid results in Q2, which were supported by strong storage rental growth, good profit performance and the benefits from recent acquisitions in emerging and developed markets. Total reported revenues were $787 million for the quarter, up more than 4% compared with $754 million in 2013. Both gross margin and adjusted OIBDA were up approximately 4%, in line with our strategic planning goals. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA in 2014 includes $3.6 million of costs associated with the company's 2013 restructuring and $3.9 million of ongoing REIT compliance costs. Adjusted EPS of $0.41 increased by about 5% from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2013, which was restated to be on a comparable basis using our current structural tax rate of roughly 15%. For both the quarter and the year-to-date, we booked sizable discrete net tax benefits associated with the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and assets related to our conversion. Just a bit more color on this. Tax accounting for C-Corps requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future expected tax impact of temporary differences between our tax basis and our financial reporting basis. As a REIT, instead of that booked to tax difference being reflected at our U.S. federal tax rate of 35%, it is now being reflected at 0% for the portion of the business that is included in the REIT and the QRS, or qualified REIT subsidiary structure. This is effectively a onetime reset of our deferred tax liabilities and assets and resulted in a large noncash benefit. While we no longer -- while we'll no longer be taxed at the U.S. federal level on our QRS income, we will continue to pay local tax on our international operations, including in those countries that were converted to the REIT structure. And of course, we'll continue to pay taxes on our global service operations and certain state taxes. But the REIT structure allows us to effectively repatriate storage-related income from the REIT countries and distribute it to stockholders without double taxation. While our structural rate for year-to-date came out to 15%, we continue to believe that a rate in the 17% range over the long term is about right. For the full year in 2014, we expect the structural rate to be between 15% and 17%. We have normalized FFO to adjust for these one-off tax effects as well. Another highlight from this page is our summary of our investments in capital expenditures. As you can see, due to the nature of our storage rental business, maintenance CapEx per foot is very low. Maintenance CapEx of roughly $30 million year-to-date is running slightly behind the $90 million midpoint of our full year guidance, as we typically see in the majority of CapEx improvement projects undertaken in the latter portion of the year. Other CapEx is right in line with the $50 million midpoint of the full year guidance, and real estate investment, including racking, is on pace with our full year expectation of around $200 million. Turning to components of revenue growth on Page 8. On a constant dollar basis, revenue is up 4.4%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5.7%, while service revenue growth of 2.7% was driven by recent acquisitions, as well as fees from new inbound volume and increases in imaging projects and shredding activity. On a constant dollar basis, first half total revenue growth was 4.6%, driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5.5%, and service revenue growth of 3.3%. Also on this page, you can see that we continue to demonstrate improvement in net volume growth in Records Management, with total year-on-year volume growth in the quarter of 7.6% including acquisitions, or 1.7% excluding acquisitions. As we've noted previously, despite secular trends in the use of paper, we continue to see very consistent trends in the amount of incoming volume from our existing customers. In addition, we had increased contribution from acquisitions year-over-year and further improvements in the level of terminations and withdrawals, particularly in North America, as Bill highlighted earlier. On Page 10, we present components of growth on a segment basis. As you'll recall, in the first quarter, we amended our reporting structure to align with the way we manage the business. We broke down our North American segment into North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, North American Data Management or DM, an emerging business, which are currently a component of the corporate and other segments. Q2 segment results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. North America Records and Information Management delivered positive storage rental internal growth and maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of about 38%. We also improved capital efficiency, with spending at 4.3% of revenues, excluding real estate. North American Data Management storage rental was flat. Service declines continued to reflect the trend towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as the business becomes more archival. However, we maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of more than 60% in this segment despite the reduction in revenues. The International segment continues to generate strong growth, with 14% constant dollar storage rental and 11.6% constant dollar growth in services, driven by recurring imaging projects. International business continue to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis, in line with our mid-20s target, with adjusted OIBDA margins of 23.8%. This is slightly down on the previous quarter, as a result of phasing of acquisition integration spends. Finally, corporate and other revenue was up 9%, reflecting growth in data center service revenues. As Bill noted, we're building out our pipeline in the data center business, so these comparisons are on a very small basis. On Page 17, we provide reconciliations from net income to FFO and then show further adjustments for noncash items to arrive at AFFO. Our FFO and AFFO figures reflect the deferred tax benefit resulting from the flushing entry that I mentioned earlier. If you were to use the Q2 normalized FFO as the run rate for the second half, or $118 million times 2, and add it to the year-to-date FFO of about $225 million, you will arrive at about $460 million of FFO, consistent with our full year guidance. A similar approach to AFFO revealed about $600 million for the full year. As mentioned on our reapproval call, with our projected ordinary dividend of $400 million to $420 million, we have strong coverage for our dividend relative to AFFO. Turning to some of our new disclosures. On Page 18, we present storage net operating income to provide a closer look at NOI from our records management and data management storage operations. We have also added a summary of our global real estate portfolio on Page 19 to show owned versus leased buildings and the associated facilities counts in square footage by major region. And on Page 20, we provide square footage of racked space by product type : records management, primarily the bulks business, and data protection or tapes. NOI per racked square foot, on this page, highlights the attractive economics that we derive from our real estate, which Bill mentioned earlier. On Page 22, we provide utilization for our records management and data protection businesses. The top portion of the page shows the trailing 5-quarter trend in both cubic feet of records and data protection tapes stored, as well as year-over-year growth. The bar charts towards the bottom of the page show the total amounts of installed racking we have in these 2 businesses and the capacity we have for racking, assuming our buildings were all fully racked. The utilization numbers below are the cubic feet of records or number of DPUs stored, expressed as a percentage of the racking we have in place and as a percentage of what our maximum rack capacity could be. As you can see, our utilization rates are quite high. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum utilization is in the mid-90s percent. Bear in mind that in the new facility, we would generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years. We have some upside here, as we enhance the utilization through acquisition integration and facility consolidation over time. On Page 23, we show service business detail. This presentation has been updated from what was provided in our recent roadshow presentation. Effective July 1 of this year, we established CRS service entities in each of our identified REIT countries, which included transferring the designation of some employees who perform services in our warehouses that were previously categorized as storage-related. The transfers of these of these employees in REIT countries resulted in a shift of about $7 million of labor expenses, previously categorized as storage rental labor to services labor. We expect similar minor transfers of storage rental labor costs in the future, as we establish CRS service entities in any future REITs countries. So the basis for year-over-year comparisons will generally not be the same. We have provided a look at our customer base on Page 24. This highlights our StrongBox retention of around 93%, as well as the diversification of our large global customer base. We also provide sales, marketing and account management and customer acquisition costs, which we think of as similar to typical REIT turnover costs. Shifting to the balance sheet. Pages 25 and 26 present our debt maturity schedule and related metrics. Solid cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. At quarter end, liquidity was virtually unchanged from Q1 at about $536 million, with $170 million in cash and $390 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 5.1x, which is at the high end of our targeted range, has increased over the past 3 years, as planned to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to our REITs and recent acquisitions. We expect leverage to temporarily exceed our target range of 4x to 5x in the short term, due to costs associated with the REIT conversion. We do have extraordinary expenditures remaining in the first year of conversion, including: about a $130 million of cash associated with a special distribution, assuming the midpoint of our range and today's share price; another $85 million representing the bulk of the remaining tax recapture payments, due to the change in our depreciation schedule; and another $30 million of REIT conversion costs. If you were to look at 2014 on a normalized basis, absent these costs, and grow the components of free cash flow into 2015 at our expected growth rate and adjusted OIBDA, our excess cash available for investment, after paying our ordinary dividends, more than covers core real estate investments, including racking and leasehold improvements. Should we be more opportunistic about acquiring buildings outright or buildings associated with business acquisitions, we would look to borrow at our targeted leverage ratio or, perhaps, use equity to fund such investments. Given the returns we can generate from leveraging our scale and global platform, such financing would be a good use of capital. Lastly, on Page 28, we have provided components of value, which is a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. A couple of things to note. We present storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense, in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis, whether leased or owned. We also provide our total rent expense in the liabilities area. We are currently showing investment in buildings, racking and acquisition at book value, but it's our intent to -- ultimately, to provide a schedule of these investment categories with our expected returns. This schedule is followed by comprehensive definition of terms, which we believe will be helpful to investors to adjust to our new disclosure. In summary, Q2 was a good quarter, supported by sustained storage rental performance, continued high levels of profitability in our North American segments, and strong international and emerging market performance. And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.  Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Bill, internal growth and storage rentals this quarter increased about 1.6%, which is up from the prior quarter's growth of 1.4%, but still is below historical 2% growth levels. Can you discuss your outlook for internal storage growth and what potential catalysts that you can see that can drive further acceleration? William L. Meaney: No, I think that, as we said last time, we weren't guiding for an immediate rebound to what we saw last year. But I think you have to look at the total picture in terms of the volume growth that we generated. Let's say, this is the first quarter since 2011 that we had a positive volume growth in North America. So there is a balance to get in terms -- because what we're looking for is total revenue, not just on the pricing front. I think, in terms of -- on the price, I think the -- it's an area in a low-inflation environment that we continue to work on and optimize further. But, I think, we're still where we were last quarter, which we are slightly improved from where we were 3 months ago. But we're saying it's more of a gradual improvement to expect rather than a rapid rebound to the 2% that you referenced.  Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Right. And turning to services. Internal growth this quarter reflected some lower project fees in customer terms in North America. Do you think this is a secular trend, or do you expect a rebound in internal growth and services next quarter? William L. Meaney: I think there is 2 bits, as you know, on the service front. There are things that are, what I would call, core services that related to our records management and data management business, and then there is the project side. And the -- I wouldn't say they're secular. You're right to call out that the change in trend on the service revenue side is driven by a drop-off in some project -- large projects that we had last year. But projects in their very nature are lumpy, and it's not -- the fact that some of those haven't been replaced at the same level in this quarter is not a trend, it's rather just the nature of that part of the business. In terms of the other part of the business that we've been calling out as having headwinds, which is related to our core services around data management and records management, there we do see a flattening out of the headwinds, if you will. But, I think, in terms of the thing that was driving the major change in this quarter was the lumpiness of some of the specific projects that we do to service some of our customers.  Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : All right, makes sense. Rod, you've indicated you expect an effective tax rate of about 17% on a go-forward basis. Can you detail how taxes will play out in the remainder of the year and what you expect cash tax savings to be taking into account differences between book and cash taxes? Roderick Day : Yes. So in terms of the rate that we expect, we had 15% in Q2, as I said earlier. The range that we expect for the remainder of the year will be between 15% and 17%. The reason for the slight level of uncertainty is that we obviously still pay tax on our overseas operations within those countries and also within -- on the service activity that we have within North America. So depending on the mix of the business, that will drive some small variation in the amounts of tax that we have to pay. So therefore, we do see a range, if you like, between 15% and 17%. In terms of the cash tax saving, I'd say the sort of simple way to think about that would be, if you say historically we used to pay 39% and we're now down in the sort of 15% to 17%, that would be sort of the ratio to take as the kind of key driver of change. We will, as I was saying though earlier, have to pay additional tax associated with the slowdown in the depreciation of our racking, and that will come through this year. It's not part of our normalized tax rate, but it will impact our numbers this year.  Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Got it. And you're still expecting cash tax savings of about $120 million per year? Roderick Day : Correct, yes.  Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Okay. And then lastly, you've indicated you're accelerating your acquisition plans and plans to own more strategic real estate over time. Can you detail how you plan to finance these growth plans and if there will be a need for capital raises near term? Roderick Day : We are still working through the details of that, because the key thing for us is, obviously, to finance these in the most effective way. The likelihood is that we will finance some through debt and some through some level of equity, but we will structure this in such a way that we can generate the maximum level of returns for our investors. And we'll provide more details of that, as we work our way through that later this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Just following-up on one of George's questions, special project activity in the service area. There has been a belief in the past that, that can be an indicator that business is picking up or slowing down. And you mentioned it's been lumpy. Do you guys take any readthrough from what you're seeing right now, or do you just stick more with the view of the lumpiness and it's not really a foreshadowing of things to come? William L. Meaney: No, I don't think it's a very good leading indicator for, Scott, on the activity levels. So the nature of these things, for instance -- I think one of our larger projects last year was for a mortgage company, because they had certain things that they were actually selling and repackaging to someone else and we had to go in and help them, which both scan and organize a number of these documents. So it's that kind of lumpiness of activity. It's usually related to either a on-boarding of a major customer that has some specific needs or a major customer doing some kind of transaction that requires special services. So it tends to not have a very good correlation with, I think, any leading indicator. So it really is a one-off type project. Now given the -- it's even probably more lumpy than you see, when you look at our business from an analytical standpoint, but given the scale of our business, some of those lumps smooth out, but it really is of that kind of nature. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Great. And then with regard, primarily in core storage and we'll group shredding in as well, could you discuss the pricing environment and the competitive environment, and what you're seeing out there? William L. Meaney: I think that the -- I think it's fairly stable. I think that, if anything -- if you look at -- I think it was on Page 8. If you look at the trends in what's happening, I think that we don't see, I think, additional pressure on that. I think what we see now is, what we euphemistically call the power of the mountain, is we've got a lot more focused in honing our commercial skills. And as a result we are doing better both on defense and offense. So if you look at the trends from a year ago until today, you'll see that we've done better both in terms of sales, so out there winning by about 300 basis points over the whole period that we've got graft, and we've improve our defense by about 80 basis points. So I think that the -- I wouldn't -- and if you look at that in an environment where we're still pushing revenue -- positive revenue growth, are we making some trade-offs? Maybe, but a lot of it is also the segments that happen to be addressing, both in terms of the countries we're going after and the customers that we're going after. So I think, net-net, I don't see a major change in the competitive market other than we're using the power of the mountain or the scale that we have for the benefit of our customers, I think, much more fuller or much more comprehensively. I think the only thing that's a challenge in the low-inflationary environments that we have is price is always a challenge. Because most of the countries that we operate in, at least ones that we have any significant size, are in low inflationary environments and putting price increases through, and those types of environments is always difficult. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : And just you cited that chart on Page 8. I'm curious, over the coming year or 18 months, where do you think -- excluding acquisitions from the discussion, which of the buckets there do you think will show the most change? I can tell ideally which ones you'd like to move the most, but which do you think will have the most significant moves? William L. Meaney: Well, let's look at the chart. If we look at Q2 '14, just so we're just looking at the same numbers. So let's look at the charts by color chain [ph]. So if you look you look of the dark blue block just above the line and the right red black just below the line, I think those things are going to tend to run in similar trends. Although the light red, to me, also tends to have some lumpiness, some of that is to do with legal holds coming on or off, so you can have some movement around that 4.7. But I think, generally, that's what we would call the organic growth of the business. So I think, as I've pointed out previously, that independent of everything else, even though paper itself is in decline, document growth -- new document growth from existing customers tends to be in the 6% to 7% range, which is the dark blue block, and I expect that to stay in that range. That gets netted out, because customers are going through different life cycles with their inventory and that's been bouncing around the 4.5% to, say, 4.7% range. And I would expect those -- so I expect those 2 to be relatively stable going forward. I think the -- lets leave the acquisitions out, because that is -- we do have an acquisition strategy, biased more towards the emerging markets. But I think what you're really referring to is : what's the organic growth health of the business in terms of things that are -- that's more incremental? So I think then it really comes down to you asking, are we going to do better or with the trend in terms of new sales, which is the lighter blue or the kind of medium blue bar, 2.2%; and our defense, which is the out perm, so where we are actually are losing business, which is dark red, of minus 2%. To say that we're going to continue on a certain trend line, I'm not going to guide for that. The only thing I would say is that, I think, the improvement that we've highlighted, I think we should be able to hang on to in that order of magnitude of where we're taking is -- we're quite encouraged by a couple of things that we've done with our commercial operation, both in terms of the way that we develop products now and take advantage of our global scale, not just local scale, in terms of getting insights in terms of what customers find helpful in terms of our product and solution delivery. And then the other part of it is, is that some of the reorganization of our sales force that we've talked about a few quarters now, both in terms of the verticalization, which again, gives us better insights in terms of solutions that our customers are looking for. And that seems to be resonating where you see in both the better -- in trend both in new sales, as well as defense. And then the last aspect is, is that we are boosting our presence in the middle market. Our presence in the enterprise part of the segment has been strong for many, many years, but we're now also trying to have a similar representation in the middle market. So again, I think there is lots of things that underpin that we should be able to maintain those kinds of trends, but I'm not guiding for major increase in either of those. Roderick Day : Bill, it's interesting points you make there. One sort of addition I just want to add is that we have service revenue associated with our perms and terms. And as they've decreased in the quarter, that actually had impact to our service revenue in the quarter. And it's a negative as it were on service, but it's a positive for the longer term of the business. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : And, Rod, just one other thing. And I like the new presentation, by the way. On Page 24, where you show North America revenue by vertical, that pie chart, what is that? Is that the end of 2013? Is that as of June 30? And could you give us a feel for, maybe over the past few years and maybe looking forward to some activity you're seeing in the verticals, how might that pie chart change? Roderick Day : Yes. So the numbers refer to sort of year-to-date '14, so it's kind of the latest view. I think what you'll see is that, as we sort of develop out our vertical strategy and really look to drive specific areas, we would expect some shift in this chart, although it's likely to be slow, just kind of given the annuity basis of our business. So the kind of areas where we do see potential, for example, would be federal, which is one area where there's plenty of unvended [ph] activity for us to go after, the whole area, the life sciences, energy and business services, very interesting new areas for us to be getting after. Legal and financial insurance, historically, we've been very strong in those segments. We'd expect to continue to bolster our presence. But in terms of potential relative to some of the other segments, it's probably less. So I would suggest. But would you agree with that, Bill? William L. Meaney: Yes, I think that's a good summary. The only thing I also would add is in the other category, a lot of that is the middle market. And we have roughly 20% share of wallet in the middle market where we have, say, 60% share of wallet in the large enterprise market. So I'm not saying that we're going to get to the same share of wallet. But we do feel, like the federal market, that we're underrepresented in others. So how those things move out? But I would say that -- I agree with Ron saying as we're well represented in kind of the Big 3, so to speak, legal, financial and insurance, not that we wouldn't want more business there. We are constantly pushing. But we do have some areas like federal, and, I would say, the middle market, and other where we're underrepresented and we think there's real opportunity. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : One more, if I can sneak in, then I'll turnover. Just the one topic you didn't hit in that category was healthcare. I'm curious if you're seeing anything changed on that front? William L. Meaney: It's a good question. We do normally talk about healthcare, so I'm glad you brought that up, Scott. We have -- we continue to be pleased with what we are seeing the swap-out, or the change. Because, obviously, the electronic medical records has affected our service revenue in healthcare probably more than any other vertical, as more and more of the healthcare records have gone online. That being said, we've been able to increase our storage revenue in healthcare by taking in more records. So we have year-on-year storage growth of almost a little less than 1%, which goes to that trend. So they're not destroying the records. In fact, we're getting more records as they're cleaning out the hospitals as well. In storage, as you recall, has about 2x the margin that service. So healthcare continues to be a major focus for us. We are also finding through these conversations, which goes back to Rod's comment about the verticalization, is we're gaining further insights on how we can service them even beyond the traditional, what I would call, medical record area. So it is an area where, I think, innovation is actually helping us, especially shifting us to higher-margin work. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : You talked about the activity service revenue declines narrowing. I remember this activity-based moving boxes around, moving tapes around being a drag for many years. I think it might have started in 2009. My question is : why do you feel now is a time where these activity service revenues are starting to even-out, and do we think that's kind of sustainable? William L. Meaney: I think that the -- well, there is kind of a couple of things. One is that we're still seeing -- if we look at the 2 businesses, Andrew, I think it's worthwhile to look at records management versus data management, because data management, we still are seeing probably stronger headwinds in terms of getting to a, what I'll call, a stable floor than we are in records management. And the reason for that simply is that we're still finishing up the transition from tape being for backup and recovery to tape being an archival product. Right? So our storage volume, it continues to grow in the DM business, but how tape is being used is different. So as a result, we're doing this transition to a different service model, which happens to have a lower activity associated with it. And the thing I should highlight is, we are able to maintain our margins pretty closely during these drops in activity. So it's important to understand that it's an activity-driven. Whereas on the records management side, the data that we're looking at, we are further down that cycle, if I will, that transition to a more archival nature. So things like I was highlighting in healthcare, healthcare traditionally was a high-service business because it had a lot of, what we call, active file with medical records going backwards and forwards between the hospitals and our facilities. That obviously is gone away, or going away, fairly quickly in most locations. So I think in records management, that trend to archival nature of our services is further ahead, and we see that decline flattening out. So that's what we're really -- where we're looking at. At some point, it does get to the transition from active to archive you get through 80%, 90% of the transition, and I think that's where we're at with the records management. And we are -- I think we're well down that journey with data management, but we're not as far down the journey as we are with records management. Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. And do you think we'll ever get to a point where the service revenue, activity-based service revenues, could be flat? William L. Meaney: I think, relatively, it's -- I think that it's probably going to kind of go up and down a little bit. I think the -- and it depends on what we replace some of that service revenues. So some of it is where we're replacing -- we're cannibalize our own backwards and forwards transportation, if you will, by providing them scanning and online options to retrieve data as well. So the part of it is, is we're also providing different ways for the customer to get the information back that's more efficient. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifle. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the real estate side of things. In terms of potential lease buyout, does your portfolio have any particular amount to favorable purchase options versus market value? Is there anything in there that's particularly attractive if you go through the portfolio, like a certain percentage of them? Roderick Day : Yes. I mean, actually on Slide 27 of the supplement, so it gives you a sort of the profile of how our leases look to expire. And what this shows -- if you look at the top chart, it shows when the leases come up, the sort of first expiration, as it were, and then the bottom is what would happen if we were to extend our leases into the longer term. And so the reason why there is such a difference is that when we've taken out lease agreements, we have typically looked for very long-term leases. So we've always kind of had that option in there for us to be able to extent. So the first point, I guess, in terms of our ability to buy, is we are long-term tenants. People see us as long-terms tenants. And we try to sort of structure that within our lease arrangements. And so then the second thing we try to do, not with all leases, but with certainly a significant number, is indeed to incorporate elements as sort of buyout clauses within there, which should work to our advantage. So we have a purchase option immediate -- so a good approach is an option of around sort of 6 million square feet, and that should be at good terms for us. And we would look to move forward on -- so any elements of that. We will always do this in a way that creates value for shareholders, but that's kind of where we stand today. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So is there an arbitrage opportunity in your portfolio, your lease versus buy, in terms of market value? That's just what I'm trying to get it Roderick Day : Yes. No, for sure. So if you think of it, typically we might borrow around 6% -- the lease rate, if you like, would be around 8%. So you've got a 200-basis-point spread as a sort of general rule. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Basically, let me just restate what I'm trying to get at it, is there -- I'm saying, in terms of the purchase options, will you be buying real estate at below-market prices when you exercise those options? That's an actual, but more what I'm getting it. William L. Meaney: I think the way to think about it is just reemphasizing what Rod is saying. Because we have fair market clauses in most of our leases, virtually almost all of our leases when we renew, that allows -- so the way you have to think about it is it's the cost of financing is how you create value, it's not the arbitrage in terms of being able to get something at a lower price. So I think the better way to model it or to think about it is that 200-basis-point spread, which is around the financing cost of 8% to lease, 6% to own, right? Because I wouldn't try to build in us being able to buy at a better price. I think where the arbitrage comes in, potentially, is on the residual values. Because what we're capturing, especially in the emerging markets which we are -- in my previous life, I played this out a number of times where we used to buy real estate purposely because we could capture, in 15 or 20 years, the urban growth to capture additional residual value. So that's a longer-term capture. And I think you have to also do it as a backdrop. When we say leases is that a number of our leases -- as I say, these typically are very long leases. So it -- in fact, if you look in places like Asia, you typically can only buy leaseholds, but you are able to get, effectively, the full economical ownership. In fact, in some markets, you can even get this part of the residual value because of your ability to trade leases. That's not in very country, but in some countries you can do that. So that's what we're really talking about is how do we actually take some these long-term leases where we have a lot of the economics of owning, and how do we further capture it? And I think the best way to think of it is the 200 basis points of potential spread between cost of ownership. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. So if I just take that further, so to the extent that you will issue equity in order to affect either lease buyouts or property's M&A, the immediate impact on a lease buyout would be the 200-basis-point spread and that should be accretive to investors on a cash flow basis? Is that the way to think of it? William L. Meaney: I think -- I'll actually let Rod speak, but I think what Rod's saying, it will be a blend, most likely. I mean, that's the one thing that we're working out is the blend between equity and debt to do that. So it will be on a blended basis. Roderick Day : So that's right, Bill. But certainly, we aim for the -- I think to the point, we are aiming for the investments to be accretive. Correct. William L. Meaney: Yes. Roderick Day : Yes. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I mean, the other part of that in terms of, I think people are kind of getting to this, is in terms of potential equity issuances, is that how fast should you deploy or raise additional equity? How fast would you be able to deploy that in terms of being able to increase your FFO per share and AFFO per share? In other words, do you think there'll be a lag time of 6 months, or you'd be doing it kind of at the money as you need that type of stuff and so you'd make it immediately accretive? Roderick Day : I think it would depend on the speed with which we could effectively acquire the leases, if I'm answering the question. So it will be -- it will depend on that phasing. So we wouldn't -- obviously, we wouldn't be able to buy all our leases on sort of day 1, but we would have -- we would expect to have a program to do so over time. William L. Meaney: And I think -- look none of these things -- it'd be wonderful if we could do something today, and it's absolutely accretive the next day. I mean, these things -- we look at allocating capital on net present value basis and an earning per shares basis over stabilized returns, and we look at how long it takes you to get there versus how much you have to take in early. I think that the ability for most companies to be able to time these things exactly is never there. But I think it's fair to say, emphasizing what Rod's point is, is that if we go out and raise equity, for instance, it will be with a clear visibility and understanding of how that becomes accretive for the shareholders. But to say that you can do these things matching on a one-to-one basis instantaneously, I think we're not saying it can't be done, but I would say right now that it's hard to see how to do that. That being said, whatever we do, we'd be -- we would have the transparency around it with our shareholders and investors that how that is accretive in terms of their interest in the company. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. That's fair. And then just kind of a housekeeping question on Slide 28, in the annualized NOI. Could you just, maybe Rod, walk us through a little bit what you mean exactly for a stabilized portfolio versus the NOI that you would be reporting on a quarterly basis? Roderick Day : Yes. So the way to think about the stabilized portfolio is, is a kind of like-for-like. So where we -- so we're kind of excluding acquisitions and buildings that would have come out of that portfolio. It's just kind of like core, if you like, within that. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So it's going to exclude racking that's not fully utilized? I'm trying to just... Roderick Day : No, it's the buildings as opposed to the racking. If we sell a building or acquire a building in the period, we wouldn't include that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just a really quick data point. Two questions on Slide 8. Sorry if I missed that. Are those LTMs or are those quarterly figures? William L. Meaney: Those are LTM. Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And I don't know if you've mentioned it already, but would you mind giving the data point on how this would look like on a North America record management, like you did in the last few quarters? Those same metrics, but on a North America basis? William L. Meaney: Yes, I highlighted that in my remarks. If you go back -- I think you'll see that I went through. For instance, in North America, we added 1.3 million cubic feet of internal growth in the first half of this year. Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. So but you didn't specify those specific -- the things that make up the buyer [ph], you did not specify that specific what's organic versus disruption, et cetera, for North America, right? Like the equivalent of Slide 8 for North America? William L. Meaney: Yes, what I can give you is, for instance, is that below the bar, for North America, was minus 6.6%. Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then the... William L. Meaney: Which is a minus 6.7% in this one. And we can give you the numbers on above the bar. But what the North American -- so the North American below the bar is a little bit better than what it is on a consolidated basis. And then in terms of the net volume growth, before acquisitions, in North America, as I said, we added 1.3 million cubic feet. Roderick Day : Which is 0.3%. So you kind of got a minus 6.7%, you got a plus 7% on... Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Right, it improved. On an LTM basis, it improved versus Q4 and Q3 of last year. It's an improvement? William L. Meaney: Actually, yes. Operator : This concludes our Q&A session. Presenters, I would now like to turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks. William L. Meaney: Thank you, operator. To wrap up, we had a strong quarter that demonstrates the durability of Iron Mountain, as well as our renewed commercial focus in delivering, what we call, \"the power of the mountain\" to our customers through harnessing our scale in product development and solution delivery. We demonstrated progress with our strategic plan in several areas. We are getting more out of developed markets, with solid improvement in volume and improved trend in internal growth. We are building our business in emerging markets and continuing to drive strong organic growth there. And our conversion to a REIT is driving improved returns, enhanced disclosure, and we believe over time an expanded shareholder base. We feel very strongly as a real estate company, the REIT structure enhances the value to our shareholders. And we're committed to driving attractive returns through continued expected growth in OIBDA and, ultimately, FFO and AFFO of about 4%, and believe the durability and stable growth in our business will support growth in our dividend, in line with cash flow growth over the long term. Thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division  Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Tasha [ph], and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q3 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Melissa Marsden : Thank you, Tasha [ph], and welcome everyone to our Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and our progress towards strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and discuss portions of our supplemental reporting package. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2014 and 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William L. Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, with progress over -- on our 3-year strategic plan and other important initiatives. During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our performance in the developed markets, further expanded the portion of our business from faster-growing emerging markets, increased the momentum in our emerging business segment and accelerated our real estate purchase program. We also declared our first regular quarterly dividend as a REIT in the remainder of our EMP distribution, resulting in a substantial payout to stockholders. Our financial results for the quarter continued to reflect some noise related to our REIT conversion. I'll touch on the highlights, and Rod will address the specifics in a few minutes. Total revenue for the quarter was $783 million, up 3.9% on a constant dollar basis, in line with our 3-year plan to achieve 4% compounded annual growth. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS were both impacted by restructuring charges as well as ongoing REIT compliance costs, which were not in last year's numbers. Turning to the operating highlights. Total storage rental revenue, a key economic driver of our business, was up 5.6% in constant dollars, driven by strong growth of 12.5% in our international business, 3.3% in North American Records and Information Management and 1.9% growth in Data Management. Strong storage rental growth in the third quarter reflects our focus on driving net positive storage rental volume growth in developed markets. Year-to-date, we added 3.7 million cubic feet, net of acquisitions, or 0.8% volume growth. Of this amount, North America alone was positive 1.6 million cubic feet. We also continued to improve retention with further reductions in customer terminations and permanent withdrawals in North America, bringing total volume outflows down to 6.3% from 6.6% in the second quarter. The combination of improved customer retention, together with internal and new sales, has yielded North America the positive internal volume growth of 1.6 million cubic feet referenced above. These trends underscore the durability of our high-return business in the mature, developed markets, which remain fragmented with significant unvended potential, and the success of our targeted sales and customer retention initiatives. Turning to emerging market performance. As of the end of the third quarter, we now have 12.2% of total revenue coming from these high-growth markets, up from 10.5% at the beginning of the year, progressing nicely towards our goal of 16% by the end of 2016. Emerging market internal storage rental growth -- revenue growth was 10% in the third quarter, driven by internal volume growth of 9%. Including acquisition gains, volume growth was 19% in the emerging markets. Acquisitions continued to be an integral part of our strategy with particular emphasis on high-growth emerging markets. Since our last quarterly report, we closed on the acquisition of Keepers Brazil, our fourth acquisition there in the last 2 years. Brazil's record management market is expected to continue to grow in the high single digits annually for the next 3 to 5 years, and we are achieving steady improvement in profits and returns as we continue to enhance our leadership position. We also anticipate further enhancement as we shift operations to our new campus in Hortol\u00e2ndia, near S\u00e3o Paulo, over the next few years. Additionally, in Eastern Europe, we bought out the vast majority of our JV partners' interest in Serbia, Denmark, Russia and the Ukraine, and we acquired ALCZ, a provider of records management services in the Czech Republic, increasing the size of our business there by some 15%. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities in emerging markets with more than 4x the coverage needed to achieve our goal of having at least 16% of our sales from emerging markets by 2016. We continue to evaluate acquisitions in terms of how they can both further our market leadership and sustain the durability of our business, after first establishing that we can exceed our cost to capital and achieve our targeted returns. Within our emerging business opportunity area, we continue to experience good momentum in our data center operations. We will invest roughly $27 million this year to expand capacity by 25%, and deliver the space related to bookings in our Pennsylvania underground facility, where more than 90% of the inventory space is contracted. We also signed our first few deals in the initial phase of our new aboveground facility in Boston, and have a pipeline of about 3x our initial capacity. Our year-to-date investment in this business is about $19 million, and we plan to invest another $16 million or so in the fourth quarter to accommodate capacity requirements in the underground facility. As we've noted in the past, we will invest in our data center business based on customer wins. Another strategic goal as a REIT is our plan to own more of our real estate over time and continue to optimize our portfolio. Since the beginning of the year, we've bought in or have under contract more than 700,000 square feet of space, including properties in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Virginia as well as one building in Cork, Ireland. Our primary focus, however, will be on U.S. properties, where we have a total of 22.5 million square feet of purchase opportunity. Moreover, through purchase options, we have a clear path towards ownership of an additional 3.4 million square feet. Execution of these options would shift our own percentage by about 5 points, implying that together with the recent purchases, our owned or controlled portfolio of real estate represents approximately 40% of our total. Expected unlevered IRRs, or internal rates of return, on properties purchased to date are between 9% and 12%. It's important to note that we also have a substantial portion of our properties covered by attractive lease rates, given the long-term nature of those lease arrangements, so those will generally not be part of early purchase consideration. We also disposed of some older properties and will continue to prune the portfolio to maximize the value of our real estate holdings. In other REIT-related developments, we declared both our first regular quarterly dividend of $0.475 per share and a special distribution of $3.62 per share, representing the remainder of the EMP purge to be distributed 80% in stock and up to 20% in cash. As you may know, the 3-day pricing period for the special distribution ended last night, resulting in an average price of $35.55 per share. As a result, we expect to issue approximately 15.7 million shares, bringing our total outstanding to 209 million shares. Our quarterly dividend rate was based on an assumption of 209 million shares outstanding following the stock dividend. Subject to board approval, we expect to declare and pay another regular quarterly dividend of $0.475 per share in December. We also expect to declare and pay a catch-up dividend, which will represent the remainder of the total $400 million of ordinary dividends to be distributed in 2014. We don't yet know that precise per share rate, but we expect to outline the remaining 2014 payments later in November. These dividend payments are significant as they represent the culmination of our conversion to a REIT and demonstrate our commitment to enhancing stockholder returns through attractive payouts and steady long-term cash flow growth. At our current payout rate, in yesterday's share price, our dividend represents a 5.3% yield, well in excess of most REITs, and supports our goal to deliver total shareholder returns in excess of the 8% to 9% TSR, or total shareholder return, of the S&P 500. Combining our current yield of 5.3% with our expected adjusted OIBDA growth of approximately 4% results in a TSR for Iron Mountain of over 9% prior to dividend reinvestment and also before we add potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities. Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. After maintenance and IT-related CapEx and the dividend, we retained enough cash to support investment associated with internal growth in our core business. As we become more active with acquisitions and the purchase of real estate, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing or equity issuance, similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. As we've said from the beginning of the process, our business is well-suited to the REIT structure due to our sizable real estate portfolio and our attractive business model, through which we incur occupancy costs on a square-foot basis but generate storage rental revenue on a cubic foot basis. This significant spread between our costs and our return on investment generates high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders. We also distinguish ourselves through low-maintenance CapEx and low turnover costs per square foot. We have no TIs, or tenant improvements, required if a customer terminates, and we bring in another customer's records. We also have a low customer churn of less than 2% per annum, as well as excellent customer credit quality, given our service to 950 of the Fortune 1000. Due to the 15-year average life of a box in our storage facilities, we also have very low volatility in the growth of our storage rental business even during turbulent economic cycles. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod. Roderick Day : Thanks, Bill. We continue to be pleased with our operating performance. We had a solid third quarter, anchored by storage rental and improving volume growth as well as benefits from acquisitions in emerging and developed markets. I will begin today with an overview of our third quarter financial performance, followed by an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year, and a preliminary outlook for 2015. I will then address our capital deployment activities and conclude with a discussion of various REIT metrics. As a reminder, we now provide all of our financial disclosures and the earnings commentary in one comprehensive supplemental reporting package. I will be referring to certain pages of this package throughout my remarks. Turning to our financial results for the quarter. Let me direct you to financial highlights on Page 8. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $783 million for the quarter, up approximately 4% compared with $755 million in 2013. Adjusted OIBDA declined by approximately 2%, reflecting ongoing REIT compliance costs as well as acquisition-related costs when compared to prior year. Year-to-date adjusted OIBDA increased by 1%, which includes $3.5 million of costs associated with our 2013 restructuring and approximately $8 million of REIT compliance costs. For comparison, adjusted OIBDA for the first 9 months of 2013 included $5 million in restructuring charges. Adjusted EPS of $0.35 is consistent with our annual guidance. For the quarter, it would have been $0.40 prior to a $0.02 impact from ongoing REIT compliance costs and $0.03 impact from depreciation and amortization related to REIT CapEx and investments. Additionally, EPS for 2013 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. Similarly, our structural tax rate for year-to-date 2014 came out to 16%. We continue to believe our tax rate will be roughly in the same range over the long term. On a GAAP basis, net income was impacted by approximately $40 million tax provision, which represents the revisions or estimates made in the second quarter for the reversal of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the REIT conversion and taxes related to foreign repatriation. Also highlighted on this page are investment and capital expenditures. Year-to-date maintenance CapEx of roughly $45 million is on a run rate to be below our $80 million to $100 million full year guidance range. However, we typically see the majority of capital improvement projects undertaken in the latter portion of the year. Other CapEx of $33 million is roughly in line with the $50 million midpoint of our full year guidance, and real estate investment of $145 million, which includes racking, is on track with our full year expectation of around $200 million. As Bill noted, we are accelerating our efforts to own more of our real estate over time, and you can track the changes to our global real estate portfolio on Page 19. Over the long term, we believe that the purchase of our real estate will create value for our shareholders. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental revenue growth. On Page 9, looking at the top line growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis, revenue is up 3.9%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5.6% and service revenue growth of 1.3%. The growth in service revenue was driven by recent acquisitions and increases in imaging projects. On a constant dollar basis, year-to-date total revenue growth was 4.3%, driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5.5% and service revenue growth of 2.6%. Also on the same page, we show total worldwide volume growth. We continue to demonstrate improvement in net volume growth in Records Management with total year-on-year volume growth in the quarter of 5.5% including acquisitions, or 1.8% excluding acquisitions. Volume trends remain consistent with prior quarters, demonstrating stable incoming volume from existing customers, important additional contributions from acquisitions and further improvements in the level of terminations and withdrawals. Let's turn to Page 11, where we present components of growth on a segment basis. Q3 segment results were generally in line with our expectations, as our storage rental revenue continues to exhibit durability. North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and adjusted OIBDA expansion of 160 basis points to 39.5%. North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.4%. However, the decline in service revenues in the DM business drove adjusted OIBDA margins for this segment down for the quarter. That said, DM remains a high-margin business of 56.2%. Declines in service revenues continue to reflect the trends towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as our customers rotate their tapes less frequently and the biggest business becomes more archival. The International segment continued to generate attractive results with 6.8% storage rental internal growth. Internal service revenue growth for this segment declined by approximately 1.5%, primarily due to the reduction in nonrecurring customer projects. The International business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis, in line with our mid-20s targets, with adjusted OIBDA margins of 24.5% year-to-date. Finally, Corporate and Other revenue was up about 10%, reflecting growth in data-centric service revenues. As Bill noted, we are making good progress, and we expect to end the year near a $20 million revenue run rate. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2014 and preliminary guidance for 2015, on Page 10. Our business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent, and we are on track to achieve our financial goals for 2014. Therefore, we are maintaining the majority of our 2014 guidance whilst tightening some of our ranges. That said, we have made 2 changes to our guidance that impact earnings per share. The first relates to the partial year impact of new shares that will be issued as a result of the special distribution. This will obviously impact our per-share metrics. The second relates to foreign exchange pressures. For the first half of the year, modest pressures from FX were offset by contribution from acquisitions and consistent core performance, which allowed us to remain comfortable within our previous ranges. However, as we have progressed through the year, we have witnessed further material strengthening of the dollar, which is outweighing the benefit from acquisitions and consistent performance. In the light of these recent changes, it is prudent to adjust for the known currency impact at this time. So as a result of the stock distribution and the impact of the foreign currency exchange rates, we have reduced adjusted EPS guidance for 2014 to $1.33 to $1.44 from our current range of $1.37 to $1.52. In addition, normalized FFO per share will be reduced to $2.21 to $2.46 from the current range of $2.25 to $2.51. Moving on to our preliminary guidance for 2015. From an operational standpoint, we believe we are on track to deliver our long-term goals, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. We are projecting constant dollar revenue growth of 1% to 5% and growth in adjusted OIBDA of 2% to 5%, in line with our strategic plan. Please note these growth ranges are in constant dollars based on our 2014 budget constant dollar rates. If the dollar remains strong, the current estimated impact on revenue and contribution could be at 100 to 150 basis points. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.38 for 2015. To be clear, this guidance reflects an anticipation of an absolute increase in total earnings in constant dollars, offset on a per-share basis by the impact of the additional 15.8 million shares issued in connection with the special distribution. Driven by the consistent growth in our business and stable fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to be between $440 million and $480 million, with AFFO between $570 million and $610 million. And, in addition, we anticipate that our dividend growth will continue to be in line with contribution growth. From a CapEx standpoint, we expect to maintain level spend on maintenance CapEx and acquisitions, although we anticipate an uptick in real estate investment driven by our purchase plan. We will update our outlook again on our Q4 earnings call to reflect changes, if any, including the impact of FX. Shifting to the balance sheet. Pages 25 and 26 present our debt maturity schedule and related metrics. At quarter end, we had liquidity of about $1.2 million. Our total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 5.2x has increased over the past 3 years, as planned, to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. At today's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 36%. We continue to shift our debt financing to international markets. In addition to having our expenses denominated in local currencies, we have long-dated bonds in Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, euro and more currencies available under our credit facility. This provides a natural foreign exchange hedge to support our growth in international markets and reduce taxable income in local jurisdictions. In September, we issued the equivalent of about GBP 400 million in a private pounds sterling fed offering in the U.K., and established a line of credit in Brazil to support our growth. Turning now to REIT-specific metrics on Page 20. We have provided storage NOI per racked square foot, which highlights the attractive economics we derive from our real estate for both our RM and DP businesses. We continue to achieve storage NOI in excess of $21 per square foot, amongst the highest in the REIT sector. On Page 21, our racking and building utilization rates remain high and in line with prior quarter at 91% and 83%, respectively. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time. On Page 28, we have provided components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. Finally, we are currently showing investment in buildings, racking and acquisition at book value, but it's our intent ultimately to provide a schedule of these investment categories with our expected returns. As we have stated in the past, we will continue to enhance our supplemental reporting, and we welcome your feedback. So, in summary, Q3 was a solid quarter, consistent with prior performance and supported by a sustained storage rental performance, stable profitability on our North American segments and strong international and emerging market performance. I will now hand the call back to Bill. William L. Meaney: Thanks, Rod. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to sum up by saying that despite some noise this quarter due to one-offs and aligning ourselves as a REIT, we are in line with our expectations and consistent with the strategic plan we laid out at Investor Day. The fundamentals are important, and we're pleased with the positive momentum we're seeing in the business. More specifically, we are driving volume in storage rental across both developed and emerging markets, we're shifting our revenue mix to faster growing emerging markets, and we're executing on attractive acquisitions and focusing on building scale, particularly given the highly fragmented nature of the markets we operate in. Our momentum leading into 2015 is strong. Our storage rental revenue internal growth accelerated to 2.2% in the third quarter, having started the year in the first quarter at 1.4%. In addition to continue strong internal volume growth in our Emerging Markets of 9%, we added 3.7 million cubic feet of internal growth in our developed markets as well, and added 1.6 million cubic feet in North America alone. In our emerging business area, we expanded capacity in the data center business by 25%, and more than 90% of the inventory space is contracted. And we've added another 700,000 square feet to our owned real estate portfolio at unlevered returns between 9% and 12%. 2015 preliminary guidance calls for similar growth in operating performance and adjusted OIBDA, although we anticipate some reported revenue headwinds due to the continued strengthening of the dollar. We expect consistent trends for durable storage rental revenue in developed markets, and are on track to continue to make emerging markets a more significant portion of our overall sales mix. And we continue to identify and incubate new business opportunities that are complementary to our core business. We believe the culmination of these key drivers in steady growth in earnings and AFFO, consistent with our [indiscernible] day projections and related growth in our dividend. With that, Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I wanted to dive into the acceleration of the internal storage revenue growth. Obviously, it was very encouraging, but the service revenue was down more. And my question is, aren't these 2 sort of tied, like fewer destructions means less service revenues, which helps accelerate internal storage? And of course, storage is a better business. And so when you put that all together, I see you're looking for 1% to 2% internal for 2015. I assume you think that service will be kind of stable or positive to get there. So just help me with the confluence between service and storage internal revenue growth in the quarter and how it frames your 2015 comments. William L. Meaney: So let me start, Andrew, and then I'll let Rod chime in on it. I mean, first of all, the thing you're highlighting is part of the story, but I think it's only part of the story. I think if you actually look at our service revenue, is in the data management space or our tape business, that's where we've seen more of an acceleration or a continued increase in terms of the drop in service revenue. It's starting to slow down, but that's the area which probably started a little bit after the drop in service revenue in our box business, but is still continuing, whereas in the box business, we do see more stability. Some of it is a reduction in destructions because there is some -- as we said last time on the call, there's some choppiness in terms of the way legal holds come in and out in terms of when things are queued up for destruction. But also, a part of the story is the data management business. So we feel good where we're guiding in terms of the overall growth in storage rental, and I think we said at the beginning of the year, we expected to get back into the 2s, and we've achieved that. So we feel like we're set up for good momentum next year, but I think it is important to call out that in our data management business, we continue to see a decline in service as that business becomes more and more archival. And then Rod, if you want to add anything? Roderick Day : Yes. I mean, Andrew, obviously, there's a small sort of relationship between lower destructions and then impacting service revenues. So we're not hiding from that, but it's not really what's explaining what's going on in service. And just on that particular point, clearly, we'd rather have the queues given the sort of the perpetuity value of them than take the destruction revenue. So in terms of long-term value for the business, it's clearly a trade-off that we'd want to make. In terms of looking to 2015 and sort of answering that part of your question, what we're expecting within the numbers, certainly, we expect to sort of maintain the improved and good performance I think we're now seeing on the storage side. We're not expecting a sort of radical turnaround in service by any means, but we would expect to see some more modest improvements, particularly in areas such as our imaging business, which is actually showing reasonable progress this year at reasonable margins as well. So areas like that we're looking into to see what we can do to continue to drive performance. So hopefully that answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : On the service question. I'm curious about the special projects. Could you talk about what you're seeing, ebbs and flows there, and what your outlook is going forward for how meaningful those will be? William L. Meaney: I think that -- Scott, I think, these are -- they are large, specific projects. Sometimes they are consulting projects, when we are bringing a new customers in, there's a number of things that they want to look at in terms of cleaning up some of their processes or digitizing parts of their inventory. So it's everything from bringing in new customers and some of the costs associated with that from their standpoint, to one-off projects again, where customers are going through a major cleanup or digitization of some of their records. So it's one of those areas which is probably the more difficult to guide for, because it's something that is usually driven by customer relationships and specific asks on their part. So it is something that we market for, but it's something that is hard to predict. Roderick Day : And I think that's right, and actually, it can be a little bit lumpy. I mean, our business is obviously pretty predicable when compared to most businesses. But in Q3 last year, we actually had quite a large project in the data management space that kind of impacted some of our comparables. But they can be profitable lines of activity for us, so we'd expect to continue doing them, but they can sort of jump around a little bit quarter to quarter. William L. Meaney: And the only thing I would add to that is we expect that and it is -- you can think of it as also a -- it's a marketing expense that has a very nice profit associated with it in terms of either maintaining a strong customer relationship as a way we differentiate ourselves with our customers, or, as I said earlier, in terms of getting a customer in, but it is also an area where we're able to variabilize our cost base. So it's something that we can preserve the margins, even though you have this lumpiness, but it's very much part of why we -- our revenue is so sticky, because we're able to provide these additional services to our customers when they need it. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : . Now I may have missed this. Did you indicate your expectation within guidance for paper prices in 2015? Roderick Day : I didn't actually say anything on that, but our expectation would be for it to be flat year-over-year. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then could you address swing factors with regard to high end, low end of guidance range for 2015? I imagine that the sizable acquisition pipeline will contribute there, but -- to the high end or the low end. But could you talk to some other drivers you think that will be meaningful in swinging the variance? Roderick Day : Well, certainly, as you say, acquisitions, both in terms of the rate at which we bring on businesses and the speed at which we're able to integrate them have an impact. And for sure -- and as we look to next year, FX is going to be an issue. We've seen, as I was saying in the remarks earlier, that the dollar has strengthened, particularly over the last month or so. Clearly, that could get stronger, it could get weaker, and so we're studying that closely, and we'd look to update guidance at the beginning of next year as regards to FX, but that is an issue just given the sort of the global nature of our business. And you mentioned the shreds paper price, that's always a volatility that we have to manage. And another one within that for us will be our DMS scanning business, which has a sort of project component to it. To sort of build on the conversation we were talking about earlier, is that we are making reasonable progress actually in that area at the moment, and we -- obviously, we hope to continue to do so. But that's another item that can move. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : And then just one final one for me. Are you content with the size of the sales force you have, where they're focused, where they're located? Any major internal initiatives on that front into 2015? William L. Meaney: I think we are -- I think on that point is that where our investment on the sales force is less on organization and reorg. We think the reorganization we did last year to get them much more in tune and closer to the market. Because as I said in my remarks, our market is still very fragmented, so we wanted to make sure that we were aligning the sales force with those real opportunities and unvended opportunities are. I think our focus this year now is less on the reorganization, because we think we've got that right, but more on the training in performance management of the sales force. So that's really the focus, and so we think we've got the right numbers, we've got them in the right places, and now it's about equipping them from a training in performance management standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.  Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Going deeper into the storage business, can you map out how you expect volume and pricing trends to play out in your various geographies and what implications that will mean for future internal storage growth trends? William L. Meaney: I think that the -- let me kind of back up and just highlight kind of the journey that we're on. So if you look at, say, a year ago, pretty much all of '13, you would see if we net out acquisitions, then you would have about 1.1% growth rate in terms of net incoming volume on the storage business, or on the box business, right? And if you look at where -- if you look at '14, I mean -- yes, '14, during that same period, you'll see that we've trended up from 1.5% net volume internal growth rate to this latest quarter of 1.8%. So, if you think about it, we've added 70 bps over the course of the year in terms of our internal growth rate. So if you're seeing -- and then at the same time, you see what we've done on the revenue side, as we said, we started off at 1.4% in terms of storage internal growth rate, in terms of revenue, and we're up to 2.2%. What we see going forward is, and it kind of relates to the last question from Scott in terms of what we're doing with our sales force, is we really do think now that we've got the sales force organized in the right buckets and looking at the right opportunities is -- and now we're spending -- investing a lot more money and time in terms of the training in performance management of that sales force. So, what we would see is that continued trend going forward. We do think that, from a pricing standpoint, as we start going into some of the unvended areas, we would expect that we could continue the type of performance that we've got in the latest quarter. So that's -- and that's really what we're focused on right now, and we're seeing that. And when you ask about geographies, the big part of that growth, that 70 basis points of growth that I've highlighted in terms of across our business, has been mainly -- the improvements mainly come out of -- or the deltas come out of the developed market. So a lot of this realignment of the sales force has been focused at the developed market, which is far from being dead, because I said it's still -- we find the developed markets, when we really got into it, is much more fragmented and much more unvended than we previously suspected. So we would expect to be able to continue the kind of performance that we saw in the third quarter going forward into '15.  Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Very helpful, Bill. And then on the services side, can you provide some additional color on the rate at which services trends are stabilizing? Any positive or negative catalyst that can move the needle with services? William L. Meaney: Let me just stay high level. I'm going to let Rod comment in a little bit more in detail. I think that it's a tale of 2 -- let's take 3 different components of looking at the services. The one part on the box side of the business, which I think we've been calling out for the last couple of quarters, we see a flattening out of that. In other words, that business is becoming more archival, but we see kind of a stabilization in terms of the service rates that we're getting in that business, and we've been very successful in terms of stripping out costs as that business is becoming more archival. So we've got a good match between our costs and our activities in the box business, and we see a flattening out of that decline. If we look in the data management business, is we see continued single-digit decline, but significant single-digit decline in that business over time, then we're able to reduce costs in line with that. But we think that, if we look at it, we think the data management business, or the tape business, is a little bit behind in the life cycle in terms of trending towards the archival side of the business. So I think we're in the earlier part of the game, if you will, in terms of that flattening out. So I wouldn't call that as a flattening-out trend yet, but we're able to manage it from a margin standpoint. And then the third bucket is really some of the things that we were referring to before, is the DMS or, in some places we call it BPM-type processes, and there, there's 2 parts of it. There is what I would call the ones that are much more long-contracted, embedded part of the process with our customers, and these are multiyear contracts, where it's kind of an ongoing trend. And then we have some of these large projects, which are usually associated with a change or a specific need for the customers. But I don't know, Rod, if you want to comment in more detail? Roderick Day : I don't know, I think you've hit on the sort of the key dynamics that we see. I suppose that the other point I would make is within services, where we have the shredding business as well, which is performing this year. But as I was saying earlier, the importance of paper price can sort of swing that up or down. It's actually been pretty stable this year. But I think in terms of the sort of the fundamental dynamics of -- and the bottoming out, some signs of bottoming out within RM, less so within DM. I think probably, the only other thing I'd add is then, obviously what we do try to do is make sure we're managing costs very tightly against whatever revenues that we have. I think it's been said on a number of occasions, it's the storage part of our business is where most of the value comes from. Services is an important contributor, but less material in terms of overall value. So the challenge for us is as these trends sort of work their way out, we need to -- and have been continuing to sort of make sure our costs are mapped accordingly.  Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : Very helpful. And then just from a margin perspective, we had some impact this quarter from REIT compliance costs and acquisition-related costs. Just looking ahead, how do you expect these costs to evolve? And what kinds of sources of margin expansion can help mitigate these incremental costs? Roderick Day : Well, certainly, the REIT costs that we now include in our adjusted OIBDA, are those that -- essentially, those costs are the need to allow us to sustain the REIT structure going forward. So, if you think -- we're effectively incurring them this year, we would expect to incur them again next year. So from a year-on-year dynamic, this year is kind of a negative because we didn't have them last year. Next year, it will be neutral from a year-on-year perspective. I think in terms of acquisitions, it will depend obviously on the -- what the future acquisition program is and how it plays out. The way that we work our acquisitions today is that in the first year, there's typically a significant amount of integration expense as we look to make sure we drive the synergies out of the businesses that we get. And then from year 2, the benefits really start to flow through. So, from the acquisitions that we've made so far, clearly, there will be a benefit year-on-year as we go '15 to '14. I think in terms of what does that mean fully in '15, it will depend on when we do any more acquisitions going forward, and the sort of the level of them. We're expecting that our acquisition program will be similar in scale, but clearly, it's always hard to predict exactly what we'll be able to close. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Let me just -- following up on that margin question, and I apologize if some of this -- I did hear was in the prepared remarks. But on the international margin decline, what -- I mean, that was down 290 basis points. I assume some of that was these M&A costs. But can you maybe give us that number in the magnitude just to kind of help us think about what's going on there? Roderick Day : Well, I think what we do on the international side is we really try to manage it so over the course of the year, we're around the 25% mark. So year-to-date, I think we're at 24.5%. I think in the quarter itself, it was below that. Certainly, that number is the one that tends to get impacted more by phasing of acquisition -- the acquisition integration spend because that's where a significant amount of our acquisitions have been. So it can sort of jump around a bit depending on whether we're investing to get synergies or the synergies are coming out. But overall, I think we're quite happy where we're at, tracking to the sort of mid-20s margin, and that's pretty much where we are year-to-date. William L. Meaney: Yes, the only thing I'd add to it. You -- just reiterating or emphasizing what Rod is saying is we wouldn't change -- we've said that -- we had that program to target the improvement to get up to 25% or mid-20% margins in the international portfolio, we wouldn't move off of that. You will get noise from time to time because of the timing of certain acquisitions and integration costs associated with that, but we feel pretty good about the portfolio as it is today that the maturing of some and adding of others that we think that mid-20s in terms of margin target is where we'll maintain. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. I guess, my second question is kind of a 2-part, I guess, around M&A. I mean, the first part, just mechanically, how much M&A revenue is assumed in the 2015 guidance? And I guess, the capital that you're planning in the guidance to spend, do you have revenue and OIBDA attached to that in the guidance? Or would that be incremental? That's the first part. And then I guess, the second part of the question would be, given the leverage and the capital needs that you have, is there anything that would prohibit you from doing larger acquisitions if they came to the market maybe through an equity issuance? And how do you think about your cost to capital here as ability to do that? Roderick Day : Maybe just to answer the first point, if you look at what we've done, the year-on-year benefit from acquisitions will be $30 million. And in terms of future spend do you want to... William L. Meaney: I think it's hard to say what we can and we can't do in terms of acquisitions. We don't see a need on the -- this year, we obviously didn't need to do a major equity raise. So I suppose these things are always possible, but this year, for sure, we didn't have to contemplate anything like that to do the acquisitions that we have. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Right. But if something was to be more material, where it wasn't the smaller acquisitions that are out here, is equity a potential tool that you could use? Roderick Day : Yes, equity is always a potential tool, but I don't like to talk about hypotheticals when -- because it depends on what the markets are doing and everything else. So -- but I mean, equity and debt are always the tool that you have when you're investing in your business or doing acquisitions. But, as I said, this past year, we didn't have to contemplate that. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got it. And just to be clear, that $30 million benefit from M&A in 2015, that's -- you said, Rod, that, that was from the acquisitions that have been completed year-to-date, that doesn't include any potential acquisitions? Roderick Day : Yes, that's exactly right, Justin, that's where we're at. And then, clearly, if we are to do more, there will be more coming through. We'll obviously look to update the guidance at the end of next quarter on this because it can be a material impact on our numbers, but that's kind of where we're heading at the moment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I wanted to start just a little bit on Slide 9, just going over some of the trends over there. On the bottom chart, in Records Management volume growth, since the beginning of the year, we've seen the out firm terminations go down. I was wondering how much of that is kind of a natural change that you're seeing? And how much of that had to do with the contracting -- proactive contracting changes that you guys made? And should we expect that to continue to improve through the course of next year? William L. Meaney: Shlomo, it's Bill. It's a good question. I think that what I would say is that we're down to really where you would expect to be, roughly around the -- we're at 1.9%. So yes, the 2% to 1.9%, I think is probably the right level of that. And I wouldn't say it was even the contracting terms, I think it just came down to good customer service and good customer management. I think -- quite frankly, we had take our eye off the ball. We've introduced some software and tools, which I think we discussed at Investor Day, which has really helped us identify when we were kind of off the point in terms of customer service so that we could intervene before we had what I would call a significant customer service failure. So I think that has helped. So we've been able to play a lot better defense by keeping our customers happy and servicing them more proactively, and that's really helped a lot. So, believe it or not, it's just been focusing on the basics of the business rather than any magic from either contracting or anything else. But I think at some point, I think that clearly, the 2.7%, if you look back in Q4 of 2012, was way too high. And I think we're getting to the levels that I think a business with a good customer service apparatus would be targeting. So I think we're in the zone now. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And I appreciate that. What about the organic side of the business over there -- we saw 6.8 going down to 6.1. Is that -- where is your sense of that kind of stabilizing? And is that the manifestation of kind of industry trends? How should we think of it? I know clearly, the goal is to offset the 2 that we're talking about right now, just trying to gauge if that's going to be kind of -- you've achieved the optimum. Or where you think you can get on the bottom? Where we are on that side of it? William L. Meaney: I think -- look, I think part of it is driven by mix, quite frankly. In other words -- and not just in the North American versus international, but even the country mix within international, there are certain countries that we find that we're going into that are really at the early stages of outsourcing, and there are other ones that we're entering and they are more mature in their outsourcing, so they have lower growth rates. The other thing is -- and also being honest about it is that there's -- it's more art than science how we split between the new sales and the organic. Because in the new sales, it's both new logos and new business opportunities with existing customers. So it's a little bit -- so you have to kind of look at both numbers together, but I would say right now is -- clearly, in the mature markets is that we've always said they're kind of in the 6% to 7% range. Some of them are more trending towards the 6%. Some of them are still kind of in the upper 6% to 7%. And then the other thing is even in the emerging markets, we find quite significant variances between what the organic growth rate is in different countries. So some of the organic growth rates in some of the emerging markets, for instance, is north of 10%, and others is at 7%. So I think it's both a country mix issue. I think it's even within the developed markets, there's a mix across countries. And then the other aspect about it is there is an art rather than scientific split between new sales and the organic. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, good. And then just a couple of other ones. Rod, will changes to FX impact the $4.10 to $4.20 in dividends expected for 2015? Roderick Day : I guess it would depend on the extent of any FX change. I think sitting where we are today, we would be pretty comparable with that range. But I suppose I'm just putting a caveat out there, if things were to take a real, significant turn for the worse in terms of a real material strengthening of the dollar, we just have to sort of reserve the right to have a look at that. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Sure. But just leaving the exchange rates where they are today and just carrying them forward, you're comfortable with that $4.10 to $4.20? Roderick Day : Yes, that's fine. But as I -- Shlomo, we've seen quite a marked shift just in the last month. So, it may even come back to our advantage, but it is a bit volatile at the moment. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Sure, got it. And then finally, Bill, where do you guys stand in terms of going after the smaller business and the Cornerstone acquisition? I noticed it was kind of a strategic, a little bit more platform over there. We talked about progress in prior quarters. Can you just give us an update there? William L. Meaney: Yes, thanks. That's a good question. Well, first of all, I think that we still remain focused on what I would call that middle market, because that tends to be, say both very fragmented and very unvended, right? So we think that's kind of a really interesting area, and there's a lot of growth in that segment. So I would say that it's early days in terms of us fully capturing the revenue synergies, if you will, or kind of the D&A synergies that we aim to get from the Cornerstone in the sense that, this year, we did the reorganization, the whole sales force. So the sales force is aligned to go after that highly fragmented and unvended middle market, but we've concentrated our training this year more on the verticals. And this -- in 2015, actually starting I think it's next quarter, so the last quarter of this year and early in 2015 is we're really focusing, rolling out both our training in performance management associated with that unvended middle market part of the segment where Cornerstone played quite well at. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And is pricing higher or lower over there versus the larger... William L. Meaney: It tends to be higher, and -- but also, the service cost is higher associated with these, because these are smaller -- obviously smaller customers. So we do see a correlation between size of customer and pricing, but also, our cost is different, servicing this. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks? Roderick Day : Actually, I just wanted to make a clarification. In my statement earlier, I think I said that we would -- our current liquidity is $1.2 million. We're actually down to our last $1 billion as opposed $1 million. So I should have said $1.2 billion. Just so, in case anyone was having a heart attack. So, thanks. William L. Meaney: Thank you very much. Thanks for all your time, and we'll speak to you next quarter. Thanks. Roderick Day : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Baird George Tong - Piper Jaffray Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Dan Dolev - Jefferies Operator : Good morning. My name is Kavita, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q4 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ms. Melissa Marsden. Please go ahead. Melissa Marsden : Thank you, Kavita. And welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and year end 2014 earnings conference call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and year, as well as progress towards our strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and updated guidance for 2015. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we have done for the past couple of quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on our Investor Relations page of the website at www.ironmountain.com under investorrelations/financialinformation. Referring now to page two of that supplemental package. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? Bill Meaney : Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I think, given recent new stories following on from our December announcement with respect to a proposal to acquire Recall. I think, I should just make a statement before we get into discussing our results for both the quarter and the year. We strongly believe that our acquisition of Recall would provide both companies shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in the growth of the combined businesses with attractive growth prospects. We believe that there is significant value creation potential from such a transaction for both companies customers as well. We continue to try to figure out ways to narrow the valuation gap, but will only pursue a deal at the right price. We have nothing to report at this time. With that, let me turn to our results. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, wrapping up an eventful year of good progress on our three-year strategic plan and our successful conversion to a REIT. During 2014, we continue to improve results in our developed markets, expanded our exposure to faster growing emerging markets and generated momentum in our emerging business segment. In addition, we expanded our REIT investor outreach and we were added to the MSCI REIT in the FTSE/NAREIT indices, inclusion in these important benchmarks is important for generating a high level -- a higher level of awareness of Iron Mountain as an attractive REIT investment. Let me now turn to financial highlights, Rod, will have more in a few minutes. On a constant dollar basis, our financial results for 2014 were right in line with our expectations. The significant strengthening of the dollar in the fourth quarter impacted our reported figures as it did for most multinational, resulting in growth in total revenue and adjusted OIBDA of over 3%, including restructuring charges. But on a constant dollar basis, we believe more -- which we believe more accurately reflects core operating performance, growth in these measures was just under 5% at the top end of our ranges. These results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our three-year plan to achieve 4% compounded annual growth on a constant dollar basis in both total revenues and adjusted OIBDA. Turning to operating highlights, total storage revenue, the key economic driver of our business was up 5.4% in constant dollars for the year, driven by strong growth of 13% in our international business and roughly 3% gain in both our North American Records and Information Management and Data Management segments. These results reflect our continued focus on driving net positive Records Management volume in storage rental revenue growth in developed markets and further penetration into higher growth emerging markets. In developed markets, we further sharpened our focus with the fourth quarter sale of our shredded operations in the U.K., Ireland and Australia. We chose to divest these businesses because they were much smaller than our North American operations and we did not benefit from the same scale. At the same time, we acquired Securit Records Management in Canada, which brought us nine facilities in 3 million cubic feet of records, including available space to support the on-boarding of a major new customer. In Records Management, we added more than 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a base of 500 million cubic feet at the beginning of the year or 3.6% net growth. The growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround from negative to positive internal volume growth, in other words, before any impact of acquisitions, we achieved in North America. Importantly, North America represented 20% or more than 20% of our gain for the year, excluding volume from acquisitions. Globally, we maintained customer churn of under 2%. This is unchanged from Q3 levels but represents a 30% improvement over the level of customer losses experienced two years ago. This combination of improved customer retention, growth in new sale and consistent new volume from existing customers drove 3.5% internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter, continuing the steady improvement we achieved throughout the year. Our strong fourth quarter growth rate did benefit from favorable comps relative to the 1.3% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, but even when normalizing for that we saw a nice pickup and are pleased with the momentum as we head into 2015. Our internal storage rental revenue growth expectations for this year are in the range of 2% to 2.5%. Turning to emerging markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high-growth countries represent 13.9% of our total revenues at the end of the year on a constant dollar basis using our 2014 FX budget rates and a 12.8% on reported basis. You\u2019ll hear from Rod that FX currency rates will be a drag on reported performance this year. Whilst our operating margin in virtually all our countries are naturally hedged and preserved, like most multinationals we\u2019re not immune to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings impact in U.S. dollars. However, given our opportunity to expand internationally on what is today a relatively small international base, we like the fact that we have the benefit of investing in U.S. dollars overseas during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in these markets as they\u2019re beginning to embrace outsourcing of enterprise storage, especially given the durability of our business. Both internal total revenue and internal storage rental growth in these markets was more than 15% in the fourth quarter. In addition, unlike more mature multinational growth rates are fairly similar around the globe, we are in a unique position to invest in our capital markets where we are still early in the growth cycle enabling us to capture higher growth rates of a lower basis, thereby enhancing our returns in the medium-to-long term. Given this is a backdrop, acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy with a focus on high-growth emerging markets. We completed $190 million of acquisitions in 2014, including the records inventory of smaller Records Management companies with more than $125 million of the total in emerging markets through Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific regions. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in emerging markets with more than four times the coverage needed to achieve our goal of 16% on a constant dollar basis and will continue to evaluate those opportunities in light of our targeted returns in favorable underlying growth dynamics that support the durability of our business. Within our emerging business opportunity area, we continue to make progress in our data center operations. We have invested more than $70 million to date with $35 million of that in 2014 expanding our capacity in the underground facility in delivering our first phase in Boston. Whilst absorption in our Boston data center is just beginning to pick up on a blended basis, we have achieved stabilized unlevered return on invested capital in this business of 9%, which we feel -- which we feel is good given how recently we added our new capacity and expected this return will stabilize at 11% to 12% on a fully utilized basis. We continue to evaluate other emerging business opportunities that leverage our unique platform as a leader in enterprise storage. We see the potential to extend our brand strength in chain of custody and logistics to a broader range of offerings. Many of these opportunities are customer driven where they asked for our assistance in solving an enterprise storage need whether it be upstream in their supply chain or downstream to support distribution. We expect to have more on this at our Investor Day in October. These facets of our strategic plan, all support the durability of our business, the sustainability of our cash flow and are fit as a REIT. When you consider the nature of our business, our enterprise storage foundation compares very favorably with self-storage. We have superior customer credit quality given our service to more than 92% of the Fortune 1000. We serve more than 155,000 business customers, which leads to a diversified revenue stream in low customer churn of less than 2% per year. Unlike consumer self-storage where customers tend to be in transition and frequently have more temporary need, the average life of a box in our facilities is 15 years. This means we have very low volatility. In fact, we posted 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, which persisted even throughout the great financial crisis. And like self-storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers underlying storage needs. We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector if you think about the nature of our operating facilities. The major difference is that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot. We're essentially renting air. This multiplier effect generates a significant spread between our costs and our return on investment. It yields a very high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders. Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invested incremental racking structures within an existing industrial shell, we can generate very strong returns due to this volume dynamic. As we\u2019ve talked on recent calls, we intend to buy $800 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. This supports our REIT status but it also means we have more optionality over the long term. If we consolidate in the market and exit buildings that we own, we can leased them to customers for other industrial or distribution uses or we can create value by selling them or redeveloping the underlying real estate in infill markets for alternative use. Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and execute our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance, similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. You may have seen that the board declared our first quarter dividend of $0.475 per share this week at a $40 stock price. Our implied cap rate is about 7.5% well above where other property sectors are trading. At the same share price, our dividend represents a 4.8% yield, well in excess of most REITs, combined with our goal to grow adjusted OIBDA by 4% on a compounded rate. Our dividend level supports our goal to deliver total shareholder returns in line with the 8% to 9% TSR or total shareholder return of the S&P 500. And this goal is prior to any potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rod. Rod Day : Thanks Bill. We continue to execute well against our strategic plan. And we're pleased with our strong operating performance for the year. Our results underscore the durability of our storage rental business and demonstrate the benefit of acquisitions we have made in emerging and developed markets. I\u2019ll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance, followed by an update on our outlook for 2015. I will then address our capital deployment activities and conclude with a discussion of various REIT metrics. Please note that throughout my prepared remarks, I will reference selected slides from our comprehensive supplemental reporting package, which can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Turning to our financial results for the quarter and the year, let me direct you to the financial highlights on page 8. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $778 million, up approximately 1% compared with Q4 of 2013 and up 5% on a constant dollar basis. For the year, total revenues grew by 3% to $3.1 billion, or by 4% on a constant dollar basis and in constant dollars at the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $220 million, compared with $195 million in 2013. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA grew by 4% to $926 million or by 5% to $934 million on a constant dollar basis. For comparison, adjusted OIBDA for 2014 included $3.5 million of costs associated with the company\u2019s restructuring initiative. In addition, adjusted OIBDA in 2013 included $19 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million in the full year of restructuring costs. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.25 per diluted share, compared with $0.21 in 2013. For full year 2014, adjusted EPS of $1.36 was within our guidance range. As we highlighted on our Q3 earnings call, adjusted EPS for the full year was impacted by REIT compliance costs and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our conversion to a REIT as well as acceleration of real estate consolidation and some of our acquisitions. It\u2019s important to note that adjusted EPS for 2013 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. Our structural rate for the year came out to 14% as a result of lower pre-tax income in international jurisdictions, which was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long term. The fundamentals of our business remained strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental revenue growth. On page 9, topline growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis was up 5%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 4%. The growth in service revenue was driven by increased project activity, improvement in paper revenue, and recent acquisitions. On a constant dollar basis, full year total revenue growth was 4% driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 3%. Also on the same page, we show total worldwide volume growth. We continue to demonstrate improvements in net volume growth in Records Management, with total year-on-year volume growth of 3.6%, including acquisitions or 1.9%, excluding acquisitions. Growth, excluding acquisitions, maintained the steady improvements in performance that we have seen in the last two years. Within this, we continue to see strong volume from existing customers, provided approximately 30 million cubic feet of storage worldwide in this category. This number of boxes is consistent with prior years, but the percentage growth dipped to just below 6% in Q4, driven by the denominator effects of our growing base of records under management. Let\u2019s turn to page 12 where we present components of growth on a segment basis. Q4 and full year segment results were generally in line with our expectations, as our strong storage rental revenue continues to exhibit durability. North American records and information management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of 38.5% during the fourth quarter and the year. North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 6% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year. During the fourth quarter, the strong storage rental growth in DM more than offset the decline in service revenues, resulting in adjusted OIBDA expansion of 130 basis points. Declines in service revenues and Data Management continue to reflect the trends towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues, as our customers rotate their taste less frequently and the business becomes more archival. The International segment continued to generate attractive results, with 8% storage rental internal growth and 4% internal service revenue growth for the quarter. For the full year, storage rental internal growth was 6% and internal service revenue growth was 2%. The international business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in line with our mid 20s targets for the year. Adjusted OIBDA margins for the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to continuous improvement in integration expenses and other IT project expenses. Let me direct you now to page 11, where we lay out our performance for the year against our guidance. We will cover this as a high level noting that constant dollar revenue and adjusted OIBDA were at the high end of our growth expectations. Our full year FFO and AFFO were also in line with our expectations, excluding the impact of FX. Our total distributions for the year, including the E&P purge or special distribution, were about $1.1 billion. Approximately $200 million was return of capital representing less than 20% of the total. It is common for a REIT to have some portion of its distributions characterized as return of capital, particularly in its initial year. In order to qualify as a REIT, it was critical that we purge our entire legacy E&P, including the E&P from our foreign QRS entities, before the end of 2014. We intentionally built the level of conservatism into our distribution estimates, as we did not want to risk on this distributing and filing to qualify. Also highlighted on this page, our investment and capital expenditures we have made during the year. Real estate investment of $200 million for the year is in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Our maintenance CapEx was $83 million at the low end of the guidance range. Non-real estate investment of $43 million was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This was driven by timing of certain IT investments, which will now occur in 2015. Acquisitions for the year were $189 million at the low end of our guidance range. Although the acquisition pipeline is large, we are very selective in the acquisitions that we undertake and we ensure that they are meeting our hurdle rates. Turning now to our outlook for 2015 on page 10, business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, we have updated our 2015 guidance to reflect FX headwinds and our new constant currency rate, which was based on rates at the beginning of this year. We are projecting constant dollar revenue growth of 1% to 5% and growth in adjusted OIBDA of 1% to 5% in line with our strategic plan. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.30. To be clear, this guidance similar to the preliminary guidance we provided at the last earnings call reflects our anticipation of an absolute increase in total earnings in constant dollars offset on a per share basis by the impact of shares issued in connection with the special distribution and in addition the impact of FX. Driven by the consistent growth in our business and stable fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to be between $425 million to $465 million, with AFFO between $480 million and $520 million. Please note that for 2015 guidance, we have deducted non-real estate investment from our AFFO calculation in response to constructive feedback. While not strictly maintenance related capital expense, these expenditures are necessary for us to support our RIET IT and customer interface systems and a somewhat recurring in nature. Therefore, we believe this change to our definition of AFFO is a more conservative approach. As you saw yesterday, we announced our first quarterly dividend for the year of $0.475 per share. We continue to believe that our cash flow supports our dividends at current levels and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. From a capital spend standpoint, we expect investment in real estate be to $230 million to $270 million, including investment in racking. Maintenance CapEx consistent with prior years is expected to be in the $70 million to $90 million range. Non-real estate investment is also expected to be in the $70 million to 90 million range, which is higher than recent years due to the inclusion of REIT compliance related CapEx and the timing of certain IT investments. Acquisition investments are expected to be $150 million to $250 million. It\u2019s difficult to be precise here, as acquisitions are opportunistic in nature. We will update our outlook again on our Q1 earnings call to reflect any changes, if any, including the impact of any further changes up or down in FX. Shifting to the balance sheet, pages 26 and 27 present all debt maturity schedule and related metrics. At quarter end, we had liquidity of more than $700 million. As forecasted at our Investor Day last year, our lease adjusted leverage ratio would increase to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. In quarter end, it was 5.4 times as planned. At today's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 36%. Turning now to REIT specific metrics on page 20, we provide our global real estate portfolio, which highlights our leased and owned facilities worldwide. The number of leased facilities increased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2014, as a result of our international acquisitions through which we assumed a few operating leases. As we begin to consolidate facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by a square footage. On page 21, we have provided storage net operating income, or NOI, per racked square foot, which highlights the attractive economics we derive from our real estate. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI from combined Records Management and Data Management of approximately $29 per racked square foot worldwide, due to the multiplier effects of renting our space by the cubic foot. This level compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. On page 22, our racking and building utilization rates are high and have improved slightly since the last quarter at 91% and 83% respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about three years' time. On page 29, we have provided components of value, the summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense, in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis, whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. We think about our valuation as a REIT by applying the self-storage or industrial cap rates to our annualized NOI from our storage rental business. On top of the market value of our storage business, we add the value of the services business by applying appropriate multiple. We also provide other tangible assets, our current investments in buildings and racking, as well as the book value of recent acquisitions. We also provide liabilities, including our annual rent expense, to which we apply cap rate and deduct as another form of debt. We hope you find this disclosure useful. And as we've said in prior communications, we will continue to enhance our supplemental reporting and welcome feedback. With that, I will now turn the call back to Bill. Bill Meaney : Thanks, Rod. Before we move to Q&A, I\u2019d like to summarize this morning\u2019s key points. Our 2014 financial results were on track with our expectations prior to the impact of foreign currency and in fact revenue on a constant dollar basis was at the top end of our range. Moreover, we look for similar constant dollar growth in 2015, consistent with the three-year plan we laid out at our Investor Day nearly a year ago. Our fourth quarter operating results demonstrated the success of our initiatives to drive volume in storage rental growth in both our developed and emerging markets and we\u2019re maintaining momentum as we move into 2015. We have attractive high return investment opportunities in all of our segments, including potential acquisitions in developed and emerging markets, and interesting initiatives to leverage our enterprise storage rent through emerging business opportunities. We are maintaining our dividend in line with the growth in operating profit, which represents an attractive yield whilst providing cash flow to fund required CapEx and a portion of our growth investment. We\u2019ll continue to maintain our capital allocation discipline. And like most REITs, we'll look forward -- we\u2019ll look to fund external growth with new capital after first demonstrating our ability to generate the appropriate returns. Our business is durable and predictable and is characterized by attractive fundamentals compared with self-storage and industrial property types. While FX has been a drag in the recent quarter, we also see the current FX environment has an opportunity to take advantage of the strong U.S. dollar to increase our small but growing investment in the high growth emerging markets at favorable rate. With that, Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : At the internal growth in service up 3% and actually, I did catch also that, it was an easier comp? You mentioned even normalizing for the easier comp, this looks like a recovery? Could you go over some of the components of what drove a positive experience in North American service on an organic basis and looking into 2015, do you think this will be a volatile division or do you think that will be firming up? Bill Meaney : Andrew, I think, you were slipped at the beginning. But, I think, your -- I don\u2019t think we -- I hope we've got all of your, you are asking about the internal growth. And we called out the fact that we\u2019re guiding for 2% to 2.5% and we had a very strong quarter. You want to understand how volatile that is and what drove the improvement. Is that correct? Andrew Steinerman : On the service side of North American box Bill Meaney : On the service side? Andrew Steinerman : Yeah. Bill Meaney : Okay. I think on the service side, I will let Rod talk you through because you also asked for the different components and I think I would say as an introductory mark before, Rod takes you through the different components of that? Because there as you know, there are multiple things in our service revenue, some of it is driven by paper prices. Some of it\u2019s driven by the ins and outs associated with our Records Management business. There are different components that are more volatile and more in direct control of the operations. So, I think we have seen an improvement around our imaging business and paper prices and we have a new dedicated leader that\u2019s just looking at our digital or scanning operations, so we have seen an improvement in that area. But we still see some of the underlying trends, especially in our Data Management area in terms of the some of the service associated with transport but Rod, you may want to talk about it in more detail. Rod Day : Yeah. I think that\u2019s right, Bill. The way I think about service revenue and I\u2019m sure, I think you do as well is that service revenue that we can directly influence and this is more sort of independent, if you like from some of our core Records Management business and then there is service activity that is dependent on the activity of what\u2019s going on within whole storage side. I think what was positive for us in Q4, we look at the first areas of the stuff that we can influence directly. We had a particularly good quarter in what we call projects. So that\u2019s where we do specific assignments for customers to sort of help them more with Records Management issues and that was a good strong performance. In addition, we also have the benefit of a good shred performance during Q4, some of which was driven by an improved paper price that we\u2019ve seen take-off bit in Q4. In terms of the activity associated with our records business within the RM side, although there was still a sort of modest decline, the decline is not as serious as we\u2019ve seen. And so again, I think you know we were nervous about calling the bottom of that. But at least, it was a more favorable quarter than we\u2019ve seen and actually follows on from Q3 in that regard. I think the contrast of that would be, as Bill said, within the DM side, we did see quite a significant drop in service activity associated with tight and sort of tight rotation. Now let\u2019s talk about 2015. As Bill said, we\u2019ve actually done a bit of reorganization on the service side, particularly within North America to give more focus to our scanning business and our shredding business, which I think will benefit us. And I would hope that within the RM side, although that\u2019s probably still be continuing declines with activity associated with box, but that should be it and that would be at lower levels. But on the DM side, I do think we will continue to see quite significant reduction so. In terms of summary, in terms of the activity that we can control, I think will be -- I\u2019m hoping for a good performance there on the stuff that is more difficult for us to control. RM more positive than it\u2019s been. DM, I think will continue to struggle. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Bill Meaney : The other thing I would add to that, Andrew, is on the DM side, there is a couple of initiatives that we are doing to try to mitigate that. First of all, we do have a new offering in Secure Destruction, which we are seeing, albeit off a small base but very rapid growth on that base. So, I think you'll start seeing that come through in some of the service numbers associated with the DM business. The other aspect is that we have taken a focus on maintaining and in some cases, trying to add additional volume and what we call our premium transport services around DM, which is dedicated transport. So there are couple puts and takes in initiatives that we've just started in last quarter, last year and we expect those to continue to come through. But the overall trend in DM, as it becomes more archival, like the box business. The DM business is a little bit behind in terms of the lifecycle of that. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie. Kevin McVeigh : A real nice job. Hey. Obviously, I don\u2019t know if you can\u2019t comment on Recall at all but they reported, they said there is further discussions, things like that. Just any update in terms of how you are thinking about that, Bill, particularly given the pullback in the Aussie dollar, does that impact, kind of the approach? And are there any milestones that as you think about the potential transaction from a timing perspective or is it just -- any update at all, if you can talk to it? Bill Meaney : Thanks for that. I guess, Kevin, you probably expect -- I don't have much more to say than what my statement is that, we\u2019ve obviously seen attractiveness of such a transaction, which is the reason why we put a proposal forward in December. And we look at different aspects of the business that is attracted by it. But it's really a question of whether or not we can get to a value that works for both sides. But I think I don't have any more to say than in my opening statement. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. That's helpful. Hey. And just wondering, if I had a rate, it looks like on the initial \u201915 guide, the internal growth was 1% to 2%. Now, we are saying two to two and a half percentage, is that right? Rod Day : Say that again? I'm sorry. Kevin McVeigh : I\u2019m sorry. The internal growth overall in the 2015 guide, I thought initially was 1% to 2% and if I have it now, I think you bulk that up to two to two and a half percentage, is that right? Rod Day : Yeah. I think just to be clear, there is probably a distinction between -- so if there is a distinction means total internal growth in storage, internal growth side. Bill referenced storage internal growth of being sort of 2% to 2.5%, which is kind of the number that we would expect for 2015, which is distinct from total revenue growth. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. Because it seems like you are doing a really nice job there. And then just one other question in terms of -- with the drop in fuel, I know you had fuel surcharges, did that kind of work against you, so I guess it seems like the internal growth is probably even stronger than what you'd suggest if some of those surcharges were starting to runoff or Am I thinking about that incorrectly? Rod Day : No, you're right actually. It does don't have an impact. It did have a relatively small impact to be honest in the backend of Q4. And it obviously doesn\u2019t impact the EBITDA but it does impact the revenue slightly. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. And then just one last and I apologize. I will get back to queue. It sounded like, Bill, you announced a major new customer. It doesn\u2019t look like the CapEx from a racking perspective picked up. Was that a secured customer. or was that kind of an organic and any sense as to just what\u2019s vertical that\u2019s in? Bill Meaney : I think you're referring to, is in relation to the Secure acquisition, I\u2019d say it also helped us on-boarding a major new customer, is that what you are referring to, Kevin? Kevin McVeigh : Yes. Bill Meaney : Yeah. No, I think that -- well, it did help us a little bit in terms of the amount of CapEx for racking that we needed to deploy for that because we were able -- we bought Secure, they had some spare capacity in some of their other facilities, which we are able to use to onboard this new customer. So, I think that is true and that\u2019s up in Canada. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. Super. Thanks so much, nice job. Bill Meaney : Thanks. Rod Day : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittman with Robert W. Baird. Andy Wittman : Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start by digging into some of the restructuring costs in fourth quarter. You may have said this on the conference call rather but I missed it. What were the restructuring costs this year and last year in 4Q specifically? Rod Day : Okay. Andy Wittman : Sorry, just want to get a sense of the comparability of the margins? Rod Day : No. I got it here. So the restructuring charge for this year in Q4 was zero and for last year was $18.6 million. Andy Wittman : Okay. So that implies that the margins are somewhat weaker here as we look at the segments, it looks like some of that was driven internationally, it looks like the guidance for next year takes a low end of the EBITDA or the OIBDA growth down a smidge? I guess, Bill, when you think about that, what\u2019s the driver there, is that continue to be the international performance or is it something else? Could you help us understand that little bit better? Bill Meaney : Well, I think that, if you look at our international performance is still in the range, though we said slightly below the 25% that we reported last year. But it really is dependent in terms of how we grow the emerging market portfolio, because it\u2019s a -- it will ebb and flow as we add new countries into that portfolios. As we said before it\u2019s -- you put something in the funnel and it grows to mimic U.S. margins, which are even much higher than the 25% that a year ago we reported in the international segment. So that will ebb and flow in that range as we actually add new investments as we build market leading positions in the various geographies on the emerging market portfolio. Rod Day : Maybe, I\u2019ll just make a comment on FX just, because that\u2019s the difference if you\u2019d like between the guidance, say we have approximately 40% of our revenues internationally and we\u2019ve seen a 12% decrease in FX on those revenues across those basket of currencies, so as a kind of impacted around sort of 4%, 4.5%. So you can see that the scale of the issue if you like and that\u2019s what\u2019s -- that\u2019s really the only thing that\u2019s driven the change in guidance. Andy Wittman : Got it. And then, just how much of the factor is pricing and I know several quarters ago now there were some large customers that you decided that wasn\u2019t worth to loss the customer to keep down the churn, I think, that ultimately was, obviously, I think a smart decision? How much of that continued, Bill, and how much of pricing is maybe a factor in your margin performance? Bill Meaney : It\u2019s a good question, Andy. The pricing -- the beginning of the year, we probably weren\u2019t as sophisticated as being into on pricing. In the middle of the year we hired a new person in-charge of pricing and we on boarded in November our new Chief Marketing Officer with that comes under. So we have seen during the course of the year being able to up our game in the pricing area. So this year, obviously, we turned around the performance in North America from a volume perspective. So that helps as well and we put those two together, which especially towards the second half of the year in terms of adding more sophistication and more horsepower in our pricing area, you put those two together and that\u2019s why we feel pretty confident that, when we talked about internal storage revenue growth for next year in the 2% to 2.5% range. And if you recall, in quarter one last year we started off at 1.3%. So it\u2019s been a nice trend and we've been building some momentum through the year, both on the volume side and now on the latter half of the year on the pricing side. Andy Wittman : That\u2019s really helpful. If I -- could you allow me one more question, I guess, this one to, Rod, on the capital structure. Debt-to-EBITDA now at 5.4 times, just wanted to get your sense of your comfort level there? I guess, last time we checked that was at the high-end or slightly above your targeted range? Is there been the change in the way you look at the range or is this really kind of staying there recognizing that you maybe able to get a lot more EBITDA, if you can come to terms with Recall, without having a lot of incremental debt, therefore taking you better into your targeted range that way? I just trying to understand, how you are thinking about that, if there's a need for fresh equity through a public offering, or if you feel like you are going to re-equitize the balance sheet through a deal and if that's, what\u2019s preventing you from maybe reducing the leverage that way? Rod Day : Actually, I don\u2019t really want to talk about on sort of Recall and how that would may or may not impact things. Let me just talk about in isolations. I think the first point to say is that the leverage ratio of 5.4% is exactly what we predicted at our I Day presentations. So there\u2019s actually no surprise in that. And we\u2019ve landed in a preciosity of the point where we thought we would. But our stance is over the long-term -- a range of 4% to 5%, we think is optimal from a sort of cost of debt or cost of equity and trade off. But in terms of -- and raising any further record as Bill referenced in his remarks, we would do that on the basis of having compelling investments to make in a bid in acquisitions or in real estate in particular. Very, very common for a REIT, that\u2019s the situation that we are in and that\u2019s how we would look to fund things going forward. Andy Wittman : Okay. Rod Day : No, do you want to add on that, Bill? Bill Meaney : I think that\u2019s spot on. Andy Wittman : That\u2019s fine. Thanks guys for the answers. Bill Meaney : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George Tong : If you look at Record Management volume growth this quarter ex-acquisition, it was relatively consistent on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But if you look at the fourth quarter organic storage revenue growth, it accelerated from 2.2% to 3.5%, given the volume growth was consistent on a quarter-to-quarter basis, is the different essentially coming from stronger pricing trend? Rod Day : Yes. That\u2019s good. There was actually a slight improvement in terms of our volume growth quarter-on-quarter. But you are right and George, it doesn\u2019t explain the full difference by any means. Two things that are going on. One, we benefit from relatively weak compared to last year because as you may recall on our earnings call this time last year, we were talking about a number, sort of pricing adjustments down with what we have to make during that period. So in a sense, the sort of the year-on-year comparison and it slightly falls. But even if you strip that out, we have seen an improvement, a disproportionate improvement relative to our volume. And that comes back to -- in terms of the overall mix price and that\u2019s what Bill was referencing earlier in terms of our ability, if you like to get more pricing traction than we\u2019ve been able to do and maybe earlier in the year. Bill Meaney : Yeah. No, I think that\u2019s right. So as you called out, we started off Q1 at a storage rental internal revenue growth of 1.4%. We ended up the year at 3.5%. As you say, even if you correct other things that Rod\u2019s talking about, you were in the upper half of the 2s in terms of internal revenue storage growth rates. So, we've seen a really nice trend in pick up during that area. I think we also guided at the beginning of the year that we were -- we did call out that we were underperforming and we are very comfortable that we could get to the 2% to 2.5% range and we think we\u2019ll be able to continue that momentum this year. And just to pick you up on one other thing is that, we have seen a nice progression in terms of the volume growth, the storage volume growth over the last say two years where we've gone from Q1 in 2013 in terms of internal storage volume growth before acquisitions of 1.1% net growth and we progressed up to this last quarter of 1.9% growth. So, we've seen a very nice expansion and that's really been driven by both better offense and defense in terms of retaining customers and also gaining new customers, so we feel like things are starting to come together. So, we feel pretty confident that we'll be able maintain that momentum into 2015. George Tong : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And last quarter your C dollar OIBDA growth was indicated to be 2% to 5%, while this quarter the range was widened to 1% to 5%. Can you talk about how your views on margins have evolved over the past quarter? Rod Day : Really, no material shift other than the issue of FX, as I was referencing earlier so and that's really the only change that we have to our thinking. George Tong : Okay. And then last question for me. Real estate acquisitions, I think in the past you've indicated, they will be largely funded by ATM offering, which is typical of RIETs. Can you discuss returns you\u2019ve seen from recent real estate acquisitions you\u2019ve done and what the plan is for 2015? Bill Meaney : Yes. So in terms of the returns that we would expect from acquisitions, I would distinguish between acquisitions that we make in developed markets and acquisitions that we make in emerging markets. And given the sort of the risk profile within emerging markets, we look for higher returns than we would expect than in developed markets. The range that we look for is 9% to 11%, so that the -- I'm always worried about quoting averages here because each day when we look at on a case-by-case basis and risks adjusts and make sure that we\u2019re getting good quality returns on a case-by-case basis. The average is 9% to 11% typically higher in emerging and it is easier to take lower returns in developed where it\u2019s more predictable. George Tong : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Good morning. Could you -- it looks to me that the service revenues -- just following up on Andrew\u2019s question, it is better than it\u2019s been in a very long time. Can you give us just the organic services revenue in North America in aggregate, was it positive? Rod Day : The North American service revenue for the quarter, Andrew, or just for the year? Shlomo Rosenbaum : For the quarter. For the quarter. Bill Meaney : Sorry. Yeah, definitely. On a constant currency rate, we are at 2.4% in the Records Management, which is a good performance. But we have seen a decline of 4.2% in Data Management but certainly in the North American space that was a strong -- sorry, the RIM space that was strong performances compared to where we\u2019ve been. Shlomo Rosenbaum : If I put them together, North American general services is positive now? Bill Meaney : Yes. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Very good. And then what\u2019s going on in the U.S. government market. You guys added some capacity, I saw in news like a month ago. Is the government right to go after that really huge market that you guys have been talking about for years? Bill Meaney : Yeah. Shlomo, I think it is a good question. And you probably also noticed, I think we had a press release just a couple of weeks ago that we had a new head of federal who has a wide of depth and experience in that that area. We have as you know that we invest when we can see the revenue coming. And I think we feel like we\u2019re getting pretty close on a number of discussions with the federal government and we still see that has a very big unvented opportunity for us. So yes we are and it\u2019s probably little bit overstated to say we\u2019re bullish but we feel that we're building momentum in that vertical. And we\u2019re really pleased by how fast our new leader of the federal business seems to be getting his feet under the desk. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. And then middle-market, any update over there in terms of kind of a strategy post the acquisition you made a little while ago? Bill Meaney : I think that the -- on a Cornerstone acquisition, which I think you\u2019re referring to, we talked about that we\u2019re getting some of the D&A to go after that market. We do think that that's a real opportunity for us because as I think I\u2019ve said before is our market share or representation in that market is almost a quarter of what it is in the large enterprise market. And that is the market that tends to have better internal growth rates among themselves and good pricing. So that is an area where we have taken some of the D&A from Cornerstone and we have some of our folks working on how to better go after that. And also the reorganization that we did a year ago is already starting to show some benefit in terms of better penetrating that market and that was breaking -- getting the feel people aligned with the local territories much tighter. So I would say we\u2019re still in the early part of the game on that, but we're starting to see -- we definitely see the opportunity and we\u2019re starting to slowly see some results in that area. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And this is for Rod. Just going and looking at a kind of change in the AFFO calculation. Is this $70 million that you moved out of AFFO because some focus somewhat more recurring, is that non-real estate investment correct line on slide 10? Rod Day : That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s exactly right. And just to get a little bit history on that, we were talking to a number of REIT investors and there was kind of confusion around what\u2019s maintenance for a company like us. So we\u2019ve always had the real estate maintenance expense within our AFFO and following feedback, we thought it was appropriate to include this additional spend which is generally sort of recurring in nature. And therefore it gets sort of more conservative and more prudent view of what the AFFO number should be. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So is there a difference between the $70 million that came down in the $70 million to $90 million range? Rod Day : So I don\u2019t \u2026. Shlomo Rosenbaum : In other words, if I take AFFO in the old definition to the new definition, it\u2019s down $70 million but the range of $70 million to $90 million. Is there an improvement somewhere else? Rod Day : No. No that\u2019s the only adjustment. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Would you mind just walking us through kind of sources and uses for next year? From starting with an AFFO that should be roughly $500 million and I take kind of the midpoint of real estate investment, maintenance CapEx, business and customer acquisitions. I netted out on the $500 million and I would go to issue about negative $30 million, use about $400 million of dividends. Is there -- there is clearly you have about $600 million of liquidity, if you pulled that all with debt you kind of bump out of our debt. How should we think of it from a modeling perspective? Rod Day : I think while I draw that, try my best for the case that would be long sort of detailed analysis. If we could do that offline, very happy to do that but it will take quite some time to work that through with you. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll take your appointment. Thank you very much. Bill Meaney : Bye. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Dan Dolev for Jefferies. Dan Dolev : My question, I won\u2019t take step back and kind of look at the last few years and ask you if I look at the last three years you spend about all-in $1.5 billion in CapEx. And if I look at the EBITDA progression, so called since 2011, it\u2019s down about 2.5%. So what kind of return were you aiming to get on the CapEx and why isn\u2019t EBITDA growing if you did get return on that CapEx? Thanks. Rod Day : I think that what you disentangle is Sort of what\u2019s been going on with the some of the underlying performance of the business, certainly in the sort of \u201811 and \u201812 period and the returns that we\u2019re getting from the CapEx that we spend. So during the sort of the \u201811 and \u201812 period, the two things were happening. And one is we had a sort of poor performance on our services side of the business but it impacts our business negatively. And the second is depending on which EBITDA you\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re investing in REIT costs which obviously has the benefit further down the P&L in terms of tax. And if you then just strip out the CapEx, the investments that we\u2019ve made. The typical returns we look to get on those certainly in excess of our WAC which is 8% and obviously that will vary depending on the secured investment that we are making. But then if you sort of layer them back on top, that will then contribute in a positive way to EBITDA. Dan Dolev : Okay. Understood. Bill Meaney : Okay. Dan Dolev : And one last follow up, on the dividend, you sounded a little bit more reserve, if I understood correctly on \u201915 dividend? Are you still committed to $4.10 to $4.20? Rod Day : I think, we are -- so the reason why we gave the -- this is a dollar guidance in the previous quarter, was really because there was so much going on with the dividend, with special projects and an E&P projects and special payments. And we are happy that we were getting questions coming in from investors because it was quite a confusing pitch. So we thought that would be helpful number to put out. Now we are through all that. We will just go, I don\u2019t know sort of quarterly basis in terms of our per dividends payment. So, I think Bill, referenced in his remarks. Our policy like is to grow that dividends in line with our operating performance and that\u2019s what we were doing. Bill Meaney : Yeah. That the only I was just saying, I think, we are -- I think it\u2019s also clear, where we are guiding now is on a per share basis and I think I kind of fumbled over cents whatever, but its $47.5 of per share is what we are guiding over and that, as Rod said, grows in line with operating income, because we are now through the project. I think, with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to the operator. Operator : And at this time, I will turn it back over to Bill Meaney for closing remarks. Bill Meaney : Yeah. I think I have already done the remarks, Operator. So I just want to thank you all for joining us this morning for our call and we look forward to speaking to you in three months. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC Han Zhang - Churchill Capital Operator : Good morning. My name is Felicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now like to hand the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Felicia, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As I'm sure, everyone joining us this morning knows, we also announced an agreement in principle to acquire Recall. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter, some key points related to the proposed transaction, as well as progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial results. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we have done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. We've also posted there a brief presentation related to the proposed Recall transaction at the same location. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and in the Recall presentation and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Let me first extend our apology for such a short notice on the change in timing for the release of first quarter results. But given that it was driven by our agreement in principle to acquire Recall, we felt it was important to combine the news. I would like to start by saying, we are pleased to announce that our results in the first quarter meet or exceed our expectations. We continue to build operational momentum in the business, which is, in turn, driving strong financial results in spite of the significant FX headwinds. However, given the breaking news associated with the agreement in principle to acquire Recall, I'd like to start with the discussion of this agreement. First, I should say, we are very excited about our agreed proposal to acquire Recall. We think this proposed transaction represents an attractive value proposition supported by significant synergies and believe it will be highly accretive. Our revised offer reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other favorable changes since our last proposal, particularly regarding transaction related tax assumptions. Of course, we have yet to complete due diligence to reach a definitive agreement and the successful completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions noted in today's press release. We have a few slides related to the proposal, the proposed transaction that we have posted to our Investor Relations website, which I'll touch on briefly. Turning first to slide three, the proposed acquisition is an all stock deal at a fixed exchange rate of 0.1722 of an Iron Mountain share for each Recall share. Additionally, we've made a provision that each Recall shareholder can elect up to a maximum of 5,000 shares to be paid in cash at AUD$8.50 per share subject to a cap on the total cash consideration of AUD$225 million. On slide five, we estimate there is an opportunity to achieve synergies of between US$125 million and US$140 million driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead. We expect to realize 50% of these synergies in year two, which will already yield by year two, high-single digit accretion in EPS, FFO and AFFO. Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that, it supports our de-leveraging strategy. Additionally, we have complementary market platforms with Recall having a more developed presence with the small-to-medium businesses in the U.S. whilst we have more significant presence with larger enterprise customers in the U.S. Turning to slide six, we also have complementary geographic coverage with Recall having more exposure to faster growing international markets. Slide seven provides a bit more detail on the benefits to Recall shareholders, including the ability through stock ownership to participate in future upside and be supported through a secondary listing in Australia. Slide eight shows more detail on our estimated net synergies as well as our expected integration and other costs that would be incurred in year one to achieve those synergies. Assuming the midpoint of the synergy range, consensus estimates of Recall's 2015 EBITDA and the fixed exchange ratio, we estimate our going-in EBITDA multiple is just over 12 times and is reduced by 4 turns to 4.5 turns on a fully synergized basis, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed transaction. Lastly, on slide nine, we've provided a list of next steps in the process. With that overview of the proposed transaction, let me turn to our results. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, extending recent progress with continued positive organic volume growth in solid storage rental internal growth. We continue to execute on our three-year strategic plan, which rests on three pillars; getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster growing emerging markets, and continue to explore adjacent opportunities in our emerging business segment. Rod will have more details in a few minutes but I'll start by highlighting that on a constant dollar basis, our financial results for the first quarter were in line or ahead of our expectations, with total revenue up 2% and adjusted OIBDA up 5.7% on a constant dollar basis or 4.5% on a constant dollar basis if normalized for restructuring charges as shown on page 20 in our supplemental. We saw further strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter, which impacted our reported results, but the fundamental trends in the business remains solid and we are pleased with the momentum. Our results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our strategic plan. If you reviewed our supplemental disclosure before the call today, you probably noted that we added a further breakdown of our International business. Effective with this quarter's reporting; we've broken the former International segment into Western Europe and Other International. With this segment change, we've consolidated executive leadership of North America and Western European markets under Patrick Keddy to provide better focus and alignment within our developed markets. Patrick has run our UK and Western European markets for several years now, having originally joined us from Pitney Bowes, where he ran its entire business outside the U.S., including operations in 28 countries. JT Tomovcsik will continue to run our North American Records and Information Management business and Eileen Sweeney will add Western Europe to her leadership responsibilities and will head Data Management in all developed markets. She and JT will coordinate their efforts through Patrick. This integration of executive leadership in North America and Western Europe will allow us to present a single face to our major customers in our largest markets and we'll be better positioned as a global service provider not just a company with a global footprint. Marc Duale will continue to run emerging markets through the Other International segment, which covers Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe. This segment also includes Australia as it is easy to manage within this segment due to the geographic proximity. We think this structure will better fuel our continued momentum in developed markets and continue our expansion in emerging markets, thereby more closely tying performance to our strategic plan. Turning to operating highlights, total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, grew by 4.6% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth from the Other International segment and consistent trends in Western Europe as well as North America, RIM, and DM or Data Management. Worldwide, internal growth in storage rental of 3%, continued to show resilience. Whilst, internal growth did benefit slightly from favorable comps relative to the 1.4% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, we are seeing continued momentum and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 of between 2% and 2.5%. In Records Management, we added roughly 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 3.5% net growth. This growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth, or in other words, before benefit from acquisitions. Importantly, North America represents nearly 25% of our net volume gains for the trailing 12 months excluding acquisitions. Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98% in line with our fourth quarter 2014 levels, but a significant improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just two years ago. In our Data Management business, we continue to see solid storage revenue growth, although as noted in recent quarters, we are still experiencing headwinds related to reduced frequency of customer tape rotation. Whilst we continue to evaluate ways to right-size our cost structure to align with this trend, we are continuing to develop new product and services in the Data Management segment to leverage our strong customer relationships in the more than 200,000 stops we make each month. During the quarter Google named us as the ingestion partner for its new Nearline cloud solution. This means we are the preferred provider to assist Google Cloud customers in uploading all the data saved in legacy data storage formats that predated cloud storage so they can better use big data. We plan to begin offering this service later this summer. We also are seeing good early reception to our Restoration Assurance Program that helps customers retrieve data from legacy media and optimize their backup environment for future technologies. Moreover, just last week we announced a strategic relationship with EMC to deliver cloud backup and replication services, which helps customers optimize their on-premise and off-premise data protection strategy. We are the only one of their providers to offer data domain replication to the cloud with tape-out capabilities. These new initiatives are in their early days, and we are not guiding to a specific contribution from them, but they demonstrate our thought leadership, innovation capabilities and partnership with other world leaders in information management like Google and EMC. Turning to emerging markets, we are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high growth markets represent 13.6% of our total revenue at the end of the quarter on a constant dollar basis. Like most multinationals, we do have exposure to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. While FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our gross and adjusted OIBDA margins is almost completely muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby creating a natural hedge. On the other hand, the current FX environment gives us a positive window in terms of investments. Given our opportunity to expand internationally on what is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S dollars during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in emerging markets as they are still in the early part of the outsourcing of enterprise storage. Internal storage rental growth in our Other International segment was 11.1% in the first quarter. Rod will describe more fully the impact of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on our reported performance for the quarter. Furthermore, we intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities that extend durability of the storage rental business. As we've discussed on recent calls, we plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next eight years to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. On average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going-in cap rates and market cap rates, whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals. It does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we became more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. As you think about opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the solid durability of the business, which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by the leaders in the industrial and self-storage sectors. And we have other attractive business characteristics that compare favorably with REITs. Our enterprise storage foundation is similar to self-storage, but we serve more than 92% of the Fortune 1000 with superior customer credit quality. We have a diversified base of more than 155,000 business customers with 98% customer retention and a 15-year average life of box in our facilities. Our business has a very low volatility, as highlighted by a track record of 26 years the consecutive growth in storage rental revenue even throughout the recent recession. And like self-storage we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers' underlying storage needs. We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector with the major difference that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot, yielding a very high net operating income per square foot. Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invest in incremental Racking Structures within an existing industrial shell, we generate very strong returns due to the leverage associated with this volume achieved with reduced growth CapEx. To wrap up, we're excited to be announcing the proposed transaction with Recall and reporting a quarter of strong operating performance. Our results were in line with or ahead of expectations and we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals. Our business is durable and generates strong cash flow that more than covers our dividend and provides a portion of growth CapEx. And as we look at our longer-term growth potential, we have multiple capital allocation opportunities to invest in attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital and support long-term growth in our dividend. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Bill. We're pleased with the momentum we continue to see in our business and the strong operating performance we saw in the first quarter of 2015. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental business and the benefits of acquisitions we made in developed and emerging markets in prior periods. Before I begin, I'd like to note that our outlook for 2015 doesn't contemplate potential contribution or impact from the proposed transaction with Recall. As noted by Bill, we have yet to reach a definitive agreement; we're just embarking on the due diligence process. To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including a review of our new segment disclosure. I'll briefly touch on our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since our update in February of this year. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results for the quarter. Referring now to pages eight and nine of our supplemental, supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $749 million, up approximately 2.2% compared with Q1 of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. Reported revenue for the quarter declined by 2.7% year-over-year as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5% or $37 million. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $231 million compared with $229 million in 2014, up 1.2% on a reported basis and 5.7% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted OIBDA increased year-over-year due to improved storage profits, somewhat offset by a reduction in service profits. In addition, overhead expenses declined partly as we are seeing the benefits of our efficiency initiatives. To illustrate the 4.5% year-over-year improvement in normalized adjusted OIBDA, we've included a bridging schedule on page 20 of our supplemental package. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.50 for the quarter, while adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $128 million. The year-over-year decline in AFFO was driven by variances in deferred tax expenses. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.32 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the first quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, adjusted EPS was impacted by an increase in interest expense related to higher levels of debt and a slightly higher structural tax rate. The increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion related expenses such as E&P purge and the D&A recapture payments. Our structural tax rate for Q1 2015 came out to 16.2% as result of a slight mix change driven by a higher income from foreign jurisdictions. It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2014 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the longer-term. To illustrate the changes to adjusted EPS, we've included a bridging schedule on page 21 of our supplemental. The fundamentals of our business remained strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental growth of 5%, offset by a decline in service revenue of 1% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill mentioned, in an effort to look more closely tie our leadership structure to the strategic plan, we have broken out the former International segments into two segments, Western Europe and Other International, to facilitate managing the business along the developed emerging lines we've talked about in the past. I will now discuss Records Management or RM volume trend across this new segmentation. As you can see in the supplemental, on pages 10 and 11, we've expanded our disclosure by illustrating Records Management volume trends by segments. As you can see, we've achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 5.4% in Western Europe, and 12.9% in the Other International segments, reporting Global Records Management net volume growth of 3.5%. We continue to experience strong organic growth with first quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.9% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers who added approximately 30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months, which is consistent with prior periods. Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. North America Records and Information Management, or RIM delivered positive storage rental internal growth and expanded OIBDA margins by more than 300 basis points during the first quarter. This expansion in adjusted OIBDA margins was driven by a decline in overhead costs as we continue to execute on our speed and agility efforts. North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.2% in the first quarter. However, service declined by 5.9% as DM tape management becomes more archival. During the first quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 52.7%, partly as a result of the new product launches related to our Restoration Assurance Program and other initiatives that Bill covered in his remarks. We believe these will prove very positive investments for the longer-term. The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 3.7% storage rental internal growth, which was partially offset by a decline of 2.6% in internal service revenue. The Western Europe business is similar to North America in its level of market maturity. However, there are certain countries within these segments, where we don't have a strong leadership position, which in turn results in profit margins that are lower than North American margins, although returns are still well above required hurdle rates. In addition, it's important to note that the Western Europe segment includes head office costs, which reduces our adjusted OIBDA margins. Excluding the head office costs, the margin in this segment would be in the mid to high 30% range. Adjusted OIBDA margin percentages remain stable in the first quarter despite the decline in service revenues, although absolute dollar adjusted OIBDA fell primarily as a result of FX headwinds. The Other International segments, which is made up of emerging markets in Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.1%, and service internal growth was 6.8%. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high-teens to low 20%s range as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast growing markets. Adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was impacted by FX headwinds and integration costs. Historical data for Other International on a full year basis will be available in our amended 10-K which will be filed in the short-term. As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in February during our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition, at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction. Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on-track to deliver our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to impact our reported results. However, we believe that, we will remain within the ranges of our guidance. As a reminder, our guidance includes an expectation of roughly 12% decline in reported non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue for 2015 relative to FX rates in place in 2014. Revenues outside the U.S. make up 40% of total worldwide revenue. As a result, we expect the FX impact on total revenue for 2015 to be 4% to 5%. Lastly, although there is no seasonality to our quarters, there is typically a moderate ramp in revenue performance as the year progresses. Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million, which gives us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund a portion of our core growth investments. As we've previously said, we expect to fund discretionary investments including real estate and acquisitions through external funding whether through equity or borrowings. Shifting to the balance sheet, at quarter end, we had a liquidity of more than $780 million. Quarter end, our lease adjusted ratio was 5.5 times as planned. At Monday's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 38%, in line with major REIT averages. Turning now to REIT specific metrics, as we begin to accelerate consolidation of facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by square footage. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI approximately $27 per racked square foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 83%, respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90%s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about three years' time. We added a new page to the supplemental, page 32, which highlights our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected return and anticipated returns. We will continue to enhance our disclosure as we move forward through the year. Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. In an effort to ensure transparency to our shareholders, we will continue to enhance our supplemental disclosure and provide more details to help you better understand our business and its underlying fundamentals. As always we welcome your feedback. Operator, with that, we will now take questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie. Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, congratulations on Recall and actually the results, just a great outcome and obviously with the REIT just very good execution. My question was more along the lines of what does the organic growth look like, the combined entity post the deal? And then just \u2013 and I know it's probably little bit ways out but how does that impact kind of the dividend and just leverage ratios on a pro forma basis to the extent you can give us any color? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Good morning, Kevin. Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, Bill. William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : I think you're going to appreciate that we haven't done our due diligence to this point, so to give us \u2013 to give you specific guidance, we're just not in a position to do that. I think that \u2013 I think you can probably get a sense of it in terms of we \u2013 we're looking at something that synergizes in the 7.5 times to 8 times range based on the $125 million to $140 million worth of synergies we've guided. So it is clearly very accretive on EPS, FFO and AFFO, which obliviously drives to deleveraging and dividend growth. But at this point, we haven't done the due diligence on the company so we're not in a position to guide for that. Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And then just those synergies, Bill, they assume any potential divestitures you might have to do to the extent there is any trust concern? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : You can probably appreciate that we have taken counsel on the anti-trust side and we feel that there is a very good \u2013 a very good beneficial path through any of the hurdles that we may meet in terms of regulatory. Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Super. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi, thanks. Good morning. And I'll also extend my congratulations on your agreement to acquire Recall. You've outlined cost synergies between $125 million and $140 million. Can you discuss your confidence around achieving these synergies and provide some thoughts on how much tax synergies you might achieve from the transaction? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, George. I think, first of all the synergies include both tax and operational benefits. I mean it's probably fair to say we've been a little bit conservative because we've just been relying on really public information and we haven't been able to do due diligence. So we feel very confident that we can deliver those numbers but you'll notice we're probably less bullish than some of the analysts' reports that have been written previously on. So we are pretty comfortable and that is \u2013 that's including all the regulatory aspects, tax aspects and operational aspects built into that number, the puts and takes associated with that. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, maybe just to build on that, Bill and George, as you know we've done hundreds of acquisitions over the year, obviously not on this (33:55) scale. But we try to use that experience when \u2013 to come to bear in sort of calculating what we think is a sensible range for synergies (34:05). George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): That's helpful. And can you walk through your expectations for the regulatory approval process, including timing and your expectations around market share discussions? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Again, we've taken a counsel on that. In other words, we've been in consultation for a period of time now with external counsel that specializes in that area, and we think we can achieve a satisfactory outcome. But we haven't finalized the proposal, we haven't done any fillings. So at this point to speculate on that I think it would be pure speculation. But we do feel that based on the studies that we've done so far with external counsel that we'll achieve a satisfactory outcome. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. And then last question, can you talk about how this transaction impacts your ability to continue to operate as a REIT? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : This \u2013 our \u2013 again that was one of our key pieces of analysis that we did when we looked at the acquisition is to determine our level of confidence that we could both acquire it and absorb it into our REIT structure, in other words, convert the Recall assets into a REIT. And again, we will confirm that through the due diligence process, but we are highly confident that we can do that. So we wouldn't do it otherwise unless we could convert the Recall assets into the REIT. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, it's Andrew. Just tell me if I missed this, again I would like to know the question asked before out of the $125 million to $140 million, how much are the potential tax savings from REIT conversion? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I can give you a sort of approximate number, Andrew, based on our analysis so far. We think it's around $10 million, could be slightly more. But clearly that's one of the elements that we'd hope to get a better handle on through due diligence. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So you are only assuming $10 million, so that could be a conservative estimate. William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, you have to look at the size of Recall's business in North America that is storage related, so don't forget their business is not that large in North America, it's a global business, but it's in North America where you have the tax benefits. So their tax liability in North America is not as big as you may think. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So we don't get \u2013 there wouldn't be savings on the shredding business as an example. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well said. So if I can get one more question. Okay. So let's assume low tax benefits, be conservative there, you're talking about still four times turn pre to post synergies. If you look at Iron Mountain's history, it's really kind of been two times to four times, so this would be towards the high end of the synergies. And when I look at Recall's racking utilization of about 90%, that's really close to Iron Mountain's racking utilization. What other things do you know again from the public that makes you feel like you can get towards the high end of pre to post synergies, synergization multiples. William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Andrew, if you \u2013 the thing that's a little bit unique about Recall, it is at the higher end, but we have achieved that before as you pointed out. And the reason why we feel that it's at the higher end and maybe it exceeds some of our best integrations is that Recall is one of the few out there that runs an international platform. So they have a lot \u2013 if you look at their SG&A, it's very different than the SG&A of a small regional player. Because they are actually built \u2013 they are running a global company with all the costs that are associated with that, albeit they are doing at a scale that's one forth our size. So if you look at their SG&A, I think you can get a handle on why we feel that the $125 million to $140 million is actually a conservative or \u2013 we feel very confident around that number. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That was a good reminder. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys thank you for taking my questions. Bill, could you talk a little bit about the realistic timeframe \u2013 in the first year you talked about \u2013 you mentioned maybe half the synergies. What's the realistic timeframe to kind of get the balance of the synergies? Is this something that facility consolidation really takes kind of two years to five years or how should we think of that in terms of conceptually and potentially modeling it? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Shlomo, you've been around a long time, so you answer the question for me. But no, I think, it's a good question. So just to clarify, in year two there we think we'll be half way through the synergies. So the first year, I mean, first year we're assuming is 2016 just for people to be level set. So, year two would be 2017. So we think 2016 is a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of the restructuring, then in 2017 is when you start \u2013 that that cost starts falling away and you start seeing the benefits split bleed through. So 2002 \u2013 I think at \u2013 year two 2017 we see about half the benefits coming through. And exactly as you say, we'll get a better handle on it through due diligence but the rest of it comes through \u2013 a lot of it is driven by the real estate consolidation and that generally takes the timeframe you're talking about two years to five years. It depends on the nature of their leases and our leases in the areas that we're overlapping. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just from a fundamental perspective, how is the volume growth in North American Records Management this quarter over the second half of last year, you guys generated positive growth, can you kind of talk about will the trend continue, was it up, down, the same? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry, I didn't get the question. I heard the beginning of it you were referring back to the continued growth, the internal volume growth in North America but what was \u2013 what did you say at the end? Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I just \u2013 did the trend \u2013 we had for years seen volumes be down, but kind of revenue be flat to up a little bit because of pricing. The second half of last year, we saw North American volumes get to be positive, do we \u2013 in this first quarter what was the trend in North American volumes? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Actually in the supplemental on page 10, we've broken this all the key numbers out in more detail than we've done historically. And what you can see, if you were to strip out business acquisitions to just sort of look underlying, there was a 0.5% growth year-on-year in Q1 2015, which actually compares quite consistently with the previous three quarters. And then if you go back further in time looking at this chart, at the beginning of 2013, you can see that to your point was when we were at zero or negative growth. William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : One thing I want \u2013 and this was feedback that we received from a number of analysts and investors. So hopefully if you look in the supplemental on pages 10 and 11, I'd direct you to those, in part of the organizational shift and putting all of the developed markets under a single leader, is we've been \u2013 we've broken out and built a lot more transparency in terms of how our volume works. And then \u2013 so hopefully you'll start seeing, you can see how that trend has been building as you say, as Rod pointed out, Q1, we maintained the same 0.5% positive volume growth as we did in Q4, just in the North American business. And you have to remember you can say those are small percentages but it's off a very big base. So North America alone we have over 370 million cubic feet. So it's significant. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And if I just want to look ahead a little bit into the future, in terms of the REIT structure, what happens if paper pricing kind of bounces back to what it was like three years, three and half years ago, do you have enough kind of room in the REIT structure that you're not worried about coming close to any of the \u2013 kind of the restrictions that are over there in terms of assets and income? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'll let Rod kind of answer it in detail, but the one thing, I think we covered this on previous calls, you need to keep in mind is that there is, at some point, actually increasing profitability on our shred helps us the way the test works because there is a back and forth. In other words, we have to get shred to a certain level of profitability. So, having higher prices \u2013 having higher profitability in shred doesn't necessarily lead to the result that you think it does. So that's kind of at a very high level way of saying we have plenty of headroom, but, Rod, you may want to be a bit more specific. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, there's actually a specific on shred, as Bill says around sort of cross subsidization between the QRS and the TRS, so that if we increase the profitability of shred, it would actually work to the advantage of some of our REIT tests. But I think the broader point and \u2013 that you make, Shlomo, is that around just sensitivity to issues within the business and do we have enough cushion within our REITs and against the REIT test to be able to handle that. We think we do. It's something that we're very conscious of and we analyze lots of different scenarios and sensitivities to try and ensure that that is the case. William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : And very specifically which is probably what's behind your question is if we look at the acquisition of Recall, we don't envision a problem of combining. Recall's business is quite a bit smaller, their strip quite a bit smaller than ours in North America. And we don't see a problem in terms of combining those two businesses. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sachin Shah with Albert Fried. Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the Recall possible offer. I just wanted to just make sure as far as risk to transaction. I know you're conducting due diligence, but is there anything that you expect that you may uncover or something that may not cause this deal to move forward after you completed due diligence? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : We wouldn't be making a public announcement about the deal if we thought there was a high risk item that would crater the deal. I mean clearly we have to do the due diligence. So, we haven't made a binding agreement, but we have an agreed proposal with Recall and we wouldn't do that if we expected to have a major hiccup in the process. So, we don't see anything. Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. And in the presentation, you mentioned the ratio is fixed and so in the due diligence process is there a subject for another revision or the due diligence is just confirmation of what's the fixed exchange ratio of 0.1722? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : It's fixed and it's subject to confirmatory due diligence. So, there's no \u2013 I mean there's no expectation or you'd have to renegotiate the whole term. So, it really is that we've done enough work on it that we're very comfortable that that is the right valuation. And Recall's board also feels that it's the right valuation for their shareholders. And now the next three weeks to four weeks that we highlighted in the press release is about confirmatory due diligence. Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. Just one last question, if you don't mind. On the regulatory approvals, you mentioned that you are not expecting any kind of essentially hiccups, any idea what they may be? Is it just to U.S., Australia, or is there any other jurisdictions that may be needed \u2013 major jurisdictions? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : I think you can understand at this point we're not going to comment on what the regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions may think or not think of it. The only thing I would just repeat is that we have taken extensive counsel from external advisors or lawyers on this point and we believe that we will achieve a satisfactory outcome in those jurisdictions. Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. So, that's not part of the due diligence, that's already done. The due diligence is more operational. William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : We will also learn more about the regulatory aspects during the due diligence. Due diligence is primarily operational, but we will learn a number of things during that period which will be helpful. Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much. Have a great day. William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Han Zhang with Churchill Capital. Han Zhang - Churchill Capital : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question is, you said you won't comment on what are the regulatory approvals you're seeking, but could you just tell me more about in which jurisdictions you are seeking those approvals, I mean U.S., Australia, but for example, is China involved? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : At this point, we don't expect an issue in China. Both of our businesses are very small in China. I mean, the Chinese government will take their own view, I'm sure. But it's \u2013 both of us have \u2013 I mean, it improves both of our position, but neither one of us are very large in the China context. Han Zhang - Churchill Capital : Okay. And could you tell me how many dividends would you expect to pay before the close of the deal? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, it depends on the closing of the deal. We pay quarterly. So, you can see that we expect this deal to close within 12 months. So that would be the maximum you would expect. But I mean, we've \u2013 we can't guide on how long it's going to take us to go through the various regulatory authorities to consummate the merger. But we pay quarterly generally, right? Han Zhang - Churchill Capital : Hi. This is Ramesh, Zhang's colleague. Have you had any informal discussions with any regulators at this point in time? William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : No. We haven't. Han Zhang - Churchill Capital : Thank you. William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, looks like we are through the Q&A, operator. I just want to thank you for your flexibility, and again apologies for the short notice, but I think you can imagine that given the timing of achieving a positive result on the acquisition of Recall, we felt it was important to combine that with our earnings call which was originally scheduled for Thursday. So, again, thank you very much for your flexibility, and just to reiterate that we're very pleased in terms of our results in the first quarter, continue to show real momentum in the operating performance and improvement in the business. And of course, we're very excited to finally end the speculation around Recall and to have agreed a proposal to acquire the company. So thank you very much and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Keyva, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now like to hand the call over to, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Melissa Marsden. Please go ahead, Ma\u2019am. Melissa Marsden : Thank you, Keyva and good morning, everyone. This morning we\u2019ll begin our call with remarks from Bill Meaney, our President and CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and progress towards our strategic initiatives followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial and operating results. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we have done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and supplemental package do contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s supplemental the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. And the reconciliations to those measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? Bill Meaney : Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to be reporting solid second quarter results that we\u2019re in line with our expectations on a constant currency basis and underscore the durability of our core business. Despite the FX headwinds, we\u2019re comfortable maintaining our guidance our for 2015 as we typically see a bit of a ramp in the second half of the year. It was a very eventful quarter with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Recall Holdings and the initiation of our transformation plan, which will drive significant improvement in our overhead cost structure and support strong cash flow generation in years to come, even prior to the substantial and additional synergies we anticipate from our acquisition of Recall. I\u2019ll get to the last two items shortly, but first I would like briefly cover certain financial and operating highlights. Our momentum in the storage rental business continues to build and drive durable results in line with our strategic plan. On a constant dollar basis, total revenue growth for the quarter was 2.2% reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.1% and service revenue declines of just 0.6%, foreign currency impact year-over-year in total revenue by roughly 6%, reflecting the strong appreciation of the dollar experiences at this time in 2014. We also continued to see good internal growth with storage rental, up 2.7% for the quarter and 2.9% for the year-to-date reflecting continued strong growth from data management or DM and the other international segment and stable performance in Western Europe and North America rim. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 in the mid 2% range. The realignment of our data management business we initiated last year is yielding good result. DM storage continue to show very strong internal growth with 5.3% increase over last year. Total service revenue internal growth was flat for the quarter and down just 0.5 point year-to-date in line with our expectations for continued yet moderating top line headwinds. Looking at volume in records management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12 months basis, representing 2.8% net growth. This growth was maintained in part as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth or in other words before benefit from acquisitions. Net volume growth in North America was 1.2% or 0.4% on an internal basis excluding acquisitions in line with Q1 levels. Globally we maintain customer retention of 98% in line with the first quarter and a 20% improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just two years ago. Now turning to our transformation overhead optimization program we announced in June prior to the Recall acquisition news. We\u2019ve spoken with many of you about this over the past several weeks and highlighted our reorganization in April in which we put a single leader over our developed market has facilitated this important program. This initiative calls for taking $100 million out of overhead costs or SG&A between now and 2018 in this independent of and additive to the Recall acquisition. This will bring us from our current overhead of more than 28% of total revenue down to the mid 20% range, and more in keeping with best practices for companies with similar size in global reach. Importantly, we have already implemented a portion of this program and achieved $50 million of cost reduction or half of these savings with a charge to be taken in Q3 and the full benefit of the $50 million to be realized in 2016. With a partial year contribution from this program we expect the net impact for 2015 to be neutral. Also in recent communications we\u2019ve illustrated how the decline in our service margins over the past few years and more recently FX headwinds have offset the attractive returns we achieved from investment in real estate in acquisitions. In fact, during this period we have been achieving unlevered returns on invested growth capital in the low teens and have seen significant contribution flow through in the past couple of years. We initiated some programs last year and are continuing to implement changes that we believe will allow us to stabilize the service margin trend line and get back to around 27% by the end of the year. It is important to keep this in perspective. While service represents 40% of our total revenue, today it represents just 17% of our total gross profit. Again to be clear, we are talking about a slowdown in the activity of physical records and tapes being retrieved, not a slowdown in incoming volume of records and tapes to be stored. Whilst demand for typical office cut sheet paper has declined between 2% and 4% in the mature markets, in the past few years, we continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded from our existing customer year-after-year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. We do continue to expect service revenue headwinds of negative 1% to negative 2% annually over the next few years and in fact we did see flat service revenue this quarter compared to a year ago period. And whiles we can\u2019t completely offset the impact of lower service revenues due to a decline in retrieval and re-file in transportation activity, we can do more to align our service cost structure with this decrease in activity levels. So what are we doing to address this service margin decline? First we are looking at ways to variabilized more of our cost. Second, we are exploring efforts to make more efficient use of third party logistic suppliers or 3PL where we can be assured they will maintain our quality and focus on secured chain of custody. We have used this in Europe on a smaller scale and believe we can expand the use of 3PL elsewhere. And third, we are using technology more proactively such as using sensors to detect when shred bins are ready \u2013 are ready to be emptied to make roots more efficient. Additionally, in this quarter we have seen an uptick in our bad debt. This has come out of our North American business and is primarily the result of refining our billing process over the past 18 months to 24 months. During this transition we didn\u2019t adequately refine the process before moving responsibility for the North American billing offshore. Here is now our robust plan in place addressing this. Now let\u2019s turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of industrial logic and strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. I assume by now you are familiar with the basic terms of the deal, so I won\u2019t review all the information but rather just touch upon the highlights. In the announcement presentation, we illustrate estimated total net synergies of $155 million with $110 million of that to be achieved by 2017. These synergies are driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead, and when fully realized, will lead to double-digit accretion in adjusted EPS, FFO per share, and AFFO. At 25% of our size, Recall is managing a similar global platform in terms of country coverage as they are in 24 countries, compared to our 36 which drives much of the overhead synergies. Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. With the additional cash available to us from our transformation plan as well as recall synergies, we can not only fund a stable and growing dividend per share, but we also generate the capital we need for growth. Additionally, we have complementary market platforms with Recall having a more developed presence in the small-to-medium businesses whilst we have significant presence with the larger enterprise customers. We\u2019ve been on the road over the past several weeks and have met with a number of our shareholders, as well as recalled major holders in Australia. And what we\u2019re hearing is universal agreement that our two companies are worth more together than they are separately. You can see that several Recall shareholders have increased their holdings and appreciate the attractiveness of owing the combined company. Even our most seasoned devices have noted that they cannot remember a deal that delivered 26% EPS accretion in three years time. In the next several weeks we expect to file the shareholder meeting document, seeking approval of the acquisition, which will have additional detail, including proforma results. Turning back Iron Mountain, on past calls we discussed progress on our three-year strategic plan which rests on three pillars, getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster-growing emerging markets and continued to explore adjacent opportunities in our emerging business segment. Whilst the Recall acquisition and transformation plan have guarded a bit more internal and external attention of late, we continued to make good progress on our base plan, achieving consistent positive storage volume growth in developed markets in completing an organizational realignment to put developed markets under common leadership, which enables our ability to implement our latest transformation program as well as to accelerate our service margin initiatives. Additionally, in emerging markets, we continued to progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by the end of next year. We pressed the pause button on acquisition for a moment to assess some of the transactions in the pipeline, might be affected by the Recall acquisition, but we are resuming activity and continue to be pleased with the quality, size and scope of our pipeline. We\u2019ve also discussed on recent calls how we have been impacted by the effects of currency, translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. While FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our gross and adjusted OIBDA margins is muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby creating a natural hedge. On the other hand, we continue to believe that the current strong dollars \u2013 positive in terms of investments opportunity. Given our intend to expand what is today, a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle. This may take the form of M&A, or in the purchase or development of real estate. In both cases, we can benefit from investing at a low basis. In addition, we have deepened our focus in the real estate investment area, adding an experienced REIT asset manager to accelerate our plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next eight years to ten years. As we seek to shift our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties, on average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going-in cap rates and our market cap rates, whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. We think this is important and appropriate as a REIT, as it supports such being viewed more in line with traditional REITs by the rating agencies and investors. Importantly, our debt to total market cap and our debt to EBITDA measures, are in line with major REIT sector leaders [ph] and our internal storage rental revenue fared better than these sectors during the recent recession. When we did not have a down year. Our low volatility business is distinguished by a track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue. As we think about the opportunities to grow our storage rental business it is important not to lose sight of the durability of the business which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. As we noticed in recent calls, the restructure is consistent with our capital allocation goals; it does not limit our ability to fund our business plan as we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline. We expect to fund that incremental investment with excess cash flow or additional borrowing. Now I would like to turn the call over to Rod. Rod Day : Thanks Bill. Our results continued to demonstrate that durability of our storage rental revenue stream and the underlying strength of our business fundamentals. Our performance is tracking in line with our full-year expectations. To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, including overview of results by segments. Then I will address plans and expectations related to our transformation program and our next step to improve service gross margins. I will briefly touch on the recall acquisition calls and also our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since June on the constant dollar basis. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring now to pages eight and nine of our supplemental, total reported revenue was $760 million, compared with $787 million in Q2 of 2014 down, by 3.5% year-over-year. This reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5.7% or $44 million. Excluding FX and so on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.2%. Year-to-date reported revenues were $1.51 billion, compared with $1.56 billion in 2014. Again on a constant dollar basis, first half total revenue growth was also 2.2%. Worldwide revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of 4.1% for the quarter and 4.63% year-to-date. This was offset by service revenue declines of roughly 1% for the quarter and year-to-date. As we did for the prior quarter, we are providing bridging schedules for revenue, OIBDA and earnings which explain key variances in year-on-year performance. These were on Pages 20 to 22 supplemental. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $223 million compared with $242 million in 2014, down 7.7% on a reported basis and 3.3% on a constant dollar basis. The constant dollar adjusted OIBDA decline was driven by investments in new product introductions for example in data management. In addition, we had a $4 million increase in bad debt expense. As Bill mentioned, during the offshoring of our billing activities, our collection efforts fell behind. However, we now have a strong remediation in place. Service margin declines were further drive on the business although these were offset by improvements in storage contribution. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per diluted share, compared with $0.41 in the second quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by 10% increase in share count related to the special distribution, which we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition to the earlier OIBDA write-down, adjusted EPS was also impacted by an increase in interest expense related to higher levels of debt. As stated in our earlier calls, this year-over-year increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion related expenses, such as E&P purge and the depreciation amortization recapture payments. On the subject to debt, please note that it\u2019s our instance to refinance our high coupon debt when conditions allow. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 13.9% compared with 15% in the prior quarter, primarily as result of mix change in income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long-term. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share $0.48 for the quarter, $0.98 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $130 million for the quarter and $255 million year-to-date. Let me now turn to Records Management volume trends on Pages 10 and 11. As you can see, we achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 3% in Western Europe and 9.7% in the other international segment, delivering global records management net volume growth of 2.8%. We continued to experience strong organic growth with second quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.8% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers. We continued to add approximately 30 million gross cubic foot of storage in the last 12 months, consistent with prior periods. Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. In North American records management and information, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was flat for the second quarter. Year-to-date North American RIM internal storage rental revenue grew by 0.2%. Internal service revenue growth showed a small improvement in Q2 with a decline of 1.3%, compared with decline of 1.8% in Q1. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remain solid at 39.4% for the quarter and 40.2% year-to-date. North American Data Management delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.3% in both the second quarter and year-to-date. However, service declined by 1.7% for the quarter and 3.8% year-to-date. As we continue to see declines in re-file and transportation activity. During the second quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 50.8% from 52.7% in Q1, as we continued to invest in new products. The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 3.5% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by declines in internal service revenue, 4.8% for the quarter and 3.7% year-to-date. The decline in service revenue was driven mostly by the sale of our shred business in the UK and Ireland was at the end of last year. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined in Western Europe this quarter due to legal cost related to a customer dispute. The other international segments, which is made up of emerging markets in Australia built strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.3% year-to-date. Service internal growth was 13.5% for the quarter and 10.2% year-to-date. This quarter emerging market revenues represented approximately 14% of our total revenues on a constant dollar basis. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high-teens to low 20s range. We continue to expand our exposure in these fast growing markets. As Bill mentioned, we are leveraging our new leadership structure to focus on integrating across \u2013 cost developed markets. Rail transformation program which was announced last month we expect to achieve approximately $100 million production in overhead expense by 2018. Actions we have taken this month are expected to yield a full year $50 million benefits in 2016. We will see partial benefits this year at the end of the year. However, these will be offset by severance related charges. We are anticipating approximately $10 million of severance related expenses in the third quarter as a result of this program. Let\u2019s now discuss our initiative to maintain and enhance service gross margins. As Bill outlined, decline in service gross margin [indiscernible] as a drag on our performance in the last four years. [Indiscernible] the strong returns that we\u2019re seeing from investments in real estate and M&A. That said, it should also be remember that on a constant dollar basis, we have seen good improvements in overall contribution year-on-year in 2014 and we expect the same in 2015. As discussed earlier and as you can see in the supplemental on Page 26, in the second quarter, service gross margins have declined year-over-year. The actions we are now taking are not yet reflected in our results. In the second half of the year, we expect to see an improvement in service margins that continues to targets a year end run rate of about 27%. Let\u2019s touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As Bill mentioned, we\u2019re making good progress with regulatory filings. To prepare for closing we incurred approximately $6 million professional and advisory fees this quarter. We expect about $10 million to $15 million of additional spend in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year. In addition to these advisory fees we\u2019re expecting approximately $20 million to $25 million charge in the second half of the year to prepare for integration, including Recall\u2019s reconversion. Please note that these costs will be excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation, as they are one-time in nature. These costs are also included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal. As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in June, when we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Recall. Please note that at this time our guidance doesn\u2019t reflect the benefit or impact of potential Recall transaction. We\u2019ll provide detailed guidance for 2016 and beyond at our upcoming Investor Day in October. For 2015 although we expect revenue to be as anticipated on a constant dollar basis for the full year, given FX movements, we expect reported dollar revenues to be towards the lower end of our range. As regard to other metrics for both constant and reported dollars, we expect them to be well within our ranges. Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels within 2015. And we intend to maintain our dividend per share rates for the reminder of the year, subject to Board approval. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains, $470 million, giving us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund our core real estate investments or bow cracking, which support approximately 2% organic growth in our adjusted OIBDA. 2016 and beyond, assuming the Recall acquisition closes and with the transformation benefits, we have excess cash that can support potential growth in the dividend and fund discretionary investments in real estate, M&A, or emerging business opportunities. These investments achieved returns of [indiscernible] and are accreted to shareholders. To sum up, we have adequate dividend coverage, excess capacity and attractive investment options. Shifting to the balance sheet, at the quarter end we have liquidity of approximately $750 million. At quarter end, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7 times as expected. Turning now to REIT specific metrics. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI approximately $28 per racked square foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 84% respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90%s. When we enter a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about three years' time. Investment page, Page 32, the supplemental, highlights our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth related investments and exclude consolidation related expense. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns in our growth racking and building development projects. Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of various metrics of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether facilities are leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. Overall, we believe this is a solid quarter and we\u2019re pleased with the momentum we continue to see in the business. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, improving service margins, achieving overhead cost reductions through our Transformation Program and realizing the synergy benefits of the Recall acquisition. Now that concludes my summary for the Q2 financials. Bill Meaney : Okay, thank you Rod. Before we turn to Q&A, just to wrap up, I just want to emphasize a few things. That first of all, we have a number of exciting developments underway. We have already executed on half of our plan for significant cost reduction of more than a $100 million and we will see the full benefits of the first $50 million for 2016. We have actions underway, that we expect will stabilize the margins in our service business. We are keying up to close the Recall deal early next year and are organized internally to support a smooth integration of Recall. And our attractive emerging business pipeline is delivering interesting adjacencies that can further extend the durability of our enterprise storage business. Finally and most importantly, the strength of our business, plus the transformation program support approximately 11% to 14% growth in the cash we have available already next year to grow our dividend per share over time and fund our growth investment. This is even prior to the Recall acquisition. With that operator, we are ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. Bill, very helpful comment, or there any type of goal post you can give us in terms of cadence on Recall, I know there\u2019s a process involved in any [indiscernible] so on and so forth. But is there anything, you could point to that we kind codage [ph] give us cadence as the deal progresses over the course of the year? Bill Meaney : Hi, good morning, Kevin thanks. Well, I think the same goal post that we set on the beginning is that we started the regulatory review process, rent engaging the regulatory review process and that\u2019s a six to 12 months process. We feel that we should be able to do it at the lower end of that range. So our expectation is still the first quarter for 2016 and the net \u2013 we will continue to update that changes, but I think right now that\u2019s our expectation. I think the other goal post as we said on this call within the next few weeks both us and Recall will be issuing documents for their respective shareholders for the \u2013 get ready for the shareholder votes. But those are probably just two goal posts that are important to highlight. Kevin McVeigh : And then just the $20 million to $25 million of Recall we conversion costs is that something about right, does that mean it\u2019s a dual track in terms of you start that reconversion process now. So when the deal occurs, it was goes lot of day one? Bill Meaney : Yeah, well, I think, that the \u2013 it\u2019s a very good point. Yes, we will start incurring cost and Rod can give you more detail on that. We\u2019ll start incurring cost as we speak now in preparing for the REIT conversion, because we need to convert before the close of the first quarter. So you\u2019ll also note us in the documentation is, that we have set it up the documentation that we will close at the beginning of a quarter. So the idea is that we will close either at the beginning of the first quarter, or either \u2013 the first month of the first quarter, i.e. around the month of January or it would be beginning of the month of the second quarter, again to give us time to actually execute the conversion. But the prep for that conversion obviously starts way in advance of closing the transaction, I don\u2019t know Rod, if you want to add any? Rod Day : Yeah, I think, that\u2019s a good summary, Bill. Kevin I can\u2019t exactly tell you when but it is by the end of the first quarter and obviously given the limited amount of time that we have, it\u2019s important we get our preparation right in advance of that. So it\u2019s really worth spend is primarily related to. Bill Meaney : And you\u2019ll see that in the documentation on the deal is that it\u2019s very clearly set out that if we miss roughly the first say four or five weeks of a quarter then it\u2019s been a delay for the next quarter because again we have to get the conversions done during that period. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And then \u2013 and this will be my last question, I apologize. Would there be any incremental tax expense like [indiscernible] step up from the racking on the initial conversion or that $20 million to $25 million had primarily professional fees things like that? Bill Meaney : Yeah, that relates primarily to professional fees. Kevin McVeigh : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Andy Wittman of Baird. Andy Wittman : Hi, good morning guys. Bill I had kind of a strategic question. We\u2019ve seen some consolidation in the shredding industry. You guys have kind of aided that as you got all of your European shredding. I was wondering as you look at your business today, particularly as a REIT, does even more disposition of the shredding assets make sense for you, particularly if you could find a partner that would be able to do this with. Let me something, you\u2019d be open to considering or our considering today. Bill Meaney : Well, I think first of all just from a general capital allocation standpoint we look at all our businesses and say, we the best owner for that or is that where we should invest capital. So we look across all our businesses. So to say that we are open to certain segments and non-open to others would be probably a false premise. But I mean we like you look with interest in terms of what seems to be happening in the shredding business. We feel good in terms of what we\u2019ve done over the last six, 12 months in terms of first of all divesting those shredding operations the one in Australia, the one in the UK, where we didn\u2019t think we have to scale, we get the kind of returns that we expect in demand. Well, separating the U.S. operation to be more of a standalone unit so that it has the right focus and cadence associated with it to achieve the results that we think are possible. So I think we feel comfortable where we are, but we were also very pleased in terms of the way the market seems to be valuing these assets, whether we own them or we sell them. Andy Wittman : Yeah, okay, good, that\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess I wanted to gain a little bit more in the transformation business. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what some of those, maybe some confidence that they are not going to affect but the customer experience and your retention rates are rather business drivers. Bill Meaney : It\u2019s \u2013 excellent question. So I think first of all, we need to start the top that we are starting from a base, where our SG&A is 28% of sales, which is clearly on the upper end of what our company with our scale and scope should be able to achieve. It should \u2013 company of our scale and scope should be in the, let\u2019s say the mid-20s, I mean, probably the lower side of the mid-20s, in other words, not \u2013 it\u2019s probably kind of more of the 23% to 25% ranges where a company of our size and complexity should be. So that\u2019s the first thing to give you kind of a sense of what\u2019s possible. Then the thing that triggers it is, this \u2013 really if you think about it, there are I would say three buckets. One is just getting efficiency through the reorganizations that when we put all the developed markets under 1% then it allows you to rationalize. You know you have two finance groups, you have two HR groups, you have two commercial leadership groups, you have two engineering groups et cetera. So you\u2019re able to actually shrink that to one to get some of the efficiencies and economics of scale that you would expect. I think the second aspect of it is looking at what we call just general spans and layers, probably it\u2019s triggered by that move by just saying, what is the right breadth of responsibility in the organization. Do we have too many layers? And I think that\u2019s just good housekeeping that all companies our size need to go through every so often to make sure that we don\u2019t have what I would call organizational tree or layers building into the organization and to me that\u2019s important not just from a cost standpoint but it also important from a dynamic standpoint, I mean, by dynamic is to be quicker, nimble, more nimble, less bureaucratic. So I think that\u2019s a \u2013 its shows up in the cost line but we also expect that to show up in the revenue line. And then the third aspect is it\u2019s related a little bit to the aging of some of our aging of our receivable split which lead to a bad debt charge, is that we need to look at our processes first and foremost in terms how can we make those more efficient and then where should those be done, should they be done internally, should they be done internally offshore or should they be done by an outside party. And that\u2019s the third bucket that we are going through both optimized those processes. And then figure out where they should be done either within Iron Mountain or by an outside vendor. And that\u2019s kind of that the three buckets that we\u2019re going through. Now at last when you can imagine we are actually using also some outside help that have done this a number times. So we feel very confident in terms of the targets and we feel very confident that we are doing this in area that doesn\u2019t impact the customer experience and service levels and in fact, I think, our expectation is it should improve, as we look to make the organization quicker, more nimble and less bureaucratic. Rod Day : Yeah I mean, I\u2019ll just add to that, Bill, I think if you benchmark are announced and against comparable type companies, I think, you can say we are behind where we should be on some of the stock. And that gives us confidence around the program that we have. So things like offshoring, we\u2019ve done some of that, but nowhere near enough we have done some process improvement but nowhere near enough. There has been some improvement in our SG&A and as a percent of revenue over the last couple of years. But again if you look at benchmarks, if it is median benchmarks, represents 25%, Bill you know you compare that to where we are obviously. And again I think that gives us additional confidence to what we\u2019re trying to do is now rocket science it\u2019s just what we should be doing. Andy Wittman : Yes, okay. I\u2019ll leave it with that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from the line of George Tong of Piper Jaffray. George Tong : Hi, good morning. Bill Meaney : Good morning, George. George Tong : You\u2019ve talked a bit about various puts and takes in OIBDA margin performance in the quarter and some of it appear to be transient in nature. Can you frame up how you think about OIBDA margin on a go forward basis? And any plan in reinvestments of the benefits you expect from the transformation program? Bill Meaney : So I\u2019ll let \u2013 George, I\u2019ll let Rod kind of go through a little bit more detail, but the bridging to get at a high level and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we provide these bridging schedules is so that you can \u2013 we\u2019re highlighting the things that we \u2013 that in our view are one off either because of that something specifically had in the quarter or when we\u2019re talking about the service, where we think we\u2019re going to end up at the end of the year, in terms of service margins based on some of the improvements that we\u2019re making. So the intent of those bridging schedule is to guide you to where we think we\u2019re moving to \u2013 where we should being on a normalized basis on an OIBDA margin basis. But Rod, may want to comment in more detail on that. Rod Day : Yes, maybe to answer the question in two parts. First, instances would be underlying not sure if you like \u2013 at the P&L, basically what we expect to see continuous improvement in performance as the year progresses. And that is to be expected as you know, that\u2019s key volume continues to build at the decent price closer to decent margin. So quarter after quarter after quarter, we should continue to build. Around that, obviously then you have to some of these one offs in the quarter and we pulled out a couple of them one with this bad debt expense issue and Bill referencing some of the deals related to the offshoring of our drilling activities. We also had a \u2013 an investment in the data management space around new product introduction, which obviously the expectation of that is there will be returns coming from that in future. So there were a couple of some key one-offs for the quarter. But to underlying that that sort of [indiscernible] fundamentals of the P&L, this was a relentless drive upwards on the storage side. George Tong : Got it. And can you talk about how your storage pricing strategy compares with Recall, and how do you think about pricing as a contributor to storage revenue growth going forward? Rod Day : Well, I think, first of all I can\u2019t comment in terms of compared to refocus. We haven\u2019t exchanged or shared any commercial information. We have to go through the regulatory aspects. So I can\u2019t comment on how we compare to Recall. But I think if you look at the results that we\u2019re getting, as you can see \u2013 I mean, I think, the way you look at it is couple of ways, is we\u2019re getting, I would say fairly regular yet modest price increase that offsets the inflation that \u2013 the low inflation levels. But I think as I said, I think, a number of times on calls, there\u2019s been low inflation environment, price increases are more challenging. I think the other thing to look at if you look with the \u2013 if you look at what\u2019s been happening to our gross margins associated with storage you can see they actually, there\u2019s a slight uptick. So that gives you a view that in a low inflation environment obviously we have wage inflation that is still real in terms of what we pay our folks. But we\u2019re able to get both, productivity increases and pricing increases, that allows us to either maintain or slightly enhance our gross margin. So we feel pretty good in terms of what we\u2019re getting, in terms of pricing and something that we continue to work on, I think I told you we brought somebody in about a year-ago, just to our new leader for the pricing group that seems to be getting some good traction. But I also think it\u2019s important to understand that in the low inflation environment, these are small numbers that you are dealing with, you are not dealing with large order of magnitude. But the results are good. I mean our gross margins are stable and I would say it is slightly higher than they were a year-ago. George Tong : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi Bill, I just want to know if the data management, new products were as planned, should we expect a similar level of investment to $1.5 million, in the quarter in the second half of the year. And if you could just give us a little description or these new products in the area of capable all thing or is it something a little different with then data archiving? Bill Meaney : Hi, Andrew, good morning. There is couple of aspects, first of all what we have in the bridge was a very specific one-off associated with our relaunch of a product that\u2019s associated with secured destructions. So that was a very specific one-off re-launch of that particular product. I think that there even if you add that back, you will notice that our margins are slightly down from where they were a year ago, albeit they are very good margins. But they are slightly down. And we didn\u2019t bridge to that for the reason that your highlighting right now is, we are \u2013 we have made a conscious decision to incur some additional OpEx which is associated with launching new products in that area. So one of the areas, I think, we\u2019ve publicized is that we have a partnership with EMC that offers both their customers and our customers a joint, it\u2019s kind of a combination of our datacenter, our Cap business and EMCs data to main business which a datacenter replication hardware offering they have. And that there is an investment associated with standing up those new products. Our expectation, the reason why we didn\u2019t bridge that is you could say that that was a one-off for this quarter, but our expectation is we will continue to make those kind of investments has we see a pipeline of further products like this one that we\u2019ve announced publicly with EMC. So I think that\u2019s the way I would think about. So what we have in the bridge was very specific to a product launch that we did this quarter that we really anticipate as a one off, but we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur some OpEx investments in terms of the new product launches. Andrew Steinerman : And was that always envisioned in the plan like \u2013 so that spending now doesn\u2019t affect the guide for the year. Bill Meaney : Yes, \u2013 no that was always in the plan and that was part of separating data management under a separate leader as you know that we brought in Eileen Sweeney just a year ago specifically, so that was part of the plan. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. And then if you let me one more. The bad debt write-off the 3.8, obviously that\u2019s a surprise. Are you hoping some of the cost initiatives that you\u2019re talking about could offset that? Or does that in some way kind of tilt the EBITDA guidance towards the lower end? Bill Meaney : No, I think that what we\u2019ve said in the press release as you\u2019ve noticed that we think that on a reported dollar basis that we are still within the range of our guidance. On a revenue basis, we think we\u2019re in the lower end of the range, but on a reported dollar basis, but it\u2019s in the range that we\u2019ve guided to. So we still feel comfortable about maintaining our guidance that our OIBDA will be in the range as we said out at the beginning of the year. I think the specific \u2013 think about the specific highlight that we\u2019ve talked about on bad debt and I will ask Rod to comment further. But its more about an ageing issue in terms of when we moved the process, we didn\u2019t optimize the process fully before we moved to offshore and we move that offshore as we slipped behind on the dating. So we feel \u2013 we feel good over the next six months to 12 months that we are \u2013 we will be able to get that back in shape and we are well underway, but you can imagine that when you slip behind on the dating it takes a while to fix that back up, but I don t know Rod, if you want to add? Rod Day : That\u2019s right, Bill in terms of the general component of our bad debt provision its driven by the aging of our receivables and as we move this offshore, the aging deteriorate and a little bit and therefore that triggers an increase in the bad debts and bad debt expense by half a point. And we are \u2013 I think we \u2013 just to make sure as clear as I, we will get back to our normal range of about a half a point of revenue in terms of bad debt expense\u2026 Andrew Steinerman : Right. Bill Meaney : Absolutely right, and though \u2013 I don\u2019t know we have various rigorous plans to ensure that that is the case. And just to be absolutely clear in terms of the contribution guidance, we\u2019re in no way signaling the lower end of the ranges very well, so within the range on that. Andrew Steinerman : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev of Jefferies. Dan Dolev : It\u2019s actually Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll ask few questions. We thought a few weeks ago, Bill you did the conference call, you mentioned service margins stabilizing. I see a 330 basis points decline. What gives you confidence that that you could actually stabilize margins in the coming quarters? Bill Meaney : Hey, good morning Dan. [Indiscernible] it\u2019s a good question. So if we look \u2013 obviously this quarter was below our target of getting 27% by the end of the year. But if you actually \u2013 when we looked at the performance as part of the improvement program we looked at. If we took the month of May, May was a specifically weak month for us on this quarter in terms of our service margin and profitability. If we took the month of May out, we would have 26.1% service margin in this quarter, which is still a 100 basis points, but we know how to bridge that gap. And even when we looked at May some of the things that we\u2019re introducing, we get the sprit [ph] to manage them. So with the month of May, was particularly soft really two things, was one, is verbalizing some of our cost quick enough associated with a normal downtick in revenue, because there is some seasonality in revenue and plus it was a short month. But in terms of the way the holiday is felt. So those two things that \u2013 which is part of our program, if you remember our three-pronged approach to this is verbalizing our cost base more which the month of May is a great example in terms of what that program is designed to offset. The second thing is using outside parties, and the third one is technology. So, again, the data for the quarter looks worse than it is if you know what I mean in terms \u2013 especially if we add back some of the programs that we\u2019ve introduced to minimize that going forward. So we still are sticking by our guidance that we think by the end of the year will be at 27%. Dan Dolev : hank you and two more quick questions. On the bad debt expense, I know you\u2019ve addressed it fully, so the uptick from 50 basis points to 70 basis points, is that \u2013 was that a result of ageing or did I misunderstand it? Bill Meaney : Yes, it\u2019s primarily the result of ageing, is the issue that we\u2019ve referred to earlier. Dan Dolev : Got it. And without result in any impairment to the capitalized acquisition cost on the balance sheet or\u2026 Bill Meaney : No, no, not, no. Dan Dolev : Nothing, okay. And then last question, when I was looking at \u2013 EPS obviously was a little slight outdated versus consensus. If you look at both FFO and EPS, it does imply a very significant acceleration in the second half of the year, can you maybe talk a little bit about how your components have actually getting it. Bill Meaney : Well, I think first of all on the AFFO basis you see, we\u2019re actually been ahead of where the consensus status coming out. So first of all from a cash standpoint we\u2019re actually ahead. I think the bridging schedules I think do a pretty good job in terms of what the puts and the takes were in terms of why we ended up a bit below on consensus. But if you just look at our normal ramp in the second half of the year, part of this is just in terms that we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance we give a year guidance and part of this just a way that the [indiscernible] besides the carve out our annual guidance. So if you just look at historical ramps in the second half, you don\u2019t find this is as surprise. That\u2019s why I feel very comfortable in terms of maintaining our guidance. Rod Day : I mean may be just talk specific about EPS, year-to-date we\u2019re at on an adjusted basis $0.60 a share, the midpoint of our guidance for the full year is $122.5 million [ph]. And so you could see we\u2019re almost at the halfway point. As I was saying earlier, because of the dynamics of our business, the storage revenue and contribution growing and quarter-after-quarter, I think you can sort of see how we can reach that point. Dan Dolev : Right, I was also referring to FFO, it\u2019s a midpoint is about a \u2013 it prices about 14% acceleration? Bill Meaney : And I think what\u2019s deciding is the same logic, if you like in terms of the flow through, the P&L. So we expect contributions to continue to build, that actually has a disproportion of banks, in sense of the flow through to the FFO. So again we feel comfortable around that number. Dan Dolev : Great, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Shlomo here. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Yes, Bill, could you go into little bit more detail what you mean about variabilizing the cost with third-party logistics vendors, and we talked about working with like UPS or FedEx or something? Rod Day : Yeah, good morning, Shlomo. Well, there is two parts, it is variabilizing and is using third-party so that there \u2013 and you could say that there kind of two \u2013 there is two ways of doing it. We also look at variabilizing more of our cost under own our control and we do use temporary workers that are trained and certified and cleared by Iron Mountain, it\u2019s getting that mix right. So first of all we do have a variabilized workforce internally and making sure that we are using more of that which is the thing that helps to offset some of these variabilization of some of the service revenue that goes through and then service revenue for us don\u2019t forget it is more than just transport they rather bid that are contract based so that\u2019s one aspect. And then on the 3PL side, yes it is like the \u2013 it\u2019s the FedEx and UPSs of this world and other courier services. We use some of them today, we use them more extensively in some European countries, where we \u2013 where the necessity has come even faster because of the size of some of our operations in some of the smaller countries. And we\u2019re using that same doll as a know-how to accelerate that in North America. So it is anytime those logos and others. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thanks for your clarification. Then maybe this is for Rod, the non-real estate investments in the maintenance CapEx, at least for the first half of the year is trending well below the annual targets. Is this expected to get a tick up in the second half of the year or for some reason, where just current levels are more of a good run rate. How should we think of that? Rod Day : I think there will be a tick up in the second half of the year, but closer to the guidance numbers that we issued in June. It\u2019s just to do with the phasing at certain aspects of all activity. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Is that a \u2013 is there seasonal component to that or it just happens to be year-by-year, and works in different parts of your base and what your plans are? Bill Meaney : It\u2019s actually largely based on our own plans. It\u2019s an element of seasonality around some of the maintenance activity that we prefer to sort of backload as opposed to doing in the middle of winter of January, February. But it\u2019s largely down to our own planning. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, and then am I understanding you correctly that while you are guiding to the low end of the guidance range because of currency for revenue, you are not winning [ph] to that for \u2013 what for \u2013 am I misunderstanding that? Bill Meaney : Yeah, that\u2019s correct, that\u2019s correct. So we are taking action on cost to ensure that we still stay towards the midpoint of our guidance right from a constant and a real dollar perspective on contribution and cash. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And is that because of this program or largely because of this program that you just announced [indiscernible] third quarter charge? Bill Meaney : No, actually that\u2019s not that specifically in fact that the transformation program for us is neutral because we incur severance charge during Q3, which will be offset by run rate savings in Q4. This is more due to other activity that we\u2019re taking. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Bill Meaney : Okay, well thank you very much everyone for joining us this morning and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker) Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the Iron Mountain Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Faten Freiha, Director of Investor Relations. Faten Freiha - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Hula, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This morning, I'll be filling in for Melissa Marsden, who couldn't be here with us today, due to a family matter. We'll begin the call with Bill Meaney, our CEO, who'll discuss highlights for the quarter and progress toward our strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we've done for the last few quarters, we've posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2015 and 2016 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Faten, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be report a solid third quarter results that were at the upper end of our profit expectations and underscore the durability of our core business. It's based upon this continued demonstration of the growth and durability of our business that our Board of Directors has resumed our growth in dividends and has pull forward the dividend increase by declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.485 per share. I suspect most of you on the call today, either attended in person or listened to the webcast of our Investor Day about two weeks ago. Therefore, I won't go into a long discussion of our strategy, goals or longer-term expectations, as I believe time would be better spent on Q&A. That's said, I would like to briefly reiterate a few main points from our event and relate how our Q3 results fit within that framework. For those, who haven't heard the live event or listened to the replay, we laid out our vision for the year 2020, given that we are rapidly approaching the end of the three-year strategic plan that we introduced at our Investor Day in the beginning of 2014. More specifically, we described our past performance and go-forward vision for our three strategic pillars, developed markets, emerging markets and adjacent businesses. In developed markets, our strategic plan over the last two years has turned around these relatively flat internal growth markets and driven more than 7 million cubic feet of net new records, all prior to acquisition. In emerging markets, our sales expanded from representing 10% of total revenue in 2013 to 14.3% of total revenue by the end of Q3 on a constant dollar basis. These markets are growing 10% to 15% per year before acquisitions and our goal to reach 20% of total volume from these markets by 2020 is within our grasp. Roughly 18% of the 20% goal will be reached by internal growth alone. In adjacent businesses, we expect revenue to represent 5% of our total worldwide revenue in 2020, up from just 2% today. Currently, our adjacent businesses are comprised of our datacenter business and our recently announced acquisition of Crozier Fine Arts Storage, the leading arts storage business in the U.S. This is a natural extension of our film and sound business. Crozier comes with about a 0.5 million square feet of owned real estate and achieves about 10% sales growth per year before acquisitions. We anticipate closing this deal in December. This all adds up to a shift in mix with 25% of our revenue coming from faster growth markets and businesses by 2020. That's up from 15% today with a majority of increase coming from internal growth. The expected impact from this shift is that by 2020 annual internal profit will grow by roughly 5% or 7% with acquisitions versus 2% and 4%, respectively, today. We also enhanced our Transformation program to deliver a total of $125 million of overhead savings, up from the $100 million we announced this summer. You can see from the bridging schedules in the supplemental that we recorded $9 million of charges in Q3 related to this program. We expect to realize partial year benefit of the first $50 million in savings in the fourth quarter, offsetting this charge. The full $50 million annualized benefit will flow through in 2016 and beyond. And our next set of actions to be taken in early 2016 will represent another $50 million of annualized savings in 2017. So we're getting more from our efforts in this program and we're getting it faster than originally anticipated. We outlined our plans to continue to increase the percentage of owned real estate over time through our programs, which deliver improved operating economics with the consolidation of facilities. Lastly, we demonstrated future cash generation on a run rate basis to support growth in dividends and investment, both on a standalone basis and including Recall. On a standalone basis, the continued strong and durable cash of the base business, coupled with the Transformation Program, will at a minimum allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018, whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018 and reduces leverage by 0.7 turns. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall. Now, turning to Q3 financial and operating highlights, total revenue for the quarter grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.2%. The impact from foreign currency on total revenues was roughly 7%, reflecting the continued strong appreciation of the dollar against several of our major functional currencies. Moreover, we should note that we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity this quarter, as we deferred transactions to assess how they may be affected by the Recall acquisition. Having now fully assessed the benefit of the Recall acquisition, we have resumed M&A activity with an appropriately adjusted focus to account for Recall's footprint. This quarter, we continued to see good internal growth with storage rental up 2.8% for both the quarter and year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, Other International and Western Europe. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. Looking at volume in Records Management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 2.7% net growth. Globally, we retained 98% of all customers. This is in line with our second quarter and a 20% improvement from the customer turnover we experienced just two years ago. We continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded, some 30 million cubic feet from our existing customers year after year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. The durability of our business is demonstrated by solid growth in bookings we are seeing across major verticals. In addition, we encouraged by year-to-date low double-digit increase in the midmarket customer bookings, as we continue to increase our focus on these small to midsize enterprises where our market share of the total market is roughly 10%. We are pleased to report solid improvement in our service gross margins as a result of numerous initiatives. Q3 total service gross margin was 28.5%. However, when normalizing for the reclassification between storage and service, Q3 total service gross margins were approximately 26.8% and we are well on track to achieve our expected end-of-year run rate of between 27% and 27.5%. Now, let's turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. With the benefit from a number of months of detailed and joint integration planning with our Recall counterparts, we remain comfortable with the estimated total net synergies of $155 million, with $110 million of that to be achieved in 2017. As we've noted in the past, there is potential upside to these figures as we work through real estate consolidation opportunities. We remain on track from a regulatory standpoint and we continue to target a close in early 2016. As I've said previously, our business is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance even in the most volatile times. With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Bill. We're pleased with this quarter's strong operating performance and the momentum we continue to see in our business. Our results continue to underscore the strength and durability of our storage rental business and the incremental returns we're generating from our investments. Similar to Bill, my remarks this morning will be brief. I'll begin with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date performance, including a review of results by segments, and an update on cost related to the potential Recall transaction. Finally, I will touch briefly on our outlook for 2015 and 2016. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring to pages eight and nine of our supplemental, total reported revenues for the quarter was $747 million compared with $783 million in the prior year. This decline reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 6.6% or $50 million year-over-year. Excluding FX, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2%. Year-to-date reported revenues were $2.26 billion compared with $2.34 billion in 2014. And again, excluding FX, also grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis. Total revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 4% for the quarter and year-to-date. This was offset by modest service revenue declines of roughly 1.3% for the quarter and 1.1% year-to-date. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue is partially driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the UK and Australia. Consistent with prior quarters, we're providing bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance. These schedules are on pages 20 through 22 of the supplemental. In addition, this quarter, we're providing a bridging schedule on page 23 to explain the change at our total service gross margin. In this schedule, we have normalized for the accounting adjustment that Bill referenced. And our projected year-end run rate of 27% to 27.5% is consistent with that normalized basis. Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $228 million compared to $235 million in 2014. Excluding FX, adjusted OIBDA was up 2.3%. Our adjusted OIBDA for Q3 2015 included $9 million of charges related to our Transformation program. Excluding these costs, adjusted OIBDA would have been $237 million or grown 6.5% on a normalized constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 1.5% on a constant dollar basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect to incur very little in charges related to the Transformation product initiative. Please note that our savings outlook for Transformation remain consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the third quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by a 9% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 2014, as well as the restructuring charges related to Transformation. Excluding the increase in share count and the Transformation costs, normalized adjusted EPS grew by 8.7% for the quarter. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 16.5% compared with 16.3% for the prior quarter and 13.9% in Q2. The sequential increase in our structural tax rate was driven by the expenses related to the Recall acquisition and debt refinancing costs, which lowered our QRS pre-tax income. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% in the short-term. Our blended rate, following the close of the potential Recall acquisition, will be closer to 20%, as we noted when we announced the deal. Normalized funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.55 for the quarter and $1.53 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $137 million for the quarter and $395 million year-to-date. Let's turn to our financial performance by segments. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue showed a decline of 0.3% for the third quarter and is flat year-to-date. North American RIM internal storage rental growth can vary on a quarterly basis and is often impacted by the timing of large contract renegotiations. For the last eight quarters, it has varied from 0.9% to minus 0.4%. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to continued decrease in retrieve/refile activity levels and the timing of non-recurring imaging projects that were in the year-ago period. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remained solid at 40% for the quarter and year-to-date. North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of more than 5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. However, internal service declined by 4.9% for the quarter and 4.1% year-to-date, as we continue to see declines in tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the third quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained stronger at 51.6% compared with 50.8% in Q2. The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 1.4% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 2.8% year-to-date. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in non-recurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong in Western Europe at 31.2%. The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.4% year-to-date. Service internal growth was 12.3% for the quarter and 10.9% year-to-date. We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens and low 20%s range in the short-term, as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we're making good progress with the regulatory process and we anticipate closing the deal early in 2016. To prepare for closing, this quarter, we incurred approximately $15 million of professional and advisory fees, including cost to prepare for Recall's REIT reconversion. We expect about $25 million to $30 million of additional Recall cost in the fourth quarter. Please note that these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations, as they are one-time in nature. Importantly, these costs were included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal. As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 and 2016 remains consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this month at our Investor Day. But one exception to that is that we tightened our expected real estate investment range and lowered it by roughly $30 million at the midpoint relative to the projections provided at our Investor Day due to the focus on in timing of our real estate consolidation program. Given FX fluctuations and to provide better visibility of the underlying performance of our business, we're providing constant dollar guidance figures for 2016 and our plan is to continue that practice. Please note that our current 2016 guidance is based on 2015 constant dollar budget rates, which was set in January 2015. When we'll report full year 2015 results in February, we will provide an updated 2016 guidance based on 2016 constant dollar budget rates, which will be set in early January 2016. We've got the question from some of you on R$ guidance for 2016. Assuming constant September 30 FX rates, our exit FX impact for the quarter on total revenue, where approximately 40% of it denominated in non-U.S. dollars, is roughly 3.5%. Again, holding that constant for 2016, it implies a 3.5% FX impact on revenues, which translates into roughly $120 million impact for the full year. Beyond the dividend increase that Bill mentioned for the upcoming quarter, we laid out at our Investor Day minimum projected dividends per share guidance through 2018 on a standalone basis and the combined basis with Recall. Please refer to the presentation and webcast for more details. Late in September, we raised $1 billion of debt at 6%, enabling us to pay off some of our very high interest legacy debt and lowering our average interest costs. At the quarter end, we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Note that this figure is prior to the October 2015 redemption of our outstanding 6.75% euro notes and 7.75% U.S. notes and 8.375% U.S. notes. Following the redemption, liquidity will be approximately $900 million. Lastly, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7 times as expected. Turning now to page 34 for supplemental where we highlight our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, the total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth-related investments and exclude consolidated-related spend. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns on our growth racking and building development projects. So far this year, our investment in M&A and real estate investment activity has been lower than typical as we prepare for the potential Recall acquisition. We are focusing future plans on the synergy potential fuelled by our real estate consolidation between the companies. Overall, we believe this was a solid quarter and we're pleased with the progress we have made so far in advancing our Transformation program and stabilizing service gross margins. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015 as well as our long-term objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives our cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. And with that, operator, we will now take questions. Operator : The first question comes from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Good morning. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Andy. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you for the details. I wanted to ask about the relationship between some of the organic volumes and the organic revenue growth rates in your two mature markets. It looks like in North American RIM organic revenue was minus 1.2%. The volumes were about flat; kind of a similar relationship in Western Europe where revenue was down 3.3%, but \u2013 I'm sorry, organic volumes were up over 3%, but total revenue was just on the positive side of flat. So, is there a pricing dynamic that's in there or is there something else going on? If you can give us some color around that relationship it would be helpful. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the \u2013 Andy, I think there's two aspects. One is the \u2013 one set of data, if we look at the price changes measured in revenue in terms of constant dollar storage, it's quarter-on-quarter. And when we look at volume, it's trailing 12 months. So, you can't quite put the two of them together. But if you kind of look at North America, North America is achieving similar types net volume growth organically, or before acquisitions, as we were last year. So, it's actually up in terms of volume. We've had some pricing adjustments this quarter due to some renewals, which I think we talked about a little bit on Investor Day. It's not unusual during certain times of the year. And if you go back over, say, the last two to three years, you'll see that we have maybe two, three, four quarters of positive internal storage revenue growth in North America and then it's punctuated by one or two quarters generally of negative, which is usually associated when we're doing renewals. But you can't \u2013 because one set of data, in terms if we look at the revenue side, is quarter-by-quarter, you can't link that to volume, which is just on trailing 12 months. I don't know, Rod, if you want to add anything to that. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I think that's right. It's difficult to do the comparisons on a true like-for-like basis, as you said. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That makes total sense. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The only thing I would add, Andy, from a modeling standpoint, it's still what we've been saying consistently is that, so the volume \u2013 you can back out the volume increases that we're getting both in North America and in Europe. So that's easy. And then, in terms of the revenue increase, we still are achieving somewhere between 0.5% to 1% annual price increase in those markets. So, we're a little bit \u2013 we're starting to move a little bit more towards the upper part in that range through some of the technology we've added, but it's basically in that 0.5% to 1% on top of the volume growth that we're getting. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, Rod, with \u2013 after doing the October notes refi on to the line, the coordinates are a little bit tighter. Are you looking at tapping the unsecured market to term some of that debt out or is there complications with the pending Recall deal that we have to factor into your calculus here? Some of your thoughts on the capital structure would be helpful, I think. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I think we're happy with the capital structure that we have at the moment, particularly having paid off the very high interest notes that we had. Effectively, what we'd like to do is hold what we have, see what happens through the Recall deal, which is to say we anticipate it to close in early Q1, but we're still working through the regulatory process there. It gives us some capital to assist with that on closure, if you like. But \u2013 so we're going to kind of hold what we've got and see how we get on with Recall. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks. Hey, nice job. Asking about Recall, but just one more time, because it'd probably be the last time before it closes. Bill, I know you're working through the regulatory, is it \u2013 are there any kind of goal post or anything that we should look out or is it just something you'll update once you're through the regulatory process? Because obviously something came out of the UK last week from the authorities, it looks like relatively benign. But is there any kind of disclosures you just think we should focus on as we get closer to the close process? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Kevin. I appreciate the question. I think if you can imagine that the regulators like these discussions to be kept confidential as we go through them. I think the \u2013 but I mean just to give you guidance, I think it's pretty much what we said at Investor Day is, we're engaged with the four regulatory authorities that have shown interest in the transaction, which is the U.S., Canada, the UK, as you mentioned, and Australia. We feel that we're well engaged with those authorities, so on track for a Q1 close and the discussions are ongoing. But where we sit today, we feel good that it's in line with our expectations when we set out on the course. So, nothing has changed. I mean, generally, these things take six months to 12 months, when you go through a regulatory process in the United States, for instance, but we continue to guide at the lower end of that range because we feel good where we stand. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And then, as you think about the progression, kind of the volume growth, I've always thought that you'd start to see destructions and permanent removal start to kind of trail off, and then new volume growth, I mean, just the customers kicks up. Does that kind of ratio still hold through as we're coming out of this kind of cycle in terms of things we look forward, as a volume growth starts to reaccelerate here? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, look, you're right. I mean you've watched this for a long time. There's ebbs and flows. I'm not sure you can always do the cause and effect between perm-outs (29:07) and destructions, but \u2013 and customer withdrawals, but I think the \u2013 there is ebb and flow between the two. And the other thing I should point out is the new sales growth is, it's part art and part science, because some of that new sales growth comes from existing customers. And that split between new sales growth and what comes from \"existing customers\" is much to do in terms of the way we compensate our sales force. In other words, if they get something \u2013 if they get some growth out of an existing customer, but we deemed it as a new area or new location or new department, then we call that a new sale. So I think there is some ebb and flow between the two. And as you know, if we look at the heavily regulated industries, which we have a \u2013 which is a big part of our business, is a lot of that's affected by different litigation that's going on around the world. So I think there is some cause and effects, but I wouldn't overplay it. There's a certain amount of randomness to it. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Cool. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi. This is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. Just looking at your updated guidance, it seems like there's a slightly better OIBDA margins at the midpoint versus last quarter. Can you discuss what is making you incrementally more positive on margins? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I'll let Rod answer that. I think just on a high level, there's a couple things. I think one is if you even look over time, we're pretty good at driving productivity out of the business. Because when you start off, what I was saying earlier is that, we get \u2013 currently, in this low inflation environment, we get somewhere between 0.5% to 1% increase in price. Obviously, our labor cost in certain markets goes up faster than that. So, we continually drive productivity through the business. And that's what really drives our OIBDA growth. And then, I think you can expect also when some of the transformation gets fully realized, now that we're through most of the restructuring cost in this quarter, you could expect that that will even pick up a little bit more. But, Rod, you may want to comment further. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, maybe just to build on what you're saying, you're absolutely right in terms of the point that was made. If you look at our guidance \u2013 take the C$ guidance that we updated at Investor Day, in effect what we're saying is that from a revenue point of view, we see ourselves at the middle of the range, and contribution, we see ourselves more towards the higher point of the range. And obviously, therefore the OIBDA margin goes up. Really, what's behind that is the work that we've been doing on efficiencies around service margin and also around the Transformation efforts that we've referenced. Some of that has come through in 2015 faster than we originally anticipated when we set the guidance back in January. And really, that's what's behind the improvement we're seeing. Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it. Thanks. And then, can you just discuss which emerging markets are showing the strongest growth and if that growth reflects expansion in those markets or it's increasing volumes? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think on the emerging markets, we're seeing it pretty much across the board, but it depends on the size of the base. So, for instance, I just came back from Eastern Europe and took couple of members of the board along with me so they could see up close what we're doing out there and also see some of the talent we've got. So, Eastern Europe is growing \u2013 continues to grow extremely well so does in Latin America. I mean, the challenge in Latin America, Brazil, which is our largest operation, for instance, is in terms of growth. And if you measure it in Brazilian real, it is strongly double-digit and continues to do well. I mean, the issue, of course, in places like Brazil is the translation of that because the real's been under pressure. And then Asia, which is a smaller portion of our portfolio, but again has very strong growth rates, whether you look at India, or you look at places like Hong Kong, Singapore and China. The one thing I would point out, though, is that in markets \u2013 even in markets like Brazil, where we've been under pressure from a real standpoint, so when you translate that in U.S. dollars, the growth may be muted slightly, is we've also been able \u2013 in some of these cases like Brazil, been able to borrow locally in real, which has helped to hedge some of that translation. But I would say pretty much across the board. We haven't seen any slowdown in the emerging markets and all the countries typically run in that low double-digit of internal growth before acquisitions. Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, there. I know there's a couple of questions already on FX, but if it's possible, Rod, could you just give us the mix of currencies, so we could those calculations ourselves, the mix of currencies? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, really, obviously, we deal in quite a number of currencies in terms of what's impacting our numbers. And I think in terms of the short-term impact, the \u2013 where we've seen the hit is being Canadian dollar, Russian ruble, Aussie dollar, the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. So they've been hitting us during Q3. If you were to take a longer term view, so more looking year-on-year, there sort of wider effects coming in from sterling in particular, where obviously also we have quite a significant business. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The only thing I'd like to add to that, Andrew, is that, whilst you've seen the FX headwinds in revenue, you'll note that it gets muted pretty quickly as we start going through the OIBDA and the EPS line. And the \u2013 where we are at a stage is, in some sense the timing is not bad for us because we are using strong U.S. dollars to invest and build out this portfolio, which is still a relatively small portion in terms of the countries where the currency is mostly impacted, which is in the emerging markets. I'm not saying that the other markets aren't a factor. So, if you say 40% of our sales are in foreign currency, but the currencies that are impacted typically are in that, a little less than 15% emerging market area. And those are areas where our OIBDA margins at this point are lower because we're building scale in those markets. So we're taking strong U.S. dollars to build out these markets right now. And their impact \u2013 even with the negative FX impact, the impact on OIBDA in earnings is muted. It's obviously fully affected at the revenue line, but when you see what happens to earnings, it's muted. So, I agree you need to model it out, but the earnings is not as sensitive as you might think to the FX, whereas you do see the full sensitivity on the revenue line. That's why we feel comfortable about already starting to increase our dividend because we feel that we've got enough momentum in the business that we can continue and start back on our growth trend in terms of dividends. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That sounds natural (36:27). I'm hoping I could ask a second question. Could you, Rod, talk a little bit more about the OIBDA margin of 30.5% in the third quarter? Were there any one-off helps to that margin? And what puts and takes should we keep in mind as we compare the third quarter OIBDA margins to the implied fourth quarter margin in the guide? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, nothing particularly unusual in Q3. Obviously, other than the fact, we actually booked the $9 million restructuring charge, which actually lowered the margin slightly. I think as we look to Q4, again, sitting here today, I'm not seeing anything particularly unusual that should come through. Obviously, we won't have a repeat of the $9 million charge and there would be some benefit from that actually hitting us in Q4 as a result of the slightly lower cost base. But other than that, I think it's pretty much steady as she goes. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'm just trying to compare the storage revenue that was in North American RIM that was slightly negative versus the trends that we're seeing in the charts where you have positive volume growth. And the positive volume growth, if you exclude the acquisitions, has been kind of modestly creeping downwards, but you still got positive growth, but we're seeing kind of negative revenue on an organic basis. Can you kind of just explain that? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Shlomo, let me start off and then Rod can add any color that he thinks that I missed out. So I think, first, let's look at the revenue growth. So if you go back, say, to Q4 2013, right, and you just look at the number of quarters, you'll see that North American storage rental revenue growth has gone negative 0.4%, negative 0.3%, plus 0.3%, plus 0.4%, plus 0.9%, plus 0.5%, and then in the last two quarters a negative 0.1% and negative 0.3%. So you'll see, first of all, which I was referring to earlier, you'll see that moving around and you can kind of get that \u2013 you can back into that through the supplemental. And so, on the revenue side, because as you can appreciate when we renegotiate large enterprise deals that you do get \u2013 in any given quarter, you can get a significant impact in terms of the revenue associated per cube. So there's a disconnect between that volume growth. Over a long period of time, though \u2013 if you look at the trend over a long period of time, we still see, if you take the revenue growth and if you look on an annualized basis, we're getting between 0.5% and 1% in terms of price per cube growth, then you get those two bits combined and that will give you a good guide in terms of what the internal storage revenue growth is for a particular market. So, the \u2013 you're right to point out that we continue to drive significant \u2013 I'd say on a percentage basis relatively small percentage growth in North America, but in terms of volume, because of the size of the North American business, as you know, the law of large numbers, we continue to deliver a significant amount of organic cube volume growth in North America. And over a 12-month period, you should think about 0.5% to 1% price growth on top of that cube growth. But any given quarter, depending on where we are in renewal cycle, especially for the large contracts, if you go back over the last, I don't know, eight quarters, nine quarters, 10 quarters, you'll see that movement around where we'll have one or two quarters where it'll be negative, two quarters or three quarters will be positive and it just kind of moves around. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So just when I look at the trends on the volume growth, so if you take the total company and then North America, which probably is having the largest impact, you're seeing just kind of a modest organic trend down over the last four quarters, if you \u2013 I'm excluding acquired volume, because I think that that's appropriate for this. But if you look at it, you're seeing the organic, say, going from 0.6% \u2013 in North America, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.1% and on total you're going 2%, 1.9%, 1.8%, 1.7%, is there \u2013 we had seen kind of a run up, that whole organic number had been going \u2013 trending up from the middle of 2013 through basically 3Q 2014 and then we're starting to see that coming down. Is there any color you can give to that, those numbers moving in that direction? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, look, I think that it's a little bit is what I think Kevin asked earlier in terms of kind of tos-and-fros between customer cycles, there's a bit of that. I think, also, it's fair to say on a percentage basis, it is coming down slightly because, I mean, partly driven by customer activity, but a big part of it is just the large number. So if you look at the constant \u2013 if you look at the volume of cubes coming in, we're still seeing very consistently across the board 30 million cubes coming in on a growth level and, say, 40 million cubes net coming in. I think the one of the things that we do where you'll see us try to even tap into another market, which we think is quite large, is what we're doing in the mid-market. So I think if you look at where we are on the mid-market side, I think I actually misquoted is we're in kind of low double-digit growth, if we look at year-on-year bookings for new sales across the board. But in the mid-market, year-to-date, we're up over 60% in terms of bookings in the mid-market where we only have 10% market share. So I think there's some things where we can tap into \"another large market\", but I think it is fair to say that if you look at our core, our normal hunting ground, if you will, it's the law of large numbers and there is a limit in terms of how much more we can get from those customers. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, that's fair. And can you \u2013 Rod, can you just explain that reallocation of margin between the services and the storage business, what is that all about? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It was actually to do with our \u2013 predominantly to do with our data center business where we had some costs that were in the service line that we really analyze where (42:53) we thought they should be in the storage line. So that sort of artificially enhanced the service margin in Q3. So we didn't want to give the impression that we were \u2013 the true underlying run rate was 28.5%, which is what we recorded, that is more like 26%, 26.8%. So that \u2013 it was just a reallocation of cost following a more detailed reviewing. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Does that support the REIT structure when those were reallocated like that? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In that case, it has a very, very minor impact, but \u2013 so it doesn't affect our assets as such (43:31) in any meaningful way. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. If I could just squeeze in one more, there's a pretty large range at the end of the year right now, $0.15 on EPS. Is there any reason why it's so large or is there something that you're anticipating some investments that you're still contemplating at this point in time that can move it around? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. And obviously, we are subject to FX volatility, which during Q3 moved against us. Actually, if you look during the first few weeks of October, it's moved slightly back in our favor. So that can swing the numbers around. But in terms of the fundamentals of the business, it's relatively stable. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : There are no questions in queue. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, operator. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. I know it's a busy time for everyone, but just to sum up. We're very pleased the way the quarter came out. It was a very good quarter driven by the strong \u2013 or continued strong operating performance I should say and has delivered profit that set the upper end of our expectations. So we feel really good about the quarter and hence the recommencing of our dividend increases that we declared this morning. So, thank you, everyone, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes call. You may now disconnect.",

George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker) Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the conference call. I will turn the call over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Cathy. Welcome. Good morning, everyone, to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This morning we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic initiative; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks we'll open up the phones for Q&A, and as we've done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at ironmountain.com, under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the Supplemental, today's earnings call and slides will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's Supplemental, the earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this Supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial and operating results that in every respect met or exceeded our expectations in constant dollars, with reported EPS for the quarter beating expectations. Our results continued to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business, even in these volatile times. Total revenue in constant dollars was in line with our guidance and constant dollar adjusted OIBDA was at the upper end of our range. We continued to achieve solid growth in storage rental revenue, as well as consistent volume growth in new records from existing customers. We also achieved service gross margins in line with our year-end exit rate goal, as well as growth in adjusted OIBDA. All of these accomplishments resulted in a very good 2015. I believe most of you are familiar with the strategic plan we outlined at our Investor Day last fall. To assist in tracking our progress against that plan we've modified the earnings commentary at the beginning of our supplemental disclosure to highlight key performance metrics. You'll note that in addition to our solid financial performance in 2015, we've made good progress against our objectives in each of the three pillars and in the foundational elements that support our strategy. As anticipated, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to impact our reported revenue. However, when looking through to fundamental performance, we've achieved a significant turnaround in the business in the last two years. We've gone from negative internal growth in total revenue in both 2012 and 2013 to 1% positive internal growth, or prior to acquisitions in 2014. And in 2015, we achieved further improvement with 1.5% positive internal growth. This is a testament to the hard work our organization has undertaken to, first, achieve net Records Management volume in all major markets, enhance customer service and retention whilst attracting new customers, stabilize service revenue declines in Records Management, penetrate new emerging markets and advancing adjacent business opportunities. Turning to the pillars of our strategic plan in developed markets, our focus over the last two years on getting more growth from these regions has driven improved performance with positive internal storage growth, stabilizing Records Management service revenues and adding roughly three million cubic feet of net new records in 2015, prior to acquisitions. In emerging markets, our revenue has grown from 10% of the total in 2013 to 14.6% of total revenue at the end of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. We have a sizable deal pipeline and are confident we will reach our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by 2016, and 20% by 2020. Importantly, we're driving internal growth in these markets of roughly 10% per year, so just two points of our 20% goal comes from acquisitions. We resumed M&A activity in select emerging markets in the fourth quarter, closing on a transaction in India. We have adjusted our focus to account for Recall's footprint and expect to close a few transactions in the first half of 2016, including a couple in fast-growing new emerging markets with underserved demand for records management. As we've noted in recent calls, despite the impact of the strong dollar on reported revenue, we mitigate our FX exposure at the income level because our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, and we are increasingly moving more of our debt outside the United States. The net of this is that we exceeded earnings expectations for the fourth quarter. Additionally, using strong dollars to invest in high-growth markets outside the U.S. gives us a lower cost basis and sets us up to realize significant value creation as the economic growth in these markets, over the longer term, will typically outpace that of the United States. I should note that in our Other International segment, which is emerging markets plus Australia, we did see a higher level of destructions in Q4 driven by a single large customer, which will carry over into Q1 of 2016. However, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that destructions for the remainder of the year will return to more typical levels. But we do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis and therefore this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. We also have a goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. Today, our adjacent businesses consist of our data center operations and our recently acquired art storage business. We closed on Crozier Fine Arts storage in December and are pleased with how it is being integrated into our business whilst retaining the DNA and key management talent that made it the leading art storage business in the United States. We believe the billion-dollar estimated global market is poised for the same type of consolidation opportunity we saw in the records management business years ago, and we have a plan that can take it to $100 million within three years. We had a fairly aggressive goal for 2015 to finish with an adjacent business revenue run rate of $50 million from a starting point below $20 million. We achieved that with roughly a $20 million revenue run rate from our data center business and $30 million from art storage. This all supports our planned shift in mix by 2020 to have 25% of our revenue coming from both emerging markets and adjacent businesses that have internal growth rates closer to 10%, up from 15% of our revenue in these higher growth businesses today. In terms of the foundational elements of our strategy, we have made significant progress on our Transformation initiative, effecting changes that have resulted in $50 million of net savings in 2016. We are finalizing the next set of initiatives that will deliver an additional $50 million of savings by year end 2016. As previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the Transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Importantly, the cost to achieve these savings in each year is offset by the savings. As a reminder, we don't exclude the Transformation costs from our adjusted financial measures, but we do detail the amounts in the bridging schedules in the supplemental. Rod will have more on the timing of expected Transformation related costs to 2016 in a few minutes. We continue to work toward closing of the Recall transaction and related integration planning. As outlined at our Investor Day, we have detailed workstreams for virtually every functional area of the combined companies, and I am pleased with what I am seeing in the way our teams are working together on integration planning to create a dynamic combined entity and facilitate a smooth transition. Obviously, this transaction is compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive accretion. As we work through the regulatory process, we will refine our views based upon a clear understanding of the outcome. We are constructively engaged with the four principal regulators and are working hard towards closing the transaction in a timely manner. As you know, it is necessary for us to close early in a given quarter in order to convert Recall's operations in certain countries into our REIT structure. We will provide updates with respect to the timetable when we have substantially completed the regulatory review process. But at this time, we cannot answer any questions about regulatory outcomes on today's call beyond what we have already said. In addition, we view real estate as a foundation to our strategy. During the year, we invested roughly $171 million in real estate. We remain keenly focused on our capital allocation opportunity and think about real estate investment in four major buckets. Our first priority is to invest in growth racking to accommodate net new volume growth we achieve annually. This investment yields average IRRs in the high teens. Our next priority is real estate consolidation, which may include both buildings and racking to improve real estate and operating efficiency and enhance utilization. This is characterized by mid-teens IRRs. Third, we plan to continue to invest in data center in a success-based manner driven by customer commitments. We continue to see good opportunity here with low double-digit IRRs and stabilized mid-teens return on invested capital. Fourth, we also look to complete select opportunistic lease buy-ins where we can acquire buildings at attractive valuations relative to market pricing or where it is strategically important to own. Rod will have more on how we view our real estate investment opportunities for the coming year. Now touching on some key financial and operating achievements before turning it over to Rod. On a constant dollar basis, we grew total revenue in 2015 by 2%, reflecting continued storage rental gains of 4%. This was driven primarily by storage rental internal growth of 2.7% for the year, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, Other International and Western Europe. As we look out into 2016, we are seeing consistent trends and maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. Service revenue growth for the year was negative 0.4%, and we delivered positive at 0.3% internal service growth revenue for the quarter. We made good progress on our service margin initiative, exiting the year at 27.2%, right in the middle of our range. There will be ups and downs as the mix shifts to more non-recurring projects and there will be a downtick in service margin early in the year, but we expect it to ramp up again throughout the year and to result in a similar average margin for the full year. Also as previously mentioned, in 2016 we will also focus on growing overall service gross profit as we move forward and our service mix evolves. Although some of our new offerings have lower margins than our core activity base services such as transportation and handling, they are also less capital intensive, so they have very similar returns. Storage volume growth is another important indicator in our business. During the year, we once again grew net worldwide storage volume by 8 million cubic feet or 2.3% net growth and 1.6% prior to acquisitions, and gross volume of records from new and existing customers was roughly 42 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months. Our customer retention remains strong at 98%, underscoring the stability of our customer base in supporting the durability of the storage revenue stream. This level has been stable over the past six quarters and represents an appropriate level in our business. Lastly, and most importantly, our cash generation is an important metric as it supports growth in dividends and investment. In recent presentations, we laid out our expectations for cash available to support the dividend, both on a standalone basis and including Recall. We expect to fund additional growth through debt in amounts that allow us to continue to delever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. On a standalone basis, the continued strong and durable cash of the base business, coupled with the Transformation program, will at a minimum allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018, whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. Even with an increased dividend in Q4, we improved our year-end 2015 payout as a percentage of our AFFO from 82% at Investor Day to 78% at year end. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall. Looking ahead, all of these drivers support our updated constant dollar guidance for 2016. On a like-for-like basis or comparing our 2016 constant dollar guidance with our 2015 results using 2016 FX budget rates, you can see our growth expectations are very consistent with what we showed at Investor Day. We expect 3% to 6% constant dollar growth in revenue, 6% to 8% growth in adjusted OIBDA and 6% to 13% growth in adjusted EPS. This growth is underpinned by nearly $1.5 billion of storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Bill. I'll begin today with an overview of our 2015 performance, including a review of results by segment and updates on our service gross margin initiative as well as our Transformation program. Finally, I will address our outlook for 2016, including a review of our capital allocation plans. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the full year, reported revenues were $3.01 billion, compared with $3.12 billion in 2014. Excluding the full year FX impact of 6% or $171 million year-over-year, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.1%. Consistent with the full-year picture, revenues for the fourth quarter also grew by 2.1% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill noted, we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity for most of 2015, so our revenues for the year had a very limited contribution from external growth. Total revenues were driven by good constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Service revenues were flat for the quarter and down 1% for the year. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue for the year was driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the U.K. and Australia in late 2014. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter and the full year. These schedules are on pages 22 through 26 of the Supplemental. Similar to last quarter, we have also provided a bridging schedule on page 27 to explain the sequential movement in our total service business gross margins. For our focused initiative we're continuing to align service costs with activity levels and revenue mix. Looking ahead, we expect modest reductions in our service gross profits during Q1, reflecting one-off severance costs and the timing of costs related to our growing mix of special projects. However, we expect service margins will recover to current levels throughout the year. Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $238 million, compared with $220 million in 2014. Despite FX headwinds, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 8% and excluding FX by 14%. For the full year adjusted OIBDA grew by 4.4% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill noted, our Transformation program continues in 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect to incur roughly $7 million of net charges related to this initiative. During Q2 and Q3, we expect the Transformation program to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA, with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. In Q4, we expect net upside of up to around $10 million, so providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits in 2017. As Bill noted, we continue to expect run rate savings of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for Transformation remains consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. Looking at the overall phasing of contribution for 2016, we expect this to ramp up during the year for two reasons. Firstly, as I just discussed, the costs associated with our Transformation program are front loaded, with offsetting net benefits coming later in the year. Secondly, our storage volumes and revenues will grow through the year as they typically do. As such, excluding any extraordinary events, we believe that Q1 adjusted OIBDA will represent roughly 21% to 23% total adjusted OIBDA, factored in 2016. Furthermore Q2 and Q3 will make up roughly 24% to 26% each and Q4 will represent roughly 26% to 28%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33, compared with $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $1.21, compared with $1.36 for 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by an 8% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 2014 following our REIT conversion, charges related to Transformation, and a high structural tax rate for the year. Including the increase in share count and restructuring costs in both periods as well as holding the tax rate constant, normalized adjusted EPS grew by $0.02 for the year. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out as 16.8%, compared with 14.4% in the prior year and 16.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase in our structural tax rate was primarily driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 17% in the short-term. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter compared with $0.52 in the year ago period, driven by improved performance. For the full year, FFO per share was $2.10 per share compared with $2.28 in 2014. The decline was driven by FX headwinds, the increase in share count as well as restructuring charges related to our Transformation program. Including share count increases, FX and restructuring charges in both periods, FFO per share grew by 3%. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $125 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $112 million in the year-ago period. For the full year, AFFO was $522 million compared with $527 million in 2014. If we adjust for FX in the items mentioned earlier that impacted FFO, except for share counts, then AFFO grew by 3% year-on-year. On page 21 of the Supplemental, we're now providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statements, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not of a typical recurring nature. Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was up 0.2% for the fourth quarter and 0.1% for the full year. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to the continued decrease in transportation, retrieve and re-file activity levels. In addition, we saw more of a precipitous decline in average price of recycled sorted office paper towards the end of the year, leading to a decline of over 19% quarter-over-quarter in average pricing. This impacted the paper revenue in our shred business and will have a follow-on impact into 2016. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remain solid at 41% for the quarter and 40% for the year, up from 39% in 2014. The year-over-year improvement in North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins is driven by the service gross margin actions and better operational performance. North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.0% for the fourth quarter and 4.2% for the year. The growth in DM storage rental internal growth for the quarter was lower than recent periods due to a strong comparator from Q4 last year. Looking forward, we expect DM internal storage growth to be in line with the growth in total company storage internal growth around 2.5%. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 8% in the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the year, as we continued to see declines in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the fourth quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong at 53.7%, compared to 51.6% in Q3. For the full year, DM adjusted OIBDA margins are 52.2%. We expect DM adjusted OIBDA margins will remain in the low to mid-50% range as we continue to invest in new service offerings. Margins on new services, although high at 35% to 40%, are lower than core storage margins of approximately 75%. The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 2.4% internal storage rental growth for the quarter and 2.7% for the year. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in nonrecurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remain solid in Western Europe at 33.1% for the quarter and 34.4% for the year. The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% for the quarter and 10.8% for the year. Service internal growth was 8.4% for the quarter and 9.0% for the year. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 23% for the quarter and 21% for the year. We expect to see adjusted OIBDA from this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in a low 20s% range in the short-term as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. To prepare for integration, in 2015, we incurred approximately $25 million of deal close costs and $22 million to prepare for integration, which brings total Recall related costs in 2015 to $47 million. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect $5 million to $8 million of deal close costs and $8 million to $12 million of integration related costs, bringing the total costs in Q1 to roughly $15 million to $20 million. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are one time in nature. Importantly, these costs were outlined in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal. Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 13 of the Supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent and operationally we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. Please note I'm referring to the corrected version of the Supplemental that was posted just prior to the call. Our guidance for 2016 growth on a constant dollar basis remains fairly consistent with the preliminary guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call. We made two changes. Firstly, we updated our outlook to reflect the new constant dollar budget foreign exchange rates which was set in January 2016. Note that at this point, that our 2016 constant dollar budget rate is now equivalent to an R (sic) [reported] dollar rate since it was just set last month. Secondly, we have reduced revenue and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $10 million at the midpoint as a result of the decline in the shred recycled paper prices that I noted earlier. Revenue from paper recycling is almost all margin, and so the vast majority flows through to adjusted OIBDA. To provide further clarity, I'd now like to share with you additional detail of how FX has impacted 2016 guidance and walk you through the components of our expected 2016 adjusted OIBDA growth on a constant dollar basis. The FX headwind was primarily driven by significant declines against U.S. dollar in the following five currencies : Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and the euro. These represent about 28% of our total revenue. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our total revenues are denominated in non-U.S. dollars. Assuming our 2016 FX rates remain constant throughout the year, our guidance reflects a 5% decline in revenues from FX. In our Investor Day, we had anticipated a decline of 3.5% based on rates at that time. Given continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, our outlook represents an additional decline by the end of the year of 1.5%. This total decline translate into roughly $165 million for the year on the top line. As we move down the P&L, FX headwinds continue to impact our guidance, albeit at a lower dollar amount. The FX headwinds impacting the top line translates into approximately $50 million on adjusted OIBDA for 2016. As you can see on page 12 of the Supplemental, we reported constant dollar 2015 adjusted OIBDA of $940 million at 2015 constant dollar budget rates set in January 2015. When our 2015 numbers are translated into 2016 budget rates, adjusted OIBDA would've been $900 million. However, we're also expecting an additional impact related to FX of roughly $10 million as a result of a change in our contribution mix. As we noted earlier, we are also expecting a $10 million constant dollar impact from paper price declines. On a more positive note, we can add a $50 million benefit from Transformation. Adding all that up, we get to adjusted OIBDA for 2016 based on January 2016 rates of roughly $930 million. Adding onto that our expectation of roughly 2% to 4% constant dollar growth will get you the $950 million to $970 million, which is our 2016 guidance range. Lastly, moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investments for 2016, we expect it to be roughly $495 million at the midpoint for 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds for our core gross racking investment. Let's turn to our capital deployment plans. We expect our capital expenditures, which include maintenance and non real estate investment to be in line with the ranges we provided at our Investor Day. Real estate investment spend is expected to be about $265 million, driven by growth racking spend of about $60 million, data center investment of $35 million. We also plan on investing $170 million in real estate consolidation and lease conversions. For M&A our plan is roughly $100 million in emerging markets and $50 million in the developed markets. Our dividend expectation also remains consistent with the guidance we laid out on our Investor Day. As you saw last week, we announced our first quarter dividend of $0.485 per share, which is consistent with the $1.94 per share run rate from Q4 last year when we increased the quarterly rate by $0.01 per share. In addition, the $1.94 per share is the minimum projected dividend for 2016 in a combined basis with Recall. Importantly, we ended the year with a dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO of 78%, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the year-end we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.6 times, as expected. Before concluding, I'd like to point out that we are updating our shelf registration statement with the SEC. You will likely see this filing next week. Please note that this update is part of our regular cycle. As we've said in the past, at this time we don't plan on issuing equity to fund investments outside the potential Recall acquisition. Overall, we've delivered good results for the year, supported by continued execution on our strategic plan, progress we've made in our Transformation initiative as well as the stabilization of our service gross margins. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to deliver on our short and long-term goals. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and cash available to fund dividends in core growth investments. And with that, I'll hand back to Bill to sum up. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, Rod. Before going over to questions, just to sum up, by utilizing the levers available to us in this highly durable and cash generative business, we've been able to deliver a good year, which is distinguished by first demonstrating growth in the business, both with and without acquisitions; additionally by generating cash, which allows us to grow dividend whilst at the same time establishing a debt-to-EBITDA glide path which delevers over time; and finally by investing in our core business whilst building adjacencies which support the business well into the future. With that, I'd like to open it up to questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Just to say it very clearly, the only change in the 2016 guidance relative to the last time we spoke was FX and paper prices, right? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. That's right. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay. I wanted to dive a little bit into tape services decline. I know this is not a new thing in terms of frequency of rotation. But the decline, this is North American tape, was larger this time. What's your anticipation in sort of getting to that bottom of that cycle in terms of frequency? And how do you think the service side of tape will do this year? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. No, I think it's pretty much the same as we said I think on the last call. I think it's bouncing between kind of the high-single-digit to low-double-digit declines in terms of what I would say our core service revenue associated with the transport of the tapes. And I think as we called out the last few quarters is that where we were on the paper record side of the business maybe two or three years ago, we're still watching that till it starts flattening out or we see the inflection point. And we don't see that inflection point right now, but at the same time we don't see it getting worse than what it is. I think what you'll see is, you'll see some bouncing around in terms of the net service revenue on the data management. I mean, quite frankly, I think we've done a pretty good job on building up some of these new service lines that in the tape management which includes the secured IT asset destruction business, for instance, and also the restoration assurance business, just to call out two. So on the transportation side, again, which is our highest margin in that type of business, we don't see a slowdown in that decline, but we don't see an acceleration either. But I think what we're -we're making some good progress in some of these new services which generally have lower margins than transport, but at the same time they have much less invested capital associated with it, so we're getting similar returns. So when those \u2013 I wouldn't expect this year that these new services are going to overtake the decline that we're seeing in the transportation, but we're making good progress. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Right. And then if you don't mind, I'm just going to ask about Western Europe. Service has really popped up in the quarter. Is there something there that really is unusual for the quarter? And how do you feel like we're entering the year on service side of Western Europe? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think it's a good call-out, Andrew. I think one of the things you probably caught in my remarks and a little bit in Rod's is that as we're shifting from the core transportation services that are associated with the ins and outs in our storage business to some of the new service areas, a lot of these new service areas are project based, which is also the reason why we said we expect kind of a downtick in Q1 in some of our service revenue as those projects have a lead time in terms of the sell and onboarding those cycles. And then they come through it in the next quarter or quarters and that's what you've seen actually in Western Europe. What you will have seen is there was an investment earlier in the year, and then that project revenue kind of flows through. So that's part of the new services. It's less smooth than say the transportation side of the business, so you have these ups and downs. So what we tend to do is we look at it over the course of the year and it just so happened that in Western Europe, you saw that spike as part of that normal cyclicality of these projects. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: All right. And if you'll let me sneak just one last in, so when you think about service side total for 2016, do you feel like it's going to solidify it more like we saw in the fourth quarter? Would that be the right word, solidifying services revenue? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think what we said is that we expect looking at the pipeline that we will have a similar margin by the end of the year as we achieved in 2015. So that's correct. And what you'll see is that we were, in Q4, we had positive service revenue growth overall in the year, slightly negative. So what we expect is service revenue to be basically flat and the margin to be in line, maybe slightly ahead, but it's going to be basically in line with what we achieved at the end of 2015. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think that's right. It might move around a little bit by a quarter, but I think that's actually right, Bill, for the full year. It's a good summary. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Morning. I'd like to go a little bit into the services business as well. Can you elaborate on the timing of internal initiatives that you think can drive upside or improvement in services' internal growth in 2016 versus 2015? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, so good morning, George. So I think there's kind of a couple aspects. There's some that \u2013 there's a number of things that you're touching upon or referring to that Patrick Keddy went through on Investor Day, things that we're doing just to get more margin out of some of our existing core service areas which have seen a drop in activity, so that's really around the transportation side. And I think we feel pretty good where that's coming out. I think you'll continue to see some improvement during the course of the year, but a lot of that is in flight. I think the bigger part of it is how we bring on some of the new service areas which are less smooth, but on a year basis these are project-driven. So you can think of it as like a defense contractor : there's a certain amount of prospecting and then there's a certain amount of reaping or harvesting. So you'll see on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you'll see some movement around that, but we have good visibility over the course of the year to be able to predict where the year will end up. So I think what you can expect as we go through the course of the year is we think that we will have similar slight uptick in terms of where we came in for the year in 2015, so slight improvement, but kind of in the same postal code for 2016 in service. But you will see as we shift away from the volume coming from almost exclusively the transportation side of the business to some of these new services that are more project based, you will see more ups and downs on a quarter-by-quarter basis just like Andrew called out for the uptick in Western Europe in Q4. And we're saying that Q1 you'll see a downtick in some of those services, but we have very good visibility over the course of the year where we'll come out. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it. Thanks. And looking at C$ revenue growth for the quarter and year, it came in a little bit below target because of lower M&A activity given your focus on Recall. You talked a little bit about your expected M&A activity in the first quarter. But with Recall still in progress, can you update us on how you're approaching your tuck-in M&A strategy for the full year? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So there's kind of two dimensions to that, right, George. So one is now that we've gone through quite a bit of the integration process, not on the commercial side, but we kind of know the people and the overall volumes that we're getting in different geographies, we have a pretty high confidence level of where it makes sense for us to continue to bolster our presence internationally. So that's kind of one dimension. So you saw for instance our acquisition the last quarter of last year in India. And there's a couple more in flight that are in, as we called out, in the emerging markets, right. The other aspect of that, of course, is you won't see us doing any M&A activity in the four regulatory jurisdictions that we're working with right now to close the Recall transaction because we don't want any delay in those discussions with the regulators, right. Because if you start doing acquisitions at the same time you're having discussions, it's just going to delay it. So we have pretty good visibility now where it makes sense. And that's why we've restarted the engine. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think that's right, Bill. I think, George that was in the nature of deals, particularly internationally, it can be a bit lumpy in terms of when they land. It was relatively quiet last year as you rightly pointed out. But I can see a reasonable amount of activity in Q1 actually with some, well I think, pretty exciting deals. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Did we lose you, Kevin? Operator : Kevin, your line is open. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we got you, Kevin. Yep. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I apologize. Sorry about that, I was on mute. Apologize. Hey, so in terms of any updated timing on Recall? Do you still see it as Q2 type event? Or does that get pushed out a little bit based on \u2013 just any updates on that if you can to the extent you can provide further clarity on discussions with the regulators before? Just any thoughts around that? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kevin, I think you were covering us during the PLR, no? Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I think you probably know how I'm going to answer this one. As I said in my notes, it's not much that I can say beyond \u2013 or anything I can say beyond in my remarks. So I think you could probably appreciate that... Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Sure. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But we remain excited about the deal. As I said on my prepared remarks is that we're engaged constructively with the four key regulators, and we're working hard to drive this to a close. But I can't \u2013 I think you could probably appreciate I can't say much more. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I figured I'd try, Bill. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I knew someone was going to try; I just didn't know who it was. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Would you give updates based on country? Or would it be when it's all done? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, right now I think all four are \u2013 we're engaged in all four, so I think our expectation is it'll probably be coming together pretty much at the same time. I mean, I wouldn't rule out a country-by-country update, but I think right now my expectation is it's going to be fairly closely aligned. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: That's helpful. And then just \u2013 it looks like you tightened up the range a little bit on the on the internal growth for 2016. You took the low end up 50 bps, the high end down 50 bps, am I reading that right in terms of the notes? And then if that is right, what drove king of the tightening of that range? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Rod, do you want to... Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't think we've mentioned change in internal growth. This may be in total growth. And so the internal \u2013 it's only if we start with internal storage growth, we've always been sort of in the 2.5% to 3% range and, obviously, that's the key metric for us. On the total revenue outlook, you're right. I think we've sort of pulled it in slightly as a result of just having a better understanding of how things might pan out. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Awesome. And then are you at the point now where the sorted office \u2013 is the pricing still decremental? Or is it a point where it's stabilized, the sorted office paper? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It looks like it could've stabilized, but we've seen that before. So effectively what we've done in terms of our projection, we've taken the paper price out of that January. It could continue to move up or down, and we'll obviously keep updating on that, but where we did see the drop was really in the last couple of months of last year. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Awesome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. Could you just give us a little bit of color as to some of the service projects, the nature of those projects that are causing things to kind of go up and down, become a little bit more lumpy? Just a practical on the ground, what exactly are you guys doing? And then afterwards, can you just give us an update on the EMC partnership announcement last April and how that's moving? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Morning, Shlomo. I'll just give you kind of a couple examples that give you an idea. Some of them are large scanning projects, so there's some that are in flight with government contracts for instance, and they have a certain \u2013 that's why I kind of alluded to kind of like defense contracts, those things have a kind of a tilling, fertilizing, seeding process and then a harvesting side. And those are typically very large scanning projects that are associated with storage. So we're not going in to compete with an ACS or a Xerox per se. I mean, they may be competing, but we're going after contracts where we think we really have a strong skill set that's associated with just not the scanning, but also the classification of the records and in many if not most cases the actual storing of those records. But those are long lead time projects that come through at different times and hence you see the kind of spike that we saw in Western Europe when those things come through. Others are, again, what I would call kind of BPM-type projects that are associated with storage. So right now we have in sight a large project which is associated with mortgage servicing or helping mortgage originator to process and manage a lot of their documentation and processes associated with mortgages. Again, there's a big upfront piece and we have the relationship with that customer because we do, if not all, most of their storage. So those are kind of two different projects. One which I would typically call BPM, and the other one I would call scanning, but we come at it, and we've been asked to come in and provide these services because of our expertise around records management and record storage. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And the EMC... William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. On the EMC, so the EMC we're still very excited. We're making good steady progress, and the great thing about it is there's still a high level of engagement, even though you can probably imagine that EMC is going through their own changes right now with the Dell acquisition. But even with all that and through that process both pre and post announcement, we've had a high level of engagement and both teams are working well. I mean, it's starting on a small base, but we're very excited about that combination because to us this is kind of like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, right. It's putting \u2013 I don't know if you could say who has the peanut butter and who has the chocolate, but putting those two things together and combining it with our raised floor platform using the data center is just a \u2013 it's a really unique platform that we could offer to our customers, which it's very difficult for any competitors to do because we're allowing customers to remove both the OpEx and CapEx associated with their tape drives in their premises and using EMC's market-leading technology or data domain technology. We can replicate their data center on our raised floor using our data center technology, and then deliver tapes off the back of that and store it in our vault, which is a perfect cyber-security play because I think what people have learned is that you're not secure around cyber-security unless you unplug it completely from any network, so that's where tape comes in. But at the same time, people can get rid of a lot of the OpEx and CapEx costs associated with cutting the tapes themselves, and you reduce the need to transport these things over the road, and many cases these tapes aren't encrypted. So that adds a much more secure environment. And then the other service of course we apply to that is we tell the customer, independent of any change in generational tape drives, we give them guaranteed assurance that we will restore that data whenever they need it in whatever format they need. So if you kind of look at some of the things that are in the core DNA of Iron Mountain, together with our growing data center business, and the core DNA of EMC, it is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Are there any marquee clients yet that you guys are willing to name or you're allowed to name or that you obtained, but you can't name? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, at this point you could imagine because this really goes to the IT security of most of our customers, none of them \u2013 I mean, we keep working on that, and when we can we'll highlight them. I think I should highlight, it's still a relatively small portion of our revenue. But we're really excited about these types of programs because it really resonates with our customers. But I think you can imagine most of our customers are pretty secretive about the way that they manage their IT assets or IT information. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. For Rod, given the movements in currency and everything, are you able to maybe just give us a little guidance on the certain base rate percentage move in each of the currency that you highlighted, what that impact would be to both revenue and OIBDA up and down? So strengthening a certain \u2013 1% against the dollar impacts revenue by X and impacts OIBDA by X, just so that from a technical modeling perspective we can get that rate? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and probably the easiest thing to do, if you take it as 40% of our revenue as outside of the U.S. and so therefore if you kind of take a 1% delta on the dollar against the basket of currencies, that would impact our revenue by 0.4%. And then you can flow that down to OIBDA. I think the way to think about that is if the FX movement is against markets where our businesses are more mature, so I could say for example, Canada and the UK, there obviously we earn higher margins. And so it has a sort of disproportionate effect on OIBDA. If the FX movement is against some of our businesses in emerging markets, it tends to be more dampened at the OIBDA level because obviously they're at earlier stages, and so the contribution margin percent is lower. Don't know if that helps. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I mean, percentage of revenue helps more than that, but as much as you can give us, we'll take. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think that's probably what I can give you. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ellman, with Mayo Capital Partners. Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could just offer me a bit of clarification about the guidance summary on page 13 of the document. I'm not sure that I understood all of Rod's remarks. Do I understand that your guidance for adjusted OIBDA for 2016 is the $950 million to $970 million range that I see in the second column from the right? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Yeah, that's exactly right. So page 13, it's the second last column on the right is our 2016 guidance based at January 2016 FX rates. So... Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : January 2016 FX rates? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, exactly. So that's... Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : Okay. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...our best view of guidance as we sit here... Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : All right. So just sort of taking the midpoint of that range, that would be $960 million, and then you present your estimated capital allocation at $555 million to $595 million? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : Okay. And your dividend obligation is currently about $412 million at the $1.94 rate? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : Okay. So the dividend obligation, plus the midpoint of the capital allocation guidance would be $987 million? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : Okay. And so in your guidance for adjusted OIBDA you've obviously excluded the anticipated going forward expenses for the Recall consolidation which you've estimated at $15 million to $20 million? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : And so are there any other foreseeable expenses that, being one-time in nature, you're also excluding from your estimate of adjusted OIBDA? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. No. So we have restructuring costs, but they're actually included within adjusted OIBDA, but they have a phasing impact as I referred to earlier. Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : Okay. All right, I guess that would be it. Could you possibly clarify in your capital allocation estimate of business and customer acquisitions of $140 million to $180 million, how much is acquisitions of business and how much is the money that you invest when you establish a new contract with customers? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's really our M&A spend, so that's \u2013 we refer to business customer acquisitions, but it's really the M&A spend. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think the way you should think about it is that \u2013 I think I understand where you're kind of going with it, is that if you're trying to bring it down to cash available for distribution and investment, is that... Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : That would be fair. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Okay. So that's what I figured you were trying to get to. So if you look at 2016 and you take the midpoint of the guidance, you should get to $495 million, and then you had $412 million for the dividend, I mean, it's $411 million, $412 million. So you subtract that out and then there's about $65 million for growth racking, but that is actually for growth. So actually if you think about it, it's the $495 million less the $411 million and then that gives you a number that's available for growth basically, for investment and growth. And so the first call in that cash available is $65 million, which is for the organic growth that we get from our customers every year. So even if you take out, and that's for 2017 revenue if you know what I mean, right, because you're putting the racking investment in 2016, so that when the growth hits you in 2017 you can actually put those boxes on the shelf. So then even after you take the growth racking which gives you the mid-2% range that we highlighted in terms of internal growth, in terms of our storage business that leaves you about $19 million for cash available for discretionary investment. Now, that's versus 2015 actuals of about $3 million left over after you paid for racking. So we've actually \u2013 even with the further FX headwinds coming into the 2016 based on January rates, you see the improvement from $3 million to $19 million, but again, that's also already including $65 million for growth, so that 2.5% organic storage volume growth that's coming in. Now when you come down and you're trying to \u2013 to your point about M&A is \u2013 so you say : well, how are we able to delever and still be able to do M&A? Because of course when we're doing the M&A we're buying EBITDA as well associated with that. So we're \u2013 so that's how the whole thing works. So we are issuing debt to do the M&A because obviously $19 million doesn't fuel our whole M&A program. But between the $19 million that we have for beyond internal growth of storage, we also borrow, but on a net-net basis in terms of what it does is debt-to-EBITDA you see a deleveraging as well. So that... Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : Is there a debt-to-EBITDA target that you have, say, for the end of 2016? I think you said you were at 5.6 times currently? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : 5.6 I think, and we aim to hold it around that level, it would be 5.5 times to 5.6 times by the end of the year. And over the next three years it will come down to 5.2, excluding the Recall deal. If we did the Recall deal, actually allows us to delever faster than that. Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : Okay. Very good. Thank you very much. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the only thing I would do is just one last thing, Michael, is if you go to our Investor Day deck it lays it out quite well because it shows you what happens to \u2013 we do it both on a standalone and with Recall, but it shows you how we grow dividends during that period of time, how we grow the M&A and how we delever during the period of time. And you'll see the cash available or the CAD in the appendix of that deck. Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC : Okay, thank you. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Do we have any closing remarks? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I think that's it, operator. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain First Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. These go ahead. Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Dushyanta, and welcome everyone to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our President and CEO, who will discuss highlights of the quarter and progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial results. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. And as we have done in the past, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com, under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's supplemental, our earnings commentaries, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in our supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. And thanks to all of the investors, analysts on today's call for your continued support during the process of finalizing our acquisition of Recall. In fact, it was one year ago today that we announced the agreement in principle between our two firms. As you saw last week, we have now satisfied all conditions for closing and will do some next Monday, Australian Time. I cannot say enough good things about the dedication and focus required and demonstrated by our teams on both sides to get this transaction over the goal line. And I should add, it is this dedication of our teams that has set us up to hit the ground running with integration. I wish to thank my fellow team members for continued focus on the core business by delivering another strong quarter across all metrics, but most importantly, our earnings and cash flow results. What does this acquisition mean for Iron Mountain? From a commercial perspective, it enhances our global footprint, both strengthening our existing country presence as well as expanding our reach from 41 countries to 45, and strengthens our ability to reach both global organizations in mid-market businesses looking to benefit from our industry-leading expertise and solutions appropriate to their scale. The combined strength of our companies expands our ability to meet customers' information, management, and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing security threats, and seek to turn information into business value. You may remember a video we featured at our Investor Day last fall with customer stories about the trust they place in us. Today, the stakes have never been higher for organizations of all sizes to ensure their most critical assets are protected and accessible. They see us as their partner protecting what matters whilst also providing expertise, products, and services designed to get the most out of those assets. That trust is a cornerstone of our business. A big part of this trust is based not only on our dedication to high-quality service, but it is also derived from confidence our customers have in us to leverage our scale to the kind of innovation that allows us to serve them long into the future. The industrial logic of this deal is undisputable. And from a financial perspective, it enhances our 2020 strategic plan, delivering cash benefits that drive accretion, both on an FFO and an AFFO basis. This in turn supports attractive long-term durable dividend growth averaging 10% per year through 2018 as the synergies and benefits from transformation begin to flow through in approximately 4% growth per year annually thereafter through 2020. I won't go into the detail of synergies and accretion here, as I believe we've covered that thoroughly in the call we hosted on April 1 to announce the conclusion of regulatory reviews in the U.S., Canada and Australia. But I do wish to reiterate that the benefits of the transaction are compelling consistent with our strategy and importantly, consistent with our expectations in terms of the financial contribution. Now that closing is imminent, the challenging work of integration can begin. We have been refining and advancing integration plans across all functional areas of the combined companies, and it is encouraging to see how well the teams have come together to support the closing and prepare for a smooth combination. We look forward to welcoming Recall's customers, employees and shareholders. Turning to Iron Mountain's standalone results, first quarter financial and operating results were strong. Our financial results continue to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business. Total revenue growth in constant dollar of roughly 4% was in line with our longer term expectations, driven by constant dollar growth of 4% in both storage and service. Adjusted OIBDA constant dollar growth was about 7%, excluding charges associated with our transformation program and service initiative (sic) [transformation program]. We see consistent trends in constant dollar storage revenue growth for the remainder of the year, while constant dollar service revenue growth will continue to be a bit lumpy. Even with this lumpiness, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue, as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. Our results in the first quarter reflect the service revenue mix shift we discussed in recent calls with declines in transportation and handling related services, largely offset by growth in shredding, project revenue and DMS, which for Iron Mountain, refers to our imaging or scanning businesses. We are also beginning to gain some traction with new data management service offerings such as our secure IT asset destruction offering and our data domain venture with EMC. You may have also seen that yesterday we announced a new Iron Mountain cloud archive, offering a cost-effective, near-infinitely scalable repository for organizations needing to protect and preserve data for compliance, legal or value creation purposes. We'll be debuting this new solution at EMC World conference next week. As our mix shift continues, we will focus more on enhancing gross profit rather than gross margins as these new service offerings are often lower margin, but still generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. Turning to internal storage revenue, growth of 2.2% for the quarter was in line with the fourth quarter of last year and is compared with a particularly strong quarter in 2015. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be north of 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth or net of acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarters' performance at 1.6% worldwide growth. Total gross volume of records from new and existing customers was roughly 30.5 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months also very consistent with what we've seen over the past few years. Turning to progress on our strategic plan. During the quarter, we continue to advance each of the three pillars of the plan as well as in the foundational elements that support it. Let me briefly highlight progress in each of the three pillars, namely getting the most out of our developed markets, expanding our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expansion and faster growing adjacent businesses. In developed markets, we achieved consistent performance from North America RIM with positive internal storage and volume growth, while North American data management and our Western Europe segment both generated internal volume growth of roughly 3% and total internal revenue growth of about 2%. In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall's footprint in Southeast Asia will support that objective, but prior to the combination, we already have driven our emerging market business to 15% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q1. During the quarter, we continue to achieve total internal revenue growth in these markets of 10% with internal volume growth of 7%. Additionally, as our visibility on closing of the Recall transaction became clearer, we resumed acquisition activity moving into two new emerging markets during the quarter. We acquired a 75% interest in the largest privately owned and the number two overall records management company in South Africa, a company with more than 2 million cubic feet of storage and a range of offerings similar to ours. We also acquired a Lithuanian-based document storage and archiving firm during the quarter, expanding our presence into three new countries in the Baltics with the acquisition of this market leader. With these acquisitions, we expand our global reach and now operate in 41 countries on six continents. But it's not about putting pins in the map. It's about leveraging our global footprint and capturing the first wave of records management outsourcing occurring in these faster growing markets. As we noted last quarter, we did see the carryover of the large single customer destruction in our other international segment, which drove destructions up to 4.2% in this segment in line with what we saw last quarter. Again, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that the remainder of the year will return to more typical levels of less than 4%. We do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis, and therefore this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. You can now see a full quarter's contribution from Crozier Fine Arts acquired last December, which is performing in line with our expectations. Additionally, you may have noted our plans to expand our data center business into Northern Virginia, North America's largest data center market. Northern Virginia is also home to the Federal Government data centers and large cloud data centers owned by the major data center REITs. During Q2, we plan to resell this land to an industrial developer who will undertake land development and shell construction whilst we focus on expanding our data center product offering in this highly desirable location. We are early in the planning for this multiyear, multiphase project. Whilst we are not yet sharing specific projections, we wanted to share our plans to provide some insight into one of the ways in which we are able to strategically fund our growth opportunities. The result is that whilst we will achieve slightly lower margins through this approach to funding, the impact on our balance sheet has improved and our stabilized ROIC is similar to that of data centers we owned outright. To sum up, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020 with internal growth rates in the 10% plus range, which is up from a little over 17% (sic)[70%]of our business mix today. I should also add we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative. Actions in 2015 resulted in run rate savings of $50 million, which is visible in a 120-basis point improvement in year-over-year OIBDA margins this quarter after adjusting for transformation. We have undertaken additional actions in the first quarter that support the additional $50 million of savings we expect to achieve by year-end 2016. We incurred told charges of $5.7 million in the quarter related to these actions and were able to pull forward a bit of the run rate savings that contributed to our strong performance this quarter. Also as previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. The all-important cash flow result for both today and growth into the future is in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and again on our April 1 call and continues to provide the foundation for our expected dividend growth. We also updated the high-level goals associated with our 2020 plan. What we've communicated is that we continue to expect to achieve similar top line and adjusted OIBDA compound annual growth. We also expect to generate similar levels of cash available to grow the dividend by an average of about 10% per year through 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, fund organic growth racking investment and increase the amount of remaining cash available to support discretionary investment. And we will do so whilst both reducing our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO and deleveraging. We expect to fund additional growth through debt financing in amounts that allow us to continue to delever the business on a debt to EBITDA basis. Our expectations are underpinned by the continued demonstration of a very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. In addition, we are extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed markets, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses and continue to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates more than $1.5 billion of annual storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks Bill. I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including an update on our transformation initiative and a review of results by segment. Then I'll provide color on the Recall transaction and progress we have made so far in preparing for integration, as well as discuss our plans for funding the transaction. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the first quarter, reported revenues were $751 million compared with $749 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year FX impact of approximately 3.6% or $26 million. On a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 3.8%. Total revenues were driven by strong constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of approximately 3.9%. Service revenues also performed well in the quarter up by 3.7%.This was primarily the result of project revenue in North American records and information management and growth in shred revenues driven by new customer wins. This service revenue growth reflects the mix shift in our business were service revenues are more heavily weighted towards projects which can result in more volatility in year-over-year growth rates. During the quarter we saw a reduction in service gross profits and service gross margin. This decline was driven by an increase in medical expenses and severance costs related to our service gross margin initiative. Excluding these costs, service gross margins would've been flat on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with prior quarters we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share which explain key variances in year-over-year per performances for the quarter. This quarter, we've also added a similar bridge for FFO per share. This schedules on page 20 through 23 of the supplemental. Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $235 million compared with $231 million in 2015. Despite FX headwinds early in the year, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.7% and by 4.5% on a constant dollar basis. And growth was 7% if we exclude the $5.7 million of transformation initiative charges we took in the quarter. As evidenced by improvement to total adjusted OIBDA margins, we continued to execute on our transformation initiative. As just stated, during this quarter, we incurred roughly $6 million of net charges related to this initiative. During Q2 and Q3 prior to any adjustments from Recall, we continue to expect the transformation initiative to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. In Q4 we expect a net upside of roughly $7 million providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits in 2017. We continue to expect exit rate savings from actions taken in 2016 of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out in our Investor Day in October with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 compared with $0.32 in 2015. Excluding the cost of our transformation, and after normalizing for the tax rate benefits adjusted EPS would've grown by roughly 9%. Our adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS result for the quarter came in ahead of the phasing expectations we laid out on the February's conference call. This over performance in the first quarter was driven by pulling forward portion of transformation benefits as well as lower overall G&A expenses as we delayed certain costs and hires in anticipation of the recall transaction. In addition adjusted EPS benefited from a lower tax rate. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came up to be 14.0% compared with 16.2% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in our structural tax rate was primarily driven by earnings mix skewed more towards our qualified nontaxable entities. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be roughly 20% once Recall closes due to their exposure and international markets. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter compared to $0.50 in the year ago period. Excluding the cost associated with the transformation FFO per share would have grown by roughly 8%. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $142 million compared with $128 million in the year ago period. AFFO is at the high end of expectations due to the timing of maintenance capital expenses and non-real estate investments which are typically incurred towards the second half of the year. Similar to the prior quarter, on page 19 of the supplemental providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not of the typical recurring nature. Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 0.2% for the first quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue increased by 3.8% due to an increase in project revenue and new customer wins in the shred business is noted earlier. North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins decline year-over-year, primarily due to increased medical costs and severance charges related to our service margin initiative. North American data management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.8% for the first quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 6.9% as we continued to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. The high single-digit decline in transportation and handling service was partially offset by mid single-digit growth in the new data management service offerings and other DM project related revenue. DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to an increase \u2013 due to decrease in overhead costs, primarily associated with lower G&A expense. The Western European segment generated solid results with 2.1% internal storage rental growth. Internal service revenue growth declined in this segment, primarily as a result of activity declines in retrieve and re-file and transportation and a relatively weak quarter for projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved in Western Europe as a result of a decrease in overhead expense specifically compensation expense. In addition, Western Europe benefited from one-off real estate tax benefit of roughly $3 million. The other international segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets in Australia showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% and service internal growth 11.3% for the quarter. Other international adjusted OIBDA margins were 21% for the quarter in line with expectations. We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA in this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the low 20% range in the short-term as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Let me now talk about the Recall acquisition and provide details on the cost that we've incurred so far in 2016. We're working diligently on integration planning, as well as preparing to convert portions of Recall's business to our REIT structure. As a result of all this hard work, we're well-positioned to achieve our synergies quicker in 2016 than we originally anticipated when we announced the deal back in June of 2015. Our expectations of cost to achieve the deal are still consistent with prior projections. In the first quarter, we incurred $7 million of deal close costs and $11 million of integration related costs, bringing the total of Recall costs in Q1 to roughly $18 million in operating expenses. Please note these expenses are excluded from adjusted OIBDA calculations because they are one-time in nature. Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent. We remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. As we noted, our 2016 guidance reflects a partial year benefit from Recall as well as the net synergies we're expecting in 2016. Please note this is a preliminary view of the combined group and assumes that all divestitures are effective from May 1st. We'll continue to refine our estimates and provide updates as necessary once the transaction is closed. Another point about the guidance as you might expect given that we're combining our higher margin business with Recall's slightly lower more margin business, in the near-term adjusted OIBDA margins will be slightly lower than our standalone margins until we realize synergies. Lastly, I'd like to note that we're starting to see improvement in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which may potentially add some favorability to our 2016 guidance. The top currencies that improved since beginning of the year are the Canadian dollar \u2013 euro; Brazilian real and Australian Dollar, partially offset by the declines in the British pound. We're continuing to watch these trends closely and will update our guidance one warranted. Moving to our expected cash available for distribution and investments for 2016, we continue to estimate that it will be roughly $600 million for 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds our core growth racking investments. Our capital deployment plans remain unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real estate maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the figures we provided on April 1st We expect to spend $17 million in core growth racking and approximate $35 million in the data center business. For M&A, our plan continues to be a roughly $100 million spend in emerging markets and $50 million in developed markets. We also plan on investing where value creation is compelling in real estate development and consolidation and lease conversions. Dividend expectations remain consistent with the guidance we laid out on at Investor Day. Dividend per share is expected to grow in the double digits on average in 2017 and 2018 as we realize the benefits of transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share at roughly 4% per year. Importantly the dividend payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO is expected to be approximately 78% in 2016 and 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at year end we had liquidity of approximately $650 million and our lease adjusted debt ratio is 5.7 times as expected. We announced last week that we entered into a commitment letter with lenders to provide an unsecured bridge facility of up to $850 million to provide a portion of the financing for the Recall transaction. We expect to enter into a definitive formal documentation for the bridge and follow \u2013 borrow the full amount on April 29. As previously said, we anticipate refinancing the bridge and replenishing capacity on the revolver with long-term debt as soon as practical. Overall, we're pleased with the strong performance we saw in the first quarter. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our 2020 vision. We're excited to begin the integration of Recall in the second quarter and begin to realize meaningful synergies associated with the deal. Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term goals. We remain focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth in our cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Bill. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Rod. And before I turn the call back to the operator for questions, let me quickly sum up what you've heard today so far. First, this was a very good quarter, and we are headed into the Recall integration from a strong position. Our core storage business performed well and remains extremely durable, a characteristic that has been demonstrated both in good economic conditions as well as through downturns. And if you recall, last year, we finished the year with a 1.5% internal revenue growth rate, i.e., before acquisition, and our Q1 results showed a 2% internal revenue growth rate, which also compares favorably to the Q1 of last year of 1.4%. So \u2013 it was a good quarter also in terms of revenue growth. Second, we're feeling good about the Recall transaction. Our progress on integration and our ability to derive benefits from scale which supports additional growth in cash flow. And finally our high-margin business coupled with our focus on continuous cost control continues to give us high confidence in our ability to deploy that incremental cash flow into growth investment, deleveraging and near-term double-digit growth in our dividend per share. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the North American tape business, services internal revenue declines remain elevated which suggests that we're still early in the cycle in terms of the tape rotation revenue decline process. When do you expect the decline in services there to normalize? And could you provide a status report on some of the newer services initiatives you have that can help offset the headwinds? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Hi, George. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So, we still don't see much of an abating of that trend. So we're not predicting the bottom \u2013 I mean it's \u2013 as I think I've said a few times, it's on the records management side, we have seen a flattening out, but on the tape, it's a little bit behind the curve. What's encouraging is that we see high single-digit, low double-digit quarter declines in the \u2013 what I would call the transportation or rotating the tapes, as you say, part of the service business, but we see mid-single-digit growth in those new services, which is what allows us to offset the rate of decline. So, we do see \u2013 albeit off a small base \u2013 but we do see significant impact in terms of growth to some of these new service offerings like the service offering I highlighted on the call with EMC. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Got it. And then looking ahead to the company pro forma for Recall, can you discuss what your expectations are for Recall's fundamental performance? What assumptions are embedded in your guidance with Recall? And if your due diligence findings confirm Recall's existing guidance? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Rod answer that in the more detailed aspect of the questions, but I think I'll just touch upon your last \u2013 the last part of your question in terms of what we found through the integration planning with Recall. And I think what we \u2013 the main difference \u2013 I think we talked about that on the April 1 call is we found that we've \u2013 what I would call more capital efficiency. So two areas specifically is we found in terms of maintenance CapEx. We feel very comfortable that Recall's maintenance CapEx will be in line with what we spend on our facilities, i.e., around 2.6% of revenue, whereas before we thought we were going to have to spend more because they had done a number of acquisitions. So we feel comfortable based on integration planning that it's kind of a like-for-like integration in terms of level of maintenance CapEx. The other area which we feel very comfortable now which was an unknown for us is we had a significant uptick or original budgeting for IT systems because again we didn't know if our platforms would be big enough to scale efficiently to absorb all of the Recall operations. And again, we feel very comfortable. So you'll see that we still have significant investment to absorb the Recall operations onto our IT platforms, but much more in line that we're taking on a company that's a quarter of our size rather than one that we would have to rebuild or relaunch major IT systems. So those are then the two areas which I would say are positive surprises that we've had on the integration side, but, Rod, you may want to comment a little bit more in terms of the guidance. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, in terms of the assumptions we've made for Recall performance for the remainder of this year is essentially is consistent with the performance that we've seen over recent periods. So we've just trended that forward. So it's a modest underlying growth within the business of around 2%, and there's acquisition benefit on top of that. And margins being broadly and consistent so we've not assumed any inflection point up or down in terms of performance, just a continuation of the trend. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. I'd like to spend more time on the service internal growth of 3.8%. I did catch that you said it is more project oriented but this is kind of a massive standout, if you kind of look over the last four quarters versus 3.8% growth. Could you just give us a sense of \u2013 do you feel like there was anything that was particularly one time or are these projects you know that should come up regularly and do you think that service revenues will grow for the year within North American RIM? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So \u2013 its a good question, Andrew. So good morning. The \u2013 so, first of all, I would say that they are specific projects, but not necessarily one-time in nature. In other words, what I'm saying is we expect to continue to have these kinds of projects that we sell as we go through, but they're not \u2013 these are \u2013 it could be a project for company X today and company Y tomorrow. So these are discrete projects but not ones that we don't expect to have a recurring pattern. That being said, which I said both in my remarks, I think Rod also mentioned in his remarks, that these tend to be more lumpy. So I wouldn't change our guidance in terms of overall growth in terms of revenue, because you will see some ups and downs on that. So I would keep the guidance the same, and that's our expectation. But it is an area \u2013 you're right to call it out. It is an area that we're putting more and more discrete focus on as an initiative because we're hearing from our customers, they are looking for more and more those kinds of, what I would call, project related services as we kind of take their \u2013 a full management of their document from creation to storage approach. So just by the very nature, it is more project related. We have focused more of our attention in providing those kinds of services for our customers, so you can expect continued growth in that area, but it will be lumpy. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But do you think it will be positive for the year? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It will be positive. Yeah. For sure it will be positive for the year. Yeah. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, this is Adam Parrington for Shlomo. Sorry, I apologize if I missed this, but could you go over the items that caused services or the margin to be lower year-on-year? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I think probably it's best for Rod to take you through a bridge. Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, let me do that. So if we look at the same periods last year, our service gross margin was 26.1% and this quarter we came in at 24.3%. There's really two key factors that's driving the difference. One is we had an increase in medical costs year-over-year that accounts for 1.0% of that differential. And the second is we took some severance costs in a number of our services businesses as part of a sort of ongoing program to drive longer-term improvements in margin. And that has an impact of 0.6%. There's a small other component which has to do with some vacation accruals. If you're to factor those in, we'd actually would have had a service gross margin of 26.2% and say that would compared to 26.1% from last year. So that's the drivers of difference. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the one thing I would add, so \u2013 and you would expect our margins to be kind of similar year-on-year because the mix hasn't shifted that much. But what we've said, I think, on the last couple of calls, what you will see over time is not that we're not focused on margins, but we're less focused on the specific margin number because we're looking at return on invested capital as the mix of services change, because as I was talking \u2013 answering the question earlier about what's happening with transportation, for instance, in our data management or our tape business, the transportation typically is very high margin business. So as we supplant some of that revenue loss with new service initiatives, many of those have a lower margin, but they also have lower capital associated with them so similar returns. So \u2013 but I think the bridge year-on-year, you're not going to see a massive change in mix over time. So I think the bridge is important one on a short period of time to see what's really happening. Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Got it. And there's a decline in maintenance CapEx due to the timing of the Recall acquisition or some other item? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Again, I also referred to that in the prepared remarks. It is a timing issue. We typically spend more of our maintenance CapEx in the back half of the year than in the first half. And so, it's just a similar trend that we're seeing this year. We'll obviously \u2013 well, to your point, it is one of the items we will be evaluating as well as sort of post-close of Recall, but at the moment, our guidance on that for the full year still stands. Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie. Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, can we go to the next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That was great. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know where Kevin was, but it must have been fun. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I was just hoping that you could talk a little bit about the pricing characteristics by the major markets that you break out, Bill. Are you seeing any change in the marketplace? That would be helpful. Thanks. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. It is a good question. I think I understand the question behind the question because in some of the markets we highlighted, there were some of the segments we highlighted is that volume was growing faster than revenue, if I understand where your question is coming from. I think the \u2013 I wouldn't read too much into that. I think generally, our guidance is the same that we're achieving inflation or a little bit more than inflation in terms of pricing in each of our markets. So it does look a little bit odd in this quarter that you see in a couple of segments where we actually achieved higher volume growth than total revenue growth on a storage basis. I think that's more driven by a couple of things. One is, that in one of our business lines, we had a major \u2013 a very large customer major renewal, and I think as we've talked about before is when we have large customer renewals is you get this sawtooth where at the renewal point is you take a discount, and then it climbs up through that period. So there was a little bit of that going on. And then specifically in Europe, we had a market where we successfully took on a very large public sector customer which has actually similar pricing as, say, a lot of our other developed markets. But because of the historical volume of some customers just reaching their natural life or some of the boxes of natural \u2013 of customers reaching their natural life going out. At the same time you have a \u2013 what effectively looks like a dilution effect, but overall, our pricing still continues to track. If we look at it over a 12 months or kind of a trailing basis, we expect it to continue to track to be slightly ahead of inflation. So you'll see that kind of go back into the normal zone. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then just another question. I asked this maybe a year ago, but I thought maybe ask it again now, which is, your view on Iron Mountain's need and desire to be in shredding as the company gets bigger, as \u2013 still another year into the REIT. Thinking about it, I wanted to understand your thoughts on that business? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think as I probably said a year ago, we like all of our businesses, we never fall in love with any of our businesses. So you know, I would say the same thing about shred or any of our portfolio of businesses. I think \u2013 look, we're getting some good growth out of the business. We \u2013 when we sold off the Australian and the UK business, I guess, a little over year ago that was because we didn't think those markets we had the scale to actually do it. I think we're getting a nice turnaround or improvement in our business in North America. That being said, we look at all our businesses but not just shred. We look in geographies. So businesses and geographies we look at it on a portfolio of basis. And if at some point we feel that there is a better owner for either a business line or even a geography of a \u2013 what you might think is even a core business line, we will consider that. So there are no plans, but we're pretty disciplined on a capital allocation approach across our portfolio of management. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think maybe just one thing to add on shred. It's not a short-term performance problem for us. Certainly in the last few quarters we've seen some good traction in terms of new customer wins which has helped boost revenue, and there has been some good work actually driving the underlining efficiencies within the business. We also saw the paper price for shred recycled paper start to stabilize. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That was my follow-up. You guys mentioned that shredding is up. Is that paper price driven or new customer driven or can you press that out for us? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's primarily driven by new customers, and so we've had a couple of good wins. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean we \u2013 I think we've highlighted before. We've put a new leader in charge of that business and really kind of put a separate, almost managing it as a separate business unit about a year ago, and he's really doing a stand-up job on it. I mean, he is taking a very different approach to driving that business. I think too much before we were focused on chasing customers rather than managing windshield time, and that is a business that lends itself to route density. So different approach, very strong leader and as a result, we're getting good results from that business. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Is there \u2013 are you seeing a competitive dynamic with the ownership change in your competitor there in North America? Are you able to \u2013 is that a source of the new customers? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I wouldn't say that. I mean, I guess you're talking about Stericycle taking over Shred-It, but I think, look, it's \u2013 our sense is it was run as a separate business unit when it was PE-backed, and it's run as a separate business unit \u2013 in fact it has the same leader of that business now as it did before when it was owned by the PE firm. So I think it's pretty much the same competitive dynamic that we had before, but I think we're just doing a better job quite frankly than we were before. Not that we were doing a bad job before, but we just have a much more singular focus on day-to-day management of it. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFJ. Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about storage rental revenue internal growth. 2.2% in 1Q. I think you said in your remarks that you're still expecting it to be up roughly 2.5% for the year. What do you think is going to drive the acceleration later on in the year there? And what are you seeing in terms \u2013 which segments are \u2013 how are they trending? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, good morning, Karin. So I think a couple things. One is, I think if you look at the 2.2% this quarter, it's in line with what Q4 was and as much of anything driven by that we had a 3% increase in Q1 last year. So it's a quarter on quarter, in other words, it's a high comparable versus last year. So it's the main thing that's driving the \u2013 or one of the main drivers of driving it. The other thing which we said is that we expect a ramp through the year. I mean, we feel like we're well on track. But that's why we said we expect still at the end of year to end up north of 2.5% in terms of internal storage revenue growth. The other thing you should go back, is important to look at, if we look at year-on-year comparison, if we look at just total internal revenue growth, total internal revenue growth for the company quarter one 2015 was 1.4% and we have delivered 2% this quarter and overall last year we had 1.5% and we delivered 2% this quarter. So we feel comfortable with the ramp even on a total revenue basis that we're achieving. And specifically, if we look at the storage rental revenue, as I say, you need to look at, quarter-on-quarter is we're looking at a very strong quarter in 2015 and then we have a natural ramp during the year. Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Okay. So, easy comps plus a ramp later on in the year. Got it. Okay. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say more normal comps. Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Normal comp. Okay, got it. Second question, a follow-up on a previous one. The internal service revenue growth performance that you got on 1Q going to be lumpy for the rest of the year, but net positive, are there any quarters that you're expecting from here to go negative on that line? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think you can probably appreciate, we don't guide by the quarter we have a lot of confidence as we look out the course of the year because we see the pipeline of projects, but the actual timing of those projects. You know, quite frankly, some of those projects came in earlier in Q1 than we expected, some of those we thought we are going to come in Q2. So the exact timing of projects are not in our control many times. So we feel comfortable with the pipeline and what we're going to deliver for a year-end result, but to give you quarterly guidance, we're not going to do that. Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Okay. Are you seeing any impact from global economic turmoil on any of your international businesses today? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I think, I'll let Rod talk about it. He can give you a little more flavor about currency. I mean, FX is usually the thing that affects us but doesn't affect us from a liquidity because our costs in revenue are matched, but generally, the great thing about this business, its \u2013 maybe I shouldn't say battleship. That probably is \u2013 people don't like that analogy, but it just plows through basically any weather. I mean, the \u2013 if you look at the GFC [global financial crisis], we had positive rental revenue growth right through the GFC where of any of the company, whether self storage or industrial storage didn't have that. So first of all, even if we see turmoil, it doesn't really affect our business, and we don't see anything that would affect it, even a Brexit which \u2013 which Rod \u2013 which I think can probably comment on more than I can. So you know, we look at these things all the time. We do want to say that we are not complacent as a company as we do look at political risks when we make investments. And we think about the political risk both in terms of what could happen in that country in terms of economic turmoil, but also in terms of currency, but, Rod, you may want to comment a little bit on currency. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Maybe two things, Karin. Just in terms of currency, as I mentioned in the remarks, because we've actually seen a sort of slight weakening of the U.S. dollar more recently and that could be a favorable for us for the full year. So, across the basket of currencies, if things stay as they are, it would be a slight favorable. So, that \u2013 that's a negative if you like for us has turned around, I'm sure as for many other global businesses. In terms of the economic turmoil in certain markets, it's a good question but as Bill points out, we are relatively immune from that. So if I could pick an example such as Russia or Colombia or Brazil, which it's quite difficult straits and more broadly our business is actually performing well and to plan in those markets. It's really to do with the fundamentals of the businesses as Bill pointed out. Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Great. And just last question for you, Rod, where do you think you could raise a long-term debt today, what cost? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's a good question. We think \u2013 well, we hope it will be in the sort of 5% to 6% range, but when we go to market, we will see what the conditions are, but we recently raised some U.S. debt a few months ago at 6% when the market conditions actually weren't as favorable as they are now. So hopefully we can get a bit below that. Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Thanks very much. Operator : William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If there's no \u2013 it doesn't look like there's any further questions, operators. So first of all, I guess we'd like to thank everyone. I know it's a busy time of the year for dialing in and listening in today. And again, we're very excited that we think we've had a very good quarter, which is more importantly is giving us a very strong foundation and entry point into the Recall acquisition which we're really excited about. And the company hasn't done an acquisition that is this transformational probably since the Pierce Leahy acquisition, which was done my predecessor. So we're really looking forward to taking the strong quarter, layering on what Recall can bring as a next stage for growth in the company both in terms of cash flow and dividend growth. So thank you again and look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker) Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good morning. My name is Andrea and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 Quarter's Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would like to now turn the call over to you host Ms. Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Andrea, and welcome everyone to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results. We also have Stuart Brown our incoming CFO with us on the call today. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. And as we've done in the past several quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com, under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's supplemental, the earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently-filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a very good start after our May 2 closing of the Recall acquisition. The base Iron Mountain results continue to show financial and operating performance, which is consistent with quarter one. Synergies from Recall are coming in faster than anticipated in 2016, and based on all this, we reconfirmed the full-year guidance we gave back in April. We're also pleased to welcome Stuart Brown as our new CFO. Stuart officially joined us last week, and I know he is looking forward to getting more engaged in the business and meeting with our investors and analysts. Stuart has a unique blend of both global operating company and REIT experience, and I know he will be a great fit with our executive team. And whilst we are sad that Rod will be leaving us, he will be around for a few months yet to ensure a smooth transition to Stuart. Turning now to our progress on Recall's benefits and integration. First, just to summarize, overall the acquisition makes us the only global platform in our industry as we continue to expand our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing cyber security threats and seek to turn information into business value. As we've noted in the past, this transaction has three core benefits. First, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets. Second, it strengthens our ability to reach mid-market businesses where Recall was very present and Iron Mountain was significantly underrepresented in this very large and high-margin segment. And third, the level of synergy enables significant growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution. This rapid and large expansion of cash flow allows us to simultaneously invest in new product and innovation for the benefit of our customers, significantly grow our dividend, while simultaneously de-levering and markedly bringing down our payout ratio. Finally, this acquisition further supports the trust our customers have in Iron Mountain to serve both their current and future needs. Trust in Iron Mountain to protect what matters most, trust that Iron Mountain will be available to continue to support them in 50-years' time, and trust in Iron Mountain to continue to use its scale for innovation and to provide expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of their overall storage and information assets. In the customer interactions we have had since closing the acquisition, their commentary has been very positive as they can see how we both have the intention and the resources to be even more innovative. An example of our product innovation was reported in a recent Bloomberg profile, highlighting the work we are doing on behalf of MTV as they celebrate their 35th anniversary. On a more operational note, I'm pleased with the team's work to welcome new customers and begin integrating operations. During the second quarter, we accomplished a number of critical integration-related initiatives, whilst continuing to pursue our transformation agenda. And we delivered internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in the base Iron Mountain business, consistent with the growth we saw in the first quarter of this year. In short, we kept our eye on the ball despite all the activities surrounding the Recall close. More specifically, since the closing on May 2, our integration progress includes several key initiatives. We completed our review of Recall's leadership and immediately brought the management teams together, enhancing our organization through the retention of key former executives to lead areas such as customer experience, mid-market and SMB sales, as well as key finance roles in a number of country and territory management positions. We converted Recall's operations in four countries into our REIT structure. We completed the disposition of Recall's business in 23 U.S. markets as required by the United States Department of Justice. We received final clearance from the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority. We solicited and are currently evaluating bids on required dispositions in additional jurisdictions. We began a portfolio review of both companies' service offerings to determine optimal platforms for ensuring continued superior customer service. And we undertook real estate reviews in select markets and identified initial consolidation opportunities in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Australia, as well as in the United States. As a result of these and other quick actions and outstanding facilitation from the transitioning Recall teams, we're getting the synergies faster than expected. This means more impact this year. In fact, we will exit 2016 having achieved more than 80% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. We appreciate that given the closing of Recall a month into the quarter, our second-quarter results don't fully reflect Recall's contribution. And as we noted on last quarter's call, Q2 margins would reflect that Recall's core EBITDAR margins are lower than ours. In fact, Recall's EBITDAR margins have consistently been more than 700 basis points lower than ours. But we saw a bit more impact from that initially given that the assets to be divested and those already sold are among the higher-margin markets in their portfolio. You will recall the execution of our integration program increases the Recall base margin business by pulling two levers. First, in the near-term, we're achieving synergies in SG&A and labor costs. And second, in the medium-term, we'll improve our operating leverage as we consolidate facilities. Rod will have more detail shortly and walk you through the build-up to our full-year expectations. In brief, when we prorate year-to-date results, add in accelerated synergies, second half transformation benefit and typical ramp we see in the business throughout the year, we are comfortable slightly raising the bottom end of our guidance range relative to what we provided back in April. Now turning to some of the quarter's results at a high level before Rod walks you through the ins and outs that can also be found in the bridging graphs in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was 19%, with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage, rental and service revenue. On an internal basis, storage growth was 2.1% and in line with levels achieved in Q4 and Q1. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume or prior to acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarters' performance at 1.7% worldwide growth. Service revenue was flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of projects. However, based on our service project pipeline, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue, as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. As mentioned previously, given our expected service mix, we will maintain our focus on increasing service gross profit rather than purely gross margins. Our new service offerings are sometimes lower margin, but generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. Consistent with this focus, you will note service gross profit was up more than 18% in the second quarter, exceeding the growth in constant dollar service revenue. Turning to progress on our strategic plan : during the quarter, we continued to advance each of the three pillars of the plan, as well as the foundational elements that support it. I will quickly highlight progress in each of the three pillars, namely, getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expansion in faster-growing adjacent businesses. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we had 3 million cubic feet of internal volume growth during the quarter. In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall's footprint in emerging markets supports that objective and has helped drive our emerging market business to 16.4% of total revenue on a constant-dollar basis as of the end of Q2. Additionally, as our visibility on closing of Recall transaction became clearer, we resumed acquisition activity and moved into new emerging markets during the year. Earlier this week, we announced plans to acquire the Information Management operations of Santa Fe Group in 10 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia for approximately \u20ac27 million. The deal also marks our entry into four new emerging markets, Macau, the Philippines, Indonesia and South Korea, as well as further bolstering our already strong positions in Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Taiwan and Malaysia, providing a great foundation for further expansion in this dynamic and higher-growth region. We continue to nurture a deep, diverse pipeline of accretive M&A opportunities in emerging markets where we can leverage our global footprint and deep customer relationships to capture the initial wave of records management outsourcing that is in the early days within these faster-growing markets. Before turning away from our international operations, I should comment on Brexit. Importantly, we don't expect to see a significant impact. We have built scenarios related to the potential implications of the decision with particular focus on our customers, our supply base, our staff and the regulatory and fiscal frameworks in which we operate. We will continue to monitor developments closely and watch for any shifting legal obligations governing the management of information, but as other multinationals have acknowledged, it will be some time before any meaningful movement toward an exit from the EU gets underway. In terms of our core business, it is unlikely to have much impact from a constant-currency perspective, we're generally naturally hedged. As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020 up from just 2% at the end of 2015. In our data center business, we had several recent big wins, bringing us to 80% committed in our first phase building in our aboveground facility in Boston. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds in Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, Missouri, our data center space is greater than 90% committed and we are on track to achieve internal growth approaching 20% in this business area. In our Art Storage business, we are making good progress and acquired another small business, a good example of what we believe will be a long-term consolidation play. Overall, between the progress we're making in emerging markets, as well as adjacent businesses, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, which is up from about 17.5% of our total business mix today. In terms of supporting foundations for the plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. Also as previously disclosed, the remaining $25 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Given the timing of Recall synergies, our transformation program and expected ramp in the business, we remain confident that cash flow will be in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day, and again on our April 1 call, which provides the foundation for our expected dividend growth. As a reminder, we expect to grow dividend per share by about 13% in 2017, as the synergies and transformation benefits flow through our results, and by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments in support of our previously-presented 2020 plan. As we progress this plan, we'll have more cash available to support discretionary investment, which means we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to de-lever. And at the same time, we'll reduce our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO. Our operations are underpinned by our very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. In addition, we're extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed markets, identifying capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in both good and bad times. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. I'll begin today with a high-level overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, which included a two-month benefit from the Recall acquisition compared to the prior year. In addition, I will review our results by segment, provide an update on our transformation initiative and summarize our successful bridge loan refinancing. Lastly, I will touch on the strong progress we're making integrating Recall into our business, as well as our outlook for 2016, which remains essentially unchanged since April. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Consistent with prior quarters, we've provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings-per-share, and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on pages 21 through 24 of the supplemental. Let me briefly walk you through the highlights. For the second quarter, total reported revenues were $884 million compared with $760 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year negative FX impact of approximately 2% or roughly $17 million, on a constant-dollar basis, revenues grew by 18.6%. For the first half of the year, reported revenues were $1.63 billion compared with $1.51 billion in 2015. Excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal storage rental revenue was up 2.1% for Q2, consistent with the growth we saw in Q1. In contrast, internal service revenue was down 2.1% compared with growth of 1.6% we saw in Q1. As we noted on our last call, service revenues are more project-based, which have more volatile growth rates on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Based on a review of our service deal pipeline, we continue to expect internal service revenue growth to be positive for the full year. Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $261 million compared with $223 million in 2015. We grew adjusted OIBDA by 17.1% on a reported-dollar basis and by 18.8% on a constant-dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 9.3% reported dollar, and by 11.6% on a constant-dollar basis. As we noted on our Q1 call, Recall is a lower-margin business than Iron Mountain, therefore, as expected, our adjusted OIBDA margins were lower relative to the first quarter of the year. This impact flows through to our adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO results. As synergies build in future quarters, this picture will be reversed. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 compared with $0.28 in 2015. Year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.55 compared with $0.60 in 2015. In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the increased depreciation expense of Recall's legacy racking structures. The amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to FFO per share; however, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO per share. FFO per share was $0.47 for the quarter compared with $0.49 in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, FFO per share was $0.98 compared with $0.99 in the year-ago period. AFFO was $159 million compared with $131 million in the year-ago period. Importantly, AFFO was not impacted by the increased depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter, as these are non-cash items and do not impact our AFFO or cash available for distribution. Year-to-date, AFFO was $301 million compared with $259 million in 2015. AFFO for the year-to-date is at the high end of our expectations. However, we expect to remain within our ranges for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, on page 20 of the supplemental, we are providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement. So you can more readily see the cash items that are not typically of a recurring nature. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 17.2% compared with 13.9% in the prior year. Expected year-over-year increase in our structural tax rates was mostly driven by the legacy Recall business, which has higher exposure to international markets with their respective foreign tax rates, and which do not have the same tax efficiency as we do in the U.S. with the REIT structure. Also, the tax rate this quarter is below the previously-communicated run rate expectation of 20%, as our pre-tax income was impacted by Recall integration and deal costs. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18%, as a result of these Recall costs. However, beyond 2016, we expect the tax rate to be closer to 19% to 20%. Let's turn to our financial performance by segments, in North American Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 0.7% for the second quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue declined by 1.2%. Growth in shredding and scanning was offset by declines in core transportation. North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.3% for the second quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity, partially offset by strong growth in new Data Management offerings. In addition, we had a large project which benefited the prior-year period. After normalizing for this, DM service revenues performed in line with prior quarters. DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to a decrease in overhead costs as we continue to realize transformation benefits. The Western Europe segment generated 0.1% internal storage rental growth and internal service revenue declined by 4.6%, primarily as a result of lower activity in transportation-related revenue and lower project revenue. The low internal storage growth in Western Europe was due to a large customer win in the year-ago period and certain contract renegotiations that occurred this quarter. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year in Western Europe due to lower G&A expenses. The Other International segments, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Internal storage rental growth was 8.6% and internal service growth was 5.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 25% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. We're pleased with the progress we've made with our transformation initiative. During the second quarter, we did not incur significant costs related to transformation, as the focus was not head count related; rather it was on streamlining business processes. Year-to-date, we've actioned $28 million of the $50 million exit rate savings and have line-of-sight on incremental $22 million to be implemented by the end of this year. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out at our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and provide details on the costs we've incurred so far in 2016 to achieve synergies and integrate Recall within our business. As Bill explained, the synergy program is ahead of schedule. As you can see on the supplemental on page 25, we expect to exit this year having already achieved more than 80% of the total synergies originally anticipated for 2017. Our expectations of total cost to achieve the target synergies are still consistent with prior projections. Because we're accelerating synergies to set us up for a strong run rate for 2017, we expect to incur roughly $10 million more in costs in 2016 than originally contemplated. Year-to-date, we've incurred $37 million of integration costs, $32 million of deal close costs. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Please note, these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are one time in nature. Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent, given the durability of our business. We remain on track to achieve our short and long-term financial objectives. Please note that although our guidance assumes divestitures would occur on day one, the benefit from businesses yet to be divested that are running through our operating results is not significant. Some legacy Recall assets were sold to Access nearly at the same time as the close, so they are not reflected in our results. The remaining legacy Recall assets to be sold are included in discontinued operations, therefore not flowing through our operating income. Lastly, the remaining Iron Mountain assets to be disposed of are flowing through our financials; however, with an immaterial benefit for the quarter and full year. Overall, our core Iron Mountain business is performing to plan. Recall contribution is tracking in line with our previous expectations, and we have accelerated the realization of net synergies for the year, which is why we brought up the lower end of our adjusted OIBDA guidance by $5 million. Let me now refer you to the table at the bottom of our guidance page, on page 12 of the supplemental, to follow our expectations for full-year adjusted OIBDA. We thought it'd be helpful to cover how results track against our original expectations. But please note, we will be not reporting actual results separately, given our financial statements are now fully integrated. Our standalone expectation for Iron Mountain's core business remains $950 million to $970 million, consistent with what we previously communicated. And our performance in the first half of year is tracking right in line with our expectation. For the second quarter, excluding Recall's base and synergies less divestitures, Iron Mountain's standalone adjusted OIBDA was in line with Q1 results at $235 million. So year-to-date, Iron Mountain standalone adjusted OIBDA was roughly $470 million. In the second half of the year, we expect to realize $7 million to $10 million of transformation benefits to offset costs associated with that program in the first half. We also expect a ramp in the business as our storage base continues to expand. This ramp is consistent with 2015, during which second half-year results were $10 million higher than the first half on a reported-dollar basis. If you annualize the first half actual run rate, our transformation benefits and a similar ramp to last year, standalone expectations are in line. Now let me address the second line related to Recall's contribution for the year. Prior to divestitures, we expect the Recall business to contribute $115 million of adjusted OIBDA at the midpoint. This reflects eight months of Recall contribution, and our range implies $13 million to $15 million per month of contribution prior to synergies and divestitures. Lastly, we are expecting $18 million of adjusted OIBDA synergies, net of the impact of the divestitures for the year. As Bill noted, this is up from our initial expectation of $15 million. As a result, our adjusted OIBDA guidance range for 2016 is now $1.075 billion to $1.110 billion. For adjusted EPS, our guidance remains unchanged, although our expectations for the structural tax rate are lower than previously anticipated. This benefit will likely be offset by the accelerated depreciation of Recall racking structures. Although our total normalized dollar AFFO guidance remains the same, we changed our FFO per share guidance to reflect where we expect the final weighted average share count will settle for the year. We did not update adjusted EPS for this impact because the benefit is offset by the incremental real estate depreciation expense mentioned earlier. Please also note that on a constant dollar, guidance remains close to reported dollars. Assuming current rates hold, we do not see a downside from FX in our guidance. Moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investment for 2016, we continue to estimate that it'll be roughly $600 million. This provides ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments. Our capital deployment plans for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real estate maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the figures we provided on our last earnings call, and to total $170 million for the year. Our expectation for total real estate investment spend remains $320 million. This includes $70 million in core growth racking investment and the remainder of our real estate spend is expected to be in real estate consolidation, development, data center and some lease conversions. As we've said in the past, we are focused on consolidating facilities, particularly given the Recall transaction. We expect real estate consolidation will provide upsides to synergies in the long-term, but it's too early for us to quantify the exact benefit at this time. For M&A, we continue to expect to spend roughly $150 million, with approximately $100 in emerging markets, $50 million in developed markets. Dividend expectations remain consistent with our previous guidance for 2016. Our dividend per share is expected to grow from $1.94 this year to a minimum of $2.20 in 2017 and $2.35 in 2018, as we realize the majority of benefits, transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share at roughly 4% per year. Importantly, our dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is in line with prior expectations and should reduce to 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. In addition, we're targeting a leverage ratio of 5.0 times by 2020. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the quarter end, we had liquidity of approximately $580 million and our lease-adjusted debt ratio was slightly up at 5.8 times as expected. Our leverage ratio increased primarily as a result of the timing of Recall integration and deal costs discussed earlier. We expect to end the year at a leverage ratio at 5.7 times as we start realizing synergies and transformation savings. As many of you may already know, we refinanced the $850 million bridge facility associated with Recall transaction, primarily with long term debt. We raised $750 million in aggregate principal amount and senior unsecured notes, which included $500 million at 4-3/8% due in 2021 and $250 million at 5-3/8% due in 2026. Our unsecured debt was prices at spreads similar to business services issues rated two notches higher than Iron Mountain, and at the top of the spread range for our investment grade issuers, which reflect debt investors' favorable view of our predictable cash flow. In addition, we also amended our credit agreement and extended its maturity to 2019. So overall, we are pleased with the performance we saw in the second quarter and year-to-date. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our long-term plan. We're excited with the progress we've made so far in integrating Recall, and pleased that we will be realizing synergies earlier-than-expected. Looking ahead, we're confident that we're well-positioned to deliver on our long-term goals. We remain highly focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth in cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. I'll now hand the call back to Bill. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Rod. To wrap up before going to Q&A, just to summarize, we're off to a very successful start after closing Recall and having accomplished what we set out to do in the first three months since closing. We made great progress on integrating Recall's people, platform and portfolio. We're on track with our financial expectations for the year, and in fact, slightly raised the lower end of our range for the full-year guidance. And additionally, we like what we see as we look at our exit rate from 2016 and our entry into 2017. Overall, we are excited about the potential we see to realize the benefits of combined scale with Recall and look forward to updating you on continued progress next quarter. Before I turn it over to questions, I should say that I think our transformation program probably has reduced the caffeine in my coffee in the morning. So I did, I think, misstate that Access \u2013 we sold 23 U.S. markets to Access, I meant to say 13. So, 13 is much better than 23 and I will talk to the transformation folks to kind of put the caffeine back in my coffee. But any way, with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over to Q&A. Thank you. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, It's Shlomo Rosenbaum over here prior to the name change I guess. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Shlomo, I was wondering who is at Stifel's these days. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: A couple things I want to ask. One of them is around the \u2013 what looks like the destructions and the out-perms. If you look particularly at the out-perms in Western Europe International, it looks like in the last couple of quarters you are seeing some acceleration over there in terms of volumes. Can you give us some color on what exactly is going on there? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, sure. Sure, Shlomo. So first of all, let's look at the absolute net volume, right? So if you look at Q2 2016 this quarter, you'll see that out-perms and destructions, if you subtract that from new sales and organic growth, you have a net before acquisitions of 3.8% (sic) [3.7%] growth versus a Q1 of 3% growth, so the net growth has actually increased. But coming to specifically your question about what's going on with out-perms is, the 2.3% in Q1 of 2016 is not out of norm. So if you kind of go back and you look at the supplemental on page 11, you'll see that over the last 12 month \u2013 or less, say, even more than 1.5 years or so, you'll see going back into Q3 of 2014, it goes somewhere between 2.1% and 2.3%. Where you really see the spike is in the Q2 2016 number, where you see that go up to 2.6%, so it's really a Q2 issue. But as I say, the net volume is positive. And for those that followed Recall, there was a program that Doug would euphemistically call Close the Gap. And the two things he referred to was the 700-or-so basis points lower gross margin that their business yielded in terms of their overall business. And the other thing is, he highlighted that the level of out-perms that they had relative to ours. So, where we see the roughly the 30 bp increase in out-perms from Q1 to Q2, that's driven by Recall's \u2013 emerging Recall's business into ours, which we knew was a \u2013 had a less \u2013 had a higher volatility or a higher turn in that. But you'll see that come down over time because obviously, we're wrapping the same customer loyalty program, which I think we've spoken on previous calls where we have \u2013 we built a \u2013 with outside help, we built an algorithm that helps predict 6 months to 12 months ahead of time certain customer issues that prevent the out-perms. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, they had a higher out-perm. Was it the nature of their business? Or based on what you are describing, it sounds like they didn't have as effective a customer outreach as what Iron Mountain core had. Is that the way to think about it? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's the latter. So and Doug used to comment on his calls, I guess, they only did half year results. But it's exactly that they didn't have the same tools. And in fact, three years ago, we basically introduced the tools \u2013 I can't take credit for it, they started the work before I came in, but we started ramping up just as I came in. And you would've seen the same decrease in Iron Mountain's business. And one of the things that Recall had is, they couldn't afford to take the investment that we did. I mean, we brought in some outside help and advisers that know how to build these tools, and it looks at a number of different things. It looks at volume through the call center. It looks at number of boxes coming in. It looks at the types of complaints that we're getting from a customer, and there's a number of different things that you pick up. The last time we gave them a price increase. And you look at those different pieces of data, and it's pretty accurate in terms of predicting when you're heading for a crisis with that customer and then you can intervene. And I forget exactly what their number was, but it was significantly \u2013 it was at least a full point higher than ours in terms of the out-perms. And you're seeing that averaging in when we go from the 2.3% to 2.6%. So it is something \u2013 it isn't structural in the Recall business. It was much more they just didn't have the same tools and sophistication that we introduced, say, three years ago. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Bill, did you have a chance to go back, now that you own the company, and a look at how many of the out-perms that they were experiencing actually were incoming to you guys and kind of do an analysis on that? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: A great question and I wish I could've gotten the DOJ \u2013 the DOJ asked the same question. I wish I could have gotten them to be data-driven. Actually, the loss ratio between \u2013 the win and loss ratio between us and them was actually much smaller than you would think, right? I mean, we'd like to say we competed against each other and we did. But actually, generally, they lost to somebody else, and we lost to somebody else. And that \u2013 I think we've talked about it previously where they have \u2013 they did \u2013 they have taken business from us. There was no question about that. But where they were much more present was in that middle market and SMB space, so they were winning and losing against much more the smaller players. And we're actually quite excited about it, to be honest with you. So their head of sales for North America now runs our whole mid-market SMB segment. And that business is, I think, approaching almost $800 million. I think $750 million of sales, if we combine the two companies. So, it's of the same size of what Recall was globally just in North America, and we think we can to a better job. So, they were losing typically to other people, and we were losing to other people for the most part. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hi, thanks, good morning. You're substantially pulling forward Recall synergies, about 80% of total synergies previously expected by the end of 2017. That said, OIBDA guidance for the full year is not meaningfully increasing. Can you discuss what incremental headwinds you expect in the back half that are reflected in guidance? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a good question, George, but it's more the math. So the part \u2013 it's not as big a delta as you think because you have to look at what the translation of the $15 million, because of the way the synergies flow in during the course of the year, what we get for impact in 2016 leads you to a very high \u2013 which is small, leads you to a very high exit. So, I'm trying to remember the number, but I'll ask Rod to comment. I think we were before the $15 million translated into around $60 million, $65 million. And the $18.5 million translates into around $80 million. But it's not a \u2013 it's 80% \u2013 we were always going to achieve a very high percentage; just we weren't going to achieve 80% before in terms of going into 2017. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes, George, our exit rate is 80% of next year as opposed to the in-year being 80% of 2017. So in-year, we're sort of net $3 million higher, but actually that translates into quite a significant improvement in the exit rate that we have for next year and sets us up really nicely for 2017. So it's not that the number's gone up and we're using that to cover for other things. That's not the case at all. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's just we're getting it faster. It's just \u2013 it is a speed, but it gives you an idea that when we get into 2017, we're cracking the back of it. We're always going to crack the back of it in 2016. We are even cracking a bigger part of it in 2016 than we originally thought. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Can you remind us what the 80% previously was in terms of exit rate? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, it was around 70%, right? I think, it was about 70% \u2013 we'll give you the exact number. I think it was about 70% because it was 60% on 90%, right? So I think it was about 70%. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It was of that order, George, 65% to 70%. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Can you provide some additional details around how records management volumes performed in Recall's business compared to recent historical trends and expectations? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Say it one more time. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Basically, how Recall's volumes performed relative to your expectations and relative to their... William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, all right. Yes. Okay, so in terms of their historical trend, so pretty much as we expected, other than \u2013 we expected, as I answered to Shlomo, we expected that the out-perms would be higher and that pretty much translated straight across because we could see that in the results. The growth and opportunity we see in the middle market is pretty much what we expected. I think that the \u2013 so the trends of merging their business into ours, we're pretty much on track. The margin that both I commented on and Rod commented on, we commented on last quarter before we closed. We knew that, that was the case. I think the one thing that has been the \u2013 so it's been more of an upside, and I think the upside has been more around the people. Not that we expected to get bad people. But I think when you buy a competitor, you always kind of think that they're different than you, and when you're talking to customers, you typically demonize the competitor. And guess what? They have blood flowing through their veins just like us, and we've gotten some really good people as a result of it. And they had almost identical values and code of conduct as we had. In fact, you lay the two slides up next to each other, we did it at a town hall, and they're virtually almost the same. So I don't know who copied from who? So we've actually, probably, if anything, have integrated the people much quicker. And when I say integrated, not just get them into slots, but people feel like they've been around a lot longer than they have, if you know what I mean. In other words, they didn't spend a lot of time trying to figure stuff out or adapt to a new culture. So that part has been better than we thought. But in terms of the way the numbers have flowed in, we haven't found any surprises. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Got it, helpful. And then, lastly, could you provide an update on services trends, if you're seeing continued signs of stability or any potential risks to growth ahead? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, it's a good question. So I think we also pretty \u2013 kind of foreshadowed at the last quarter that we thought we would see a drop in service revenue, that the next \u2013 Q2 wouldn't be as strong as Q1. And so obviously, we could see the pipeline, and we knew how that worked. The one thing that I think again we commented last time is that as we shift more to project-based rather than transportation-based service revenue, we do expect it to be pipeline-dependent and, therefore, more project-dependent and, therefore, more lumpy. So it's much easier to predict that if you look over a 12-month period than if you look at it on a 1-month or even a 3-month period. So if we \u2013 as that as a backdrop, if we look forward to the rest of the year, we like the pipeline, the booking pipeline \u2013 the bookings and the pipeline that we see for the rest of the year. So we're very confident that for the total year, we will see positive service revenue growth, which obviously means that the new services are offsetting the declines that we talked about in the transportation, which has driven to the structural shift in the way that the information is being used. So we feel very good that for the full year, you'll see a trend that's consistent with Q1 as the pipeline turns into bookings and turns into projects that we see in front of us. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. If it's okay I'm going to dive back into tapes \u2013 North American tapes decline. I just don't quite get how the minus 13.5% organic services decline in North American tapes has to do with a large project from a year ago. The decline in that business is 7 points worse than the first quarter decline, but the comp year-over-year is only 4 points, let's call it, less easy. And so, when I kind of see this 13.5% decline versus a year ago, minus 1.7%, it just doesn't seem like the year-over-year comparison explains it all. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's a good question, Andrew. So first of all, our \u2013 so that business also includes film and sound, right, which is very project-dependent. So a year ago, we had a very large project with one of our film and sound customers, and that project fell off. So if you normalize for that, what you see is roughly the 9% to 10% reduction in transportation that we've been calling out quarter-by-quarter. And the new services have been offsetting that between 40% and 50% of that decline. So the net decline and you'll see that going forward as well is that the net decline as the new services replace some of the transportation as the tapes are becoming more for disaster recovery rather than for rotation, then you'll see that the typical 9% to 10% decline in transportation and being offset by 40% or 50% by the growth in new products. But specifically, our Data Management business includes both the data protection and the tape business, as well as our film and sound business, which we had a very large project for a studio. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I got it. I think what you just said was the transportation business was down about the same as first quarter, we had some more new services in the first quarter, expect more of it for the rest of the year, but not as much in the second quarter, with a large project a year ago? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, no, the only thing \u2013 the first part was right, but we had the same amount of growth in the new service products in Q2 as we did in Q1. So roughly, what I'm saying is that what you can expect is that, the underlying business in Q2 was like Q1 if you took out the large project. So you had transportation going down to 9% to 10%, and then you had new services offsetting about 40% to 50% of that decline. So in other words, you end up net in the mid-single-digit decline in terms of the service revenue of that business. And we expect that trend to be similar in Q3 and Q4. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, it was at this time in Q2 last year, this film and sound project, so it screws up the comparisons, but Q3 should be about normal. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And that was just one quarter, right? We don't have any tough comps on the film project going into the second half, right? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, it was a Q2 issue. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the time. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It was a nice issue to have last year, I should say. I'm not saying that having large project is an issue. It's just explaining it a year later how they roll in and roll out? Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. No, I'm sure it was a fun project. I appreciate it, thank you. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, Andrew. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, good morning guys. So I wanted to ask a little bit just for an update on pricing trends, particularly in Europe, given that the organic volume gains were up pretty nicely, but total organic was flattish. I think you mentioned some contract renegotiations. So, maybe just an update on what's going on in the pricing environment would be helpful? Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. In Western Europe, we had a couple of things, one affected last year, and then also impacting this year. So in Q2 of last year, we actually had a gain as a result of some renegotiations that went on at that point to do with a specific project and specific customer. This year, we had a couple of customers that went the other way in terms of the renegotiations that we had, which obviously, you have a sort of strong quarter last year and a relatively weak quarter this year. So you got a double impact in terms of the growth rate. I think in terms of overall, if you strip that out and then talk about overall pricing, in Western Europe, we do see a modest price erosion over time because we have quite high price legacy base. So that's a phenomenon you'll see if you look in some of our historic numbers, that's not the case, say, for example, in North America, which is obviously a much larger business where the legacy base price is more consistent with the price that we get today. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. And just to illustrate Rod's point, it's typically in the UK, you see prices in p that you see in cents in the U.S. Now that was even more interesting before the Brexit. But anyway, so you do see this range in terms of the high legacy pricing in Europe. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. That's helpful and that makes sense. And then my second question is really just a clarification just to make sure that we have the right numbers. With the accelerated synergy benefits, it looks like for 2016 now you've got $18 million in net synergy benefit versus $15 million previously. But 2017 is still the same $80 million net synergy target, is that right? And then what's the ultimate synergy target? That still is unchanged at $105 million? William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. What we've always said is that \u2013 that was a minimum synergy target and we'll see as we get closer to 2017 and into 2017 if that speed also translates into more. Right now, it's speed. But I think we've always said that once we start really understanding the consolidation opportunity, that could be more, but right now, I would keep your $17 million guidance in the overall synergy number where it is. But yes, so the \u2013 you're absolutely right. It's about speed right now. Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think that's right, Bill. I think at this stage, it's sort of bit of upside this year, sets us up great for next year in terms of confidence around that number, but no change in the total yet for 2017. The big item we're looking at the moment is real estate consolidation, which we've always called out as a potential upside further down the line, but it's still early days in terms of the analysis there. There will be an update in quarters to come on that. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Okay, that makes sense, thank you. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks a lot. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, well, thank you very much, and I hope you all enjoy the rest of your summer. Have a great Labor Day and we'll speak to you on the Q3 call. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 and 2017 preliminary financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's slides, our earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. And the reconciliations to those measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting a solid quarter, and I'm also happy to be partnering with Stuart Brown for his first Iron Mountain quarterly conference call. Stuart's been on board since the time we reported Q2 and has been spending a lot of time in the field, familiarizing himself with the business and working closely with Rod during the transition. Stuart will deliver financial highlights in just a bit. For the third quarter, we delivered revenue and Adjusted OIBDA results right in line with our expectations and notably drove our Adjusted OIBDA margins back to 31.2%, more in line with historical norms prior to integrating the historically lower margin Recall business. In addition, we continued to see consistent trends in our core business with positive internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in developed markets, a greater portion of our revenue coming from faster-growing emerging markets and good momentum in our adjacent business segment, particularly data center. As noted last quarter, due to our quick actions, we are getting Recall integration synergies faster than expected. In fact, we now expect to exit 2016 having achieved more than 85% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year end 2017. This is up from 80% in our Q2 call, and we continue to expect in-year synergies to be $80 million. It is this achievement of getting synergies faster and the added benefit from our transformation initiative, which is the fuel that allowed us to increase the dividend per share starting in Q4 by 13% from $0.485 to $0.55 per share. As you will recall, this is in line with what we laid out at our Investor Day a year ago, but we are achieving it a full quarter earlier despite closing the Recall transaction later than originally expected. Before going into Q3 performance, let me first provide a little more color on the Recall integration. As we've noted in the past, the Recall transaction benefits us in three primary ways. First, the level of synergy enables meaningful growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution, which funds increasing dividends and provides cash for continued investment in the business, all whilst over time delevering. Second, it strengthens our ability to reach the high-margin mid-market business, where Recall had a strong presence compared with Iron Mountain's enterprise focus. And third, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets, giving us more exposure to these faster-growing and attractive markets. As noted in the past, integration efforts will increase the Recall base margin business, which has historically operated at 600 basis points to 700 basis points lower than ours in three areas : SG&A labor; and in the longer term, real estate consolidation benefits. We also continue our detailed review of our real estate platform, as we consider further consolidation opportunities, which we believe can provide additional, benefit over time. Further, the growth in cash flow allows us to invest in new products and innovation for the benefit of our customers, innovation around areas from how we bundle services in simplified pricing, to utilizing excess building capacity for other types of storage, to leveraging our sector-leading knowledge to offer technology solutions to our customers. An example of this is our Analytics Dashboard that we recently introduced to help records and information managers demonstrate the effectiveness of their information governance program and uncover the value of their data. The Dashboard help them manage retention schedule, improve inventory tracking, identify potential risk and compliance concerns, and conduct internal and peer benchmarking of best practices. In addition to improving tools such as the Dashboard, we're also testing better and easier ways for customers to interact with us through mobile devices that enable voice recognition. When we refer to innovation, we're talking about tapping the ideas our customers and employees have for new products and solutions, vetting them and then incorporating them into our customer solutions and processes in order to further strengthen our differentiation and profitability. We have discussed some of these items previously, such as our emerging partnership with the likes of EMC/Virtustream, and now, Dell, in building air gap, which provides customers with the added cybersecurity all of us seek. It is these innovations and others, which not only provide additional value to our customers, but will also add to future earnings growth both as stand-alone products as well as further differentiating our existing offerings. We're planning to host our next Investor Day in late April 2017, at which time, we intend to share a few of these innovation ideas with you. We'll also have about a full year of Recall under our belts by that time. In addition, we continue to make progress on the dispositions required by the regulators. You may have seen that just last week we received approval from the ACCC, or the Australian regulator, for the disposition of our legacy business in Australia to Housatonic Partners, a private equity firm. This AUD $70 million transaction closed yesterday. In addition, we continue to make progress on the sale of the required assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We're pleased with our progress on these dispositions, and we'll bring you updates as those transactions are approved by the regulators and closed. We now expect that total dispositions will generate approximately $185 million in gross proceeds compared with our initial estimate of $220 million. Whilst this total is a bit lighter than we originally expected, we are pleased with where we've landed and believe the transactions are consistent with our commercial goals in those markets. Let me now turn to some highlights before Stuart walks you through the details that can also be found in the bridging graph in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was up more than 27% with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage rental and service revenue. Adjusted OIBDA as I mentioned at the beginning is back to nearly our high levels before the acquisition with Adjusted OIBDA margins up 150 basis points from Q2. On an internal basis, storage rental growth was 2.6%, and we continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth, which excludes the initial Recall volume we added when we closed the transaction was positive in all storage segments and at 1.8% for the quarter. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration related activity. Year-to-date, service revenue was basically flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of the projects. Based on our service project pipeline, we expect internal service revenue growth to be roughly flat for the full year. As we've talked about on previous calls, given our expected change in service mix, we continue to focus on improving service gross profit and protecting returns on invested capital rather than on service gross margins. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvement in our service business, but it's important to keep in mind that 83% of our gross profit is from storage. Whilst we continue to devote a fair amount of attention to how we can grow and enhance our service business, our service lines first and foremost, provide a strong differentiation to our core storage business. Turning to progress on our strategic plan, which entails getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expanding in faster-growing adjacent businesses, we continue to make progress on each of these pillars and the foundational elements that support them. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we added 3.6 million cubic feet of internal volume growth. North America RIM storage growth was 1.1%, reflecting positive volume growth. This is all before the impact of Recall and any other acquisitions during the period. In emerging markets, it is important to note that these markets are differentiated through higher levels of internal storage growth of roughly 10%. Our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale to drive these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. You may remember, we announced the beginning of this journey about three years ago, where we started at 10% of our sales coming from this fast-growing segment. By the beginning of this year, we had approached 16% of our sales coming from emerging markets. And now, with Recall's footprint, we are at 17.1% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis. Whilst we did not close any international acquisitions during the quarter, we continue to expect total M&A investment in the range of $140 million to $180 million this year, having closed on roughly $56 million year-to-date excluding Recall. More specifically, we expect four significant transactions in the emerging markets to close in Q4, which will utilize about $75 million of the remaining M&A budget. In addition to this final stage pipeline in the emerging markets, there are a number of smaller tuck-ins mainly in developed markets, which are expected to close. An example of this focus and continued execution can be readily seen in our Southeast Asian markets plus China. At the start of the year, this region represented just $14 million of annual sales. With the acquisition of Recall and upon closing the Santa Fe transaction we discussed last quarter, we'll have grown our business in this region to annualized revenue of more than $100 million, with leading positions in virtually all countries where we operate within the region. In our adjacent business segment, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. In our data center business, we announced a major lease in the quarter in our purpose-built Boston data center with SimpliVity, a leader in infrastructure enterprise IT. SimpliVity needed data center resources to support its engineering lab, and our colocation solution was the right fit from a cost, capacity, efficiency and security perspective. They noted that our 65-year track record of protecting proprietary assets gave them the confidence to trust a third party with such an expansion. In addition, a couple of weeks ago, we broke ground on construction of the first building of our 83 acre data center campus in Manassas, Virginia using a development partner for this first 150,000 square foot data center. This building will deliver superior physical security, lower power costs and a reduced tax structure compared to other national locations. In total, our Northern Virginia data center campus will support 42 megawatts of critical load spread across a planned four individual colocation facilities. This represents a four times expansion of our current capacity. The first building expected to open in summer 2017 will offer 10.5 megawatts of critical power and a flexible design that can meet the more exacting requirements of cloud service providers, federal government, system integrators, financial service firms and healthcare companies. It will also comply with federal technology and environmental regulations, enabling federal agencies and integrators to comply by stated deadlines for efficient, sustainable data centers. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business and are continuing to manage capacity utilization to stay ahead of demand whilst benefiting from pre-leasing activity in existing markets. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds of Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our data center space is greater than 90% committed. And we are on track to achieve internal growth of 20% to 25% in this business area. Whilst we don't break out our data center business separately in our financials, we continue to achieve top line organic growth in this business. And we expect to end 2016 with an exit run rate of $25 million in sales, which compares favorably with our 2015 exit rate of $20 million. In terms of supporting foundations for the strategic plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. We expect to action an additional $18 million of savings by the end of this year, bringing us to $100 million in run rate savings to be recognized in 2017. Whilst we didn't incur much in the way of additional cost in Q3, we laid the groundwork for improvements to be implemented next year focused on achieving the final $25 million of this $125 million program. Given the timing of Recall synergies, our transformation program, and positive business trends, we remain confident that we will generate cash flow in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and updated in recent presentations. This provides the foundation for our dividend growth. Our newly declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share equates an increase of about 13%, reflecting the benefit of synergies and transformation. Our expectations continue to be \u2013 to grow the underlying business and cash flow, which will support an increase in our dividend per share by an additional 7% in 2018, and 4% annual growth thereafter in line with our strategic plan whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments. As we progress our plan, we'll generate more cash available to support discretionary investments. So we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to delever. Our operations are underpinned by our very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. We have a durable storage business that generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage real estate sectors. Our lack of volatility through economic cycles and business durability clearly distinguishes our business. It is this durability that delivers consistent operating performance with high rates of utilization and stable pricing in both good and bad economies. Another thing that distinguishes our business is our relative insensitivity to higher interest rate compared with most REITs. First, our customers' storage needs are largely unaffected by interest rate movements. Second, our core storage NOI doesn't change with the value of the underlying real estate. Third, we incur virtually no TIs or tenant improvements, if a customer leave and we bring in a new one. Importantly, we have an operating business and we effectively control real estate through long-term leases with multiple lease extension options and direct ownership in strategic locations of about one third of our properties. In an increasing rate environment, this structure reduces our exposure to real estate value fluctuations compared with REITs that own their entire portfolios. Additionally, it should be noted that we generally enjoy higher levels of real price increases during periods with more inflation. In summary, it was a solid quarter with good execution on all three pillars of our strategic plan even in the midst of the Recall integration. We achieved solid internal and constant dollar growth, continued volume increases, and meaningful expanded OIBDA margins all of which support increased cash flow and the 13% increase in our dividend per share. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be a part of Iron Mountain and working with mountaineers around the globe. The durability of Iron Mountain's records management and related businesses and the substantial opportunity to continue to optimize performance following the Recall acquisition and through our strategic plan is just part of what drew me to Iron Mountain. I am really pleased that our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute. There are many opportunities ahead, and I believe it's a very exciting time to be a part of the team. Before diving into the details of our financials, let me take a moment and walk you through the key highlights of the quarter. First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, excluding Recall and other small acquisitions. This compares with 2.1% last quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Making up over 80% of our gross profits growth in the storage rental business remains our key execution focus. Second, we enhanced our profitability. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 150 basis points from the second quarter, as benefits from the transformation program and synergies from the Recall transaction flow into our results. Third, we are making great progress on the integration of Recall and over 85% of the $115 million of 2017 growth synergies will be in process by the end of this year. Fourth, since June 30, we completed approximately $380 million of debt refinancing at attractive rates, including the recent $50 million mortgage, resulting in about 74% of our debt now being fixed after paying down the revolver in early October, and that compares to 68% in the second quarter. Our average maturity was 5.1 years and our weighted average interest rate was 5.1%. Our Canadian debt offering tied to the lowest coupon ever in the high yield Canadian market demonstrating our debt investors' appreciation of our solid cash flow and recognition that our leverage is in line with many investment grade REITs. We remained steadily on track to deliver on short term financial objectives and long-term goals. And as Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth, the durability of our cash flows and capital efficiency that our board of directors increased our dividend by 13% to $0.55 per share. Now that I've covered the highlights, I'll go over our worldwide financial results followed by a review of our performance by segment and conclude with the discussion on our outlook for 2016 and a preliminary view on 2017. Consistent with prior quarters, we provided bridging schedules for total revenue, Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted earnings per share, and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on pages 23 through 26 of the supplemental. Let me walk you through the highlights. For the third quarter, our total reported revenues increased 26.3% or 27.4% on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal revenue increased 1.4% in the third quarter compared with a 0.4% increase in Q2, again with improvement in all regions and segments. We expect total internal revenue growth in 2016 to be between 1.5% and 2%, reflecting continued solid performance in our higher margin storage activities and growth in adjacent businesses, offset by modest declines in service revenues. Let's look at storage and service revenue performance in the quarter. Storage rental revenue is the core economic driver of our business, representing 61% of revenue and 83% of our total gross profit. As I mentioned earlier, our third quarter storage internal growth accelerated to 2.6% from 2.2% growth in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect full year storage internal growth of approximately 2.5%. Service revenues which make up 39% of total revenues and 17% of our gross profit declined 0.5% from a year ago compared to a year-over-year decline of 2.1% in Q2. As we've highlighted in previous calls, the mix shift in our service business growth rates can be a bit volatile on a quarter-on-quarter basis. However, we expect internal service revenue growth to be about flat for the full year. Total third quarter gross profit margin declined slightly from Q2 due mainly to the additional month of Recall results. As we've previously highlighted, Recall pre-acquisition, operated at a lower margin than Iron Mountain due in part to having higher rent expense as a percentage of revenue, as Recall lease almost all of their facilities. However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies and other synergies to more than offset this margin decline resulting in expansion of Adjusted OIBDA margin. In the quarter, we grew total Adjusted OIBDA by 29.1% on a reported dollar basis and by approximately 30% on a constant dollar basis. Importantly, Adjusted OIBDA margins expanded year-on-year and sequentially to 31.2% as we continue to see benefits from transformation actions and from Recall synergies. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27; Adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the depreciation expense of legacy Recall racking structures. As a reminder, the amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to funds from operations. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO. Normalized FFO per share was $0.44 for the quarter. The decline in FFO per share was driven by two factors. First, the increased non-cash amortization of Recall's customer relationship intangibles as discussed back in April, that is not added back to calculate FFO. Second, is the tax impact of Recall related expenses. As most of the costs of this integration phase were incurred in our qualified REIT subsidiary, they did not provide a tax shield. This last item also impacted our effective tax rate which appears high as the Recall costs and the $14 million impairment reduced pre-tax income, however they did not reduce taxes recorded in our taxable subsidiaries. This is a short term effect of the integration effort. Third quarter AFFO was $169 million compared with $134 million in the year ago period, fueling our dividend increase. Remember AFFO adds back non-cash items such as amortization and non-cash or discrete tax items, so AFFO was not as impacted by the same items that impacted FFO. Let's turn quickly to our financial performance by segment. Pages 15 and 16 of the supplemental outline our performance by segment in detail for the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis. Let me touch on a few highlights from these pages. In North America Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 1.1%, reflecting strong internal volume growth, in North America Data Management or DM we saw a strong internal storage rental growth of 2.2% reflecting an improvement from the second quarter. However, service internal growth declined due to the timing of projects and the ongoing reduction in tape rotation as we have discussed previously. The Western European segment had 0.3% of internal storage rental growth, having been impacted by the carry forward of certain contract negotiations that we mentioned on our last earnings call. In the Other International segment, we continue to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth of 11.6% and 6.9% respectively. Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and the costs that we have incurred so far to achieve synergies and integrate Recall with our business. Bill explained we remain on track to achieve the synergies in total, albeit we are getting there a bit faster. Our expectations of total cost to achieve synergies are still consistent with prior projections, $380 million and deal costs of $80 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur roughly $50 million in operating expenses, and $17 million in capital expenditures as we accelerate the cost savings programs. Year-to-date, Q3 we have incurred $103 million of integration in deal close costs and $7 million in capital expenditure. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q which will be filed later this week. Please note that these one-time items are excluded from our Adjusted OIBDA calculation. Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 and preliminary outlook for 2017 summarized on pages 10 and 11 of the supplemental. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged with consistent storage rental growth and accelerating growth in our International and Adjacent Businesses. In addition, our expectations for Recall's contribution and our standalone business contribution remain unchanged as seen in the table at the bottom of our guidance page. Our guidance is now on a reported dollar basis given foreign-exchange differences during the year have been small and this now serves as the baseline for our 2017 outlook. Further, we have updated our 2016 FFO guidance to adjust for the increases in income tax expense, amortization and interest. Our AFFO guidance remains unchanged at $610 million to $650 million reflecting savings we have identified in maintenance capital since the Recall acquisition, as well as non-real estate capital expenditures which were partially offset by increases in interest expense and cash taxes. However, we anticipate AFFO for the full year to come in above the midpoint of our guidance. Our interest expense for the year is higher than we originally assumed due to the timing and amount of divestiture proceeds as well as additional Recall integration related spend. AFFO continues to provide ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments. Given the higher interest in taxes than our original guidance, we expect Adjusted EPS to be near the low end of our guidance range for the year. Upon further review of Recall's real estate assets and overall systems requirements, we reduced our capital expenditure outlook, real estate and non-real estate maintenance as well as non-real estate investment by $25 million for 2016. The capital efficiency that is created by bringing the two businesses together is better than we had originally anticipated. Therefore, this is an elimination, not a deferral of spend. In addition, we reduced our real estate investments by $95 million driven mostly by delayed spending on lease conversions and certain real estate development as we make sure we take the time to optimize each market's needs and negotiate with landlords to consolidate facilities in light of the Recall transaction. Note that the reduction in real estate spend this year is not impacting our synergy or margin outlook or 2020 vision as we know that these types of investments take a period of time to stabilize. Distributions for the year will total around $500 million resulting in our dividend payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO consistent with our prior guidance under 80%, and becoming more aligned with REIT peers over time. Let's touch on our preliminary guidance for 2017 which is based on September 30 exchange rates. At a high level, this guidance is consistent with long-term expectations with slightly lower growth from acquisitions given our focus on Recall this year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect adjusted OIBDA to grow by 17% and AFFO to grow by 12% in 2017 compared with 2016. We'll provide more detail on capital allocation and other guidance for 2017 in February after we finalize prioritizing investments. We expect maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments to be approximately $170 million next year, together representing roughly 4.5% of revenue consistent with 2016. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we currently have liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.7 times as expected. In the short-term, given the timing of proceeds from the divestments, we expect to end the year at a leverage ratio around 5.8 times and to trend down from there in line with our 2020 vision. Lastly, we continue to focus on strengthening our debt structure through increasing exposure to long-term notes and shifting a greater percentage of our debt to foreign jurisdictions, which creates a natural currency hedge to mitigate translation exposure while also being tax efficient. In September, we raised CAD 250 million in senior notes at 5.375% due in 2023 and closed on a AUD 250 million dollar syndicated term loan B facility which matures in September 2022 and currently bears interest at 6.05%. Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the progress we have made integrating Recall and executing on our transformation program. Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our short term and long term financial projections. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our business and we are extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan and optimizing our costs. Before closing, I want to mention that I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the team here at Iron Mountain. And appreciate the passion that our teams in the field have to care for our customers. Their focus on moving the business forward during a major acquisition integration was evident in the performance this quarter. I continue to expand my knowledge of the Iron Mountain business and look forward to meeting with many of you in person over the coming months. With that I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Stuart. We are pleased with our underlying results as well as our progress with integrating Recall and at a high level we should think about it as we've issued 20% more shares to purchase Recall. In less than six months in on a Q3 to Q3 basis we have seen revenues up 26%, Adjusted OIBDA is up 29%, and AFFO is up 27%. All this has allowed us to increase our dividend per share by 13% and do this three months sooner than predicted. With that, I'd like to take questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, thanks, good morning. Now that more of your services business is project based, can you discuss how signings look for services and whether your signings trend support positive internal services revenue growth for full year 2016 and 2017? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Good morning, George. I think as we noticed what we expect is that service revenue for 2016 to be flat based on the pipeline that we've looked at, and then for 2017, we expect \u2013 we'll give you further guidance in February, but I think you can expect a slight improvement on 2017 based on what I see in the pipeline right now. But you're right, as we now have more and more is project based is we need to take that into effect as the core services decline as the business becomes more archival. But right now, I would say 2016 is going to be flat, in 2017 we expect \u2013 we'll give you more later in February, but I would expect that it's going to be a slight improvement on 2016. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And can you, as it relates to Recall, discuss some of the early realization of the synergies you saw in the quarter, and what aspects of the transaction helped allow for this early realization of synergies, and then whether there is potential for additional upside beyond what you already see? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: That was a good try George. But I think you know what I'm going to say about the upside. Because right now we're very pleased that we're getting it faster. I think we're \u2013 we still remain optimistic that there'll be upside as when we get into the real estate consolidation, but obviously that's a longer term. I think the biggest fuel to being able to get it faster, the answer was cultural. That when \u2013 you always \u2013 when you have a competitor across you, you always tend to think they are more different than yourself, but actually when we brought the two organizations, there was a lot of common understanding and common way of doing things. And the result of that was we were able to bring the teams together much faster, because especially these early synergies are mainly head count related. So let's say we weren't \u2013 we are not going deeper than we expected in terms of the head count reductions, but the speed at which we were able to align processes and then release people was much faster than we plan. So I would say it's probably that the key driver has been cultural. But let's say in terms of further upside is we still remain focused, but we think there is going to be further upside when we start consolidating the facilities, but that's more in the midterm rather than the near term. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Another thing \u2013 this is Stuart. Another thing I'd add quickly is that just our procurement teams have done a really great job going through and comparing contracts too at the better pricing and starting to capture that upside. Everything from facilities, management cost in the third party that we used to help us with that to the paper business. So there's a number of things they are working hard on. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Very helpful. And then lastly, can you elaborate any one time items you expect to impact FFO and AFFO in 2017? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I'll let Stuart answer that. As he highlighted, is FFO looks a little bit odd right now because of some of the onetime issues in terms of bringing the two companies together and especially some of the integration costs wasn't tax deductible. But I don't know, Stuart you may want to comment in terms of how FFO gets normalized or starts running in more of a clean fashion (36:29). Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. We're starting to get more of a regular run rate, right? You'll expect on a year-over-year basis for the year you'll continue to see some amortization impact. The tax rate as well. While this year there has been some normalization items, so we brought our FFO guidance down this year. A lot of this has been due to integration costs and how those have hit. So our guidance next year for FFO in flowing all the way down has got a tax rate around 17% or 19%, so that's the only thing that will get normalized. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: And the one thing \u2013 just to add is that I'm not saying that FFO doesn't matter, but the thing that in terms of driving that cash both to invest in the business and dividend growth is obviously AFFO is the main thing because it's the more pure thing that has purely focused on cash, because as Stuart pointed out on FFO, there are some non-cash items that don't get added back to FFO where they do you get added back to AFFO. So not saying that it's not important, but the cleaner measure in terms of cash generation of the business going forward is for sure, especially the way our business operates is the AFFO metric. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. Bill, what's going on with the North American Data Management Services line that was down 11.3% year-over-year last quarter, it was down 10.3%? We had a discussion about some tough comp on project related revenue. It seems to have worsened a little bit this quarter. What's the story behind that? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Good morning, Shlomo. So actually it's pretty much consistent with what we've said. I think I've always said on the calls for the last, I would say few quarters that it's really the transportation and I'd say that's generally down between high single digits, low double digits in terms of revenue. So it's continuing \u2013 we've continued to see the trend. As I said before, I think on a couple calls ago, we see a kind of a flattening out of that archival drop in transportation when we look at the paper storage business or the record storage side of the business, but in the data management, it's still a little bit lagging that transition into becoming more about backup and recovery rather than rotating the tape. So \u2013 and we still aren't declaring a bottom. So if you say going forward, I'd still expect that we're going to see transportation declines in the tape business still in the high single digit, low double digit level, so it's really \u2013 it's not the projects that are driving that. It's the transportation decline. So I mean the good news if you look at the storage, as we said that the storage, both on a revenue and a volume basis, if you look at revenue quarter-on-quarter, we're up a little over 2%. If you look at a trailing 12 months in terms of volume, we're up 2%, and to keep in mind is if we look at the margins of the business and the profitability of the business, whilst I think services is important, it's first the most important in terms of differentiating our storage product because that's where we build the reliability in and through the robustness of our transportation, but the part that's driving the cash in the business, we continue to be pleased with. But if you're asking me just specific on transportation, I have to say that I expect it to continue to decline in the high single, low double digits for a few more quarters because we still seem to be behind the transition that we've pretty much worked most of the way through on the records management side. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I thought that that is true, but you typically get a certain amount of project related revenue and that helps offset it and you had a particularly strong project-related revenue quarter in 2Q 2015. And that's what made it tough to comp on that on 2Q 2016? Was I just misunderstanding how that was going through? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, no, you're right because it was kind of mid single digit decline, I think in the quarter that you're referring to, Shlomo, so you've got a very good memory. I think that specifically we do see \u2013 if you look at, especially in our film and sound, this includes our film and sound business, is we do have specific projects with some of the studios that rotate in and rotate out, and whilst it does drive the top line in terms of the revenue, again, if you come down to in terms of \u2013 if you backup and say, you see even though that we've lost that project which so you're now seeing kind of raw more the transportation decline and you see in some quarters, it hasn't affected our ability in terms of driving overall profit growth. But you're right, we do see those \u2013 and those typically, I'm not saying all, but most of those lumpy projects come in our film and sound unit. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then can you \u2013 maybe this is a question for Stuart, can you talk about the specific items that resulted in the FFO guidance, just go through them like one-by-one into it, what change from last quarter of \u2013 for 2016? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes, it's pretty simple really. So, if you look at the change in guidance which on a total dollars basis is about $80 million or at the midpoint on FFO was about $0.35, you get the biggest piece of it's tax expense and it's really about half of it, and the reason for that is that the integration costs out of Recall are really hitting in the REIT subsidiary, so you're not getting any tax benefit from those and that is different from what we had originally assumed. You've got about a third of it is coming from the amortization of customer intangibles, right, that's really came out of purchase accounting and as we finalize purchase accounting, I'll point out that that's not in cash, so that you get that added back in AFFO. So that's about a third of it. And the last piece of it is really interest expense and that's the rest of it and that's really the timing as we talked about the divestment proceeds and a little bit lower proceeds from that on a cash basis. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So is it half from the first part of the integration of Recall cost or being in the REIT as opposed to not lowering the tax rate outside of the REIT? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. Yes. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And I guess is that something that flows through in 2017 as well or is that something that we're kind of in since most of this has been actioned this year? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It mostly will hit this year. There'll be a little bit next year. But next year we'll have it built into our \u2013 into the tax expectations in the guidance. We got that built in now, how that's going to flow through. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the amortization of customer intangibles, hits the FFO, but not the AFFO because it gets added back. Is that the right way to understand it? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then the interest expense will hit both of them, right? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's just higher interest expense. Okay. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Why did the out-perms in other international step down, if you look at those bar charts that you give for storage, if you look at other international looks like 2Q 2016 minus 3.7, 3Q minus 4.5 what's going on over there? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think we've \u2013 if you remember, we talked about there is a specific customer that we have in Other International that was going through a specific kind of \u2013 I would say a legacy destruction project. So you see that kind of still flushing through. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Do you know when does that end, so we could start \u2013 we'd start to see the trend going the other way? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think we've been calling it out now for about three quarters, so I think we've got now one or two more quarters because it's a trailing 12 months, so you have to kind of see the 12 months. We can go back and check. But I think we've been calling it out for about three quarters, so you probably got one more quarter to kind of flush that through. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then what was the impact of the U.K. pound on the 2007 OIBDA guidance? Year-over-year....? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: You mean \u2013 You're asking the Marmite question, Shlomo? Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The what question? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The Marmite question. I don't know if you follow in the U.K. they're talking about the price of Marmite. So, right now it hasn't had a big impact to date because it's more of a translation issue. You're right, it does show up in our numbers, but it's a translation issue only at once you get to the profit numbers. So we don't have the double whammy that some companies have where they have a manufacturing cost issue that they are selling into the U.K., and then they have the translation issue. So that being said, we are sensitive to the translation issue, but right now you don't see a major impact in the numbers. And we've built that in going into our guidance for 2017. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So is it fair to assume somewhere between 6% and 7% of revenue is U.K. pound and that just kind of drops down in the translation, either up or down depending on what's going on? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Actually not quite because when you go through the P&L, you remember when we had FX going against us for so many quarters over the past couple years, right. If you go from the top line, you start getting a dampening as you go down through the P&L, because we actually have costs in that local market that get absorbed that are also lower when you translate it. So it's a little bit less. You're right to think about it as kind of a start point, but it actually gets mitigated. I don't know Stuart if you want to talk a little bit more detail about it. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. When the Q gets published there is a line by line of all the currency changes, remember. And some of that currency change gets offset by the strengthening in Canada and some of the other currencies. So the net effect is not as big as you may think it is of that current, as it flows through the full P&L, but in the Q, we'll detail that out specifically. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi Stuart, you made a passing comment. And it was actually too quick for me, about CapEx for 2017. I think you referenced part of CapEx for 2016 and said it was about 4.5% of revenue. You said it might be the same next year. I assume you're talking about maintenance CapEx, so if you could just kind of bring us together on what you're willing to say about 2017 CapEx at this point. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. So, maintenance CapEx and non-real estate investments will be about $170 million, we've got built into guidance right now and again, we'll finalize that and update it in February if we need to. And so, total, together, is about 4.5% of revenue. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Okay. And your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittman with Robert W. Baird. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, great. So, I guess, my question, in North America, it looks like we had a little consecutive, or quarter-over-quarter acceleration in volumes, organic growth and that's all great, and you highlighted that. Could you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of some of the dynamics in the marketplace that are leading to a little bit better than last quarter's growth rates? Is it just \u2013 was it distraction maybe from integration, and now you're better integrated and can focus more? But some of your commentary around that, I think, would be helpful. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, I think you have to \u2013 good morning, Andy. I think that you have to kind of see the overall trend. If you go back kind of three years ago, right, I think we've been going at steady march forward. And I'm saying on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you can see some noise, like in any business, but if you think it on an annual to annual basis as we continue to march forward \u2013 and I think we're one of the largest implementers of salesforce.com. I think we've got the salesforce much more organized and aligned. We did the big organization three years ago. That's starting to bear fruit. And as you know, as being a long observer of this business, nothing happens fast, but you have to put certain foundations and building blocks. So, my \u2013 I wouldn't say it's any one thing. I think a lot of it goes back to what we did. And I wouldn't say last quarter's performance was because of noise of Recall. It's just that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it does move around. But we're starting to see that whilst this isn't a high-growth business, there is still growth to be achieved which I know is counterintuitive, but I think this business will be running longer than the iPhone franchise, right. I mean, I know a lot of people in their stomach don't believe that, but if you look at the results, we continue to drive positive organic growth out of the business. And I think the new organization gets better and better every quarter of doing that. I'm not saying the sky's the limit, but I would continue \u2013 we continue to expect to get more out of even the developed markets on an organic basis going forward, albeit these are small incremental improvements, not large swings. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Then just \u2013 okay maybe another way to dovetail to that question is just with the integration of the two large global players, have you seen any competitive response from the competition, maybe the trends and the outlook for pricing, in particular, for national accounts? Can you talk about how those things have maybe changed since the closing of the deal? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, we don't think about pricing in isolation. What I do feel, I talked about it a little bit on my call \u2013 in my script, or when I was going through my remarks saying that innovation is an important part. And one of the things bringing the two organizations together, it gives us not only a larger customer base, but it gives us more capacity to innovate, and that innovation resonates with our customers. What we're finding, especially for the regulated customers that have to worry about compliance in so many different jurisdictions, the fact that we can give them better solutions around information governance is a differentiating factor. And you can say, do they pay for the product, or do they pay more for the storage? And sometimes, it's built up in the storage cost or pricing and sometimes it's built up in the product, but what we do find is that the world is getting more complex, especially for the heavily regulated industries. And bringing the two companies together does give us more economies of scale to do that kind of R&D, and that is resonating with customers. So I wouldn't \u2013 I think that's the way I think about the power of bringing the two companies together. It just gives us a deeper pool, if you will, to innovate around. And that \u2013 and so far, it's early days, but I've spent a fair amount of time in \u2013 with different customers. We had a top financial service customer forum in Louisiana in June. I just came back from one in Europe a couple weeks ago. And there's even more excitement that I'm hearing from our large customers about bringing the two companies together rather than less, because they're expecting even more in the way of innovation. The other thing I would highlight is it's early days, but I also expect we've reorganized the North American sales force again a little bit in light of bringing Recall in. They were, as I said, much better at running after the middle market, which is a higher-margin segment. And a lot of it is unvended, and we haven't been as present there as Iron Mountain, whereas Recall was more present. And so now the head of North American sales is the person from Recall, who's driving the charge, not just in terms of our traditional segment in the enterprise, but he also has two new leaders that are helping drive more penetration into the middle market, which we expect over time to start coming through. It's early days, you don't see that in the numbers today, but I would expect to see an improvement in those areas. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. I'll leave it there. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Can you give us more color on why the proceeds you're expecting to receive from your dispositions are coming in below your previous expectations? And can you tell us what \u2013 just update us on what the OIBDA multiple is that you're selling those businesses at today? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. Good morning, Karin. So I think that the \u2013 when you get into the \u2013 and you can probably appreciate I'm not going to give you probably as much detail as you want because of the confidential nature when you're dealing with both commercial parties, but also the different regulating authorities. But I think it's much \u2013 there is certain science about it. I mean, we had certain requirements that we have to hit, but when you actually start negotiating with sellers, each seller -each buyer, rather, I should say, has different parameters that they're interested in. And lining that up, that makes sense for the regulator and makes sense for us commercially is something that we work through. So, I think, the \u2013 hence my comment is that we're lighter on cash that we're getting from these dispositions, but we're quite pleased in terms of where we're coming out commercially. So, I think, everybody wins on those things. So, I think, that's about all I can \u2013 I think you can probably appreciate that's all I can say given the confidential nature of these discussions. But I think it's a good platform. And you can see that in our guidance for next year. In other words, we're not taking down guidance for next year, because we ended up lighter on cash. And we still believe that we'll get to the leverage numbers that we expect. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Is it just that the size of the businesses that you're selling is changing, or is it that the valuation is different than what you originally expected? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think I'm just going to leave it there, Karin. I mean, I think you can probably... Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...appreciate. But I think the best way to unpack it is if you look at the guidance we're giving for 2017 and beyond, as you say, I wouldn't even say it's noise in terms of our \u2013 you don't see a blip in terms of where we're going to end up in 2017. You definitely don't see any change in terms of where we're going to end up in 2020. So, I think, it's \u2013 these are \u2013 you think about NPV calculations, these are kind of trade-offs that you make between cash today, platforms, et cetera. So, I think, it's \u2013 we're comfortable where we came out. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. My second question is just regarding the line balance. Excuse me, it was $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Can you just update us where it stands today? And Stuart, I think, you mentioned plans to do more debt fixing in 2017. Can you just give us your thoughts on where you think is appropriate for the line balance to be on an ongoing basis? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah total \u2013 I don't have the line balance with me. Total liquidity right about now is about $1.1 billion. You got to remember, we did one of the debt offerings right at the very end of the quarter, so we had the cash sitting on the balance sheet and has not paid off the credit facility. And then in addition, in October, we did the $50 million mortgage notes, so that brought down the balance as well. Sitting sort of fixed to floating, we call it, 74% today, we're continuing to sort of evaluate where we are in the cycle. I think, over time, you'll see us stay in the 70% to 80% range. My personal view would be to try to continue to push that up a little bit, given where the world is today. But we're right in the middle of what our target range is. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: But I think one thing Karin, just to keep in mind on that is we've gone from \u2013 the thing that I think is amazing in terms of the way that the debt markets have gotten the Iron Mountain story is we've gone from 68% to 74% fixed, and at the same time, we've taken our cost of debt \u2013 I mean, Stuart correct me, but I think it's down by about 80 bps or 90 bps in terms of the average cost of debt. We're now at 5.1%. And before we did this latest refinancing that fixed even more of our debt, we were at 5.8%, 5.9%. So, to me, it's an interesting reflection that the debt markets definitely get the durability of Iron Mountain's business, and they're rewarding for it. So, if you think about where we are now, it's in a \u2013 we're in a much sweeter spot. Not that we're in a bad spot before, but we're in a \u2013 even a stronger spot in terms of the debt markets than we were a few months ago. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. I mean just compared to the end of last quarter, our average interest rate is basically flat despite fixing all that debt and terming it out, so. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks Karin. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ...squeezing me back in. Just I'm trying to understand the difference between the FFO guidance last quarter and this quarter. I mean, I understand you're not going to include additional interest expense of debt due to future offerings. But wasn't the accelerated customer relationship intangibles known last quarter? And also, the costs coming out in the REIT subsidiary versus non-REIT subsidiary, is that something that's truly accounting? I mean, won't you understand that, that's really coming out in the U.S. versus some of the international geographies are really coming out in the areas that you had identified from beforehand? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Let me answer \u2013 I'll let Stuart address in terms of the intangibles flow through, but I think just specifically your question on the tax and where that flows through, I think you can kind of appreciate, when we knew the number of heads that came up \u2013 because the diligence on a public company is different than the diligence on a private company, so we had pretty clear view, and you can see that in terms of our improvement on AFFO of where we were actually getting the restructuring savings. The issue is, and it's specifically in the U.S., right, because that's where we have the tax deductibility or non-tax deductibility, depending on if it's in the QRS or the TRS or the qualified REIT subsidiary or the non-qualified subsidiary is when we got into the U.S., a lot of the cost savings were in the part of Recall that would be in terms of the qualified REIT subsidiary. And that was where we didn't get the deductibility. It doesn't affect international, because although we do have split between qualified in non-qualified subsidiaries, you remember that internationally we get fully taxed in those local entities, because the U.S. REIT rules don't apply. It's important in terms of the way we repatriate money back into the United States for dividends, but it's not important in the local tax scheme. So, it's specifically a U.S. situation. And as we finished the restructuring, I'd say, there'll be a little bit more of that next year. And that's built into our guidance, because we now have clear view of what the restructuring is left that's in the qualified REIT subsidiary versus not, so we know where the tax deductibility is. But I think you can probably appreciate when you're buying a public company trying to have that level of detail until you actually get into the restructuring, that's where you get into the tax deductibility. But you think about it in terms of the ability, whilst cash taxes does affect AFFO as well, we're starting to actually get through those one-time restructuring charges, then we're still in line with what we think the total cost of the integration project is. But I know \u2013 Stuart, you may want to talk about the intangibles. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah \u2013 no. The customer intangibles as well that was something that was highly influx last quarter, so we were \u2013 it started to flow through in the second quarter, but we were still between that and the racking in the lives of the assets and things like that. We're still working through a lot of those valuations, so we've not fully flowed that through our forecast for the rest of the year. So, could we have forecasted better? Maybe, but it's getting updated now. The other thing I'd point out though to, as we've gone through and clean up and reconciled these things, I'm going to turn to AFFO for a second is if you go back and look at second quarter AFFO, we actually had understated that by around $10 million. That's because we had a \u2013 for Mexico REIT subsidiary, we had some onetime tax \u2013 integration cost or tax that we had to pay to restructure that entity. Those costs had actually been accrued as part of purchase accounting, never went through the P&L. Because it was a cash tax payment, it has actually gotten picked up as a reduction of the FFO last quarter, but it was one time in nature. Those are the types of things we exclude. So, if you go back and look at second quarter, AFFO was actually better and our trends, and that's one of things we talked about, AFFO guidance being above the midpoint for the year. That gives us comfort. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I'm going to take the other stuff off-line. Thank you very much. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Shlomo. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Operator, I think we are all set. Operator : Okay. And at this time, there are no audio questions. I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. Now, just thank you. Appreciate everybody joining us this morning. And wish you all \u2013 as we start into the holiday season, a good holiday season. So, have a good day. Operator : And at this time, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting a solid fourth quarter and full year results for 2016. Before I discuss in more detail our results, I want to point out that both the quarter and the year witnessed major progress on continuing as well as enhancing the durability of our business. This has been marked by continued strong internal volume and revenue growth before all acquisitions in our developed or mature markets. Moreover, we further extended our business model into the faster and higher growth emerging markets. Additionally, we continue to building on our brand and reputation, serving 940 of the Fortune 1000 companies through our growth and expansion in Adjacent Businesses. A major support to all three pillars of durability has been the transformative nature of the Recall acquisition where we are ahead of plan in most areas. This transformative acquisition is having a major impact on both the financial and strategic goals of our company. Turning to a more detailed overview of our progress in these areas, total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core storage fundamentals were in line with our expectations, both on an internal and total basis. Notably, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded more than 50 basis points, a sequential improvement over Q3, reflecting continued margin expansion as a result of Recall acquisition synergies and our Transformation Initiative, whilst integrating the historically lower margin Recall business. We also achieved storage internal revenue growth in Q4 of nearly 3%, internal volume growth was also positive in all storage segments and averaged 1.7% for the quarter. New volume from existing customers of more than 30 million cubic feet was consistent with the past few years, demonstrating the consistency of customer behavior related to storage of new regulatory and legal documents. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration related activity. Stuart will have more shortly on our updated guidance for the year, which reflects consistent performance, expectations for the core business fundamentals, continued strong growth in high-single to low-double digits on an internal basis in our Adjacent Businesses and our Other International segment, which excludes Australia, updated foreign exchange expectations, the expected impact from the reinvestment of some Transformation savings into innovation and further efficiency initiatives, and our expected cash available to support distributions and growth investment. Returning to our overall summary, slide 4 is a quick review of progress against our 2020 strategic plan during the year. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we continued to drive positive storage rental internal growth for the year with 1.9 million cubic feet of internal volume growth on a trailing 12-month basis. In terms of our progress of expanding our business model into faster growing emerging markets, we are just shy of 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, a major improvement over 10% just three years ago. Year-over-year progress was also supported by our other transactions in four additional new countries. In addition, we acquired tuck-in businesses in existing markets in Western and Eastern Europe that strengthened our market positions there. In Adjacent Businesses, we achieved strong topline growth in our data center business where we continued to see attractive complementary opportunities. In October, we broke ground on our 80-acre site in Northern Virginia, which remains one of the strongest data center markets in the country. We expect to bring the first of four buildings online in the third quarter, and once fully built out, this site will more than quadruple our existing capacity. Whilst the construction is under way, we continue to see good momentum and are managing the development of new space in our underground data center in Boyers, Pennsylvania, to address both new customer demand as well as growth from existing customers. Between our Boston facility and the underground data centers in Boyers and Kansas City, we continue to see internal growth in excess of 20% in this business area, albeit off a relatively small base. We also solidified our leadership position in art storage with two tuck-ins during the year, Fairfield and Cirkers. We continue to see opportunities for consolidation in this storage market segment. Combining expansion in both Emerging Markets as well as Adjacent Businesses, we made good progress in 2016 with shifting our revenue mix in line with our 2020 plan goals as you can see on slide 5. As we noted in the past, we have an objective to reach 25% of total revenues from our higher growth portfolio. Supported by the acquisition of Recall, we are now quite close to 20% of our mix coming from these businesses. As I mentioned, our guidance includes M&A and near double-digit organic growth to support this transition, both in Emerging Markets as well as in Adjacent Businesses. As this shift progresses, we expect to see faster EBITDA growth and expansion in ROIC. Turning to progress on the benefits from Recall integration on slide 6, as we noted last quarter, we've gotten off to a great start with integrating Recall's business and implementing actions that enabled us to achieve synergies faster than our original expectations. The integration has gone well. Our cultures were similar, thus enabling us to quickly combine teams and advancing number of objectives that were key to achieving the synergies. As you can see, the financial impact is flowing through very strongly, and we are early in seeing some of the potential for further benefit in having by far the leading global platform. Our guidance assumes $80 million of net synergies to be realized in 2017, and roughly $65 million of that was included in our 2016 exit rate. Overall, when combined with the $100 million of cumulative benefits from our total $125 million Transformation Program, we expect to generate a $180 million of combined savings impact for 2017, with roughly $20 million of that to be reinvested into innovation and shared service efficiency programs. I'll have more on that shortly. Turning to Transformation on slide 7, when we started this effort in mid-2015, our three decades of acquisitions had left us with overly complex reporting structures, overlapping teams and processes and overhead costs that had ballooned to more than 28% of sales. That was four to five percentage points higher than most companies our size and breadth. So, we committed to further reduce our overhead by 2018 into transformed teams and processes to enable us to work faster and more efficiently. We've made a lot of good progress to-date entering 2017 with our overhead as a percentage of sales including Recall at just under 25%, and excluding Recall at 24%. We have plans to derive this next $25 million of Transformation benefit from moving to a new model for delivering HR, finance, and IT functions. Moving forward, each of these functions will leverage best-in-class shared service providers to scale their service to our business partners around the world. Doing so allows us to retain cash for reinvestment and dividends without compromising our goal of having global excellence or centers-of-excellence. For example, the transformation of our finance function will include implementing a single finance system across the world to improve the consistency of our reporting and processes. Similarly, the HR team's globalization effort will include implementing a standard people management system across the business. These shifts will require an investment this year that will slightly exceed the in-year benefits of our Transformation Program, which is reflected in our guidance. We expect this work to take the better part of this year with timelines varying by function and country. Stuart will have more in a few minutes on the impact of this on 2017 guidance. The pace of our progress in Integration and Transformation can be seen in the year-over-year comparisons of financial performance on slide 8. Whilst the weighted average increase in our shares outstanding for 2016 relative to 2015 is roughly 16.5%, our growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO exceed the growth in share count. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 13% in the fourth quarter so the majority of this improvement is going directly to shareholders without compromising future growth. Switching gears for a moment on slide 9, we've all seen the linkage between rising interest rates and REIT public market valuations. And cycles have shown in the past that rising interest rates and rising inflation often go hand in hand. Given that we are a real estate company generating the majority of our profits from rental related activity, we believe we are unique among REITs in our ability to pass through inflation in the form of upward-only CPI type escalators in our contracts. As our storage gross margins are 75%, the CPI escalators on our rental income have a positive and compound effect on margins, especially during periods of high inflation. Additionally, when we do have the opportunity to leverage inflation, it happens more quickly than for a typical REIT as we have shorter duration storage rental contracts on average of three years for large customers and one year for small customers, which allows for more timely price adjustments. Furthermore, a portion of our customers have auto renewal contracts for which we implement quarterly pricing contracts or changes on a rolling basis that are tied to CPI. And I would note that the shorter term rental contracts are balanced against our average box age of 15 years coupled with 98% customer retention. So, the average customer stays with us for 50 years, supporting durability of the rental income stream. In terms of rising interest rates, we don't generally see an impact on customer storage requirements and the net operating income we derive from storage related activities doesn't change if the market value of the underlying real estate fluctuates. Our storage internal revenue growth has less variability than the same-store NOI and other real estate sub-sectors as we demonstrated during the great financial crisis or GFC. Lastly, effective control of real estate through long term leases with multiple extension options means we aren't as impacted by fluctuations in the value of underlying real estate. Before I turn the call over to Stuart, I'd like to say a few words of how we think about investing in new products and innovation. You may have seen our news a couple weeks ago that Fidelma Russo will join us as Chief Technology Officer in mid March. We are very excited to have Fidelma coming on board from Dell EMC, where she served as Senior Vice President and General Manager for the technology company's Enterprise Storage and Software business, one of the largest units of the EMC business. This is a new position that we're creating to respond to our customers who are increasingly asking us for enhanced solutions to their needs around information storage and data extraction. In a sentence, our innovation efforts are focused on customer solutions and processes that can further strengthen our differentiation and support growth in service and storage. We have discussed some of these items previously and look forward to sharing more of these with you at Investor Day on the April 20. Fidelma will build upon the strong momentum established by our existing technology team lead by Tasos Tsolakis. I'd like to thank Tasos for all he's done for our company over the years. Tasos transformed our IT function into a strategic enabler for the business. And over the last several years, he led our business improvement initiatives, most recently being the integration of Recall and our Transformation Program. Tasos has delivered enormous value in his time here and he leaves behind a highly capable team. We thank Tasos for his contributions and we wish him continued success in his future endeavors. In summary, 2016 was a very good year with solid execution on all three pillars of our strategic plan as well as closing and successfully integrating Recall, making Iron Mountain the most global of information management companies. All of these accomplishments in the near term support increased sustainable cash flow and our ability to grow the dividend consistently, whilst continuing to de-lever, and even more importantly, longer term, they provide us with an enhanced strategic position. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be reporting on another strong quarter and the continued success of our operations team to grow our customer base and control costs. Before diving into the details, let me first quickly cover a couple of administrative items. To simplify our reporting, we have made certain terminology and definition changes. First, we are no longer using the term adjusted OIBDA and have replaced it with adjusted EBITDA. It's purely a terminology change. The measurement itself and historical numbers remain the same. EBITDA is easier for me to pronounce and simpler for new investors following the company. Second, we tweaked our future AFFO definition. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we will eliminate the deduction of discretionary growth capital, which we refer to as innovation investment as well as add back all depreciation and amortization, which will be more consistent with how other REITs treat certain non-cash adjustments. More detailed explanations of these changes are on slide 17 of this presentation. Let's now turn to results. Our 2016 performance was generally in line with expectations as a result of the tremendous effort by the organization to successfully integrate Recall while delivering on our Transformation Initiative as Bill discussed. Before diving into the details, let me walk you through the key financial results of the quarter. First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.9% excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions. This is up from 2.1% in the third quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Second, we very effectively enhanced our profitability. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved to 31.7% with storage and service gross margin improvement, reflecting benefits from both Transformation and Recall synergies. Third, the integration of Recall continued on track, and we entered 2017 with a $65 million annual run rate of net synergies toward our target of $80 million to be realized in the year. Now, let me quickly review our full year 2016 results compared to our guidance on slide 10. Both on a reported dollar basis and on a 2016 constant dollar basis, performance was generally within the ranges of our guidance. The 2016 constant dollar budget rate was set in January 2016 and currency changes had a minor positive benefit in our reported results compared to budgeted rates. Revenue both on a reported basis and a 2016 constant dollar basis was squarely within guidance. AFFO came at the high end of our expectations as we leveraged our scale and optimized our capital expenditures. Approximately 80% of the capital expenditure reductions were permanent as we implemented more cost effective solutions or eliminated spending, while the remainder was deferred into 2017. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted EBITDA was within our range despite the lower overall profitability of the legacy Recall business. As we mentioned on prior calls, pre-acquisition, Recall had a lower margin profile compared to Iron Mountain's base business. Going forward, we continue to believe that we can optimize the legacy Recall business and bring it in line with our profitability levels. Adjusted EPS for the full year came in slightly below our guidance range due primarily to real estate depreciation, which does not impact FFO or AFFO being non-cash. Re-negotiations of several legacy Recall leases resulted in shorter asset lives than expected. Therefore, real estate depreciation was higher than anticipated. Let's now turn to slide 11 which shows our key financial metrics. Fourth quarter top-line growth of 24.2% was driven by acquisitions and strong internal storage revenue growth, slightly offset by foreign exchange headwinds compared to a year ago. The fourth quarter total revenue growth rate was slightly lower than the third quarter, reflecting divestitures. The internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter of 2.9% was driven primarily by net internal records management volume growth of 1.7%. Internal volume growth was positive in all of our major markets. Service revenues increased 24.8% in the fourth quarter, but declined 0.9% on an internal basis primarily due to declines in transportation and handling activities as well as Western European service projects. As we've highlighted in previous calls, service business growth rates can fluctuate as on a relatively small basis and our mix is shifting towards more project-based revenues. We continue to focus on sustaining and gradually improving gross profits as services are complementary to our core records management and data storage businesses. The growth in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was driven by top line growth and acquisition benefits. In addition, we continued to benefit from our Transformation Initiative and Recall synergies. As a result, we've improved our adjusted EBITDA margins sequentially and year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins improved from the third quarter by 50 basis points to 31.7%. Year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 10 basis points as we effectively leveraged SG&A costs despite headwinds from Recall's lower gross profit margin. The total gross profit margin continued to trend positively from Q3 as we realized Recall synergies and optimized operations. Compared to a year ago, the fourth quarter gross margin declined due to the mix of Recall's lower margins. Recall's gross margins as we've highlighted had higher rent expense, as pre-acquisition, at least close to 90% of their facilities. However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies to more than offset this gross margin decline resulting in the expansion of adjusted EBITDA margins. Let's turn quickly to slide 12 to cover financial performance by segment for the quarter. Before speaking to specific performance, it's important to understand the relative size of each segment and its contribution to the results. The pie chart on this slide shows the relative size of revenue to each business segment, split by storage and service. Storage provided more than 80% of our fourth quarter adjusted gross profit, while service provided less than 20%. While we continue to innovate on new service offerings for our customers, it is important to keep in mind the impact of service declines and increases. For example, North American data management service revenues are less than 4% of total revenues, so the overall North America data management business continues to be highly profitable with increasing margins. In North America records and information management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue growth continued to be strong. This performance was driven by price improvement and volume growth. The improvement we saw in the North American internal service revenue was partly driven by the on-boarding of a large retail customer in the shred business for whom we began providing ongoing destruction services in over 10,000 locations. In North America data management, we saw strong internal storage rental growth revenue of 3%, reflecting an improvement from the third quarter. However, service internal growth declined due to the ongoing reduction of tape rotation as we discussed previously. The adjusted EBITDA margin in North America DM increased over last year to 54.4%. The internal storage rental revenue growth in Western Europe has also improved from the third quarter. However, revenues were impacted by certain contract renegotiations that we mentioned on prior earnings calls. The Western European adjusted EBITDA margin declined year-over-year due to Recall's lower margin business, overhead costs which are not yet fully synergized and a reduction in service project revenue compared to a year ago. In the Other International segment, which now includes the larger legacy Recall Australian business, we continued to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth and improving margins. Before turning to our outlook for 2017, let me quickly touch on the composition of our global business. The first two pie charts on slide 13 reflect our revenue and adjusted EBITDA composition by U.S. dollar and other currencies based on fourth quarter results, which includes Recall's more global business. As you can see, roughly 60% of worldwide revenues are generated in the U.S., and importantly close to 70% of adjusted EBITDA is in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations may be more muted on adjusted EBITDA than many realize. Also, we have matched our foreign-denominated debt to create natural currency hedges to mitigate translation exposure, while also being tax efficient. As of year-end, 23% of our debt was in non-U.S. currencies. Let's turn to guidance for 2017 as summarized on page 14 of the deck. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged. We expect storage rental growth of 2% to 2.5% and solid growth in our emerging markets and adjacent businesses. We refined 2017 guidance from our preliminary outlook presented in November due to negative currency impacts and finalizing our back-office shared service initiatives and innovation-related plans. Our guidance is now based on 2017 constant dollar budget rates, which reflects and holds constant January 2017 exchange rates. Next year, we plan to issue initial guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings call consistent with many of our peers. Our 2017 guidance also reflects the full-year impact of divestitures of legacy Iron Mountain businesses in Australia and Canada, which represent a full-year impact of approximately $47 million in revenues. Please note that 2017 guidance excludes Recall integration cost of approximately $135 million. For full-year 2017, at the midpoint, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5% with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding about 200 basis points to around 33%. We remain confident with the Recall synergy expectations as we continue to successfully integrate the two businesses. Further, our guidance assumes we invest about $20 million in operating costs associated with innovation initiatives and global shared services programs that Bill mentioned. So not all of the savings from our Transformation program will flow through to the bottom line. These extra costs are expected to disproportionately hit the first quarter given our kickoff of the shared service programs. Please note that due to the rapid integration with Recall, it is difficult to isolate integration benefits from Transformation benefits, so we'll be reporting these benefits together through the improvement in our overall adjusted EBITDA margins. Also, I'd like to point out that we will no longer be guiding to FFO as we believe AFFO is more representative of the cash generation characteristics of our operating businesses and provides a better measure for dividend coverage. In 2017, AFFO is expected to grow by 11.5% at the midpoint compared to 2016 supporting our dividend growth. Included in AFFO is the expectation that maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments will be between $150 million and $170 million. Regarding allocation of capital to real estate ownership, we plan on optimizing our real estate portfolio through capital recycling. This means funding purchases through selling buildings in non-strategic locations while cap rates are at near all-time lows, and using the proceeds to purchase properties in more strategic locations. These types of programs enable us to take advantage of market pricing opportunities, enhance our utilization, and ensure we own properties in key markets. Our strategy remains to invest where the value creation is most compelling and reflects the best use of capital which generates the highest returns. Our guidance also assumes that we invest $160 million to $180 million in business acquisitions and acquisitions of customer relationships primarily building market share as we consolidate in our emerging markets. Turning to slide 15 and our cash available for distribution and investments, or CAD; for 2017, we expect CAD to cover our anticipated full-year dividend, required capital expenditures, core growth racking, and a portion of our discretionary investments. As a result, inherent in our guidance is an assumption that we would have approximately $125 million of capital available after funding the dividend to support core growth racking and other discretionary value-creating investments, and require $200 million of external funding for the remainder excluding Recall costs. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we had liquidity of nearly $1 billion at year-end and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.7 times, which was in line with expectations. In the short-term, given the timing and proceeds of divestitures and investments related to innovation and shared services, we expect our leverage ratio to remain above long-term targeted levels and then trend down as we fully realize the synergies and Transformation benefits and continue internal growth. Overall, we are pleased with our 2016 performance and with the progress we've made integrating Recall and executing on Transformation. Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for the year. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our high-margin storage rental business, and we're extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan, including capitalizing on value-creating growth investments and optimizing our costs and capital expenditures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before Q&A. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Stuart. And before opening up for Q&A, I'd like to reiterate that we are pleased with our performance in what was a very eventful yet positive year for the company. We successfully integrated Recall. We achieved strong performance in the business with solid operating fundamentals, and are excited by further opportunities in both emerging markets and the adjacent business area. Our guidance for this year calls for solid gains in revenue, EBITDA, and AFFO, and that we expect will drive durable cash flow to support investment for both long-term growth as well as consistent increases in our quarterly dividend in line with our earlier expectations. We look forward to updating you on our multiyear plan at our upcoming Investor Day on April 20. With that, operator, I'd like to open up to questions please. Operator : Thank you, sir. And your first question will be from Kevin McVeigh of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. Great job on the quarter. Hey, the internal growth's really strong at 2.9% bringing the full-year to 2.3%. Wanted to figure out how Recall factors into that. And then I know it's not included in. When it does, is that what kind of causes the range of 2% to 2.5% for 2017 appreciating. It's up from 2.3% for 2016 overall, but is 2% to 2.5%, how do we think about that relative to the 2.9% you put up in Q4 and again really nice job there. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Kevin, and welcome back. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Great to be back. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So you've got it right on the head, Kevin. So, basically, just to be clear, the internal growth is calculated on excluding Recall, right. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So it is purely internal growth. But, at the same time, it's including as the business has gone through the course of the year, it's including internal growth on the acquired portion of the Recall business. So that's why we're guiding next year for the 2%, 2.5% because the denominator will change in terms of that calculation. So you're right, it's very strong performance in the growth in the fourth quarter, but the denominator will change slightly in terms of the calculation going into 2017. So the guidance range is between 2%, 2.5%. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. That's super helpful. And then in terms of how should we think about overall CapEx with maintenance being kind of $150 million to $170 million, as we think about the business overall, are we getting to a point where the total percentage starts to come down as you become more efficient in consolidation and things like that? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Hey, Kevin, this is Stuart. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Stuart. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, over time it will. We still in 2017 will have a little bit I'll call it of above-average run rate. Some of that's just due to the maintenance that we've got on some of the Recall facilities that are flowing through in 2016 and 2017 and then after that it should be trending down. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Awesome. And thanks again, congrats. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. It's Andrew. I think you zipped through North America RIM storage number real quick. 1.9% growth for the quarter and 1% for the year really is kind of a record level of growth for that segment. It might sound glacial, but you haven't done 1% organic in North America in RIM storage since 2012, and so just it feels like there's some momentum in that business. Do you agree with that assessment? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, look, I think \u2013 good morning, Andrew. I think it is a fair \u2013 you probably know, I'm kind of always a glass-is-half-empty person focusing on what we have to do rather than what we've done. But, no, I think the North American team has made some really good progress, both on the volume side and on the pricing side, so I think it's starting to flow through. But there's always more that we can do, but I think you're right. I think they've done a nice job. And as you know, nothing happens really fast in this business. In fairness, it's not something that they've done in the last quarter or the last year. It's something that they've been doing over the last three years. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And could you just make a quick comment about 2017 for services organic, will that be close to flat this year? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, Andrew. Yeah, that will be close to flattish. Again, you've got to remember, the service internal growth doesn't really have as big an impact as it flows through to gross profit in the bottom line, but flattish \u2013 it will be plus or minus 1% to 2%. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You are achieving Recall net synergies faster than you originally expected. Can you discuss where the upside in synergies is coming from? And if you see room for your original synergy targets to go higher? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. Good morning, George. Well, first of all, I think we are getting, as you pointed out, faster and I think we talked about that on the Q3 call. I think it really comes down to, first of all, before especially being a public takeover, to take over a public company, our level of diligence before we could close the deal was limited, right. So we had to make certain assumptions and we tend to be conservative in those assumptions until we actually can open the barn door, so to speak, and see what's there. So the good news is that we have been able to execute a lot harder and lot faster in terms of getting the synergies than what we had forecasted based on really almost publicly available data or very limited diligence. So that's the good news. And it sets us up well for 2017 where our target is $80 million and we already had $65 million exit rate in 2016. In terms of getting more, we're still working through the upside. As we've always said, we do expect that there will be additional synergies coming out of this acquisition and we always consider that most likely or most probably in the real estate segment, and we're continuing to pick through that. The good news is some of that may come through quicker because of the shorter leases that we pointed out, but it still has to be a location-by-location basis. So we're not forecasting an uptick in the overall synergies at this point, but we're pleased by the progress we've made so far. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. You indicated plans to reinvest $20 million of your combined $180 million in Recall synergies and Transformation savings for 2017. Can you elaborate on these investments and when you might expect to see benefits? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. It's a good point. I think that any continuous improvement \u2013 think of Transformation as a continuous improvement program. It's any of those things that you would expect that you're going to reinvest when you have the right opportunities into the business. But it is fair to say that the first tranches of the Transformation program flowed straight through to the bottom line. So the two areas that we' re investing : one of them think about getting the last $25 million of the Transformation benefits or the continuous improvement benefit is associated with shared services in our IT and HR and finance functions. And that's going to require some double running while we transition to new service providers in those areas and some upfront investments. So that's one part of that $20 million is that we will have some double running cost during 2017, which will effectively mean that $25 million of next tranche of Transformation benefit won't be self funding in the year, right. So that's part of it. And then the other part of it is in line with bringing Fidelma onboard to further accelerate what we've been doing over the last couple years and investing more in technology on behalf of our customers so that they can get more out of the information that we're storing for them. You'll see some of that on Investor Day, some of the investments that we're making and what we call innovation on behalf of our customers. So some of it goes into that and as Fidelma further builds on the team that we have there. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yeah, makes sense. And lastly, your Records Management internal volume growth was relatively consistent with prior quarters in the 1.7% range, but your internal storage revenue growth accelerated to 2.9% in the quarter. Can you discuss the drivers behind that I guess particularly pricing? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think that we are making some progress. As I pretty much say on every quarter, and also kind of reiterating part of my answer to Andrew, is nothing happens quickly in this business, because the good news is it's a highly durable, stable business; the bad news is it's a highly durable, stable business. In other words, any change I make today takes some time to actually start flowing through. And, as you know, that we've been working an making sure that we're getting the right value, i.e. price for some of the services that we're working on and that's starting to show real benefits, so. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe this one is for Stuart. I'm just trying to bridge the $30 million lowering of the top end of the guidance range; this $20 million seems to be coming from increased investments, what's the other $10 million coming from and then afterwards I'd like discuss, is the increased investment a pull forward from 2018 or is this just increased investment so just less expectation for profitability because of that? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, Shlomo, I think that if you're focused on EBITDA, I think maybe the simplest way to look at it is to start with the Q4 run rate that we've got, so we start with a Q4 run rate of just under $300 million and if you annualize that, that's going to get you to almost $1.2 billion, $1.188 billion. You got to remember in Q4 also we were having increasing synergies and Transformation benefits. So not all that flows through the quarter. So you have to annualize those benefits as well. That will get you about $40 million and you're going to have organic growth goes on in the business, right, every year. It's about 2%. And so that will get you about $25 million. Then you've got some incremental synergies that we've talked about, the difference between incremental synergies to be actioned in 2017, that's about $15 million and then you've got M&A activities that we have built in the guidance, which will give you about $10 million of EBITDA in 2017. You take all that together and you get to almost $1.280 billion when you add those up. And then we talked about the $20 million that we're going to be reinvesting back into shared services and innovation, that gets you close to $1.260 billion which is close to the midpoint of the guidance of $1.265 billion, that's the easiest way to sort of walk through the change from where we're going from 2016 into 2017. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What changed last quarter to this quarter, just is it all the $20 million, is there something else that's in there and also... Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: If you're looking at guidance in November to guidance now, it's really the $20 million and the FX rate that had a negative impact as well. Those are the two main changes. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But hasn't there been somewhat of an offsetting impact from rising paper prices also from November? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. You could be, but we've assumed in guidance right now that the paper prices stay consistent from 2016 \u2013 right, they're volatile. So we've assumed that 2016 stays on average flat with 2016 at about $140-$145 recycled (sic) [recycled sorted office] paper pricing. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the $20 million of costs that are coming in for this investment, is this something that is a pull forward from 2018 that you're expecting to happen in 2018 or is this just a new investment program here? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I mean, you'll start getting the return to the benefits from them really more in 2018. So you think about the back office shared services that Bill talked about. We'll have double running costs this year, so in 2018 those double running costs go away and then we start to take back office costs out. So those will continue to have benefits as well as the revenue growth that we expect and some of the other innovations will really start to benefit 2018 as well. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What I'm getting at with this question is really, we had a certain expectation for a combination of both Transformation and Integration synergies in 2018. Is this cost investment of $20 million then increase the number that we were expecting in total because there was $125 million from Transformation, you had about $100 million from Recall Synergies, does that now go up because we have this investment program in 2017, so does the aggregate number start to go up for 2018? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's going to be \u2013 yeah, what I'd tell you is that, and Bill sort of touched on it, we've really moved Transformation into a continuous program to really take cost out of the business, and improve capital deployment and keep growing the business. So what you'll do is, yeah, you should continue to see margin improvement in 2018 and 2019 as benefits from these in terms of, are we going to specifically call them out as Transformation benefits. I don't think we're going to sort of specify them that way. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think it's a good try, Shlomo, for us to kind of give you 2018 guidance, but we're not going to do that. I mean, I think you can take it to the bank that we're investing $20 million back into the business because we expect to get a return on that. But to give you what the exact return on that's going to be in 2018, I'm not going to tell you. I mean you know that we're going to have $25 million of more Transformation benefit, so part of that $20 million goes to making sure that we smoothly get to that last $25 million which requires double running cost to get there. But I'm not going to call out exactly what the return on investment is going to be on the innovation. But I think after the Investor Day, you'll probably have a better view of kind of the things that we're working on, but you're going to have to wait until this time next year for 2018 guidance. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, I'm not asking for 2018 guidance. I'm just asking is it costing more to get there? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, I think you can argue that the $25 million of Transformation, so that $25 million of Transformation benefit is, you could argue it's costing us a bit more in the sense that what we always set up the Transformation Program, as much as we possibly could, we would self fund it. In other words, the cost to get the Transformation is we would action things early enough in the year, so that by the end of the year it paid for itself and then you got the full benefit the following year. On this last $25 million, what we're saying is that we're not going to be able to do that in 2017, but the full benefit will go through. So you could argue that it's costing us more because we're not able to self fund it in the benefit that we're going to get in 2017. I think that's fair. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: In risk of over answering this question, we could have staged it out to match funds, but the right answer for the business was to do HR and IT and finance all at the same time, and since you're doing all those at the same time, you've got more cost upfront and you'll get more of the benefits later on. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then what's the total organic revenue growth implied in the guidance including services? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, if you look at the revenue mix of the 2% to 2.5% storage and the flattish of service, you'll end up plus or minus 2%, unless you have an even number in front of me, because I think of them very differently because they are such different profit margins and such different drivers of the business. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. But in terms of shifting, we're seeing this shift to more emerging markets or starting to shift to adjacencies, I'm just trying to see if we're going to get a shift overall to overall better revenue growth. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: You are seeing some of that. You're already seeing that Shlomo, because you've been watching the story a pretty long time, is you're already starting to see that shift, right, because now, where 20% of the mix now is higher growth and you're starting to see that both on the top and the bottom line starting to \u2013 what I would call wind at our backs in terms of that 2%, 2.5% of storage and overall flattening to slightly positive growth in service. So you are starting to see that kind of build in. But at this point it's more, I would say, wind at your back than a major switch that's been flipped. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Great, thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Justin Hauke of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thank you, guys. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Justin, can you speak up a little bit because we can barely hear you. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Is that better? Can you hear me now? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Great, thanks. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, good. So I guess I just wanted to ask a little bit and kind of a two-part question on the capital budget, and maybe I'll start first with just the dividend commitment that you have. One of the things is I mean with all the restructuring, obviously your taxable income is lower than the dividend that you're paying out, so in other words you're paying more dividend than you would be required to as a REIT. And I guess the question is should we think of your dividend commitments that you've given as we kind of get past the restructuring as being more in line with that 90% of taxable income that you're required to or is it your intention to continue to over fund the dividend, if you will? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think over time you're going to continue to see us grow into the dividend, right, when we set the expectations for dividend growth out as part of our 2020 plan. That was always in anticipation of getting the synergies and Transformation benefits continuing to grow the business. And so, I think, yeah, so if you look at purely from what's required dividend for being a REIT, we're going to continue to return to shareholders more in dividends than is required, but we're going to grow into that over the next few years. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that Justin is we think about dividends as capital allocation. So AFFO is really the measure that we focus on, and we try to say okay, what's the right mix between giving capital back to our shareholders through dividends versus reinvesting in the business. In the 2020 plan as a percentage of AFFO we do see ourselves trending down from say 80% down into the mid to low-70%s, and we continue to expect that that happen over time. But that's much more the \u2013 I mean, what you're saying is true and it's valid, but it's not what we're trying to solve for. So it's much more of a capital allocation decision, and if you look in the 70%s, low-80%s is that there are a number of REITs that play in that range. So it is true what you're saying, but that's not the metric that we are trying to solve for. We are much more looking at how do we take the AFFO and carve that out between giving money back to shareholders versus growing the business? Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. I mean, to paraphrase, I mean it kind of sounds like you're talking about it holistically over a multi-year period is what's forming the dividend policy as opposed to any given year's taxable income? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, exactly. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, I guess, the second question is just, this is the second time and I think it was last quarter, maybe it was the quarter before, but your maintenance CapEx needs to continue to come down, which is obviously a positive for your coverage and the ability to have more capital for the growth initiatives that you've talked about. To what extent is that now done? And is there anything that would be more properly characterized as deferred maintenance as opposed to kind of this is a structural shift in which these are not capital needs that the business actually has? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. I think the one distinction I've made is the really the real estate, the actual maintenance piece has been pretty well on track with guidance, is the non-real estate CapEx which includes things like back office IT systems at corporate and out in the field, warehouse equipment, that's where we've gone through and really sat down and said, what do we need to be investing in the business or is it better to repair than buy new as well as looking out over the next couple years in terms of system replacements, what can we not replace today and just sort of keep it going and because we're going to upgrade over the next couple of years. So we've gone through and sort of cleaned back or cut back some of the requests that have gone in that area. I think what you'll see us continue to do is on the maintenance side. Again, it'll be a little bit elevated in 2016 and 2017 because there is some deferred maintenance at Recall that we've got to do and that piece of it will trend down as a percentage of revenue or on a square foot basis. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, so the $150 million to $170 million in 2017, we should think is still a little bit elevated. It comes down a little bit more in 2018 and then it kind of grows in line with revenue? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right, great. Thank you very much guys. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi good morning. I wanted to circle back to a previous question on the organic storage revenue growth trend, so the 2016 forecast was 2.5%, you hit 2.3% last year, and now the 2017 mid point is a deceleration from there despite the fact that you've got more emerging markets in the mix today. I recognize that they are small changes, but it's meaningful given storage's outsized contribution, so just could you explain what you think is causing the deceleration there? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It goes back to my \u2013 question, so Kevin had it right. You can also say that 2.9% that we had in Q4 was also \u2013 I could show you the opposite Karin that, oh well you're really kind of trending up. I think what you're seeing where we're guiding between the 2% and 2.5% is the denominator is changing out, because don't forget, we integrated Recall. So what's happening is, is that we're getting similar or better continued growth in terms of absolute volume growth, but on a bigger base. So the 2% to 2.5% is as much \u2013 is mainly a reflection of the denominator. It's not that we're going from 2.9% in Q4 and we're saying, okay, now we're trending down between 2% and 2.5%. It's because in the course of 2016, we had the go-forward growth on a bigger base as we went through the year, although we subtracted the base, the Recall base that we did it on an internal basis. But still the overall base number hadn't been adjusted. So as we start getting into Q3 and Q4 of 2017, you'll see effectively the denominator change. So it's really the math. Not a change in the business. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: But said another way, so because it's organic growth, it's because Recall is growing slower organically than the base \u2013 than the legacy Iron Mountain business, is that right? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, it's a little bit slower, yeah, because don't forget we have now a bigger business in Australia and they also had a sizeable business in North America. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And the next question will be a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me sneak back in here. I just wanted to ask on the organic growth on storage, does it allocate any growth to Recall or is all the growth of the combined company allocated solely to Iron Mountain? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So the way it works Shlomo is we take out all the Recall base business, so if we bought \u2013 we bought Recall at the beginning of May and if we had a Recall customer that grew from May until the end of the year, the growth on that customer was part of the internal growth number, but the original volume for that customer was excluded. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So any incremental growth from Recall does count as Iron Mountain... William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ... growth? (sic) [Internal volume growth?] William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So when you look at the volume growth in the supplemental on slides 9 and 10, you'll see the overall trends increasing on new volume from existing customers and new sales, as well as destructions increasing as that volume comes in there, so that's the easiest place to see it. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So it's really just a math exercise over here. So going back to 2% to 2.5% is just more of a normalized thing, it is just kind of elevated because all the growth is allocated to Iron Mountain right now? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Exactly. Exactly. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : And at this time, we have no additional questions. I'd like to hand the conference back to management for any closing remarks. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay, well, thank you all for your time this morning. Thank you, operator and I hope to see as many of you as possible on the April 20 in New York City. So have a good rest of reporting season. Operator : Thank you, sir.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Melissa Marsden - Iron Mountain, Inc.: (00:31-00:40) include a short slide presentation that will be referenced during today's prepared remarks. The user-controlled slides are available on our Investor Relations website, along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us/Investors/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights, press release, the presentation and the full supplemental financial information together in one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com, under Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all the related documents as 1-8K, which is also available on the website. On today's call, we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2017 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the earnings commentary, safe harbor language on this slide, and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP financial measures when presenting our results, and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid first quarter results. We achieved financial performance in line with our expectations, underpinned by the durability of and the consistent growth in our high-margin records management storage business. We are particularly pleased by the strong top line growth seen across the business. We also continue to demonstrate progress in building positive momentum in the service side of the business as we grow new offerings to offset legacy transport services. Overall, we performed well against our strategic plan. At its core, our strategic plan is about extending our durable business model through continued investment in our large and developed market core, whilst expanding into faster-growing emerging markets, and seizing opportunities to provide new innovative storage solutions to both our existing customers, as well as new segments. As most of you are aware, last week, we hosted our Investor Day in New York, featuring several members of the senior executive team responsible for delivering results across our reporting segments. The event included breakout sessions that provided insights into how we approach innovation, and a peek into the garage to highlight some of our current initiatives. Given that the content from that event is so fresh, and our first quarter results are consistent with the trends and trajectory we discussed last week, we'll keep our prepared remarks brief. If you weren't able to join us in person last week, the webcast replay, presentation slides and transcript of our Investor Day are all available on our website. I would encourage you to review those materials as that form allows for a deeper dive, as well as exposure to additional members of the management team than can be accomplished in a typical earnings call or a one-on-one meeting. During Investor Day, we also touched on how our rapid integration of Recall transaction and success with our transformation initiative have significantly enhanced the adjusted EBITDA and AFFO that support recent dividend increases, and are providing a solid foundation for future growth in dividends in excess of inflation. Turning to first quarter highlights, on the third page of the earnings call presentation, total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core storage fundamentals were in line with our expectations, both on an internal and total basis. And we continued to make progress on our goal of reducing SG&A as a percentage of revenue, reaching 24.2%, down 100 basis points from last year, and down 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. We also achieved storage internal revenue growth in Q1 of 3%, with positive internal volume growth in all reporting segments and a worldwide average of 1.9%. New volume from existing customers of more than 34 million cubic feet over the past 12 months was consistent with what we've achieved in recent years and included the expected increase from Recall. This demonstrates the consistency of customer behavior related to storage of new regulatory and legal documents. We continue to maintain our focus on driving volume growth, whilst also beginning to realize some improvement in pricing through revenue management efforts. Based on the strength of these core fundamentals, we remain comfortable with our 2017 full-year guidance. Slide 4 is a quick review of progress against our 2020 strategic plan during the quarter. In developed markets, which includes both North America in RIM and our Western European segment, we continue to drive positive internal storage revenue growth with 3.2 million cubic feet of internal volume growth on a trailing 12-month basis. In terms of our progress with expanding our business model into faster-growing emerging markets, we are just shy of 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, a major improvement from about 10% just 3 years ago. Year-over-year progress against this goal was supported by acquisitions closed during the quarter. Also noted last week, our pipeline is substantial and provides solid coverage of what we need to execute to bring emerging markets to 20% of total revenue by the end of 2020. In adjacent businesses, we continue to see attractive opportunities in our Data Center business, as discussed last week. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of a small art storage business in Brooklyn that has a long history of providing storage and transport services to prominent collectors, gallery owners and museums in the New York metro market. Combining expansion in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses, we made further progress in Q1 with shifting our revenue mix in line with our 2020 plan goal, as noted on slide 5. Our objective is to reach 25% of total revenues from our higher growth portfolio. Supported by the acquisition of Recall, we are approaching 20% of our mix coming from these businesses. As previously noted, our guidance includes M&A, as well as strong organic growth to support this transition, both in emerging markets, as well as in adjacent businesses. As this shift progresses, we expect to see faster EBITDA growth. Our progress in shifting our revenue mix, along with the benefits from both Recall integration and our transformation initiative, can be seen in the year-over-year comparisons of financial performance on slide 6. We've substantially integrated Recall's business and implemented actions that enabled us to achieve synergies faster than our original expectations, and we have enhanced EBITDA growth through our transformation efforts. The financial impact from these efforts is flowing through. As stated on our fourth quarter earnings call and noted again last week, we expect to generate $180 million of combined savings benefit for 2017, with roughly $20 million of that to be reinvested into innovation, operating expenditures and shared service efficiency programs. Whilst integration is largely complete on a management and culture basis, we remain on track to add another $50 million of bottom line benefit from transformation, bringing the total from these two efforts to $230 million by 2020. As you can see, the weighted average increase in our shares outstanding year-over-year is roughly in line with revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20% range. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 13% in the fourth quarter, so the majority of this improvement is going directly to shareholders without compromising future growth. Turning to slide 7, we're all familiar with the link between rising interest rates in REIT public market valuations, and the additional correlation between rising interest rates and rising inflation. Given that we are a real estate company generating more than 80% of our gross profit from storage rental related activity, we believe we are unique among REITs in our ability to pass through inflation in the form of upward-only, CPI-type escalators in our contracts. Typically, these are annual escalation provisions. Additionally, the fact that our storage gross margins are around 75%, inflation escalators have a positive and compound effect on margins, especially during periods of high inflation. I would add that the shorter term rental contracts are balanced against our average box age of 15 years and 98% customer retention. So, the average customer stays with us for 50 years, supporting the durability of the rental income stream. Remember that rising interest rates don't have an impact on customer storage demand, and the net operating income doesn't change if the market value of the underlying real estate fluctuates. In summary, we had a very good first quarter, and we continue to execute on all three pillars of our strategic plan. In the short term, these accomplishments support both the reinvestment necessary to extend the durability of our business, and continue growth in cash flow and our ability to grow our dividend. This is all whilst continuing to advance our growth in EBITDA ahead of debt, and hence, de-lever over time, and concurrently, continuing to create value through our M&A activities. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be reporting on another strong quarter that demonstrates the durability of our business and the success of our business plans. Similar to Bill, my comments will be brief this morning and cover key highlights, certain operational and financial metrics, and our outlook for 2017, which remains unchanged since February. Before diving into the details, let me walk you through the key financial highlights. First, we achieved strong internal storage revenue growth of 3%, excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions. This is consistent with last quarter's performance of 2.9%, and reflects solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Second, we maintain consistent adjusted EBITDA growth of over 24% from the acquisition of Recall and underlying margin improvement. Third, the integration of Recall and our Transformation Program continues to be on track, as evidenced by the 100 basis point decline in SG&A as a percentage of total revenue this quarter, as Bill discussed. Let's now turn to slide 8, which shows our key financial metrics. First quarter total revenues growth of 25.1% was in line with our expectations, driven by acquisitions and the strong internal storage revenue growth. The internal storage revenue growth of 3% was driven primarily by net internal records management volume growth of 1.9%, as well as benefits from our revenue management efforts. Service revenues increased 26.6% in the first quarter, 0.6% of which was internal growth. The improvement in internal service growth resulted from higher paper prices, as well as increases in project-related revenue. At current paper pricing, we expect to benefit to the first half of the year until we begin to cycle against last year's price increases. Compared to a year ago, the first quarter adjusted gross margin declined 120 basis points due to the mix of Recall's lower margins, including higher rent expense, as pre-acquisition Recall leased close to 90% of their facilities on a square-foot basis. Sequentially, adjusted gross margins declined 80 basis points from the fourth quarter as a result of the seasonality of utility cost and compensation expense. Adjusted to exclude Recall integration costs, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20.1% from a year ago. SG&A as a percent of total revenues, however, decreased 100 basis points from last year due to the transformation integration benefits, as well as a reduction of bad debt expense. The 24.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by acquisition benefits, top line growth and the SG&A improvements just noted. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $6 million of expense this quarter related to the innovation investments, which we talked about last quarter. As a percentage of total revenues, the adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1 was 31.2%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago due to the mix of Recall's lower-margin business, mostly offset by other business improvements. Looking at the adjusted EBITDA margin on a sequential basis, that is to track progress on synergies and transformation, the EBITDA margin declined 50 basis points from Q4, due partly to the seasonally higher operating expenses in the first quarter, as well as the $6 million of expense-related innovation. Excluding just for the $6 million, adjusted EBITDA would have been 31.8%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4 2016. Growth of adjusted EPS to $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.03 related to the year-over-year increase in our structural tax rate, which was 14% a year ago and 23.1% this quarter. The tax rate was above our guidance, partly driven by a change in U.K. tax legislation, whose application was recently clarified. The legislation affects our interest deductibility, and we have included this in our effective tax rate, while we are actively pursuing remediation and restructuring to mitigate its impact. In addition, our tax rate has been impacted by our anticipated mix of earnings. Despite our Q1 structural rate, we expect that our full year 2017 structural rate will be closer to the higher end of our guidance, or approximately 20%. AFFO was in line with our expectations at $170.9 million. Compared to a year ago, AFFO growth was limited as we lapped against a cash tax benefit, resulting in a $34 million swing in cash taxes paid. Remember that the calculation of AFFO was changed in the third quarter of last year, so that it reflects cash taxes. While annually, cash taxes will generally reflect our structural tax rate, we will have some quarterly volatility, such as this quarter when AFFO is reduced by a net $30.4 million compared to a year ago, when cash taxes were actually a benefit of $3.6 million. Let's turn to slide 9 to cover internal growth performance by segment for the quarter. The North America records and information management, or RIM, internal storage revenue growth continued to be strong. This performance was driven by price improvement and volume growth. We saw improvement in the North American internal service revenue due to growth in the shred business, including the higher paper prices, and improvement in information governance and digital solutions, which provides digital imaging services to our customers. The North American data management internal storage revenue grew 2.7%. However, internal service revenue declined due to the ongoing reduction in tape rotation, as discussed in our Investor Day. The adjusted EBITDA margin in North America data management declined year-over-year, primarily as a result of increases in investments associated with product development, however, remains a very healthy 52.3%. The internal storage revenue growth in Western Europe of 1.7% improved from the fourth quarter, while internal service revenue growth of 4.4% benefited from an increase in special projects in the U.K. and new customer wins in Germany and Spain. The Western Europe adjusted EBITDA margin declined year-over-year due primarily to a one-time tax benefit in the U.K. of approximately $3 million, which we discussed a year ago. In the Other International segment, which includes the larger legacy Recall Australian business, we continue to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth, and improving margins. As for Corporate and Other, adjacent business internal service revenue showed a small $600,000 decline related to lower project revenue in art storage. Moving to slides 10 and 11 quickly, consistent with the fourth quarter call, slide 10 shows the relative size of each segment and its contribution to our results through a storage and service lens. Storage continues to provide more than 80% of adjusted gross profit with the remainder from services. As you heard in our Investor Day, we continue to innovate on new service offerings for our customers, focusing on value-added services which deliver gross profit growth. Slide 11 contains the same information as slide 10, but viewed on a product line basis. Before turning to our outlook for 2017, let me quickly touch on the composition of our global business. The chart on slide 12 remains consistent with the data provided on the Q4 conference call. As you can see, roughly 60% of worldwide revenues are generated in the U.S. And importantly, approximately 70% of adjusted EBITDA is in U.S. dollars. This demonstrates that the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations are somewhat muted on adjusted EBITDA. Also, we continue to match our foreign denominated debt to create natural currency hedges to mitigate translation exposure, while also being tax efficient. At quarter-end, 23% of our debt was in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Let's turn to our guidance for 2017, summarized on page 13 of the deck. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged since February on a constant dollar basis. For full year 2017, at the midpoint, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5%, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to around 33%, an increase of about 200 basis points compared to 2016. In addition, AFFO is expected to grow by 11.5% of the midpoint, supporting our expected dividend growth of 7% in 2018. As noted in February, our guidance assumes that we invest about $20 million in operating costs associated with innovation initiatives and global shared service programs. We continue evaluating several storage and service line innovations, and should these innovations meet or exceed specific success-based hurdles, related operating expenditures associated with commercialization of these initiatives could have a minor impact on full year adjusted EBITDA expectations. That being said, we have not made any commitments at this point and have not changed our guidance to reflect this. Turning to slide 14, our projected cash available for distribution and investments, or CAD, also remains unchanged from the Q4 earnings call. For 2017, we continue to expect CAD to cover our anticipated full-year dividend and required maintenance capital expenditures, with approximately $125 million of capital remaining to support core growth racking and other discretionary value-accreting investments, and requiring about $200 million of external funding for the remainder, excluding Recall costs. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we had liquidity of nearly $1 billion at quarter-end, and a lease-adjusted debt ratio of 5.8 times, which is in line with our expectations. In the short-term, we expect our leverage ratio to remain above long term targeted levels following the Recall acquisition, and then trend down as we collect divestiture proceeds, fully realize the synergies and transformation benefits, and continue internal growth. We expect our lease-adjusted debt ratio to be 5.6 times at year-end, and then trending down to 5 times in 2020, as we laid out in our Investor Day. To remain in our targeted capital structure and to take advantage of market conditions, we expect we will term out a portion of our borrowings with longer-term debt and attractive rates, thereby extending our average maturity. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and results that are consistent with expectations. We are well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for the year having started with strong internal growth momentum. As I said last week at our Investor Day, our steady growth, strong margins, and very effective field leadership will allow Iron Mountain to thrive in all business cycles. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Stuart. And before turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to just briefly summarize some of the key points. First, we continue to execute well in our plan. We are pleased with the performance across all metrics, and particularly call out our organic revenue growth because this provides the fuel in the tank for the business. And putting this all together, it furthers the durability of our business model, the cash flow and dividend growth as well allows for investment for future developments. With that, I'd like to, operator, turn it over to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. This is Michael Cho in for Andrew. I just want to touch on the services segment for a minute. I think you discussed paper prices and some project-related revenues this quarter. But just more broadly about that, I realize Iron Mountain is pressing into and introducing new services to offset previous growth headwinds, but also those new services could come with a lower gross margin profile. How should we view this quarter's results in that context, where services organic grew and margins expanded as well? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, Michael. This is Stuart. What you see, we've been through a little bit from paper pricing, but to take a step back, I mean, we've been experiencing a decrease in activity in records and tape rotation, as we've talked about. And so the team has been doing a great job talking to customers and working more on solution selling. So while the new activities that we're working on for our customers will likely be at lower gross margins than our storage business, when you look at it compared to our service business, we wouldn't expect any real degradation of gross margins from that. And again, we're focused on gross profit and solution selling. So, when you think about different activities that we've got going on out there for our customers, and they're looking for help managing things like HR records, scanning businesses so that they can monetize and take advantage of the records that we store for them, we think that there's not going to be any real degradation in the gross margin to that. And over time, the innovations that we're working on today is \u2013 a number of these, as Bill talked about earlier, are still in the garage in early days; these are things that we're going to continue to innovate on as we talk to our customers. Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Bill, can you discuss progress in penetrating the middle market channel in the quarter following the Recall transaction? I asked since 1Q records management volume growth, as you noted, accelerated to 1.9% from 1.7% in 4Q. How much of that acceleration represents improvement in the middle market versus other potential drivers you're seeing? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Good morning, George, and thanks for the question. It would be wrong to say that, that 0.2% uptick that you're seeing is from the middle market. That being said, you're right to say one of the areas where we're building kind of tailwinds to the business is the middle market, and we continue to be pleased in terms of the results we're getting it. I mean, in fact, actually before Investor Day, whilst I was in New York, I was calling on a financial service customer. And actually, through their independent agents, is that's another area where we're starting to look at offerings on where we can help support some of the people that support them. And that's clearly the smaller end actually, the SMB market. So, we're starting to build real momentum in that segment, but I think it would be too early to call out all the volume increase that we're seeing is coming from there. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Right. And any specific drivers you would call out in terms of the volume growth acceleration? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: A lot of it comes back to almost what Stuart was saying before, because as we're actually getting better at new service offerings in the service area, we're providing solutions, and those solutions, the exhaust from a lot of those solutions are more storage. And I think I maybe mentioned this on previous calls, is that we're actually taking a page out of our playbook that we use when we started building our services in the emerging markets because many times in the emerging markets, where the category of storing documents is not well understood, our first offering for those customers was solving a specific problem and solution, and it was a service that we provided. And part of that service is we built a further relationship with them, and built more storage on the back of it. So I think what I would say at this point is that we are getting better with our sales force in the developed markets. As in the emerging markets, we always had to kind of approach it that way by getting them much more about solution selling rather than the transaction sales, and that's having benefits, both in the service as well as on the storage. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it; that's helpful. And digging quickly into the services piece of the business, can you elaborate on your pipeline for project-based services revenues and the ability for these new services to offset declines in legacy transport? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think that we're continuing to see good progress on that, but as I said at the last call, it will be lumpy. In other words, almost by the very nature of project revenue, so it's much easier predict on an annual basis than it is on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we're starting to build real scale in that. So obviously, even the volatility will start looking smoother and smoother as we build a bigger base of project-based revenue. But if you think about the drag of the \u2013 or the downtick in the legacy transport business as the business becomes more about proof than use, then you can see that the performance that we have \u2013 we're very pleased with the strong positive internal sales performance that we had in service this quarter. And think of it about 50/50. In other words, 50% of that was through building a lot of these new project-based service offerings, and the other half was the growth in our shred and paper business. So it is clearly having a strong impact in terms of offsetting what was our \u2013 the predominant portion of our service portfolio, which was transport in the past. George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Just want to go back to the first quarter organic storage growth of 3%. And then you're still guiding to 2% to 2.5% for the year. Can you just talk about the cadence of that growth, how you expect it to progress through the year? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Karin, hi, this is Stuart. If you think about it, first of all, 2016, we really had an uptick in storage growth last year, in the second half of the year. And again, I'll point out that, that was after the Recall acquisition, so really showing that our commercial team is really staying focused on delivering. And so we anticipate that we'll be, in the second half, on a year-over-year growth basis, it will slow down because we will have tougher comps. That said, I think at this point, having what we've delivered in the first quarter, we'll be closer to the 2.5% than the 2% in the guidance. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: That's helpful. My second question is a bigger picture one. I hesitate to ask it because I know you converted to a REIT not too long ago. But in light of the Trump Administration's proposal to reduce corporate tax rates down to 15%, in that environment, would it make sense for Iron Mountain to remain a REIT? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's a good question, Karin. And rest assured, you can imagine we're watching it very closely. But I think, first, remember that we do have a very large service portfolio. So tax reform would be a real benefit for us because we pay full corporate taxes on still our service part of the business, which you can see in our structural tax rate, is not insignificant. So if we can get real tax reform, even \u2013 let's take what was proposed yesterday, but who knows what's going to finally shoot out, that would be a real benefit to us; that's kind of the first point. The second point I would just say, it is something that we're heavily engaged, both directly on our own steam as well as through NAREIT. So, for instance, I personally have been to Washington twice this year, and it's not because I like the place. But I've been down there twice since the beginning of the year with our government affairs people, as well who \u2013 and the person who leads our government affairs is a former tax attorney or is a tax attorney. So it is one of the key things that we focus on when we're on The Hill, as well as with NAREIT. And I was with a bunch of CEOs with NAREIT in late winter. And one of the things, particularly, that we are sensitive to, and it hasn't been clarified, is how the dividends that flow through the qualified REIT subsidiary, which are non-qualified dividends, how those are going to be treated under the new tax legislation, because the past, both we and NAREIT are very focused to make sure those dividends get treated at the same tax rate as the pass-through because it keeps it at a level playing field. So specifically, the one thing that did come out in the proposal that we saw yesterday is we would be continuing our lobbying efforts, both as Iron Mountain and through NAREIT, to make sure that non-qualified dividends coming through the REIT subsidiaries would be treated on the same basis as any tax rate for a pass-through. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Karin. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. This is Adam on for Shlomo. One question I had and another question's been answered. There's a comment in the presentation about several innovations that if you meet or exceed success-based hurdles, the related OpEx associated with the commercialization would impact EBITDA. Can you just explain that a little bit more? Is that kind of a recognition item in terms of operating versus capitalization, or is that kind of incremental expenditure? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Actually, it would be both. I mean, first of all, I should say if something comes \u2013 starts developing in the garage that looks promising, it's actually a good news story. But we haven't built anything in because at this point, we're still in the exploration phase. But it would be both OpEx and CapEx. But then, if you look at it in terms of the total numbers that we're guiding to, it would be noise in those numbers. So it wouldn't affect, in any significant way, either our EBITDA or our CapEx guidance at this point. But we're just calling out that it's \u2013 we haven't baked that in at this point because we don't know how things develop in the garage. Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Everything else has been answered on my end, so thank you. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I'd just like to thank everyone for participating this morning. I know it's a busy season, and also for those of you that joined us last week at Investor Day, we hope you enjoyed as much as we did and, again, we appreciate your time. So, have a good morning or good afternoon wherever you are. Thanks. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased this morning to report strong second quarter results and our first acquisition in the data center space. We're excited about this transaction and look forward to welcoming the FORTRUST team to the Iron Mountain Family. We achieved financial performance in line with our expectations and the durability of our high-margin Records Management Storage business drove solid internal growth and enhanced profitability across the business. Our second quarter financial and operating results demonstrate solid execution of our strategic plan. As you know, that plan is focused on extending our durable business model through continued investment in our core developed markets, whilst expanding into faster-growing emerging markets and capturing opportunities to provide new, innovative solutions to both our new and existing customers and to tap into new storage-related segments such as the Data Center business. Let me start with highlights on the third slide of the earnings call presentation. Our second quarter financial results were in line with our expectations and reflect how our rapid integration of Recall and success with our Transformation initiative have significantly enhanced the Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO that support recent dividend increases and provide a solid foundation for future growth in dividend well in excess of inflation. We continue to make progress on our goal of reducing SG&A as a percentage of revenue, down 80 basis points from the first quarter to 23.4% whilst our EBITDAR margins improved 230 basis points sequentially to 33.5%. Prior to one-time items, which Stuart will detail later, the sequential improvement would have been 170 basis points or 32.9% in terms of margin. During the quarter, we also achieved internal storage rental revenue growth of 4.8%, which as noted, included a data center lease termination fee. Excluding that fee, we posted very strong internal storage rental growth of 4%. This growth reflects improvement in pricing through revenue management efforts and 1.3% growth in internal global records management volume or excluding impacts from acquisitions and dispositions. You'll note in the supplemental report that trailing 12-month volume growth now includes Recall volume in the base, rather than being held out separately as acquisition-related, which is how we have presented Recall volume for the past four quarters. As we have noted in calls over the past year, after lapping the anniversary of the acquisition, folding in Recall's volume into the base increases it by about 20%, which has the impact of making all percentage growth figures a bit lower, even though there is little to no change on an absolute basis. Slide 4 shows the absolute volume change for total records management storage. Importantly, new volume from both existing and new customers of 50 million cubic feet over the past 12 months is up from 44 million cubic feet of new volume over the 12-month period prior to the Recall acquisition. This demonstrates the benefit of the transaction and consistency of customer behavior related to storage of new regulatory and legal documents. And remember that the 9 million cubic feet of net record growth stays with us for an average of 15 years. Based on the strength of our core fundamentals, we remain comfortable with our full-year revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO guidance for 2017. Whilst we benefited from some one-time items in the second quarter, our expectations are unchanged. Stuart will have more on the pluses and minuses shortly. Slide 5 is a review of progress during the quarter against our 2020 strategic plan. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 3.4% and 1.8 million cubic feet of net internal volume growth in developed markets on a trailing 12-month basis. We are pleased with the durability of volume growth and our ability to achieve price gains in the developed markets. In addition, we continued to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in developed markets, closing on four tuck-in deals in North America, including an acquisition of a small shredding business. In terms of expanding our business model into faster growing emerging markets, we are just shy of 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, a major improvement from about 10% just three years ago. Year-over-year progress against this goal was supported by acquisitions closed during the quarter, including those in the remaining markets that were part of the Santa Fe deal, namely Indonesia, India and the Philippines. We also closed on a transaction in Peru during the second quarter. In total, we invested $27 million in emerging markets in Q2, which includes some real estate assets. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a $29 million acquisition in Cyprus. We continued to nurture a strong pipeline of M&A opportunities and are maintaining our full year guidance for acquisition investment independent of the data center acquisition announced this morning, which I'll address in just a minute. Also, during the second quarter, we sold our business in Russia and Ukraine to OSG, a leading records management provider in Russia. We remain confident in the long-term attractiveness of the market opportunity and growth characteristics of these countries and will continue to participate through a passive 25% minority interest in the combined entity. We believe that owning a stake in the OSG business that now includes Iron Mountain customers and operations is the best value-creating strategy at this time. Turning to slide 6, we meaningfully advanced our adjacent business strategy with the signing of an agreement to acquire FORTRUST, a Denver-based data center company, for approximately $128 million, which we announced earlier this morning. This acquisition adds 9 megawatts of existing capacity and allows for significant future expansion. Together with the first phase of our data center campus in Northern Virginia that goes online next month, we will have a total existing capacity of more than 30 megawatts by the end of the year. Adding the expansion potential from FORTRUST, full build-out of our Northern Virginia campus and construction in progress in our Boyers and Kansas City locations, we have the potential to expand our data center platform to more than 70 megawatts. FORTRUST is a great fit with our business. It is highly regarded private data center operator with a distinction of having 100% critical systems uptime throughout its 15-year history. And FORTRUST's focus on enhanced security and consistent accessibility for critical applications is very consistent with our brand positioning in targeted verticals. It has a diversified base of more than 250 customers, with the top 25 representing about 50% of annualized rental revenue. In addition, Denver is quite attractive as a critical location for customers seeking East-West data center redundancy and the market is seeing solid demand driven by the technology solutions, data management, software, education and healthcare industries. The acquisition, including the real estate, represents a multiple of approximately 13 times stabilized EBITDA and will be funded with a combination of cash and unregistered stock issued to the seller. Assuming this deal is funded with approximately $73.5 million worth of equity at or near the current stock price, it would be $0.01 per share to $0.02 per share dilutive to EPS in 2017 and neutral to AFFO. We expect it to be accretive to EPS in year two or 2019. Our year-end run rate revenue mix following this data center transaction will bring adjacent business to roughly 3% of total revenue relative to be at 5% by 2020. Combined with the growth in our emerging markets, we are well positioned to meet our goal of 25% of total revenues from our higher growth portfolio by 2020. In summary, we had a solid quarter characterized by good operating fundamentals, strong financial performance, improved profitability and excellent progress in all three pillars of our strategic plan. We continued to identify attractive investment opportunities that both strengthen the durability of the core business and drive growth in new businesses. This progress supports growth in Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that ultimately underpins our ability to grow our dividend per share and to delever over time. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report on another strong quarter of healthy continuing growth in our core Records Management business. This morning, I'll provide some color on our quarter's operational and financial drivers and then cover our outlook for 2017. As you see on slide 7, which shows our key financial metrics, our second quarter total revenues grew 8.4% on a C$ basis and were modestly impacted by delayed closings of acquisitions compared to our original outlook. As Bill mentioned, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 4.8% in the second quarter, or 4% excluding a lease termination fee from a data center customer whose business had been acquired. Service revenues increased 5.1% in the second quarter on a C$ basis with internal service revenue down 1.1% as higher paper prices in our Shred business this year were more than offset by cycling over a high Recall destruction revenue a year ago in our Other International segment and less tape rotation in our Data Management business. As noted last quarter, we will be cycling against last year's paper price increases in the second half. So at current paper pricing, we don't anticipate further upside this year. With year-to-date internal service revenue growth of minus 0.4%, we continue to be comfortable with our outlook for flattish internal service revenue growth for the full year. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues were down 230 basis points year-over-year and decreased 80 basis points from the first quarter, driven by transformation and integration progress and excluding Recall integration costs. Our Adjusted EBITDA grew by 23% on a C$ basis in the second quarter. Excluding the additional month of Recall in our 2017 results compared with last year, growth was about 18% due to solid operational execution and acquisition synergies, resulting in margin improvement across all our regions. In addition, results benefited from almost $6 million of non-recurring items this quarter, including the data center lease termination fee just mentioned and the reversal of an earn-out provision on a previous acquisition. I'll speak to our Adjusted EBITDA outlook in a few minutes. But at a high level, we expect these favorable items to be largely offset by integration costs associated with acquisition activity in the second half, as well as a loss of EBITDA from the sale of our Russian and Ukrainian businesses. Looking at the Adjusted EBITDA margin on a sequential basis, that is to attract progress on synergies and transformation, the Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 230 basis points from the first quarter, driven by top-line growth, gross margin improvement, acquisition synergies, the overhead improvement and to a lesser extent the nonrecurring items. Compared to a year ago, the Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 390 basis points to 33.5%, of which about 60 basis points was due to the nonrecurring items. AFFO was $217 million in the second quarter, an increase of almost $62 million or about 40% on a C$ basis. This strong growth resulted from growth in Adjusted EBITDA, timing of maintenance capital expenditures, as well as a swing in the timing of quarterly cash taxes compared to a year ago of about $14 million. Remember that annually, cash taxes will generally reflect our structural tax rate. But we will have some quarterly volatility. Year-to-date, cash taxes have been just a little bit lower than our expected annual run rate. Let's turn to slide 8 to cover internal growth performance by segment for the quarter. In the North America Records and Information Management business, internal storage revenue grew by 3.7%. This growth was largely driven by higher average price, as reported internal volume growth was flat. North American internal service revenue growth of 1.3% resulted from higher revenues from Information Governance, or Digital Imaging Services, shred activity and paper pricing, and other project-based revenue. The North America RIM Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 400 basis points to 43.3%. As you can see on this slide, the total North America RIM business represents over 50% of total revenues. The strong growth in this segment has a significant impact on overall growth. The North America Data Management business trends were in line with the first quarter, with internal storage revenue growth of 2.9%. Internal service revenue declined about $2 million due to the ongoing reduction in tape rotation. While the internal service revenue decline on a percentage basis is more noticeable in Data Management compared to other segments, remember that Data Management service is just 3.4% of total revenues. Further, new services are just beginning to offset these declines, but we expect it will be some time before the tape handling declines are fully offset. The Adjusted EBITDA margin in North America Data Management declined slightly from a year ago as a result of increased investments in product development. However, the margins remained a very healthy 53.4%. The internal storage revenue growth in Western Europe improved 2.5%, up from the first quarter, reflecting good revenue management efforts. The internal service revenue decline of 1.7% or less than $1 million was due mainly to a lower contribution from Data Management and fewer destruction projects in the UK. In the Other International segment, which includes the larger legacy Recall Australian business, we continue to see strong storage internal revenue growth of 7.1% and improving margins. Service internal growth in this segment was impacted by the high level of Recall destruction projects underway a year ago. The Adjusted EBITDA margin in Other International was 29.2% in the second quarter, continuing to improve year-over-year. Remember that this segment, representing emerging markets plus Recall's larger Australian and New Zealand business, now account for over 20% of total revenues. In our Corporate and Other segment, we recorded the lease termination fee in our Data Center business, that drove a very high internal storage growth on a percentage basis given the small base. The Fine Arts Storage business also had a strong quarter driven by new sales leadership and implementation of enhanced sales management tools, as well as a focus on customer retention and operational efficiencies. Touching on slide 9 quickly, this shows the relative size of each segment by product line and the contribution to our results through a storage and service lens. Storage provides over 80% of Adjusted gross profit with the remainder from service. We continue to innovate on new offerings for our customers focusing on value-added services, which deliver gross profit growth. Before turning to our outlook for 2017, let me quickly touch on the composition of our global business as well as our balance sheet. Remember that roughly 70% of Adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. is in U.S. dollars, demonstrating the limited impact foreign exchange fluctuations have on our results. Also, we continued to match our foreign-denominated debt to create natural currency hedges to mitigate translation exposure, while also being tax-efficient. At quarter end, 23% of our debt is in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In keeping with this focus, in May, we completed a \u20ac300 million senior unsecured note offering. We had great execution resulting in a transaction that was historically significant, and we believe that at a 3% coupon was the second lowest coupon ever for a reverse Yankee issuance. This reflects bondholders' understanding of the health of our business, durability of cash flows and strength of our balance sheet. We're keeping a close eye on market conditions and may have additional opportunities for refinancing activity later this year. We maintain liquidity of nearly $1.3 billion at quarter end and our lease-Adjusted debt ratio remained at 5.8 times, which is in line with our expectations. Let's turn to our guidance for 2017 summarized on page 10 of the results presentation. Our core outlook remains unchanged on a constant dollar basis. However, we are updating underlying assumptions for the acquisition of FORTRUST and increased our internal revenue growth expectations for storage. With our strong first half internal growth momentum, we now anticipate internal storage rental revenue growth to range from 2.5% to 3% for the year, an increase of 50 basis points driven by both volume growth and pricing improvement. Our EBITDA guidance is unchanged. As noted earlier, we had $6 million of onetime benefits in the second quarter, which we expect to be offset by the timing of acquisition activity and the divestment of our Russian and Ukrainian businesses. In addition, our shared service implementation costs as well as investments in data technology and consumer storage are weighted to the second half of the year. Therefore, after a strong sequential increase in Adjusted EBITDA, we expect a flatter progression of growth from here to the end of the year. Regarding AFFO, our range of guidance for the full year is unchanged with maintenance CapEx and cash taxes increasing in the second half of the year relative to the first half. With the FORTRUST acquisition expected to close in the third quarter, we haven't Adjusted EBITDA or EPS guidance ranges given that we will have only a partial year contribution of results and will incur integration costs. We don't intend to exclude these integration costs from our Adjusted EBITDA definition in the same manner as we do for Recall costs, as this is more of an ordinary course acquisition in terms of size. Also, the partial year addition to revenue from this deal would be subsumed within our guidance range. However, from an investment standpoint, we are assuming an additional $128 million of growth capital, of which $73.5 million funded from the private placement of shares to the seller based on the average price prior to closing. Therefore, our outlook reflects an increase of about 2 million shares outstanding or roughly 1 million shares on the 2017 weighted average share count. Turning to slide 11, our projected cash available for distribution and investments, or CAD, also remains unchanged other than for FORTRUST. For 2017, we continue to expect CAD to cover our anticipated full-year dividend and required maintenance capital expenditures, with approximately $120 million of capital remaining to support core growth racking and other discretionary value-creating investments. The private placement of shares and borrowings will fund the estimated $345 million needed for growth investments including FORTRUST and excluding Recall costs. Slide 12 shows the same information, but in a sources and uses format based on our AFFO guidance for the year. As we can see, AFFO, which by definition adds back non-cash items and deducts maintenance CapEx, covers the dividend, as well as acquisitions of customer relationships and inducements with the same $120 million of cash remaining. That $120 million plus debt and private placement equity as shown is adequate to address the investment in FORTRUST, our existing data center development plus acquisitions, real estate investments and innovation. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and remain well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for the year, having maintained strong internal growth momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open up for Q&A. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Stuart. Just a couple of high-level comments before we turn it over to Q&A. First, we have had a very strong quarter in terms of the financials perspective, 4% internal storage revenue growth, year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion of 330 basis points excluding all the one-time items and strong AFFO growth which continues to drive dividend growth and to deleverage the business. Second, incoming trailing 12-month volume growth has gone from 44 million cubic feet to 50 million cubic feet after absorbing Recall, showing the robustness and quality of the business, the physical storage side. And third, we've made significant progress in building our higher growth segment aided by M&A, both in the emerging markets and now in the data center space. With that, I'd like to turn it over to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first questioner today is going to be Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mr. Steinerman .... Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sorry about that. My question is within the internal storage guide, could you give us a sense of how much net pricing benefits? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, you can see it in terms of the \u2013 you see the difference, Andrew, between the 4% internal revenue growth and you see the increase in volume. So you can kind of \u2013 we don't do it on a like-for-like basis as always, one's on a trailing 12 month and one's quarter-over-quarter but ... Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...but you can kind of see that we're getting significantly more price than we have in the past. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And last question. On the internal guide of 2.5% to 3% for the year, are you counting second quarter as 4.0% or the higher number? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: We are counting the second quarter as a 4.0% because we're stripping out the SimpliVity termination when HP bought them. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And the next question for today is going to be Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the FORTRUST acquisition. First as a clarification, you are buying the real estate as part of this deal? And then secondly, the 13 times pricing on synergized EBITDA, what's included in that synergized EBITDA? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. So, we \u2013 so Karin, we are buying the real estate \u2013 we're buying the whole business including the real estate. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: And the 13 time synergize is after also building out the additional 7 megawatts of capacity. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: And fully leasing... Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Karin, it's just to clarify. It's really \u2013 so it's the \u2013 if you look at the current run rate of EBITDA with the leases that they have in place, if there are \u2013 we have couple leases signed that haven't taken occupancy yet. And the synergize also, there is a little bit of synergies, not a lot. And then a build out of some of the existing spaces and it's not the future development space. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Does it include getting the 75% leased portion up to call it stabilization... Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. It's stable \u2013 fully stabilized yield which is if you look at sort of a 95% occupancy, you're going to get a yield there of call it 12%. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...on the initial purchase and then obviously a higher yield on the future development. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Great. Second question is just on the Northern Virginia Data Center. Can you just talk about leasing progress on that and when you would expect to hit stabilization on that development as well? development as well? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Originally, we've guided that it will take us about three years to get stabilized on that. I think it will be a bit faster than that. But I think in terms of pre-leasing activity, we had a few small customers already coming, but we had a lot of people, in fact this week, we had a tour of someone looking at both Northern Virginia as well as Denver. He's looking for in the new order of a couple of megawatts at both facilities. So, we feel pretty good in terms of where the interest in terms of that facility. We've already had quite a few sales tours, looking at that and it comes online as said in the middle of August. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Great. Last question is just for Stuart, on debt to EBITDA and you said the 5.8 time, this quarter was in-line with your expectations, are you still expecting to get debt to EBITDA down to 5.6 times at year-end or has that target changed with the incremental acquisitions you've made this quarter? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It'll still be around 5.6 times, you've got to remember, we've funded it \u2013 the seller actually wanted to take Iron Mountain stock and so we were able to fund that with the basically same leverage ratio as the existing balance sheet. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is going to be Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please go ahead. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. I guess, I'd maybe ask a couple of questions here on service to start out with. I noticed that North American Rim service was plus 1.3%, that's continuing a trend of relatively positive results. Are you working on any large projects that are happening here in the last couple of quarters or this rate of service growth in North American Rim is sustainable? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. No, I think it's more than sustainable and, in fact, although these were more in Western Europe, we had a few projects that have slipped into the third quarter, because the timing on these things is never exact. So we feel pretty good about the pipeline on the service side. And as you can see, the North American was naturally our primary focus in terms of getting our service pipeline built up because it's by far the largest portion of our service revenue. Most of it comes from North America, but we see good progress across the spectrum looking at Europe and also data management in terms of building the pipeline. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The one thing I'll add is that the first half was helped by the higher paper prices that we will be cycling against. It started to increase last year August, September. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess, Stuart, on the financial statement, I just noticed in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation as well as the Adjusted EPS reconciliation there is the other income line actually had a pretty significant number. I think it was like almost $40 million in EBITDA and $0.07 in EPS. So I was just wondering if you could give us some detail as to what that is? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's really all boiled down to FX and the change in FX in the quarter, and you can see that impact also in the supplemental where we go back and adjust FX out of that in the, what is that on page, pull it up real quick, but you can see it was about a 1% impact in the second quarter in terms of growth rates, and so that just flows through to the other. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Final question here just on the guidance. I just want to understand, check my understanding of this. On the FORTRUST acquisition, it sounded like the income statement impact because it's partial year or whatever it gets absorbed in the range, but the capital structure impact is in fact included in the guidance that you've given today. Is that right? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: That's correct. That's correct. So even as Karin asked a few minutes ago, even with that, we can keep getting the leverage down close to 5.6%. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And I can't imagine Russia, Ukraine was too much revenue, but what was the annualized revenue from that, if you don't mind us asking? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It was about $12 million. In the year, the impact was about $12 million, so an annualized basis call it $15 million or $16 million of annualized revenue, maybe $18 million... Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Maybe $18 million. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: $18 million annualized impact on revenue. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And the next question today is going to be Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Stuart, can you just walk through kind of some of the give and takes in the quarter? I guess starting on revenue, onetime benefit from a lease termination, I think you said that was $6 million. What was the in-quarter impact negative from disposition of Russia, Ukraine? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. So the in-quarter impact was pretty small; the impact for rest of the year, so it was probably about a $0.5 million impact on negative impact on EBITDA. You'll end up seeing a piece of that in the second half actually flow through sort of other income, right, because now we have a 25%, we will maintain a 25% investment, so as a minority, so it comes out of EBITDA, but we continue to remain invested in Russia. So you'll end up picking some of that back up from an EPS and AFFO standpoint. But Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What about revenue? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...of the $6 million the biggest piece of that was the lease termination fee and it was about $2 million impact from the other \u2013 from the accrued earn-out that we ended up not paying. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, but \u2013 how much, I know you said $0.5 a million impact on EBITDA on the quarter from Russia, Ukraine. How much was the Russia impact? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I mean, that's the biggest piece of it. We don't breakout EBITDA by country, so. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. What I am trying to get is that there, if I'm trying to normalize the revenue for the quarter so if we take out $6 million from the termination plus the accrued in that earn out, I also wonder if we have to remove any disposition, so I'm looking on a go-forward basis. So, what should I remove for the dispositions? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, this would be just under our smallest about a half \u2013 okay, so this is a disposition about a $0.5 million and the lease termination was about $4 million of the $6 million. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then... Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: And those are two adjustments, those are the normalizations you should make. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then for a currency headwind in the quarter what was the aggregate currency headwind during the quarter in from the company? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah that's \u2013 it is on slide 7 of the supplemental, it was about 1%, it was \u2013 yeah, about 1% impact. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the termination fee was because it compare the \u2013 the client got bought out and someone moved the business elsewhere? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, HP bought SimpliVity, here in Boston and then they moved it into their data center, they had the excess data center space so they is part of that acquisition they move SimpliVity out, but they paid out the contract. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then if I go ahead and look at the internal storage volume growth on the pages where you have those borrower's bars, it looks like they are below trend a little bit before the Recall acquisition. So, if I go back, it just looks like North America and other international just seems to be a little bit lower than they were before the four large borrower's bars with the \u2013 with Recall, I want to know if there is any commentary on that? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: That's just increasing the base, I mean it's the \u2013 because now the base is 20% bigger than it was before with Recall volume in there. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, I should divide it by 0.8 to get kind of a more normalized of what I should think about it? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, not really let me get it \u2013 your \u2013 we're sort of try to talk about it from a volume basis, right. The volume is up and as you can see that in the that in the charts in the earnings presentation, but your denominator like your base of what you're comparing that growth to, that 9 million cubic feet over the last four quarters, is your growth that you're dividing that by 20% figure base, so you can't just take that \u2013 we can't just take that times 0.8 normalized. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. I think, I mean, I think the way I would think about modeling on a go forward basis is do it around the absolute, right. In other words, the new absolute. We said that over trailing 12 months we have gone from $44 million to $50 million of incoming volume. So, I would kind of think about it in terms of the absolute rather than just try to mess around with the percentages. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. I'll just probe that a little more offline, but just if you go to page 28 of this supplemental, there is this bar chart that looks like volume has been coming down and I was just wondering if you can give us if you look at top left like year-over-year growth in units' storage, in records management storage portfolio in cubic feet, can you just explain to us what that is exactly, I guess it's down 2.1% Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. So that utilization, you got to remember that the divestments are in that as well. So, you get impacted by the disposals that we've done related to the Recall transaction. So, those divestments as well as Russia right, so go down even in Q1 because of the divestments. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. So it's all divestment related? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's what I'm getting to. Okay, pretty good. Thank you. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think the divestments is about 14 million impact cumulative, yeah \u2013 yeah 14 million cu was the impact. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, then it would have been flat, if I put it together just year-over-year? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. It would have been up a little bit, but... William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: One of the areas that we continue to improve through our real estate consolidation. So, generally the trend line is moving up, but you have to take out this one off. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. All right, I'll ask you more offline on that. But, thank you very much. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And our next questioner today is Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Hey, I wonder if you could just a following up on Andrew's question. The boost of the storage internal on the pricing side, was that primarily step up in pricing on Recall or was that across the base business? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's across the base business, we've been -- Kevin we've been, as you know that you can plan the stores while they \u2013 we started building up our revenue management expertise probably three years ago. And it takes a while for that to bleed through just the natural tenure of our contracts and we're really starting to make \u2013 you starting to see the progress that we've been working on three years now starting to bleed through into the pricing across the business. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it, got it. And then just on the slide 11, where you talk about the cash available for the FORTRUST, is it the full $130 million or should we adjust it for the private placement of stocks, till maybe to not $350 million, it should be the $345 million or so less the price, private placement or in terms of incremental capital or is that, I am thinking in terms of cash need? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: $345 million is not our cash right, as we've been talking about in investor day, there are different things that we can do to fund our growth, obviously borrowing is a piece of it, if you can see clearly on the next slide you got the private placement of debt and we've also even got capital recycling. So, we continue to do some real estate investment as well, that you don't really see above the service, above the surface, because we are selling some real estate to acquire real estate in better locations or where we want to grow. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. So, that's all, all different avenues in terms of funding? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, if you look at the next slide, if you look at slide 12, we can clearly see sort of Yeah. If you look at the next slide. If you look at slide 12, you can clearly see the sort of funding it shows the source of expectation. Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : There look to be no further questions. So, this will conclude the Q&A session and today's conference call.

Baird Michael Cohen - JPMorgan Karin Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Melissa Marsden : Thank you, Austin. Good day and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. We appreciate that the timing of today's call is a bit unusual for our U.S. audience as we are conducting it today from Sydney, Australia and will be meeting with some new and legacy Recall investors later today and tomorrow. The user-controlled slides that we will be referring to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us/Investors/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights, press release, the presentation and the full supplemental financial information together in one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com, under Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all the related documents as one 8-K, which is also available on the Web site. On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Referring now to Page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2017 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the safe harbor language on this slide, and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this supplemental financial information package. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Meaney : Thank you, Melissa, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report strong third quarter financial and operating results and solid progress against our 2020 plan. We achieved financial performance in line with our expectations and drove robust internal revenue growth and enhanced profitability across the business. Our results reflect the durability of our high margin storage business and improved contribution from Recall synergies and our transformation initiative, both of which have enhanced profitability and cash flow growth. As a result, today we also announced a 6.8% increase in our quarterly dividend per share, well in excess of inflation. Even after this growth in the dividend, we expect the payout ratio to be a little below our prior guidance with the previous lower dividend per share rate. During the quarter we made meaningful progress on the execution of our strategic plan across all facets of the business. As you know, our plan is focused on extending our durable business model through continued investment in our core developed markets, expanding into faster growing emerging markets and adjacent storage related businesses such as data center and art storage, and capturing opportunities to provide new innovative solutions to both our new and existing customers. We also achieved internal storage rental revenue growth of 3.5%, which reflects our revenue management focus and 1.3% growth in internal records management volume or prior to the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. As noted last quarter, trailing 12 month volume growth now includes Recall volume in the base which increased by about 20%, making percentage growth figures a bit lower even though the growth in underlying cubic feet of records remains consistent. In fact, new volume from new and existing customers of 49 million cubic feet over the past 12 months is consistent with last quarter's reported figure and compares favorably with pre-Recall levels of about 43 million cubic feet on a trailing 12 months basis, which you can see in the chart in the appendix. These favorable trends demonstrate the consistency of customer service behaviors, and importantly, these new records stay with us for an average of 15 years. Slide 4 is a review of the highlights related to our strategic plan. In developed markets, which include both our North American RIM and Western European segment, we achieved weighted average internal storage revenue growth of 3.2% with 1 million cubic feet of net internal volume growth on a trailing-12 month basis. We are pleased with the durability of volume growth and our ability to achieve price gains in developed markets. In addition, I am pleased to report solid progress from our dedicated focus on the U.S. federal market opportunity. We recently secured an additional multiyear contract from the United States Patent and Trademark Office or PTO. We will be responsible for relocating more than 4.5 million patent files, which includes capturing file level metadata, packing, removal, and transportation of all records to our secure federal government compliant storage facility. This contract reflects our unique ability to address the government's needs for improving the security and accessibility of government owned records with superior chain of custody and highly responsive service, while helping to reduce its operational expenses and real estate footprint. With this award, we now protect all significant repositories of PTO's intellectual property, including their data center and continuity of operations records, their patent and trademark files in micrographic format, and their hard copy patent files. Looking at our goal of expanding our business into faster growing emerging markets, we are at about 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, almost double the relative size from about 10% just three years ago. Progress against this goal was supported by emerging market acquisitions closed during the quarter, including the acquisition in Cyprus noted on last quarter's call and a small deal in South Africa totaling about $25 million. In adjacent businesses, we have laid the foundation for significant expansion of our data center and entertainment services businesses, both of which have growth rates in excess of those of the traditional records management, data management businesses. Turning to Slide 5. During the quarter we opened the first phase of our Northern Virginia data center campus in late September with the first third of that building being fully developed and more than 50% pre-leased. When adding existing capacity from our Boston, Boyers, Pennsylvania, and Kansas City locations to current and planned expansion capacity associated with recent acquisitions and Northern Virginia development, we have the potential to provide roughly 110 megawatts of multi-tenant and hyper scale data center capacity. We have included a capacity Slide in the appendix of this presentation for your reference. We see the data center business as an area where one plus one equals three. In other words, we see our unique combination of additional data center capacity plus our deep data management customer base has an opportunity to add significant value and achieve higher fill rates. In September, we closed on the acquisition of FORTRUST, which we discussed on our last conference call. We also entered into a sale leaseback agreement for two Credit Suisse data centers in London and Singapore, among the fastest growing global markets in terms of data center absorption. We expect to close this transaction in Q1 2018. After closing, we will have the ability to leverage the existing infrastructure and in 12 to 18 months time, develop up to 10 megawatts of new data center capacity in both buildings for lease to other customers. The sale leaseback structure is attractive to both us and corporate data center operators who increasingly are utilizing such strategies to refine their IT infrastructure. Most enterprise data center facilities are over-engineered and overbuilt. We can help these companies monetize their assets as they look to focus on core capabilities whilst regenerate rental income from captive, high credit quality tenants, and develop the remaining capacity to support new customer requirements. Synergies will come over time as we build out the additional data center capacity and gain economies of scale from the existing operations. Operational costs are in place to scale up the business in these locations. We expect a double digit stabilized yield from this transaction following build out and lease up of the expansion capacity. As noted earlier, this transaction is not part of our 2020 growth plan. That plan, which didn\u2019t assume data center acquisitions also did not assume the issuance of equity. You may have noted that at the time we announced the Credit Suisse deal, we also filed a registration statement for an ATM or at the market equity issuance plan. We think ATM issuances are prudent way to match and to fund smaller transactions that are not included in our core M&A plan. Our ATM plan can support up to 500 million of equity issuance over time, but we have earmarked just $100 million, about 2.5 million shares or less than 1% of total outstanding for the Credit Suisse deal. Also in adjacent businesses, we acquired Bonded Services, a leading provider of media asset management services for global entertainment and media companies for approximately 57 million pounds or $77 million. This acquisition is included in our year-to-date total of approximately $195 million, of which $55 million with the cash portion of the FORTRUST consideration. Entertainment and media companies require specialized services for protecting and preserving intellectual property whilst also making sure then can monetize it. Such as the project for MTV's 30th anniversary that we supported last year and similar relationships with major studios, recording artists and sports franchisees. Providing these customers with both physical and digital storage as well as capabilities transform content from monetization and longer term preservation in one place is ideal. Bonded also provides fine art vaults and shipping, logistics and distribution and related services through locations in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, The Netherlands and Hong Kong. And it doubles our existing entertainment services businesses and solidifies our position as the partner of choice. Turning to Slide six. We also made good progress on our innovation agenda in moving certain projects out of the garage. We launched Iron Cloud and expanded our Policy Center offering which we previewed at April's investor day. Iron Cloud's on demand storage can be accessed through a secure connection from customers to our network of secure data center and caters to the unique security and operational needs of medical imaging surveillance video and other specialty media. Our suite of data management solutions enables organizations to manage risk by complying with industry standards and implement advanced schemes to protect against cyber attacks. Just in a few short weeks since the launch, we have already secured a major win with an U.K. pharmaceutical company. To wrap up, we had a very eventful quarter with solid fundamental results underpinning our progress with new initiatives and the expansion of our faster growing emerging markets and adjacent businesses. We continue to leverage our deep customer relationships and leading brand attributes of trust and security to offer more technology enabled solutions as our customers continue to transform to a more digital way of working. These are early days but we are encouraged by the progress we are seeing and we will continue to be disciplined about how and where we deploy capital to accelerate growth outside the traditional businesses. Our progress supports growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that ultimately underpins our ability to grow our dividend per share and to delever over time. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart Brown : Thank you, Bill, and good day everyone. We are excited to report another strong quarter of continuing growth at our core storage rental business and good progress increasing our capital flexibility through our refinancing activity. We remain steadily on track to deliver on our financial objectives and strategic goals with a disciplined investment strategy. As Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth and business durability that our board of directors increased the fourth quarter dividend by 6.8% to approximately $0.59 per share, reflecting an annualized rate of $2.35 per share, up from $2.20 per share previously. On today's call I will provide some color on the third quarter's operational and financial drivers, touch on the implications of our refinancing activity and then cover our outlook for 2017. As we have noted previously, we will issue specific 2018 guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings call in February, consistent with most peers. As you see on Slide 7, which shows our key financial metrics, our third quarter total revenues grew 2.4% over last year or 1.4% on a C$ basis, impacted by the disposition of our legacy Australian business as well as our businesses in Russia and Ukraine. Internal storage rental revenue growth was a strong 3.5% in the quarter, while internal service revenue declined 20%. The growth in internal storage revenue resulted from our revenue management focus and continued growth in internal global net volume. That is growth prior to acquisitions and dispositions. Our gross profit margin improved 210 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by synergies from the Recall acquisition and the flow through of our revenue management program, partly offset by $3.5 million charge associated with the recent natural disasters. In particular, our service gross profit has improved by $10 million year-over-year to $102 million. In addition, SG&A as a percentage of total revenues decreased 20 basis points year-over-year excluding Recall costs due to the benefits of our transformation initiatives and synergies. Compared to a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter grew about 10% to $323 million. That\u2019s growth of over 8% on a C$ basis and the adjusted EBITDA margin increased 230 basis points to 33.5%. AFFO was $210 million in the third quarter, an increase of $32 million or about 19% from last year. The strong growth resulted from the almost 10% increase or $29 million of growth in adjusted EBITDA and more than funds the 7% dividend increase we announced today. Touching on Slide 8 quickly. This shows the relative size of each product line and the contribution of our results split between storage and service and showing line of business. Over 80% of our adjusted gross profit is derived from storage activities with a 75% gross profit margin. We continue to innovate our new service and storage offerings for our customers focusing on value added services that deliver gross profit growth and we are pleased with the progress supporting our strategic objectives for developed and emerging markets. Turning to Slide 9 and internal growth performance. You see developed markets, which includes North America records and information management, North America data management and western Europe, as well as other international, which includes our emerging markets businesses as well as Australia. Almost half of our total revenues comes from the developed markets storage business which grew internal storage revenue by 3.2%, largely from our revenue management initiatives including programs to improve customer mix. In total, in developed markets we achieved internal volume growth of 0.2% for the third quarter on a trailing 12-month basis as illustrated on Slide 15 of the appendix. Turning to North America records and information management specifically. Whilst internal volume growth was negative 0.2%, we continue to see strong internal storage revenue growth of 3.5% in the quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate North America internal storage revenue growth to be north of 2.5% with flat internal volume growth, plus or minus, as we work to optimize returns, balancing revenue management and capital efficiencies. Internal service revenue in developed markets was down 0.1% as growth in information governance, digital imaging projects, tread activity and other project based revenue was offset by lower activity in the data management and other businesses and slightly lower paper prices. In other international, we continue to see strong internal storage revenue growth of 5%. Service internal growth in this segment was flat as we cycle over a high level of Recall [construction] [ph] projects underway a year ago. And you can see in our supplemental reporting package, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded in all segments compared to the year ago except in North America data management where we continue to invest in new product development as Bill discussed. Adjusted EBITDA margins in this business segment though continue to be a healthy 53%. As a reminder our corporate and other segment includes overhead costs as well as adjacent businesses such as data center and fine art. Internal results are impacted by the small comparative base from a year ago as well as integration costs associated with recent acquisitions in this segment. Shifting now to our balance sheet. We opportunistically executed several meaningful debt transactions in the third quarter which together provide increased capital flexibility and term out our borrowings that you see on Slide 10. First, we amended our credit facility with improved covenants which increased flexibility and better recognized the value of our real estate holdings thereby reducing our lease adjusted leverage ratio. Second, we redeemed 200 million Canadian dollar senior notes due 2021, utilizing revolving credit capacity. Additionally, we redeemed $1 billion of senior notes due 2020 at a 6% rate and issued new senior notes at 4.875% due 2027. Lastly, we extended and increased our AR securitization program. In total, these actions extended our average maturity to 6.5 years reduced our average cost of debt by about 30 basis points, resulting in approximately $18 million in annualized interest expense savings. We incurred a charge for debt extinguishment cost of $48 million in the quarter. The attractive pricing reflects bondholders understanding the health of our business and durability of our cash flows. As of the end of the quarter, we had reduced our lease adjusted leverage ratio to 5.5 times from 5.8 times in Q2 and increased the capacity available on our capital structure remaining on track with our plan to reduce our lease adjusted leverage. Let's turn to our guidance for 2017 which is summarized on Page 11 of the results presentation. Our core guidance remains unchanged. So given where we are in the year, we are converting guidance to reported dollar or R$. Given the somewhat limited net impact of currency changes, we expect to remain within the same guidance ranges on a C$ and reported dollar basis. Given we have increased our outlook for storage internal revenue growth to be between 3% and 3.5% from 2.5% to 3%. As a result of this better growth in considering a modest benefit from exchange rate, 2017 total revenues are expected to be near the high end of the guidance range. On adjusted EBITDA, we are maintaining our guidance range despite the delayed timing of acquisitions though still incurring integration costs, the impact of the Russia Ukraine dispositions as well as charges related to natural disasters, which were partly offset by favorable exchange rates and onetime items we highlighted in the second quarter. As a reminder, our shared service implementation costs as well as innovation investments are weighted to the latter part of the year. As a result, we expect only limited adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. Following on the strong margin improvement in 2017, we remain on track with our 2020 plan to deliver about 200 to 250 basis points of margin improvements from our underlying business as outlined at our investor day, implying an improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins of 50 to 75 basis points in 2018. In addition, our expectation for the 2017 structural tax rate is now 21% to 22%, driven by changes in our business mix. For 2017, the increase in taxes will only be somewhat offset by the partial year benefit of the interest expense savings. Touching on AFFO guidance. We expect to be closer to the upper end of the range of $760 million, as we expect total maintenance and non-real estate investment to be roughly $150 million for the year, benefitting from better efficiencies and discipline following the acquisition of Recall. In turn, we expect an improved dividend payout ratio relative to AFFO considering also the dividend increase we have just announced. The FORTRUST and Bonded acquisitions are not expected to have a significant financial impact this year given the partial year contribution and the integration cost associated with both transactions. Remember also that FORTRUST was partially funded by a private placement of shares to the seller, so our outlook reflects an increase of about 2 million shares outstanding, or roughly 1 million shares on a weighted average basis for 2017. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter, reflecting the hard work and discipline across the organization. We remain well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for 2017 and our performance continues to be underscored by the durability of our storage rental business which builds our cash flow growth thereby funding investment to continue growth and returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open up to Q&A. William Meaney : Thank you, Stuart and just to sum up. We had a very good quarter punctuated by another period with strong revenue growth and particularly strong storage revenue growth of 3.5% before acquisitions. We continue to be on track with our integration of Recall which shows through our continued growth in EBITDA margin. Based on this performance, we have pulled forward our anticipated 6.8% dividend per share increase by a quarter and even with this payout ratio of roughly 80% of AFFO, we will be below our original guidance for the year with the previously lower dividend. We continue to make good progress in our adjacent business areas with the closing of the FORTRUST data center business in this quarter and the announcement of our agreement to purchase some of Credit Suisse's data centers. And doing all this whilst improving our financial flexibility, extending debt maturity and reducing our interest cost. With that, I would like to turn the call over to the operator so we can begin Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Good morning in Australia. Another solid storage same store revenue growth of 3.5%. You did cite the yield management system. I am just wondering if there are any other factors driving that strong growth relative to your 2016 kind of growth levels. William Meaney : No. I mean you can see if you look at the overall business, it's the result of the volume growth that we had. And so if you look across the whole business it\u2019s positive volumes, and the revenue management together yield to 3.5%. But I think that the most -- the big difference as you say, the year ago, Sheila, is the revenue management program that we started putting in place two years ago. And it takes a while to ramp that through as contracts becomes renewed. And you can see the difference between, say, North America, from an internal revenue growth versus Europe. Where in Europe we are probably about a year behind, in developed markets as well, about a year behind from when we rolled it out in North America. So we think there is still more to be done specifically in Europe and developed markets as those results are flowing through from the work that we did starting a year ago in those geographies. But a big part of it is the revenue management systems. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Great. And just one follow up. On the data center space, I know it's still small in your adjacent business, but you are allocating more capital there. I just was wondering if you could talk about pricing of the two acquisitions. How you look at it? Is it just on a stabilized basis or how you are underwriting it because I realize it's a competitive environment out there. William Meaney : It's a good question, Sheila. You can probably appreciate having watched -- having you watched this phase for a while. We have passed on more than we actioned. In other words, it's an area where you have to be disciplined in terms of your capital allocation. So our first and foremost thing is to make sure that on a stabilized basis that we get the types of returns that makes sense given our cost of capital, both on an IRR and an NPV type basis. So typically what we find is that if we are doing a Greenfield like northern Virginia, you are kind of in the 14%-15% internal rate of return. And when we do the acquisitions, it is that we are pretty disciplined if we look at something that\u2019s north of 11%. So it is a little bit - it's fair that when you are buying something with revenue already attached to it, it is a little bit lower in terms of internal rate of return; but on the other side is, you are taking less risk, right. Because it's coming across with customers. So when we look at it, we first look at it on an NPV and IRR basis and we also look at the cost of acquiring a megawatt versus what it costs us to build it out. So we kind of look at two different lenses and that goes without saying as we only focus on high quality assets. And high quality assets is not just the physical aspect of the building, but it's also that the absorption rates we see in the markets that they operate in. So we are really excited about, for instance, the Credit Suisse, and we look forward to closing that because London and Singapore are amongst the best markets globally in terms of absorption and specifically the London operation is in the [Floyd] [ph] estate, which is a great location. And Denver is also in the top ten markets. A great question. Stuart Brown : Yes. The only thing I would add real quickly, Stuart, is that if you look at it on a replacement cost basis, which Bill touched on, FORTRUST, we paid about $13 million per megawatt. And you need to remember, this 85% lease. So that in itself is good and then the cost to build out the future capacity is actually -- that\u2019s $6 million a megawatt. So you sort of think about where the replacement cost is, we feel really good about this investment as well for instance. Operator : The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So why are you guys not giving guidance out for '18? Again, usually you have been doing that ever since I have been covering you. Just why are you not giving it out now? Stuart Brown : Shlomo, this is Stuart. I will take that one. Since I have just joined a year ago when we issued guidance at the third quarter. So what you are seeing is that -- and you see sort of some of the things have changed even now in terms of how the business changes from February to March. And the end of the day, we have given 2020 outlook out there at our investor day. So you have got a little bit of a roadmap to work from already. And we would be able to give the most appropriate guidance, it's really better for us to get 2017 closed out to what final results are, tax rates, things like that. So in February we will be able to give a better quality guidance in the sense of number of business decisions that have been made. So this is something we talked about really back in the first quarter already. I think actually in the fourth quarter last year we had mentioned this. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So did you say anything -- I missed something about adjusted EBITDA set up for, I thought you said for '18. Did you make any comments about the EBITDA for '18 or I just misheard that. Stuart Brown : Yes. I mean basically I said consistent with the 2020 plan that we expect EBITDA margins would be 50 to 75 basis points higher in '18 relative to '17. Shlomo Rosenbaum : I mean based on what I am seeing in terms of both the transformation, the integration, some of the pricing, that sounds like kind of a low ball number to me. Stuart Brown : No. We will give more detailed guidance in February. We are just trying to lay out the roadmap with what the 2020 plan is and that\u2019s consistent with that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And can you just talk a little bit more about the North American volumes. You are negative by two-tenths of a percent, last quarter one tenth of a percent. Excuse me, this quarter one tenth of a percent to last quarter. I think you alluded a little bit to the kind of juggling between pricing and volume over there. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit more? William Meaney : Yes, sure. Shlomo, this is Bill. So I think the best way to think about it, if you look at North America and western Europe, right. Both very similar markets in terms of level of maturity. If we look at this quarter in North America rim, we had 3.5% internal revenue storage growth and in western Europe we had 2.3%. And then if you look at the volume that\u2019s made up that, is that in, as you pointed out, North America was negative 0.2% and western Europe was, internal volume growth of positive 2%. So this tells you where we are -- we are obviously a little bit ahead in North America than we are in Europe in terms of rolling out the revenue management system. We started rolling it out about a year ago in Europe. And what we are doing with the revenue management is optimizing it. For sure, when you adjust price it does at some point affect the speed of incoming volume from customers and you can see that a little bit happening in the divergence between North America and western Europe. But at the end of the day what we are interested in is what you eat is cash. And so we are really happy with the North American results that we had 3.5% internal storage revenue growth. And that allows us to even further optimize the CapEx because we are getting more value for stakes on the shelf, if you will. So western Europe at 2.3%, I am not saying it's bad, we are actually -- we are happy with the 2.3% internal storage revenue growth but we think there is more to come. But there is some elasticity as you try to optimize that and you can see that in the North American and western European numbers this quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. That\u2019s good color. And then just two kind of metrics type numbers. I want to get some color on, first, my calculation on the mature markets is, between pricing and mix. The west was 2.7%-2.8%. Stuart, does that look right to you? And then also for Stuart, it looks like ARDSO moved up both sequentially and year-over-year. May be you could give us a little color on what's going on there. Stuart Brown : I missed the second question, Shlomo. Can you say it again? Shlomo Rosenbaum : The second question is receivables days. It looks like they were up to me sequentially and year-over-year. So just wondering what's going on over there. Stuart Brown : Yes. So the first question was specifically on developed markets? Shlomo Rosenbaum : I was just looking at total company -- I mean the days that I am getting were 73 days versus 69 days for the last two quarters and if I look year-over-year it looks like it was 67 days last turn 3Q '16. Stuart Brown : Yes. So on the -- going right to the first question. On the receivables, the receivables is up mostly in North America where AR is up and that\u2019s really driven by fewer collection days that we actually had in September in the U.S. And it was up a little bit in India as well. It was the other market where receivables are up. We had a tax law change there and so what you are seeing in India is little bit of a lag in terms of getting billing out and collections done as over a pretty short period of time. You have got an entire system in India changing to new tax regulations. So that\u2019s what's going on in the receivables. If you look at the developed markets and other international volumes which is in the appendix to the presentation, the net internal growth number there is about 0.2%. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. So we should see that reverse in the fourth quarter on receivables? Stuart Brown : Yes. You should see some improvement in trend in the fourth quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And I am sorry I have used up a lot of the time but just a pricing thing I want to confirm. Was that 2.7, 2.8 between mix and pricing sound right in developed markets. Stuart Brown : Yes. In total that\u2019s about right. Both North America and in Europe, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please go ahead. Andy Wittmann : Thank you for presenting the cash chart, that was very helpful. When I look at the cash chart, it looks like you took up your guidance for the year in terms of the customer inducements and customer relationship spend from $60 million from $35 million, which is a pretty decent amount, I would say. I wanted to ask you, Bill, what you are seeing in the marketplace? Was this just you guys being opportunistic on a select handful of deals or is the inducement need a little bit higher today to get those organic boxes in the door. William Meaney : Andy, you have been watching us long enough -- it's opportunistic and you can't time these things. When the opportunity arrives, it arrives. So there is always a little bit of movement up and down in that number because it's market driven. Andy Wittmann : Got you. And then I guess my next question was related to the Credit Suisse acquisitions. It sounds like there is already some vacancy there. Sounds like there might be a little bit more. Can you talk about the lease up plan and how long it takes to get to some level of stabilization? Maybe the way to look at it from our point of view externally is at what point do you get this to be FFO accretive. William Meaney : Yes, it's a great question. So the nature of the Credit Suisse acquisitions because they were running these for their own [books] [ph], is think of 2018 as the year when we have to move some of their operations out, which was not data center related, and then prepare the data halls for lease. So in '18 you will see the thing slightly dilutive, and then in '19 it's flat and by 2021 it's fully stabilized. So that\u2019s kind of the -- so already by 2019 you will see that it's flat to slightly accretive and that\u2019s really the first year that we are able to start leasing out part of that 10 megawatt that I talked about. So 2018 is effectively creating the 10 megawatts. Andy Wittmann : Got it. Thank you for that. Stuart, maybe one for you. I wanted to ask about, I guess sequentially here with the refinancing we got some benefit to the lease adjusted leverage ratio. Can you talk about the mechanics of the new credit agreement and how that had an impact on that reported results. I guess maybe the fundamental question there is, was it definitional? Was it mostly a definitional change or was there an improvement in the least adjusted ratio sequentially here? Stuart Brown : Yes. The most important is, is that if it was definitional, there was a change in the definition and calculation. But what that does is it improves the overall capacity in terms of where our leverage is today and where the covenants are to build real capacity and your ability to fund future growth if we needed again to be opportunistic. Our overall goal is to continue to reduce our lease adjusted leverage ratio. But the way the mechanics work or the key mechanics on the lease adjusted leverage ratio is that to adjust for rent expense and capitalize that in the lease adjusted number. The old credit facility was eight times rent, the new facility is six times rent. So we have got annual rent of around $300 million, right. That\u2019s reduced your overall leverage about $600 million. And the way -- the reason that that was done is essentially it was a backend way to give us credit for the value of the $28 million square feet that we actually own on balance sheet. The value of the real estate that we own is gone up since we lasted the credit facilities. We had to work out mechanism to give us credit for that and this is a way to do that. William Meaney : Yes. Andy, the important thing about these ratios is if you look at our total level of indebtedness, it's actually pretty consistent with our peer group, both on the industrial REIT and belt storage and the data center REITs. You don\u2019t see a big diversion. But the important thing is now at 5.5 we have a full turn against our most restrictive covenant which kicks in at 6.5. And what we have always said is, it's less about the absolute number, the 5.5 for instance, it's more about that we would like to see 1.5 over time we would like to see 1.5 to two turns of free board between our most restrictive covenant is versus our debt, it just gives us the flexibility to steward this thing. So right now, I mean the good news is we have got a full turn below where our most restrictive covenant is and over time as we have guided to, is we will see that widen to 1.5 or better. Andy Wittmann : Very helpful and very clear. I wanted to just go one other question on some of these matters and specifically talking around the usage of the ATM. I guess since the Credit Suisse deal is going to be funded with these fresh proceeds of the ATM, is it your intend, Bill, that you have those proceeds in the door before that closes. And maybe more broadly speaking, is the ATM going to be done under a 10b-51 plan or is it going to be at management's discretion opportunistically in the marketplace. William Meaney : It's going to be at management's discretion depending on the marketplace. I think again, looking at our balance sheet right now, we are not going to have guns to our heads to say that we are absolutely going to use the ATM to fund the Credit Suisse. Our intention is to do that and Stuart and myself in the board will make a decision on when to use the ATM but the good thing is we have the financial flexibility. So over time I think you are right. You look at a macro level, is it wasn\u2019t a coincidence that we announced the ATM when we announced the Credit Suisse acquisition because what we said at the 2020 plan stood on its own. But we didn\u2019t have any data center acquisitions built into that 2020 plan. So we just think an ATM is the very efficient and kind of great mechanism to fund specific acquisitions such as the Credit Suisse opportunity. So that\u2019s our intention. It's to use the ATM to kind of match fund these tuck-in acquisitions that weren't part of the original plan, original 2020 plan. But again with our balance sheet we have the flexibility on timing. We are not kind of forced to draw down any of it [today] [ph]. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Cohen : This is Michael Cohen for Andrew. Just a quick follow up on that discussion around leverage and the ATM. I mean it seems like a lot of financing capacity or flexibility coming on board. I mean is there anything particular that\u2019s driving that decision for more flexibility now versus some other point. William Meaney : I think, Michael, you can fill on this -- I think the year where we see the most relevance in the ATM quite frankly is the data center space. We feel really good at the results we have been able to build on over the last three years in the data center. We are really pleased in terms of the pre-lease commitment that we had in the Northern Virginia. So we are really seeing the proof points in the markets that one plus one equals three. So the ATM at this point is mainly focused on making sure if we see other opportunities like the FORTRUST and the Credit Suisse come down to pipe, that we have a mechanism or a tool and a tool kit that allows us to do that efficiently. So again we don\u2019t guide to acquisitions in the data center because as I pointed to out to Karen, or Sheila rather, is that we have passed on more than we executed on because we are pretty disciplined but at the same we are very pleased in terms of the traction that we are getting in that segment. Michael Cohen : Understood, thanks. And if I could just follow one quick question around, I know we touched on this on the North America volumes. And I knew you gave some color with North America and western Europe. Did you say for North America, I just want to make sure I got this that that customer's are holding back new volumes because of pricing. Is that what I heard or...? William Meaney : What you see is there is a relationship between organic volume growth from existing customers based on the pricing. I mean like people will determine whether or not they decide to store on side or how quickly they sent boxes in to trust to be stored depending on the price of that. Like anything else it's not completely inelastic. So we do try to optimize that and so we feel pretty good where we planned it right now and as Stuart remarked is that we expect volume going forward is as a result in North America to be kind of plus or minus with zero points as we continue to drive better results in terms of internal storage revenue growth. Because revenue growth is the thing that drives EBITDA which drives our ability to grow cash flows. It drives our ability to grow dividend. So that\u2019s really the name of the game. So since I have been in the company this is the best result that we had in North America overall, say looking at optimization. If you look at western Europe which as I say is similar level of maturity and similar customer behavior is much stronger internal volume growth but the overall result, in other words how much price growth we are getting at the same time is lower. So we are only getting 2.3% internal storage revenue growth and going forward we will continue to look to optimize western Europe as well. Operator : Our next question is from Karin Ford with UMFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford : First a clarification. Stuart, did you say that there would be limited EBITDA growth looking quarter-over-quarter from 3Q to 4Q and if so, just why is that? William Meaney : Yes. Consistent with what -- the answer is, yes, that\u2019s what I said. And that the main reasons for that are higher integration cost that we will be incurring and will flow through adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter as well as then the fact that the shared service cost of some of the innovation spend is backend weighted. So those are two main causes. The timing of acquisitions, right. Original guidance and assumed acquisitions would be earlier in the year, so you would have picked up the EBITDA and would have incurred the integration cost by now. Obviously, you get delayed EBITDA. The other thing is you also have gotten, from a year over year standpoint, we have disposed of Russia and Ukraine. It isn't sequentially but year-over-year basis. Karin Ford : Right. Got it. And the $3.5 million of disaster expenses, what line item is that in on the income statement? Stuart Brown : That is in corporate and other from a -- it's sitting in CFG. Sitting in sort of the corporate overhead costs. I am sorry, in cost of sales. Karin Ford : Okay. Great. And then just last question is, to sum the revenue management topic, I know you said you still think you have some more wood to chop there and you are going to get some more benefit from there. But once you get at sort of rolled fully through and get your system where you want it. Is that kind of a onetime benefit or do you think that that will help elevate core organic revenue growth going forward? William Meaney : It's a great question. We think the level that we are talking about -- if you look at 3.5% for the North America, we think that we can continue to maintain kind of north of 2.5% going forward. So there is a little bit of catch up but for the most part we feel really good that customers understand the value equation that we provide and they understand that that\u2019s kind of an appropriate level of price increase for them. Which will just naturally over time increase our margins as well. So we feel pretty good that we can continue to push that through. I think where we still have probably the most wood to chop, as I said is Europe and developed markets. I mean we already have started chopping that year, year and half ago but it just takes longer to because visible. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Congratulations on the dividend boost. So you are kind of 235 existing this year. If we look at kind of the equity issuance into '18, do we maintain the 235 or is it goal to kind of keep it at the 220 that it was throughout all the 2017? Or would there be a step up commensurate with the equity issuance to keep it at that 235. Stuart Brown : We would intend to keep the dividend rate the same, right. It's very consistent with what we said even back at investor day in terms of passing the synergies and transformation benefits back to shareholders. If you look at the dividend payout ratio, it's actually improving from what we have put out in the original guidance. So we have got plenty of capital to continue to fund the ongoing business and as Bill said, if we do think sort of our outside of the plan like the data center acquisitions, we would look to fund that either through ATM or we also have, or at least opportunities to sell some of our existing real estate to fund data center growth. William Meaney : Yes. Just to be clear, Kevin on that is, it's very [consistent] [ph] dividend per share. So we are very focused on growing dividend per share and we only increase dividend per share when we know we can maintain that as we said we are able to do that and at the same time improve our payout ratios as a percentage of AFFO. Kevin McVeigh : That\u2019s helpful. And then just going back to the pricing a little bit. Bill, so if we get to kind of 2.5, if you would, is there kind of a certain level we should think about where the unit volume growth settles. So if there is kind of a tradeoff, does that get to kind of 50 basis points of decline so it's a net two, or any thought around the sensitivity because as you price the price right it looks like the new volume growth has slowed a little bit. Does that -- is there an acceptable range? Is it 50 basis points of decline or anyway to think about the sensitivity of price to volume. William Meaney : Kevin, just to be clear, what we are talking about is internal revenue volume of storage growth. So that\u2019s net of any pluses or minuses. So when we said we did 3.5% in North America, that\u2019s assets are tracking out to 0.2% volume. So when Stuart guided that next year when you feel really good that we are going to be north of 2.5%, that\u2019s 2.5% net of any up or down in terms of volume. So that\u2019s including that. So at the end of the day which we guide on and focus on is internal revenue storage growth because that\u2019s what you eat. Right. That\u2019s what drives the dividend per share growth. Kevin McVeigh : I get that. I guess I am just trying to figure out is it, hypothetically would it be three percentage points of price that gets offset by 50 basis points of volume decline that gets you in that 2.5% or. William Meaney : No. No. I mean you don\u2019t see that now Kevin. If you look at the overall company, is we are up in terms of volume growth and up in terms of revenue growth on an internal basis. So, no, you don\u2019t get those types of swings. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Just wanted to follow up, just on items that were, I guess you would say taken out of the garage, Iron Cloud and Policy Center. Is there a significant startup cost on those items that, or is it going to be flowing through over the next several years as you try to grow those business. And can you give us just a little bit of color on that and how we should think of it. William Meaney : It's a great question Shlomo. First of all, as we look at both of those things, a lot of the original startup cost has already been come through. There is a little bit more development that we still have to do or we are doing on Iron Cloud to add more features to it. But that\u2019s kind of on a go forward basis. I mean where I see the bigger investment in both of those things is on the go to market side which typically have a shortage of patient period. I mean if we see an opportunity to ramp that up, we will talk about that on guidance in February for '18. But specifically for those two, most of where I would call the development cost, a little bit still ongoing which is about say building out more features, is pretty much done. And you have seen that in the lower service margins, in the EBITDA margins in data management process which was a reflection of some of the expense that we have done to launch Iron Cloud but still it was 53% but it's lower versus a year ago. But I think if we do make investments in either of those areas next year, it's more in the go to market side. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And what you talked about [adjacent] [ph], I mean I am just trying to think about what are you looking for because there are newer things that you are rolling out and clearly when there is a go to market and something like that, there is an investment that\u2019s going to show up on the numbers. When you are looking for a return on something like that, like what's the time that you expect to see like a material return on something like that. William Meaney : These things are pretty quick, right, because of just the nature and the size of the investment. And then if you look at pure market investment is that you are definitely getting a payback within two years and in some cases it's within a year. To be honest with it, the thing that we are looking at more on things like Iron Cloud because the market interest, and we have been getting a lot of positive feedback from some of the technical analysts on these things is it's more like the question is, is it something we can build and also do we need to use partners to really execute -- to take advantage of the opportunity. So those are kind of decisions we are going through. But on the go to market side you generally see fairly quick payback. It's definitely within two years and lots of times within the year that you make them. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. We currently have no more questions. William Meaney : Thank you, operator, and good evening for those in United States and good morning to all those here in Australia. Thanks a lot. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg-G, are included in this supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? Bill Meaney : Thank you, Melissa, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong finish to 2017, characterized by significant progress against our 2020 strategic plan, with solid momentum in the business and durable internal storage revenue growth clearly demonstrated in our fourth quarter results. Moreover, the acquisition of IO Data Centers coupled with Fortrust earlier in the year, provides us with the platform that will not only deliver our 2020 goals for Adjacent Business growth, but also drive higher and sustainable growth. As shown on Slide 3, we are well on track to having a business mix that will structurally deliver north of 5% EBITDA growth before acquisitions, up from about 3.5% as of the end of 2017. Turning to Slide 4. Full year revenue growth of 9% was slightly above our expectations. And adjusted EBITDA was in line with our outlook, up 16% over 2016, driven by strong internal growth, Recall synergies, transformation and a full year of contribution from Recall. This strong performance represents a 180 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins over 2016 and 220 basis points of improvement over the past two years despite the integration of Recall, which had historically lower margins than stand-alone Iron Mountain. In addition, AFFO for the full year was up more than 12%. Our strong 2017 performance benefited from favorable currency translation after three years of FX headwinds. For the fourth quarter, our results reflected continued strong internal storage rental revenue growth across the business. We achieved internal storage rental revenue growth of more than 4% in Q4, whilst internal service revenue growth was essentially flat, as expected, at minus 0.1%. In total, internal revenue growth was 2.5%, our strongest performance in the last 12 quarters. This healthy growth was supported by ongoing revenue management progress, primarily in North America, and continued worldwide net volume growth prior to the inclusion of acquisitions. We continued to generate positive net volume with seven million cubic feet globally before acquisitions over the past 12 months. This supports the durability of storage growth. And importantly, every one of these boxes is effectively in annuity for the next 15 years as new records stay with us on average for that length of time. We also made significant progress on the execution of our strategic plan.  As you will recall, our plan is focused on extending our durable business model through continued nurturing of our core developed markets, expanding into faster-growing emerging markets and growing our storage-related Adjacent Businesses such as art and entertainment services as well as data centers. We are doing this whilst capturing new service opportunities to provide innovative solutions to new and existing customers.  We have a robust outlook for 2018, reflecting continued successful execution against our 2020 strategic plan, and Stuart will have more details shortly. Slide 5 is a review of highlights related to our strategic plan. In developed markets, which include both our North American RIM and Western European segments, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 3.4%, with modestly positive internal volume growth on a trailing 12-month basis. As noted last quarter, internal storage revenue growth in North America and increasingly, in Western Europe, is driven by revenue management rather than by organic volume growth. It is important to note that whilst our successful revenue management efforts may marginally impact the incoming volume from existing customers, it has not significantly impacted new customer behavior nor has it caused an increase in customer terminations or destructions.  Given our successful implementation in North America, we plan to add revenue management resources to Western Europe and Asia, Latin America, Australia and Eastern Europe during 2018. Furthermore, we will continue to seek growth from existing customers through revenue management programs and sales of services, and we will focus on volume growth from further penetration of unvended customers such as those in the mid-market in the U.S. federal government segments. An example of the potential from the U.S. federal government can be seen from our press release last week reporting that we secured a records management win with the U.S. federal prison system. It can sometimes take 12 months or more to inbound records from the federal segment, therefore, this volume as well as that from the U.S. Patent Office awarded late last year are not yet reflected in our reported volume. Looking at our goal to expand to the faster-growing emerging markets, they now represent more than 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, almost double the relative size from about four years ago. Our progress against this goal was supported by emerging market acquisitions closed during the year totaling more than $87 million, which we purchased at a weighted average multiple of seven times stabilized EBITDA. Notable among emerging market deals in 2017 were : acquisition of the remaining portions of Santa Fe in South Korea, the Philippines and China; our entry into the Middle East; transactions in Peru, in Cyprus; a small shredding business in South Africa purchased from Stericycle; and a transaction in India that moved us into the market-leading position.  We continue to have a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities in emerging markets and are pleased with the progress we\u2019re making to deepen our presence in key growth markets that continue to experience strong, high-single digit internal storage growth. Given our acquisition of IO Data Centers, we have begun breaking out our data center business as a separate reporting segment. Note that IO closed in January, so it is not reflected in our reported figures for Q4 or 2017. In addition, we have removed entertainment services from our North American Data Management segment and combined it with art storage as the nature of the storage assets and customer bases for these two businesses are more similar.  With the acquisition of Bonded Services in Q4, we expect to see improved synergies in the entertainment services business. The quarterly data for 2017, consistent with the new segmentation, can be found in the appendix to the supplemental. Turning to Slide 6 in our data center business, we took a major transformative step towards shifting our business mix to faster-growing segments with our acquisition of IO for approximately $1.3 billion which closed in January. IO Data Centers substantially extends our existing data center platform and provides expansion capacity in the high-growth, high-absorption market of Phoenix as well as the strategically important market of New Jersey.  Phoenix is a very attractive market where co-location and cloud providers have made significant investments over the past few years. It has diverse energy sources and relatively inexpensive green power as well as attractive business environment and was the fourth highest U.S. market in absorption last year. New Jersey also is a critical market for our data center portfolio given the importance of the New York metro area to our global financial services customers.  The IO purchase represented a 15 times EBITDA multiple on a post-integration basis, including synergies of about $9 million. This multiple compares favorably to recent public and private market transactions, many of which do not provide the same growth outlook.  IO\u2019s high-margin business is poised for significant growth, including partial synergies, and importantly, 95% of the forecasted EBITDA is already contracted. The IO deal follows our acquisition of Fortrust and the opening of our greenfield expansion into Northern Virginia in September. In addition, we plan to close on the purchase of two Credit Suisse data centers in London and Singapore in the first quarter.  In aggregate, we expect these data center acquisitions to be modestly accretive to AFFO in 2019, including the impact of shares issued to finance the IO deal and ATM issuances for the Credit Suisse transaction. For 2018, we expect the data center business to generate approximately $200 million in revenue and $100 million in normalized EBITDA.  We believe these acquisitions will create real value for shareholders given the growth characteristics of the data center space, the specific markets we\u2019ve entered, additional development capacity and the uniqueness of Iron Mountain\u2019s brand and customer portfolio. Including these three transactions in our organic base, including Northern Virginia and the underground data centers in Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our existing data center operations span 90-plus megawatts with expansion capacity of an additional 160 megawatts, bringing our total potential platform to more than 250 megawatts. Stuart will have more detail on the financial impact of our 2018 guidance and 2020 plan from the accelerated growth in our data center business in a few minutes. On Slide 7, I want to reiterate that following the issuance of debt and equity to finance the IO transaction, we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratio targets for 2020, which assumes a 4% annual increase in dividends per share, as shown in this depiction of our financial model.  Stuart will address our balance sheet shortly, but I\u2019d like to briefly note that whilst we\u2019re disappointed with the market selloff of REITs in anticipation of increasing interest rates, it is important to recognize that those rate hikes are generally associated with inflationary pressure. Unlike many REITs, we have the ability to pass through inflation-based rental rate increases on an annual basis, and we see meaningful flow-through on those increases given the high-margin characteristics of our storage business.  In a nutshell, given our 75% storage gross margin, coupled with the ability to increase pricing in line with inflation, higher inflationary environments generally expand our margins and accelerate our cash generation well ahead of inflation. In a word, inflation helps us further helps us further outperform as a business, which is pretty unique in the world of income-oriented stocks. To wrap up, we had a very eventful year with solid fundamental results from storage revenue underpinning our progress in driving improved profitability, whilst at the same time laying the foundation for sustained and accelerated growth through expansion of our faster-growing portfolio of data centers, Emerging Markets and Adjacent Businesses.  Our progress drives growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share and delever over time. In fact, Iron Mountain is unique amongst top-yielding S&P 500 companies and that we continue to demonstrate strong internal revenue growth with attractive long-term growth potential.  We are encouraged by the tremendous progress made in 2017 and our momentum moving into 2018, and we will continue to be disciplined about deploying capital to accelerate growth in a manner that is consistent with our financial framework. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart Brown : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re excited to deliver another strong quarter and year of robust storage rental growth and enhanced margins, reflecting the strength of our global position and the discipline of our management teams. We remain steadily on track to deliver on our financial and strategic goals, anchored with a disciplined investment strategy oriented toward faster-growing, value-creating businesses.  On today\u2019s call, I will review our 2017 full year performance compared to expectations and cover the fourth quarter\u2019s operational and financial drivers. Then I will lay out our expectations for 2018 with an update on our 2020 plan, considering also the recent data center acquisitions.  Turning to our full year performance on Slide 8 of the presentation. Results were generally in line with our guidance discussed on last quarter\u2019s call. Revenue came in at $3.8 billion and just above the range as a result of strong internal storage revenue growth, driven by our revenue management efforts as well as currency translation benefits.  Adjusted EBITDA of $1.26 billion was in the middle of our range. Compared to the full year 2016, our adjusted EBITDA margin improved 180 basis to 32.8%, with higher gross margins and lower SG&A as a percentage of revenues. Our structural tax rate for the year was slightly lower than we had guided on the Q3 call due to the mix in North America taxable income between the Q1 and taxable entities. AFFO came in at the higher end of our range due to efficiencies in capital maintenance projects following the acquisition of Recall, as discussed last quarter.  Let\u2019s now turn to our results for the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 9, it shows our key financial metrics, our fourth quarter total revenues grew 6.1% over last year or 4.1% on a constant-dollar basis. Internal storage rental revenue increased a strong 4.2% in the quarter, while internal service revenue declined 0.1% as we cycled against a large entertainment services project a year ago.  Our gross profit margin improved by 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by synergies from the Recall acquisition reducing labor expenses and the flow-through of our revenue management program. Compared to a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter increased over 10% to almost $327 million, leveraging growth of approximately 8% on a constant-dollar basis.  And EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points to 32.9% as we leverage labor and facility costs. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.29 per share, inclusive of a $0.02 per share increase in amortization expense, reflecting a catch-up associated with an adjustment to the life of Recall\u2019s customer relationship value. Adjusted EPS would have been $0.31 per share excluding this catch-up.  AFFO was $154 million in the fourth quarter, in line with the expectations discussed in our last call, but down year-over-year due to timing of capital expenditures and cash expenses. Maintenance and non-real estate investments increased $28 million compared to a year ago as the costs were more back-end weighted this year, as we have previously indicated. On cash taxes, there was a swing of $14 million compared to a year ago. Turning to Slide 10 in internal growth performance for the quarter. We are very pleased with the momentum in internal storage growth, which resulted from strong revenue management efforts as records volume held flat in developed markets and continued growing in emerging markets where we're shifting more of our mix. Almost half of our total revenue comes from the developed markets storage business, which had 3.4% internal growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, records volume growth was modestly positive on the base of over 500 million cubic feet in storage. Internal service revenue in developed markets increased 0.1% due to continued growth in our shred business and other project-based revenue, slightly offset by lower average prices for recycled paper. In Other International, we continue to see storage internal revenue growth of 6.8%. Service internal revenue growth in the segment was flat as we continue to cycle over a high level of Recall destruction projects a year ago. In other reporting segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the legacy data center business saw strong internal revenue growth slightly north of 20%, which excludes our recent acquisitions. Internal service revenue growth in Corporate and Other was down year-over-year due to the lapping of the project in entertainment services business. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter expanded in North America records management and Western Europe compared to a year ago as we continue to benefit from the flow-through of our revenue management programs and realize the benefits from Recall synergies and our transformation initiative. In North America Data Management, adjusted EBITDA margins were down slightly year-over-year as we continue to invest in more new product development than a year ago. As a reminder, this segment has been restated and no longer includes our entertainment services business, which is more skewed towards a service than storage. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins improved as we continue to scale the business. Over the long-term, we closer to a mid to high 50% range as we integrate the IO acquisition and continue to scale. Before I cover guidance for 2018, let me briefly turn to our balance sheet. We continued our successful refinancing efforts in the fourth quarter with a GBP400 bond offering resulting in our having over 80% of our debt at fixed rates and a reduction in our weighted average interest rate to 5% at year-end. In addition, these efforts extended our average maturity to 6.8 years with a well-laddered maturity schedule. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our lease-adjusted leverage ratio was 5x, helped by the December capital raising associated with the IO Data Center acquisition, which closed in January of this year. We expect our leverage ratio to be closer to the mid-5x EBITDAR for the first quarter and remain there for most of the year, and then decline as we begin recognizing growing cash flows from data centers, acquisition synergies and lease-up. We remain on track with our plan to reduce our lease-adjusted leverage to about 5x by 2020, as I will discuss in a moment. Let's turn to expectations underpinning our guidance for 2018 summarized on Page 12 of the results presentation. Please note that our guidance is on a constant-dollar basis and based on January 2018 exchange rates. In addition, it reflects the impact of the new revenue recognition standard we adopted effective January 1, 2018. This guidance is very much in line with long-term expectations and reflects our growing data center platform. At the midpoint and on a constant-currency basis, we expect total revenues to grow by 8%, adjusted EBITDA by 14% and AFFO to grow by 9% in 2018 compared with 2017. 2018 total revenue growth will be driven by internal storage revenue growth, which is expected to be between 3% and 3.5%, reflecting ongoing revenue management efforts in developed markets and volume growth in emerging markets. For the first quarter, remember that North America will be lapping a prior year period that had a significant amount of new customer activity. As a result, developed markets' trailing 12-month internal volume growth reporting in Q1 2018 is expected to decline up to 50 basis points and then improve as we move through the year. For the full year, we expect to see positive internal volume growth in Western Europe, while we anticipate lower income and volume from existing customers in North America, leading to a slight volume decline overall in developed markets. As a result, net internal volume growth in developed markets is expected to be flat to down 25 basis points in 2018 on a base of over 500 million cubic feet. However, as mentioned, revenue management and emerging markets revenue growth are projected to deliver total storage rental revenue growth of 3% to 3.5%. Our internal revenue guidance does not include the data center business recently acquired as these would be in operation for less than a year and wouldn't be a part of our internal growth calculations for 2018. The data center revenue is expected to be approximately $200 million with leasing approaching 10 megawatts, but not all will take occupancy in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to accelerate with the expansion of our data center business as well as margin expansion from the continued realization of savings related to the Recall acquisition, our continuous improvement initiatives and ongoing revenue management initiatives. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA will benefit from the new revenue recognition standard by about $25 million to $30 million due to the capitalization of commissions and initial intake costs. Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted EBITDA growth would be approximately 12% at the midpoint, and adjusted EBITDA margin will increase 120 basis points from 2017. Our structural tax rate is expected to be between 18% to 20% in 2018, reflecting lower rates in the U.S. taxable lease subsidiary, offsetting continued growth in our international businesses. Interest expense is expected to be between $415 million to $425 million, while our average share count is expected to be around 287 million shares in 2018, reflecting the financing of the IO Data Center acquisition. Adjusted EPS for 2018 reflects the increased depreciation and amortization and interest expense from recent data center acquisitions. There is no material benefit to adjusted EPS from the new revenue recognition standard as the cost capitalization will be largely offset by amortization related to these expenses. AFFO growth reflects the strength and durability of our storage business. We expect growth of 9% to the midpoint of guidance, with maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments of approximately $155 million to $165 million next year, together representing roughly 4% of revenue consistent with 2017. Also, we don't add back the amortization related to commissions to calculate AFFO, so the new revenue recognition standard has no material impact. Let me turn to our capital investment expectations. As always, we remain focused on expanding shareholder value through prudent capital deployment where we can achieve returns in excess of our hurdle rate. For 2018, we continue to expect to spend $150 million on core M&A transactions as well as $100 million to acquire the two Credit Suisse data centers. The bulk of the core activity is expected to be in higher-growth emerging markets, consistent with our 2020 plan. In addition, we expect to invest $185 million on data center development, including data halls in Northern Virginia and expansion in Phoenix, which will come online and generate storage revenue beyond 2018 with stabilized double-digit NOI yields. We expect to fund these growth investments through a combination of cash from operations, debt, capital recycling from the sale of real estate as well as potential ATM issuances, particularly to fund the Credit Suisse data center acquisition. Lastly, our cash available for distribution, or CAD, continues to fund our dividend as well as maintenance and core growth investments, as you can see on Slide 13 of the presentation. With our recent expansion in the data center business, we have updated our 2020 plan that we've previously laid out on Investor Day. As you can see on Slide 14, on a compounded annual growth rate basis, we anticipate revenue to grow by almost 7% from 2017 to 2020; adjusted EBITDA to grow by 11%; and AFFO to grow over 11% or over 7% on a per share basis. With expectations of a dividend per share growth around 4%, as Bill discussed, we expect an AFFO payout ratio in the mid-70s and our leverage ratio to be around 5x in 2020. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in 2017, which continues to be underscored by the strength and durability of our storage rental business. Our core business fuels the cash flow growth, thereby funding investment to continue growth and enhance returns to shareholders. We're excited to accelerate our growth as we expand in the data center space and confident in the value we'll create for shareholders over time by the platform we've built. We remain well-positioned to deliver on our near and long-term financial projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open it up for Q&A. Bill Meaney : Thank you, Stuart. Just a few points. We continue to drive improved internal storage revenue growth across both developed and emerging markets. The recent expansion of our data center business through the acquisition of IO and Fortrust and the expected acquisition of Credit Suisse data centers will take our organic EBITDA growth from 3.5% in Q4 to over 5% in 2020. We have done all this whilst remaining committed to our financial framework and targets. Net of all this, we continue to be a standout in the S&P with a strong dividend plus robust and sustainable growth. With that, I would like to hand it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : I was just \u2013 first, I had a question on guidance, if you could give us a little bit more color. Now owning more data centers, will this mean higher CapEx and straight-lining adjustments to get to AFFO? Stuart Brown : Yes, it will mean \u2013 well, most of the CapEx that we'll be having initially will really be building out the development pipeline, right? We're really going from a pretty small development pipeline, but the growth opportunities that we have in Denver, in Arizona, in New Jersey as well as the Virginia campus, we'll continue to build the development pipeline. With that comes, from a GAAP standpoint, obviously, capitalized expenses and capitalized interest. And then as the leases grow, we will be straight-lining rent adjustment coming into AFFO. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And a follow-up. Could you give us an update on how leasing is going at some of the data center projects and some insight on the IO transaction and integration? Bill Meaney : Yes, it's a good question. We're really pleased by \u2013 I guess, we expected an acceleration in terms of the pipeline, in terms of new sales, but I think getting the new logos, so to speak, from IO, which are also existing customers for Iron Mountain both, some on the data center side, but a number of them in our data management or our records side, has really accelerated the conversation both for us, but also for the IO sales force. So we're really encouraged. It's obviously early days, but the feedback that I've been getting from the sales teams is they've already seen an increase in activity, an increase in interest in what we're offering. Stuart Brown : In Northern Virginia, the first data hall we built out is about two-thirds leased already, and that's why we've got in our plans to go and build up the next two data halls. We've seen a lot of interest, the potential pipeline as a multiple of what we've got in our expectations for next year for lease-up. So we're pretty confident in the 10 megawatts that we've got in the guidance for next year. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hey, good morning. Just two, just on the volume decline in 2018, it sounds like there's some kind of mathematical calculation risk over there. Can you just explain why particularly the volumes to decline? Bill Meaney : Hi, Shlomo, good morning. Yes. By the way, your \u2013 I got the question, but your phone is breaking up. But anyway, there's a couple of things going on. One of the things, as Stuart pointed out, is that we're lapping a strong comparable in Q1 of last year because of some new customer activity. But overall, it's the same trend that we called out last time is that if you look at incoming volume from existing customers in North America versus Western Europe, Western Europe, we're still seeing kind of, what I'd say, steady incoming percentage growth from existing customers, where we've seen a reduction in North America. Now some of that may be because we're being a bit more aggressive in terms of revenue management which, obviously, we rolled out a couple of years before we start rolling it out in Western Europe. That being said, we don't see an increase in destruction rate, and we don't \u2013 and we actually see a slight uptick in terms of new customers as we kind of focus on unvended, mid-market and federal government. So we expect that trend to continue. I mean, there is a little bit of an overlap of a high comparable in Q1. But as Stuart said, we think, overall, our developed markets will be flat to minus 0.25 basis point. And we expect those \u2013 that kind of trend to continue, and it's mainly driven by a slowdown of incoming volume from \u2013 still growing, but a slowdown of incoming volume from existing customers in North America. And I think, going forward, we will continue to optimize price for existing customers and continue to seek new volume more and more from unvended opportunities. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Just to understand this better, if I were to look in 2019 \u2013 to be roughly flat or I guess [indiscernible] volumes start to decline? Bill Meaney : No. Well, I think it will be roughly \u2013 if you look at developed markets, it will be roughly flat. I mean, I think you're still going to be, from a volume \u2013 don't forget, this is on 500 million cube, and so I think volume, if you look at developed markets, are probably continuing to hover in kind of the flat, plus or minus, let's say, 0.25 basis point, so maybe negative, maybe flat, maybe slightly up. But we continue to feel that we're not going for share in these markets. And so we think the right thing to do is to make sure that we're using revenue management appropriately, so we're not trying to increase the amount of growth from existing customers. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And just, Stuart, can you walk us through some of the assumptions beyond 2018 to get us to 2020, how are you going to delever to 5x and get AFFO coverage down to 70% to 75% if you're going to be continuing to invest in data center and build out these data center assets? Is there some kind of big step-up in margin that we should be expecting that are going to improve the leverage ratio? Just can you give us some of the pieces of the puzzle that we need to build a model that will help us understand this? Stuart Brown : Shlomo, let me start with the \u2013 I mean, the target of \u2013 for leverage and \u2013 for our leverage framework is really built around two things : a, optimizing our cost of capital; and b, making sure that we've got capacity in our balance sheet to be able to take advantage of opportunities. There's no liquidity issue where we're sitting today from a leverage standpoint. So as we want to delever over time, it's more about getting back to creating that capacity for us to take advantage of dislocations. So with that said, we said when we purchased IO that we will be taking a step-up in leverage related to that and that will delever naturally over time with organic growth. However, we will be putting capital back to work in development as well. And so the funding of that additional development as we kind of build our data center pipeline like other data center REITs, how are we going to fund that? We will get some cash flow from operations. We will use the ATM for things like Credit Suisse, and we're looking at capital recycling opportunities. And we've been \u2013 just to give you an example of one we've got right now is we've recently purchased a property in the Midlands outside of London. And we're going to sell some fairly high-value properties that are in \u2013 much closer into the city, I think it's three properties, as we move out to the Midlands over the next couple of years. So those are the types of opportunities where we can sell those types of properties through a short-term leaseback and then move back and move out to cheaper properties as records management becomes more archival so that we've got a number of levers that we can pull to fund the data center expansion. And if you look at the model that we provided on 2020, coming back to your payout ratio question, right, we're not going to \u2013 we don't anticipate the dividend to grow as fast as AFFO. And so again, you get a natural reduction of the payout ratio down into the mid-70s. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, and I'll work with that. And then can you give me \u2013 give us, on the acquisition \u2013 excuse me, when you're saying the data center is expected to provide $200 million of revenue, $100 million of normalized EBITDA in 2018, what are you normalizing for? Stuart Brown : So the only thing that's normalized for in that number is the integration costs related to IO, and that's $4 million to $5 million. That $4 million to $5 million is built into our total EBITDA guidance, but we normalize for that when you look straight at just the data center number. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPM. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. When looking at the current status of the 2020 plan on Slide 14, one of the underlying assumptions there is to achieve the $2.54 dividend per share goal is a higher margin assumption. The implied margin for 2020 is now 36.8%. Previously, it was 35.6%. What gives your team confidence in higher 2020 margins than previously thought? Bill Meaney : So let me kind of give you the high-level view of it, Andrew, and then I'll let Stuart comment more. But the part that's really given us the confidence is the traction that we've gotten on the revenue management side of the storage business. You can see that in terms of the margin expansion that we've gotten in the last 12 months because what we're doing right now is we still think we'll be able to maintain 3% to 3.5% internal revenue growth on the storage side, and we're doing that at the same time whilst minimizing the amount of racking and boxes that we have to put in place to take the boxes because we're relying more and more on price. So we feel really good about \u2013 and we already see that. We've seen an acceleration in our margin increase. But I mean, Stuart, you may want to comment more in terms of our specific margin target. Stuart Brown : Just two other quick things I'll point out, right, we're coming in, in a little bit of a higher base, right? We've outperformed expectations in 2017. The other thing, Andrew, don't forget, is the revenue recognition accounting change has an impact on that margin as well, so you need to normalize for that. Andrew Steinerman : Right. So just to say, cleanly, the success of 2017, revenue recognition, but it's not like you're saying I'm going to have higher synergies than previously thought on Recall or higher transformational initiatives. Bill Meaney : No, no. It's really driven by the gross margin on the business. Andrew Steinerman : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : Hi, good morning. Just a couple more questions on guidance. What are the expectations on the service side for revenue growth and margins in 2018? Stuart Brown : Revenue growth on the service side is expected to be flat. It will be a little bit better than we've had in the past really because of the shred business. We see stronger growth on the shred side. Karin Ford : Okay. And do you expect steady margins based on that? Bill Meaney : Well, I think, actually, if you look at it, Karin, if you look at historically over the last three years, we're really pleased in the progress that we've made both on the storage margin but also as well as just in terms of storage growth. You can start seeing through \u2013 you see that we have positive internal storage rate of growth both for developed markets and emerging markets. And that's really how \u2013 as we've been replacing with historically with the bedrock, which was the transportation, with some of the new service offerings, so we feel really good with the progress and the momentum that we're building there. Karin Ford : Great. Next question is, you mentioned you're going to be rolling out revenue management into the emerging markets in 2018. How much do you think that could boost organic revenue growth in the emerging markets? Bill Meaney : We're not \u2013 we're going to stay within our overall guidance that Stuart laid out, the 3% and 3.5% overall. I mean, we'll give you more flavor as we go forward. You could see a little bit of the impact this past quarter, but we're still focused in those markets. Think about those markets, a lot of them were still focused on getting to a market-leading position. And when you're in a market-leading position, obviously, volume is your primary lever that you're looking at. And then at some point, you start harvesting that volume and optimize it with revenue management. So we are introducing because we think there are some \u2013 there is some low-hanging fruit in some of those markets. But I think our first quarter call, sort of speaking, that we are applying some of the tools now in emerging markets is Western Europe because we think there's a lot more that can be done if you just look at that Western Europe, we're still relying on volume growth more than revenue growth in terms of \u2013 I mean, volume growth more than revenue management to get to the revenue growth in that market. And we think we can optimize that further as we look at being efficient capital allocators. Karin Ford : Okay, thanks. I know I've asked you this question on calls past. But now that the tax law is settled, did you guys review whether or not you want to maintain your REIT status? And did you consider de-REIT-ing? Bill Meaney : I'll start, and then Stuart could give you the technical answer. Yes, I mean, of course, we look at these things, but it's not even close, right? I mean, if you think about us as an income-oriented stock, we're kind of unique. We have a high yield and we have strong growth going forward. And we're attractive to income-oriented investors, whether they are REITs or C-Corp type investors. And given the nature of our business where we generate a lot of cash, the REIT framework is still an efficient way for us to give benefits to our shareholders, and we drive our \u2013 most of our revenue from real estate in terms of the storage nature of the business. And the fact that tax rates have come down, it just means they're paying less tax on the service side of the business. So \u2013 but I mean, Stuart, you may want to comment. Stuart Brown : The other thing I'll add is on the data center side, I mean, the main reason we're expanding the data centers relationship we have with our customers and our ability to create value, the ability to leverage the REIT status on that is clearly helpful as well, right? So if you're Credit Suisse of the world, you're not getting the tax shield that we can provide as a REIT on those things. So a lot of data centers that are on the balance sheet of C-Corps are actually better in place than a balance sheet of a REIT. So we'll continue to leverage that as well. Karin Ford : Great. Last one from me. In past cycles, have you seen demand increase when GDP growth goes above 3%? And what type of economic forecast have you baked in the guidance? Bill Meaney : Yes. We haven\u2019t \u2013 if we look at the guidance, right, what we've baked in is a little bit of inflation because probably, in the near term, I think the biggest benefit for us is \u2013 it's kind of like a rain dance, I pray for inflation every day I come to work because inflation, our top line is really driven by inflation. And GDP, for sure, I think if you've been following the company a long time, my predecessor had shown a number of graphs where GDP does drive volume growth. But I think given the amount of growth that we expect in \u2013 the change in growth of GDP over the next 8, 12 or 24 months, I think that's going to be less of a driver than the change of inflation. And of course, with a 75% gross margin storage business, every point of inflation expands our margins. So you were kind of unique in that sense. So I know that a lot of income-oriented companies don't like inflation because it's hard to keep dividend growth at pace with inflation. In our case, it's just the opposite. It allows \u2013 the more inflation allows us even to outperform with our dividend. So it's \u2013 so I think in the near term, I'm doing my inflation dance. Karin Ford : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Any update, insight how we should think about Recall and transformation impact in 2018? Bill Meaney : It's mostly \u2013 I mean, Stuart, you may want to give more, but it's mostly done at this point. I mean, there's still a little bit \u2013 we always said that we think there's more to get done on some of the integration in terms of integrating facilities in real estate, and we're still picking through that. But I would say the bulk of it, I mean, Stuart. Stuart Brown : Yes, the bulk of it is done in terms of the Recall investments. We do still have some back-office systems and some IT Recall costs as well, as well as the real estate that Bill mentioned. And the synergies will continue to sort of flow through as we ramp up. It's built into the guidance numbers, and we're right on track. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And then just on G&A, that was a little higher than we had forecast in fourth quarter. I wonder if you can provide any detail on that and how we should think about this line item going forward. Bill Meaney : If you look at \u2013 what I would look at, Sheila, because there's puts and takes, there is a seasonality aspect in terms of certain things that happened at the end of the year. If you look at year-on-year, you're right, Q3 to Q4 were flat. But if you look at year-on-year, we saw a nice improvement. There was some noise in the end of the quarter that we had some VAT issues that we're still working through, for instance, in India. But I think if you look at year-on-year, we continue to see that we'll continue to slowly tick down. I mean, in fairness, we've got most of the SG&A improvement, and we baked a little bit into our guidance for 2018. But a lot of what you see between the flattening out between Q3 and Q4 is in the year. But year-on-year, we're pretty happy. Sheila McGrath : Okay, that's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Iron Mountain sales force and cross-selling all of Iron Mountain. Are you restructuring incentives or anything to encourage the sales force to sell the new and expanded data center segment? Or is this segment going to rely mostly on the data center specific sales force? Bill Meaney : No, it's a great question. That's one of the things that really excites us about the data center space. I think as we might have mentioned back in December that 65% of our sales \u2013 of our customers right now in our data centers are Iron Mountain ones. And then with IO, there's about a 45% overlap. And even in the short time that we've owned it is we see that the inquiries coming through our data management especially and, to a certain degree, our records management folks has been increasing. So \u2013 and how we coordinate that, there's always been a pretty good coordination, but we coordinate it with both art and science. So the art is fixed. So I'll give you an example. The Credit Suisse data centers came through our records management sales force in Europe that have been the relationship manager with Credit Suisse for a number of years, not even the data management folks just because of the strong relationship we have with Credit Suisse. And that we use both spiffs, and we also have some of those people actually carry a quota with a \u2013 which is the science part of it. But that's one of the reasons why we're really excited. And as I say, 950 of the Fortune 1000 are our customers, and over 35,000 data centers just in North America alone are people in and out of almost on a weekly basis. So it is starting to show real benefits. Stuart Brown : Just to add one quick point onto that as well, just to give you a little bit of color. I mean, our data center team, even district commercials and our the data center team met the first day that IO closed at IO's facility, right, we got the entire commercial team together. And one of the reasons they're excited to be a part of Iron Mountain is now they've got a much bigger platform to be able to sell. And companies have been owned by private equity, right, or don't have the sort of the balance sheet to be able to provide the capacity for these sales teams to be able to provide the customers. So they've got a great roster of customers and a lot of potential transactions in the pipeline. And I guess I should probably welcome them all to the Iron Mountain team. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thank you. Hey. Really nice job on the internal storage growth, the 4.2% in Q4. That kind of took the full year up to 3.9% versus a range of 3% to 3.5%. Was there anything in there in terms of one-time like a termination fee or anything like that? Or was that just kind of the pure price kind of versus making the volume growth algorithm? Stuart Brown : The only unusual item that was in there for the year was that \u2013 which we have it in the second quarter, and we fully talked about the SimpliVity on an annual basis, we had the SimpliVity termination fee back in the data center. And so that impacted the storage rental growth about 20 basis points for the quarter. But other than that, it's just strong underlying performance, 20 basis points for the year. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Stuart Brown : Yes. Kevin McVeigh : For the full year. So the 3.9%, Stuart, would have been 3.7%, right, x that? Stuart Brown : Correct. Kevin McVeigh : Is that the way to think about it? Stuart Brown : Yes. Kevin McVeigh : Super. And just as you folks think about kind of price in kind of the revenue management versus the volume in the emerging markets in 2018, to get to that 3% to 3.5% range, is there any way to bracket how much is kind of revenue management versus emerging market unit volume growth, just to try to get a tighter range on what would be 3% versus 3.5%? Stuart Brown : No, I mean, we gave you the guidance at the top level. If you look at the momentum that we built in the business between revenue management and volume growth in terms of how that's driving the 3% and 3.5%, it's pretty clear. And if you look at the emerging markets, you can see a slight upward trending, but I would instead continue on those trend lines. Effectively, what we're calling out is a similar \u2013 we expect a similar momentum or continued momentum and similar trend in the businesses. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And then just last one from me, if I could. The rev rec, the $7 million of revenue and the $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA, does that sit in storage or service? And would that be considered part of that internal growth, the $7 million of revenue? Or is that not impacted at all? Stuart Brown : It was mostly \u2013 really mostly in service because it's the commission side, right, that's getting capitalized on EBITDA. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And Stuart, that impacts the internal growth in terms of the revenue or no? Stuart Brown : No, no, we will exclude definitely internal growth. Kevin McVeigh : Okay, awesome. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you for squeezing me back in. Stuart, can you give us just a little bit more detail on what your expectations were for data center in 2018 organically versus how much of the data center $200 million revenue, $100 million EBITDA, is acquisition? I know the vast majority of it is, but can you give us a little more specificity? Stuart Brown : Yes. On the revenue side, I think the ongoing legacy business was about \u2013 I kind of remember off the top of my head, but \u2013 about $30 million \u2013 from the legacy business, about $30 million, and then you had the Fortrust acquisition and then IO on top of it from a revenue standpoint. And then from the IO transaction, we talked about it, with the equity offering, that, that will be, from an EBITDA perspective, around $80 million after integration. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So when I think about it, should I be expecting, including the other acquisitions like Credit Suisse and everything, more like $90 million from EBITDA from acquisitions? Stuart Brown : I mean, the numbers that we've provided include Credit Suisse, right. So the guidance numbers include Credit Suisse assuming that closes here later in the first quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Right. Okay. I was just trying to get a kind of an organic growth of what you guys are seeing, expecting versus the acquisition growth. Bill Meaney : I think if you can think about it, Shlomo, this way, is that we expect this year \u2013 because some of the acquisitions we have, we have to build out some capacity, so I think the organic growth will be a little bit slower than what we've seen in the previous years. So I'd say mid-teens in terms of organic revenue growth, and EBITDA will grow a little bit faster than that as some of the assets stabilize because we're, obviously, moving up in terms of our EBITDA margin. But I think it's kind of \u2013 I would expect kind of mid-teens in terms of revenue growth and a little bit better on EBITDA. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And as that was the last question, I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments. Bill Meaney : We'd just like to thank everybody for listening in, and we look forward to a continued strength in 2018. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you.

(Research) Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Melissa Marsden - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Kate. Hello, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The user-controlled slides that we will be referring to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with the link to today's webcast.

In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. And the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report a solid start to 2018 with another strong quarter of financial and operating results that demonstrate the durability of Iron Mountain storage rental business and continued progress against our 2020 strategic plan. The quarter's performance, as shown on page 3 of the presentation, is on track with annual expectations and punctuated by strong overall growth in total reported revenue of 11% versus the first quarter of last year, smooth integration of both IO and Credit Suisse data centers; continued strength in our core business with internal storage growth of 3.7%, at the high-end of our annual guidance, and another quarter well in excess of inflation, positive internal service revenue growth, and strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Including the increase in share count, AFFO grew 20% which supports our targeted dividend per share growth of 7% for 2018. Furthermore, we are pleased in delivering some of the best internal growth figures for the company in the last five years whilst the base upon which the growth is added to, has increased by about one-third. It should be noted that our acquisitions of IO Data Centers and the two data centers from Credit Suisse closed in the first quarter, therefore those companies' results are not included in internal revenue growth metrics until next year. Adjusted EBITDA growth of 17% for the first quarter was also in line with our expectations, reflecting strong margin expansion from a year ago, with some of the same revenue drivers and including the minor benefit associated with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards discussed on our last call. Stuart will have more on this shortly. Our improved internal service revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by growth in our shred business despite lower year-over-year paper prices as well as expansion of our information governance and digital solutions businesses, which provides imaging and digitization services and an increase in special projects. We're excited by the pipeline of these projects, as our traditional customers increasingly see us as their go-to partner in managing their hybrid physical and digital information management needs. Overall, our core business continues to perform well with worldwide net volume growth of roughly 4 million cubic feet before acquisitions over the trailing 12 months. This supports the durability of storage revenue growth, as the average box of records in our facilities remains for 15 years. Revenue management continues to support momentum in developed markets, and we achieved a larger contribution from pricing in Western Europe than in recent quarters. In emerging markets, internal revenue growth is driven more from volume than pricing, as we build market leadership in those higher growth markets. As shown on slide 4, this consistent internal growth in our core business, together with the expansion of our data center platform and recent transactions in other adjacent businesses, should drive faster growth with improved margins over time and gives us confidence in achieving our 2020 goals. We are well on track to achieve a business mix delivering internal adjusted EBITDA growth above 5% before acquisitions by 2020, and this quarter is consistent with that progression, fueled by the 3.2% internal revenue growth. Moreover, given the recent data center acquisitions and recently announced pending art storage acquisition, our growth portfolio \u2013 which is emerging markets, data center, and adjacent businesses \u2013 are already approaching approximately 25% of our revenue mix. Turning to slide 5, we made further progress on the execution of our strategic plan. As you will recall, our plan is to extend our durable business model through continued nurturing of our core developed markets, expanding into faster growing emerging markets and growing our storage-related adjacent businesses, such as art and entertainment services, as well as data centers. And we will continue to find ways to enhance the core strategic pillars of our plan by identifying and evaluating opportunities to provide innovative solutions and services to new and existing customers. In developed markets, which include our North American Records and Information Management, North American Data Management and Western European segments, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 2.9% even with a 0.5% decrease in internal records volume on a trailing 12-month basis, consistent with the guidance we provided on our February earnings call. Also as we noted last quarter, whilst our successful revenue management efforts may marginally impact the incoming volume from existing customers, it has not significantly impacted new customer behavior or customer terminations and destructions. Following our successful implementation in North America and early signs of progress in Western Europe, we are adding revenue management resources in certain emerging markets during 2018. Furthermore, we continue to achieve growth from existing customers through marketing the broad range of physical storage, digital storage, information governance and data management services. Additionally, we continue to focus on volume growth from further penetration of unvended segments, such as the mid-market and the U.S. federal government. We have seen increased demand to secure government records. In February, we hosted the grand opening of our 10th National Archives and Records Administration or NARA-compliant Federal Records center, adjacent to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, with more than 160 potential federal customers in attendance. This facility has a total capacity of 1.5 million cubic feet of record storage and is attractive to government agencies who are seeking to minimize their physical footprint and reduce their spending on record storage. In fact, we have already secured records from one federal agency that we expect will occupy 400,000 cubic feet of this facility once fully moved in by year end. During this quarter, we announced our plan to acquire Artex, a complementary art storage business to our existing Crozier Fine Art entity. This transaction will give us a more significant presence with important museum and institutional customers whereas Crozier has traditionally had a deeper presence with art dealers and galleries. This is an important acquisition from an industry perspective and we expect it to significantly strengthen our competitive position in key markets. Turning to our data center business, during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of IO Data Centers, as well as Credit Suisse facilities in London and Singapore. The integration with the IO team is going very well, with special focus on bringing together the commercial teams. Whilst IO had limited availability of built-out capacity at acquisition, we are now developing additional capacity in Phoenix and New Jersey on top of new development in our Northern Virginia and Denver locations. The current development activity will add 18 megawatts of which 25% is pre-leased. You can see from our reported results for the data center segment, we are on track for annualized results of about $200 million of revenue this year and $100 million in adjusted EBITDA after normalizing for full quarter contribution from these two transactions. Driven by the acceleration of enterprise data center outsourcing to third-parties and attractive growth characteristics of the business, we may shift some of our growth capital towards data center opportunities for both smaller, targeted acquisitions, as well as development within our existing platform. Turning to emerging markets for our records management business, we continue to see solid internal growth as well as attractive acquisition opportunities. During the quarter we closed on transactions in South Africa and India and since quarter end, we closed on two additional tuck-in acquisitions in Dubai and South Korea, leveraging the scale and infrastructure we have in these markets. Our deeper penetration into these faster growing markets supports enhanced leadership and we expect to drive margins higher as we further our scale. On slide 6, I want to reiterate that we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratios for 2020, which assumes a 4% annual increase in dividends per share as shown in this depiction of our financial model. Stuart will address the progress we've made on our balance sheet, both in terms of leverage as well as interest cost shortly. Before turning the call over to Stuart, I'd like to remind you that whilst our year-to-date total shareholder return is down about the same percentage as the MSCI total return REIT index, it is important to recognize that with increasing interest rates often associated with inflation, we have the ability to pass through inflation-based rental rate increases on an annual basis. And we achieve meaningful flow-through on those increases, given the high margin characteristics of our storage business. This furthers our ability to deliver meaningful dividend per share growth, in not just nominal but real terms. More directly, our 75% gross margin storage business and ability to grow price in line with inflation helps us accelerate the growth of cash generation, well in excess of inflation. Additionally, we are today a standout in the S&P 500 in that we are a top yielding company that also has durable and growing internal growth, expanding margins, a solid balance sheet, and great long-term growth potential, both in our core, as well as data center and adjacent businesses. To wrap up, we are pleased with our solid results in the first quarter, supported by strong storage revenue growth and acceleration in the contribution from our faster growing portfolio. These dynamics are driving healthy growth in both the top line and in cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share and delever over time. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting on another strong quarter with robust rental revenue growth and enhanced margins. The team at Iron Mountain continues to make excellent progress against our financial and strategic goals, anchored by a disciplined investment strategy, focused on faster growing value-creating businesses, combined with continuous improvement in our core records management business. On today's call, I'll cover key highlights, certain operational and financial metrics and touch on our outlook for 2018, which is unchanged from February. Before diving into the details, let me walk you through the highlights. First, we achieved strong internal storage revenue growth of 3.7%, tracking ahead of the 3% to 3.5% annual guidance we laid out in February. This reflects solid underlying fundamentals and the benefits from our revenue management program. Note that our internal revenue growth has been calculated to exclude any impact of the new revenue recognition standard. However, the accounting change has some minor impact on reported storage and service mix. Second, we delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% on a constant dollar basis, with margins expanding 170 basis points compared to a year ago, reflecting the benefits of Recall synergies, our transformation initiative, flow-through from revenue management initiatives and the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Let's turn to slide 7 of the presentation, which shows our key financial metrics. Results were generally in line with or ahead of our expectations. Revenue came in at just over $1 billion growing 11% over last year and 8% on a constant dollar basis, driven by strong internal storage revenue growth from global net volume growth and revenue management, as well as the impact of our data center acquisitions. Internal service revenue growth ticked up, with a 1.4% increase, primarily as a result of our shred business and growth from imaging and project-related revenue. While service revenue can be lumpy depending upon the size and timing of projects, we are pleased with the progress this quarter. While the first quarter had a benefit from favorable currency translation on a year-over-year basis, exchange rates don't appear to be a tailwind for the rest of the year. In addition, current exchange rates are relatively consistent with the rates assumed in our guidance. Our gross profit margin improved by 160 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by labor synergies from the Recall acquisition and the flow-through of our revenue management program. SG&A as a percentage of revenue also improved slightly year-over-year on increased sales leverage. Compared to a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter increased more than 17% or approximately 14% on a constant dollar basis, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin increase of 170 basis points to 32.9%. Before providing color on the business segments, let me first touch on a few other points. First, adjusted EBITDA included a benefit of approximately $4 million from the revenue recognition accounting change. Also, our structural tax rate for the quarter was 19.5%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 per share, flat compared to last year, but impacted by the increased depreciation and amortization, as well as increased number of shares following our recent IO and other data center acquisitions. AFFO was $222 million in the first quarter up over $50 million year-over-year, in line with the adjusted EBITDA increase. Maintenance CapEx and non-real estate investment totaled $23 million, up slightly from $21 million a year ago. Remember that these CapEx items increased in the second half of the year, leading to AFFO being more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Turning to slide 8, in internal growth performance for the quarter, you can see the impact of our revenue management efforts reflected in Developed Markets' results, with internal growth nicely ahead of inflation. Almost half of our total revenue comes from the Developed Markets storage business, which had 2.9% of internal growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, internal volume growth in the Developed Markets records business was negative by about 0.5 point, as guided to on our last quarterly call on a base of over 500 million cubic feet in storage, as we cycle over strong growth from new customers a year ago. Internal service revenue in Developed Markets increased 1% or $3 million due to project activity and shred growth, slightly offset by lower average prices for recycled paper compared to a year ago. In Other International, where we are shifting more of our mix, we continue to see good storage internal growth of 5.6%. Service internal growth in this segment grew 4.4%. In other segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the legacy Data Center business saw strong internal revenue growth of over 29% albeit off a small base. Turning to slide 9, adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter expanded in the North America records management business compared to a year ago, as we continue to benefit from the flow-through of revenue management programs and realized benefits from Recall synergies and our transformation initiative. In North America Data Management adjusted EBITDA margins were slightly down year-over-year, as we continue to invest in more new product development. As a reminder, this segment has been restated and no longer includes our entertainment services business, which is now included with Corporate and Other businesses. Margins in Western Europe expanded strongly on good cost controls and synergies while adjusted EBITDA margins in Other International were flat compared to a year ago. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins improved nicely, as we continued to scale the business. We expect margins over time to move closer to the mid-to-high 50% range, as we integrate the IO acquisition and add more scale to this business. During the quarter, we leased 1.5 megawatts of new or expansion space, primarily in New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Denver, as we kicked off a 4 megawatt expansion in Phoenix. Turning to slide 10, you can see that our lease-adjusted leverage ratio was 5.6 times at the end of the first quarter as expected, after having closed the IO Data Centers and Credit Suisse transactions. Our current leverage ratio is comfortably in line with other REITs, especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors. We expect to remain in this range for the year before reducing our lease adjusted leverage ratio to about 5 times at the end of 2020. As Bill discussed, we target the lower lease adjusted leverage ratio in order to give us more flexibility to seize opportunities. As you can see in the supplemental, the structure of our borrowings is appropriate to where we are in the business cycle. As of March 31, our borrowings were 73% fixed rate. Our weighted average borrowing rate is down to 4.8%, and our well-laddered maturity is at an average of 6.6 years. During the first quarter, we executed a new seven-year U.S. Term Loan B and swapped half to fixed for four years, for an all-in rate of just under 4%. With regard to guidance we remain comfortable with the outlook we laid out on our February call, so we've moved the details to the appendix for your reference. As a reminder, our guidance reflects the impact of the new revenue recognition standard to reflect the capitalization of commissions and initial intake costs. We now expect annual adjusted EBITDA to benefit from this new standard by about $15 million, down from the $25 million to $30 million we guided to previously. As a reminder this accounting change does not impact AFFO, cash flows or EPS as the increased amortization expense associated with the new standard offsets the increased EBITDA. This additional amortization expense plus amortization of customer relationship value for the data center acquisitions and the increase in depreciation of real estate acquired in the data center deals, will bring total D&A for the year to around $650 million. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we remind you that year-over-year growth in the second quarter will be impacted by cycling against the $6 million of one-time benefits associated with the write-off of an earn-out from a prior acquisition, and the termination fee earned in the data center business that positively impacted internal storage, revenue growth and EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA growth for the remainder of 2008 (sic) [2018] should be relatively steady from the first quarter just reported, consistent with full year guidance. With respect to financing plans, we expect to continue funding growth investments through a combination of cash from operations, debt, capital recycling from the sale of real estate, as well as potentially ATM issuances, depending on market conditions. We are currently planning to generate approximately $70 million late this year from the sale of three infill properties in Greater London, as we consolidate into existing facilities and a new Midland's record center, with the proceeds used to fund growth investments. On a full year basis, we expect to see continued growth in cash flow from operations as Recall related costs are largely behind us. As a result, dividend coverage will improve relative to cash flow from operations, providing more capital to fund growth investments. Finally, I'd like to touch on our longer term performance expectations. As you can see on slide 11, the framework is unchanged. On a compound annual growth rate basis, we continue to anticipate revenue growth approaching 7% from 2017 to 2020, adjusted EBITDA growth of almost 11% and AFFO growth exceeding 11%. With expectations of annual dividend per share growth around 4%, we expect an AFFO payout ratio in the mid-70s and our leverage ratio to be around 5x in 2020. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter, which reflects the strength and durability of our storage rental business. Our core business is fueling cash flow growth thereby funding investment to continue growth and enhance shareholder returns. We're excited about accelerating our growth as we expand Iron Mountain Data Centers, and are confident in the value we'll create for shareholders over time via the platform we continue to build. We remain well-positioned to deliver on our near and long-term financial projections, and I believe our stock represents a compelling investment given our current yield and favorable growth prospects. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open it up to Q&A. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Stuart. And just a few comments, first of all, we are pleased to have delivered amongst our best growth figures in the past five years, with 3.7% internal storage growth, EBITDA growth of 17%, AFFO growth of 30%, or 20% adjusted for the increased share count. And our data center business is now firmly established to become a significant contributor over time. All this, we feel makes us a stand out from an investor standpoint. With that operator, I'd like to turn it over to questions. Operator : The first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Yes. Good morning. You did guide in the first quarter to expect storage volume down given a tougher comparison. I'm wondering if you could give us some insights on your outlook for the balance of the year. And on a related note, you have had some wins in the federal business domestically. I'm just wondering when you think we might see the benefits of those transactions in the volume numbers. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: All right. Good morning, Sheila. So it's a good question. I think, our guidance from here forward is that we expect Developed Markets to be kind of the plus or minus roughly 0.5%. So I'm not going to predict what that's going to look like quarter by quarter, but I think, we're going to stay in that kind of zone. And that's consistent with our trade-off that we decided to do. If you think about it this way, minus 0.5% it's roughly around $5 million to $7 million of negative revenue headwind. And on the other side, from a revenue management standpoint, we're achieving if you do kind of the monkey math, we're achieving something like a 4% revenue or price increase is we're contributing about $50 million on the other side. So I'll take that trade any time especially in a mature market where we're not going for additional share in existing customers. So I think that the tradeoff that we're making quite purposefully is $50 million to the good on one side knowing that we're taking some risk around volume which is on a 0.5% is probably costing us $5 million. And if you then take out the costs associated with that over time, it's about probably a $4 million or $5 million drag on the business. And the pricing goes straight to the bottom line. And we see that trend continuing out into the future. Some quarters it'll be positive, some quarters it'll be negative, but we think that's the right trade. I think when it comes to the upside on it, as you point out, is some of the unvended area and the largest of the unvended is the Federal Government. So the addressable market of the federal government is about almost the same size as our total North American business. We have made, I would say, steady progress and it is making an improvement, but it's not moving the needle at this point. I just went to the opening that I referenced in my opening remarks down at Joint Base Andrews. And just by the interest by the Federal Government on that, I think it will start gaining momentum as people start seeing this as not a risky thing, but a normal thing to do to outsource some of their records management. And we find a lot more interest and support from the federal agencies. But it's making a impact today, but I wouldn't say it's moving the needle yet. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And as a follow-up, on the data center business, could you talk about how the IO integration is going, and any insights on your expectations or programs you're putting into place, cross-selling that business with your other customers? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So let me answer it at a high level, then I'm going to ask Mark Kidd to actually comment it on more directly. So I personally couldn't be more pleased in terms of the way it's going, especially from the human capital integration. So I think we said when we did the acquisition we expected to pick up and aim to retain a large portion of the human capital from the IO acquisition and, touch wood, that seems to be going extremely well. So I'm very pleased with that. The other thing that's interesting \u2013 and Mark will give you \u2013 and then I'll turn it over to Mark and have him give you more flavor, is in terms of your cross-selling aspect, as you know, Sheila, that before we did the acquisition, over 60% of our revenue in data centers were from historical existing Iron Mountain customers which are 950 of the Global 1000 companies. That's gone down a little bit with the IO acquisition, and Mark will correct me, I think it's in the 40s which I see as a good thing because we've picked up a number of new logos which gives us opportunity to cross-sell in both directions. So the first thing is yes, we absolutely do cross-sell. I was with a large financial institution with one of the IO salespeople a couple months ago in New York City, and that was a customer that we had a long established record with on a number of areas, both as a buyer of their services and provider services to them. And that definitely is making a difference that I hear from the IO sales team in terms of getting even bigger share with these guys. But on the other side, I do see our opportunity to sell to companies that we hadn't been servicing, before that IO had serviced. So Mark, you may want to comment further in terms of how the integration is going. Mark Kidd - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Absolutely, Bill. The integration has been progressing extraordinarily well. As Bill mentioned we've been very impressed to-date with the human capital, the teams and their relationships that they have with their customers. We've made very good progress overall on the cost programs that we had previously discussed in terms of identifying those and beginning to act on those which we're very confident in the numbers that we had discussed. On the commercial side, we've already had wins from our existing customers [Technical Difficulty] (00:29:56-00:30:08). William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think \u2013 hey, Mark, I think you're \u2013 unfortunately Mark's actually out with the IO team. So he's not in the conference room. Mark, I think you probably need to dial in. So we can come back to it, Sheila. Mark, why don't you try dialing back in on the bridge? Mark Kidd - Iron Mountain, Inc.: My apologies. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you so much. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Sheila. Operator : The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You indicated you're adding resources to your revenue management program in certain emerging markets. Can you elaborate on your overall progress in optimizing the pricing structure in storage and how many more quarters you believe pricing growth will remain elevated from historical levels? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, George. Yeah, it's good question. So, yeah, I think last quarter, I commented that there was probably a mix of catch-up and continue. I think now the results that we're starting to see come through. So as I said, if you do the monkey math in developed markets, we're getting a little over four points of revenue growth. I think we're going to see continued, I would say, between 100 basis points and 200 basis points of real price increase, in other words over inflation in the Developed Markets for the foreseeable future. I don't see a change in that. And we're delivering probably at the high end of that range. We're probably delivering a couple hundred basis points, maybe a little bit more in terms of what I'd call real price increase. And I don't see a big slowdown in that in terms of the Developed Market. So, I think, we have kind of lapped, what I would call the catch-up and now, that kind of 100 basis points to 200 basis points of real price increase over inflation, I think is sustainable. I think in terms of emerging markets, it's all upside. So Emerging Markets, we have rolled it out. I think it's now to four locations or during 2018, I think, we're rolling out to four locations. When I say four locations, four regions, but with specific countries in focus for the emerging markets this year in 2018. And so, we will start rolling it out. But we're growing at a deliberate pace in the emerging markets because the Emerging Markets is a place where we're still building share and not optimizing the business, right. So you can expect that we will get more and more traction in emerging markets, but we're proceeding with a little bit more deliberate pace in those areas because of the share gains that we still have targeted. George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. And then, you're planning to direct more resources to drive organic and inorganic growth in the Data Center business. Can you discuss how your expansion in data centers broadly will alter your longer-term margin profile and capital raising requirements? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, if you think about it right now is that we already said that you'll see even a change this year because you could see the margins that are flowing through, approaching 50%. And as Stuart said, we expect that to kind of, on a stabilized basis, to be in the mid-50, 55% to the upper-50s range. You can already see that we've made a step change since the acquisition of IO, Credit Suisse and FORTRUST because it's really given us a scaled platform. So you already see that. And for this year, for instance, it'll be pretty much around 50%. So we've guided that would be about $200 million of revenue and $100 million of EBITDA. Now if you see, we roughly have about 120 megawatts roughly at the end of this year in terms of capacity or after the acquisition of IO, I should say. And we have a total of 250 roughly of megawatts of capacity on what we already have in the family, so to speak, in terms of real estate land or shell that can be built in terms of what we have. So you can see that there's still a very \u2013 it's almost a doubling of our current business that we can actually build without doing another acquisition. So that would be what I would call more organic growth. I think just to be clear is that we do continue to look at places to expand, but think of that much more on greenfield, brownfield like a Credit Suisse deal or a small tuck-in. And we continue to \u2013 as we have over the last few years, as we continue to monitor what I would say the top 20 global markets, about half of those outside the United States, half of them internally. And we do see the external ones really interesting for us, because this is where we can use our D&A as a company, because we are by far the most global of any of the REITs not just the data center REITs but just REITs in general and we're in 53 countries and we have been there for a very long time. So if you think about the ability to cross-sell, our ability to actually build local scale in some of these countries, we think that our ability to actually find the right acquisitions, and drive through synergies both on the top line and the bottom line internationally is kind of a unique \u2013 it's a unique proposition that Iron Mountain has in the data center space. So it's not when we talk about looking to expand to cover the top 20 markets, it's not just domestically, it's internationally I think has a certain amount of attractiveness to us. George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi good morning. This is Michael Cho for Andrew. My question is just around EBITDA margins and I guess margin expansion. Can you just provide a little bit more color on the cadence of the margin or margin expansion for the remainder of the year, just in terms of gross profit or SG&A just given where first quarter margins were and full year guidance? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. If you look at sort of the first quarter performance obviously very strong, we do expect to continue to have some revenue flow through. The EBITDA margin expansion that we've guided to for the year isn't as strong. We expected more in the first quarter. So the overall guidance we feel quite comfortable with the expansion that we've got built into that. Again, from a margin standpoint, the point we just touched on, you will get a little bit of impact from the data center business and the storage gross profit margins but overall EBITDA is right on track with guidance. Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And can you just remind us how much of the Recall and transformation cost efficiencies have not been actioned yet? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Almost everything has been actioned. The only thing that's really out there still to be actioned \u2013 and the activity we have going on this year is there's a couple of countries that we're still doing consolidation on that had some regulatory hurdles to get those started, so those are all in process now, as well as back office systems. Those are all being actioned and will be largely completed this year, particularly around HR and finance. And then we still have some real estate opportunities and consolidation is what we've always said would sort of be the later pieces of that to flow through, just getting leases lined up and things like that. So you're seeing some of that flow through and that'll continue on. But the vast majority of the Recall costs will be done by the end of the year. Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you. I want to go back to a question that was asked earlier just in terms of volumes and expectations for the rest of the year. Hey, Bill, I understand what the company is trying to do between pricing and volume, but the investor concern is that the company is not kind of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. And I just want to ask, like if you're seeing the change in investor behavior that's impacting volume right now, what gives you confidence that you're going to see the volumes change to go from negative 5% to sometimes be as much as plus 5% and that we won't just be on a sustained downward trajectory in this area, because clearly it seems like it is a result of the pricing actions. If you could just elaborate on that a little bit? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, no, it's a good question, Shlomo. So just to be clear, that's why we call it revenue management and not just pricing, is we do monitor the elasticity that we're playing with extremely closely so that we won't let that happen. The great thing is \u2013 if I flip what you're saying, it's self-inflicted. In other words we can control it. So to me this is we're not going to kill the goose. And the other thing is we are also very careful and not about destroying customer relationships. So if you think about it, what we're talking about is a little bit over 4% price increase, right, we're not talking about 24% price increase. These customers are also important for us for our digital services. So our biggest pipeline right now is in information governance and digital services in absolute terms is our biggest pipeline. And that pipeline is primarily with people that we're serving on the physical storage business. So we don't want to damage those relationships. So it's not just the elasticity when we look at what's happening to volume. We don't look just on the elasticity on the physical business, we also look at its impact for us to sell end-to-end solutions with them. So we are very cognizant of it and as you point out, the great thing is it's in our control. So if we feel like we're pushing it too far, we'll pull it back. But if you said to me, do I think we can continue to have these kinds of real price increase, yeah, I think, right now we're probably north of the 200 basis points of real price increase that I just mentioned, but I think I'm very comfortable even with the caution that you're making that we can maintain 100 basis points to 200 basis points of real price increase because it's in our control. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Why would volumes go up if you're seeing this happen like you said, hey, we'll see \u2013 we're down minus 50, will you expect it to fluctuate between minus 50 and plus 50? What would make those volumes go up, would you have to pull back on pricing, or is there something else that would happen that just in the course of your business that will make the volumes go up? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's a couple things, so it's not \u2013 pricing, as you point out, affects part of it, part of it, don't forget what we're talking about, is 0.5% on a 500 million cubic foot business, right? So it's very small volumes that we're talking about on a relative size. So you can have a large customer that might have been on legal hold for instance that is doing some catch-up in terms of destruction during that period of time. And that can affect the numbers on a quarter-by-quarter basis as well. So it's not just pricing. So those are the things that kind of the ebbs and flows. And then some of the government contracts, I referred to the 400,000 cubic feet that we won from this one government contract which will get moved into a facility in less than a year. Those are kind of large contracts which can sway the numbers. So we think it's going to be plus or minus. We're probably, being frank, we'll probably have more that are on the negative side of zero than the positive side of zero over the next I would say 12 to 24 months. But that's what we expect. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then just going back to government contract, we've been hearing about government for like five to seven years. Are we at the point that you think this is going to be accelerating and this will be kind of a constant discussion that this is one of the untapped markets in the U.S. that's actually starting to open up to you. Is that just something you're anticipating? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, the only thing \u2013 you live closer to our nation's capital than I do, Shlomo, so you tell me. But anyway, no, look, the thing that I'm always careful about not committing to something I can't deliver because I don't want you to kind of throw it back at me because I like to do what I say I'm going to do. And I think I've been consistent to say I absolutely think the federal business will be a big business, I think I used to say 10 years. So now, I guess, I have to take a year or two off of that and say 8 years and I still stand by that, but I can't tell you when that eight years is going to happen because trying to predict how the Federal Government behaves is beyond my pay grade. So I do believe in the interest that I see and just the logic, right, I mean it makes no sense for the federal government to be doing this in house. And I think that more and more of the federal agencies understand that. But things don't happen quickly, right. So if you come back in eight years from now, I think I'd would be true to my word but I can't tell you within that eight years what I'm going to be able to have the proof point for you. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Justin Hauke of Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. So I have a two-part question. The first one is just to clarify. I think you said that there might be a shift in the overall M&A investment, the $150 million more of that moving towards the data center side, so I just want to understand if I heard that correctly and if there's any change to the growth investment figure that you gave of $185 million? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question. So Justin, just on that point, so think of it this way, go back to our 2020 slide, where we said 30% of our sales \u2013 we're already at 25% or just about 25% of our sales are in the what I would call the high-growth segment, which is Adjacent Businesses and Data Centers, right. And we said we're going to be 30% of that mix by 2020. And then, the main thing is your EBITDA. And that's all about getting to our EBITDA organic growth of 5%. And we're comfortably above the 3.5% that we needed to hit by actually the end of 2018. We're already there in the first quarter. So then you say, how do you get from here to there, and all I'm saying is that \u2013 and you're right to point out that $150 million of M&A, which we said traditionally is earmarked for emerging markets is we're now \u2013 now that data center is firmly established, we're looking at our high growth segments in one bucket. And we're saying what's the best capital allocation decision on that, consistent with our also stated objectives remain true to our financial model that Stuart went through, which is that deleveraging over time, bringing down the payout ratio of AFFO. So that's all part of our capital allocation decision. So what I was kind of foreshadowing is that we're putting that in one bucket. I can't tell you right now that we're going to make a change, but now when we look at those investment decisions, we look at it across that portfolio, consistent with driving 5% EBITDA, organic EBITDA growth by 2020, which will be fueled by roughly a 30% portfolio of fast growing businesses. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it, okay. That's what I thought, I just wanted to make sure that it's \u2013 so it sounds like it's an all-encompassing bucket now, as opposed to some incremental growth investment. So okay that makes sense and then I guess second part of the question is just for the balance of the year, obviously seasonally your maintenance CapEx is always low in the first half, so you have more in the second half, you've got the growth investments. With the leverage expected to hold at this level, how are you thinking about financing the remaining investments, is that through the ATM or are there more asset sales to come beyond the $70 million that it sounds like you incrementally announced this quarter? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: One thing that's important to remember right is a lot of the assets that we're buying be it acquisitions in emerging markets, or Credit Suisse, these are yielding assets. So it's not unproductive. So you're getting the EBITDA off of it. So you can fund it with debt and still be leverage-neutral in most cases. So you can expect us to continue to sort of like we've done with IO and with Credit Suisse to partially fund, from those cases, with equity and debt. But in other cases in terms of the development pipeline which is what you really see sort of more capital going to this year as we put in place a development pipeline, call it \u2013 we've talked about $185 million that that can be funded with other asset sales or organic EBITDA growth, as well as in some cases incremental borrowings and then the capital recycling. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, and just to answer your question on the ATM, so the plan that we laid out today and the guidance that we provided is without any ATM. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. Right. Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great, okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Ryan Cybart - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi, good morning. This is Ryan Cybart on for Karin. So the topic of de-REITing under the new tax regime has been in the headlines again. Third Avenue argued in a letter to its investors that de-REITing could be an interesting option for companies with capital needs, so they're trading at big discounts. Just hoping you can update us on your thoughts around that. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No. I mean, the REIT structure continues to provide a tremendous amount of value. If you look at where the core of the cash flow and the earnings comes from in the record management business in North America, we continue to get substantial benefits from the REIT structure and don't anticipate that changing even with the new tax regime. And we get some benefit from the new tax regime, obviously on the TRS side particularly, in the shred business where we'll be paying lower taxes on that side of it. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: And you think of it this way also, just if you just look at our AFFO this quarter on an adjusted share basis which was up 20% and if you think about \u2013 and that was in a period where we're growing the business and we had just grown the dividend, you kind of go this \u2013 we're an income-oriented stock, so why wouldn't you be a REIT? Because from our standpoint because of the margins in our business is we can walk and talk at the same time. In other words, we can grow the business, we can grow the dividend and return cash to shareholders. So maybe we're unique because of the high margin and high cash flow of our business, but makes sense. Ryan Cybart - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay, great. And just wondering if you guys had any progress on the hiring of a senior leader for your data center platform? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: We have a senior leader for our data center platform actually. It may sound like we didn't because he had a hard time getting on the bridge. He's actually with his team out in Phoenix right now. So Mark Kidd is our leader. You're right that he's in the process of hiring a number of leaders on his team. But no, we have a leader in our data center business. Ryan Cybart - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Eric Compton of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A real quick one for me, just big picture. I understand your kind of optimal range right now for your at least adjusted net debt to EBITDAR is kind of that 4.5 to 5 range, and I'm wondering just longer term if you would be like comfortable getting closer to around 4.5, maybe even below it or if maybe just conceptually you view that as suboptimal for some reason. Just curious on kind of your longer term thoughts there. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, I think the short answer is, is that where our leverage is relative to our covenants, we're comfortable where we are today. So \u2013 and that's post the acquisition of IO, so we want to get leverage down to your point to the 4.5 to 5 times to create capacity on our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities that could come up, either an acquisition or some dislocation in the market. And so if you sit down and do any type of theoretical cost of capital analysis, you'd come up also with that same sort of 4.5 to 5. So there's no reason today that you wouldn't say does it make sense sometimes to ever go below 4.5, maybe, but I think it would be unlikely. I think we'd find plenty of capacity in the balance sheet at the range. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, and if you think about it today, Eric, if you look at it is that as Stuart said \u2013 Stuart and his team did and our treasurer did a great job in terms of the recent issuance; it was sub 4%. So the debt holders absolutely get the nature of the company. I wish the equity holders would get it as well as the debt holders. But they see this as really a near investment grade or even priced at investment grade many times. So it's not about where we are now. And if you look at it relative to the REITs, people typically look at it through a C-corp, because that's how they graded the company before. If you look at it through a REITs, it's not \u2013 our leverage is actually right in line, but it comes down to \u2013 it's much more about headroom between covenants that we're trying to get to through the opportunistic reasons that Stuart outlined. So that's why we are deliberate, we are going to delever over time and we feel very comfortable we're well on track with the 2020 plan which will then naturally deliver us to that 5 range. And then we'll continue delevering from there. And so we'll do it deliberately but we're not going to do it in an unstructured way because there's no need to. Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): All right. Thanks. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, thank you for squeezing me back in. Bill, we don't hear much about middle market anymore and it was always historically pointed to as this large under-tapped opportunity. And you've made some acquisitions there in the past and some of the capabilities and Recall were supposed to be there. Is there anything going on there of note, or what should we be thinking about in terms of potential for volumes over there? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, and I should update you in terms of the exact share. I think the last time I checked I think we're up to about 14%. I think when we started this journey, we were at 10%. So we've added four points of share in that and you can even kind of start seeing that in the mix of verticals versus \u2013 which are typically large enterprise customers versus the non-vertical. So we are making progress but it's obviously slower than I would like. But the sales teams are really doing a nice job. And I think as I said before, is we got some boost, we really \u2013 we probably went from 10% to 11% if I remember right when, before we did the Recall, and the 11% to 14% is just since Recall because our head of sales, as I mentioned before, is the former head of sales for Recall in North America. And he's done a very nice job restructuring part of the sales team to focus on it. It's just not as fast as I would like, because, as you rightly point out, is we have north of 50% market share on the enterprise and the middle market is the same. It's actually a little bit bigger than the enterprise market in terms of total absolute addressable market. So I keep saying to our guys, when are we going to get our fair share. So we're making progress but more to be done. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The other thing I'll add in too is, you do see our North America team pursuing sort of a mid-market strategy in smaller markets, which is where a lot of these businesses are based right. So whether it be a hub-and-spoke system where they're moving out to sort of smaller cities outside of major cities and doing a store front and then storing the boxes in the facilities in major cities or creating smaller facilities to serve launching customers and then growing off of that. And we've seen some good success there both on revenue growth, although it's still a small base but some really positive signs. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So is there anything that you're expecting any change or is this really just in light of what's going on in the data center and the focus of the company with its capital over there, middle market is in the same kind of focus that it used to be within this company? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, it's actually \u2013 in fact I just authorized putting in a bunch more sales people. And it's minor investments. It's more getting people out, beating the street and partly, as Stuart said, it's getting people into geographical territories that they weren't hunting before. So look the gestation period anyway for our business isn't overnight, especially since some of the middle market is already vended, so you're actually also have that as a stickiness. But we're not taking our eye off of it. It's just happening slower than I would like. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Operator : The next question is a follow up from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. Just two quick follow-ups. Service revenue growth was surprisingly strong at 1.4% just is that an aberration? How should we think about that? And then, the second is, if Mark's on the line could give us any additional insights that he thinks worth noting the data center business in terms of integration and cross-selling, that would be great. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. We'll give Mark Kidd another shot. He's dialed back in on here. And before I turn it over to Mark, Sheila, so I think, that the \u2013 it's not an aberration, but we're very pleased at the internal service. There are some one-offs in there like there always are. And I think Stuart mentioned the lumpiness of it because if you go back to our information governance and digital services business, which today is not huge, it's probably about $100 million worth of revenue. But that business is growing double digits and has our largest absolute pipeline of any business. So if you said to me, do I feel that we're going to be on the north side of zero rather than the negative side of zero, which we have been in the last couple of years, I think, in the drag, remember the other side of that equation is slower transport or slower use of transport in our core records business and data management business. I do feel that the growth now in information governance and digital services and our shred business is picking up the slack. So I don't think it's an aberration. Can I say that next quarter is going to be at 1.4%, remember we're guiding for the full year to be relatively flat. But I do expect that we're going to keep this through the course of the year in the positive territory as the information governance and digital services comes through. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thanks. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, yes. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Mark. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Mark, yeah. Sorry. Mark? Mark Kidd - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Just confirming, can you hear me now? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes, we can. Mark Kidd - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay, great. So I apologize for that before. Yes, on the data center integration in the business with IO, as Bill mentioned, we've been very, very impressed with the team and the human capital at the IO locations. They've been a great addition to the overall franchise. And so we've been working very closely with them on kind of building out the platform, advancing the commercial activity and also making sure we deliver on kind of the synergy elements that we had originally announced with the deal. So, on the costs side, we've made very good progress on putting the majority of those actions into place which will flow through the balance of this year as we had talked about. And on the commercial side, we've already seen a number of cross-site wins between our legacy portfolio and that which we brought on with the IO team, initially some smaller deals, but very good customer activity across both. And the other impact we've seen which is a big plus is that the Iron Mountain Data Management team's engagement given now that we have a larger portfolio across the country and even with Credit Suisse internationally. Their contribution to the overall pipeline has had a meaningful uptick over the last three months as well. And so I think, in aggregate, we are excited about the deals we've closed already. We do have full sales force integration across teams at this point from comp, quota, all the normal things that you expect and we see both actual results and pipeline results building nicely. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Sheila. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and today's conference call.

In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Meaney : Thank you, Melissa, and hello, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report another strong quarter of financial and operating results that demonstrate the durability of Iron Mountain\u2019s global storage rental revenue, the relevance of some of our new service offerings and continued progress against our 2020 strategic plan. Our performance, outlined on Page 3 of the presentation, is on track with our full year expectations as illustrated by total revenue growth of 11% on a constant dollar basis, strong growth in adjusted EBITDA with 130 basis points increase in EBITDA margins, continued durability of our storage business with internal revenue growth of 2.7% for the quarter and 3.2% for the year-to-date after adjusting to last year\u2019s data center early lease termination fee. Strong internal revenue growth of 7.6% for the quarter and 4.2% year-to-date driven by solid growth in our digitalization in special projects business as well as shred and further expansion of our global data center platform both through internal development and acquisition, including EvoSwitch based in Amsterdam, a top 5 global market. Globally, we continue to see growth in internal storage volume. However, you will see us increasingly emphasize yield management when looking at our developed markets as we continue to maximize yield rather than market share by focusing on net operating income per foot. In our other international segments, total internal revenue is driven more by volume where organic volume growth was 3.8% in the quarter. In developed markets, which include our North American Records and Information Management, North American Data Management and Western European segments, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 1.3% for the quarter driven by revenue management despite a 1% decrease in internal records volume on a trailing 12-month basis, due in part to an uptick in destruction related to the release of legal hold. New volume from existing customers globally was stable in the quarter and we continue to prioritize volume from new customers supported by our focus on penetration of unvended segments such as the midmarket and the U.S. federal government. Turning to Slide 4, we continue to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. As you will recall, we are extending our durable business model through continued nurturing of our developed markets, expanding into faster growing emerging markets and investing in storage-related adjacent businesses such as data centers as well as art and entertainment services. We continue to listen to our customers and identify new opportunities to provide innovative solutions in services to both new and existing customers. The significant growth in internal service revenue in the second quarter was in a large part driven by growth in shred mainly due to higher paper prices, higher level of destruction of record and growth in customers. We\u2019re also seeing good growth in our digitization business. An example of this is a project we are undertaking for a major North American bank who is challenged by application form accuracy and turnaround times from their third party resellers. The bank found its vending process had been taking up to three days with higher than acceptable error rates representing lost revenue. We proposed a complete solution for tens of thousands of file and are ensuring the bank files are now securely uploaded for ingestion into their systems and applications are securely stored electronically for future retrieval. Paper documents are stored according to retention policies and later securely destroyed. As a result, this customer has been able to reduce their SLAs for new accounts down to 24 hours and virtually eliminate errors in keying. We\u2019re excited by the potential for similar projects within our information governance and digital solutions business as our customers increasingly see us as a critical go-to partner for effective management of their hybrid physical and digital information management needs. Our newly announced partnership with Google only reinforces this. Turning now to emerging markets for our records management business, we continue to see solid internal growth as well as attractive acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we closed on two transactions in EMEA leveraging our scale and infrastructure in these regions. Our deeper penetration into these faster growing markets supports enhanced market leadership and we expect to drive margins higher. As I noted earlier during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of EvoSwitch for approximately \u20ac205 million or 14x 2018 adjusted EBITDA giving us 11 megawatts of existing data center capacity in the Netherlands which is 100% leased with the expansion capability of an additional 23 megawatts for a total potential capacity of 34 megawatts. EvoSwitch operates one of the largest colocation facilities in the Amsterdam region. Its existing campus supports more than 50 connectivity and telecommunication providers and it has an attractive diversified base of global customers, including multinational enterprises, cloud service providers and public sector institutions. The Amsterdam region is the second largest data center market in Europe enhancing our presence in what I\u2019ll refer to as the FLAP data center markets; Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris following our entry into London early in this year through the purchase of a data center facility from Credit Suisse. In addition, we broke ground early in the third quarter on a new building at the IO data center campus in Phoenix, one of the fastest growing markets in the U.S. The new building can ultimately accommodate 48 megawatts of capacity with the first of two phases of construction scheduled for completion in June 2019 delivering 24 megawatts. When combined with current and potential capacity, the Phoenix camp, this will be able to support approximately 100 megawatts in one of the U.S.\u2019s highest absorption markets. You can see from our reported results for the data center segments that we are on track for annualized results of more than $200 million worth of revenue this year and $115 million to $120 million of adjusted EBITDA after normalizing for full quarter contribution from the EvoSwitch acquisition. Driven by the acceleration of enterprise data center outsourcing to third parties and attractive growth characteristics of the business, we have shifted some of our growth capital from acquisitions in the records management business towards development with our existing portfolio of data center opportunities. Stuart will have more on these minor shifts to our capital allocation guidance shortly. I\u2019m sure many of you saw the announcement earlier this week of our partnership with Google that I referenced earlier. Starting in September we will offer joint solutions that allow customers to unlock their physical and digital data to enhance insights, improve decision making and uncover new revenue opportunities whilst ensuring data privacy and security. Our customers increasingly ask us how we may help them create value from their data so they are not missing opportunities to mine that data to uncover new revenue. We believe the combination of our customer base comprising more than 95% of the Fortune 1000 with deep industry vertical expertise together with Google\u2019s machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities can help customers make their physical and digital information more useful and accessible whilst keeping it safe. Although it is early days, we are excited by the potential represented by this partnership with Google. Our expansion in the data center business and this new partnership with Google are great examples of how we are seeking to enhance investment returns whilst also supporting customers\u2019 storage and information needs across a broad range of formats and asset types where the physical documents, hybrid physical digital records, backup tape, digital data in the cloud or physical space and power within our data centers, these offerings are all part of the information management ecosystem for which we\u2019re developing offering such as Iron Cloud and other SaaS solutions. And our fine art, entertainment services and other adjacent businesses also align with our focus on maximizing yield. In fact, if you look at the net operating income we\u2019ve generated on a per square foot basis on Slide 5, we have continued to grow this across our range of storage businesses. As shown on Slide 6, we expect the consistent internal revenue growth in our internal business together with the expansion of our data center platform and recent transactions and other adjacent businesses to drive faster growth with improved margins over time. Before acquisitions, we are well on track to achieve a business mix delivering adjusted EBITDA growth in excess of 5% before acquisitions by 2020. Year-to-date, this is consistent with the progression that\u2019s fueled by 3.6% internal revenue growth. Moreover, given the growth in our data center and adjacent businesses, our growth portfolio which consists of emerging markets, data center and adjacent businesses is already approaching 25% of our revenue mix which is our goal to achieve by the end of 2020. On Slide 7, I want to reiterate that we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratio targets which assume a 4% annual increase in dividends per share between now and 2020. Stuart will address the progress we have made on our balance sheet shortly. Before turning the call over to Stuart, I\u2019d like to note that in addition to extending revenue management programs across our portfolio, we also retain the ability to pass through inflation-based price increases on an annual basis. And given the high margin characteristics of our storage business, we achieved significant flow through on these increases enhancing our ability to deliver meaningful dividend per share growth and not just nominal but in real terms. We continue to be unique within the S&P 500 and that we are a top yielding company that is durable and has strong internal growth, expanding margins, a solid balance sheet and great long-term growth potential supported by acceleration and the contribution from our faster growing portfolio. These factors are driving consistent growth in both the top line and in cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share whilst delevering over time. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart Brown : Thank you, Bill, and thank you all for joining us today. I\u2019m excited to discuss our solid results that demonstrate continued progress against our near-term and long-term objectives. Our records management business continues to deliver steady organic revenue growth and strong margin expansion, while at the same time we\u2019re achieving meaningful scale and faster growing adjacent businesses. We remain focused on driving increased value for our shareholders through strong current performance combined with investments in our data center and other adjacent businesses. Let me start off by quickly walking you through the highlights before providing a bit more detail. You can see both the quarter and year-to-date performance on slides 8 and 9 of the presentation which show results trending mostly ahead of our annual outlook. For the quarter, revenue came in at about $1.1 billion growing 11% on a constant dollar basis, driven by the impact of our data center acquisitions and solid internal storage revenue growth. Our internal storage revenue growth adjusted for last year\u2019s termination fee was 2.7% for the quarter and 3.2% year-to-date, which is in line with our 3% to 3.5% annual guidance. This reflects solid underlying fundamentals, benefits from our revenue management program and positive net global storage volumes. Our internal revenue growth is calculated to exclude any impact of the new revenue recognition standard; however, the accounting change has had some minor impact on reported storage and service revenue mix. Internal service revenue grew 7.6% in the second quarter and 4.2% in the first half, primarily due to contribution from our shred business, which Bill discussed, as well as additional digitalization and other projects. Our gross profit margin improved by 70 basis points in the quarter primarily driven by labor efficiencies and the flow through of our revenue management program. SG&A as a percentage of revenue also improved, about 60 basis points year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA grew almost 15% on a constant dollar basis for the quarter to $369 million with margins expanding 130 basis points reflecting the benefits of recall synergies and our transformation initiative, flow through from revenue management initiatives, contribution from our higher margin data center business and the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. When excluding the approximately $6 million of benefits from the data center, data center early lease termination fee and other non-recurring items recorded a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter expanded 190 basis points. Also our structural tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%, a bit higher than our annual guidance as a result of higher rates in the international markets and increased depreciation and amortization in our qualified REIT subsidiary associated with recent data center acquisitions. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.30 per share, flat compared to last year due partly to the increased depreciation and amortization as well as increased shares outstanding following our December offering to fund the acquisition of IO data centers. AFFO was $451 million for the first half, up $63 million or more than 16% over the prior year and is trending towards the upper end of our guidance for 2018. Providing a little more color on our internal growth performance for the year, on Slide 10, you can see the impact of our revenue management efforts reflected in developed markets internal storage revenue growth of 1.3% for the quarter. This quarter\u2019s growth is slightly lower as we cycle over a strong 3.4% internal growth in the second quarter of 2017. Developed markets internal volume growth was negative, about 1% on a trailing 12-month basis on a base of more than 500 million cubic feet in storage. Internal service revenue in developed markets increased 7.6% for the quarter due mainly to growth in our shred business, project revenue and digitization as mentioned earlier. In other international, we continue to see steady storage internal revenue growth of 5.9% for the quarter with service internal revenue growth of 6%. In other reporting segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the legacy data center business delivered strong internal revenue growth of almost 35% for the quarter, albeit off a small base after adjusting for last year\u2019s early lease termination fee. Turning to Slide 11, you can see our margin expansion with growth in almost all segments. In the global data center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins while down slightly on a reported basis improved nicely after adjusting for last year\u2019s early termination fee reflecting our scaling of the business. We expect data center margins over time to move closer to the mid to high 50% range as we fully integrate recent acquisitions and add more scale to this business. Year-to-date, we have executed 4.4 megawatts of new leases primarily with enterprise customers and the federal government. Based on our leasing pipeline, we are tracking well relative to our 10 megawatts of expected leasing this year and we are pleased with progress considering that our Phoenix data centers were 100% leased at acquisition. Turning to Slide 12, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio was 5.6x at the end of the second quarter consistent with the first quarter and after closing the EvoSwitch transaction. Our current leverage ratio is comfortably in line with other REITs especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors. Additionally, during the second quarter we refinanced our line of credit reducing interest on drawn and undrawn balances by 25 basis points and extending the maturity. As you can see in the supplemental, as of June 30, our borrowings were 74% fixed rate, our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.8% and our well laddered maturity is an average of 6.6 years. We believe this is an appropriate structure supported by our real estate portfolio and long-term nature of our customer relationships. With regard to guidance, we remain comfortable with the constant dollar outlook we laid out on our February call, which is in our supplemental materials for your reference. While exchange rates have had a modestly positive impact on year-to-date results versus a year ago, at current exchange rates we expect the strengthening dollar to result in a headwind of about $50 million to reported revenue in the back half of the year which will flow through to EBITDA. Just a reminder that we evaluate the business on a constant dollar basis and that outlook is unchanged. We do, however, anticipate greater capital efficiencies as you have seen through the first half of the year, so expect full year AFFO to be at the higher end of our guidance range. I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our cash sources and uses on Slide 13 of the presentation, which we have updated since our last quarterly call to reflect the acquisition of EvoSwitch, capital recycling proceeds from the sale of three infill properties in London as well as anticipated additional development to expand our data center capacity in Phoenix and Amsterdam. Our strong operating performance and capital discipline has allowed us to keep leverage flat while borrowing to fund EvoSwitch. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter business performance and results of the first half. Our revenue management initiative is working well, driving steady growth and strong margin expansion from our records management business. Further, we remain very encouraged with the progress in data center and the prospects for creating meaningful value for shareholders through expanding the platform. We\u2019re building out a well-rounded competitive data center portfolio with strong growth and a healthy outlook. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these elements over the coming quarters. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open it up for Q&A. William Meaney : Thank you, Stuart. I just wish to make some quick comments before we open it up to Q&A. First, we\u2019re very pleased by the strong financial and operating performance and this is punctuated by both the strong internal revenue growth both in storage and service, the continued expansion of EBITDA margins which when combined with internal revenue growth gave us around 4% internal EBITDA growth in the first half. Our new information governance in digitization services are finding real resonance with our customers as they look to us in helping them manage a hybrid physical and digital world. This is visible both in our financial results as well as the partnership announced with Google. Finally, we continue to be a standout as a high-yielding investment which continues to grow AFFO and EBITDA in the mid to upper single digits fueling continuing dividend growth. With that, I\u2019d like the operator to turn it over to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This morning\u2019s first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019d like to dive a little bit deeper into your progress of price volume optimization. Can you elaborate on what extent your increases in pricing has been implemented versus internal plans? And how over the next several years you expect to migrate the North American price increase strategy over to Europe? William Meaney : Okay. Good morning, George. What I would say is it\u2019s fully implemented and probably has been for about 12 months in North America. I\u2019d say we\u2019re more than halfway through mark in Europe but you\u2019re just starting to see the results. And you can see that when you actually \u2013 it\u2019s the monkey math in the sense that as you know that the internal revenue growth and internal volume growth are done on a slightly different basis, but you can get a feel for the difference between, say, Western Europe and North America in terms of how much the internal revenue growth is coming from price and how much is volume. Still in Europe we\u2019re still getting a lot of the internal revenue growth from volume whereas in North America we\u2019re getting it all from price. And over time what we\u2019re driving for is again to get more and more of our internal revenue growth from price in these mature markets as we try to maximize the yield or the NOI that we\u2019re getting on the assets deployed rather than having to add racking to drive internal revenue growth. So I would say in North America we\u2019re pretty much there and we continue \u2013 and in Europe we\u2019re probably a little bit more than halfway there and we continue to look at developed markets to deliver somewhere between, say, 3%, 3.5% of internal price improvement going forward as we roll that program out into Western Europe. If we look at the emerging markets, we have just recently established four pricing centers or revenue management centers in those markets because we don\u2019t want to just leave chips on the table. But you can expect us to continue to be more cautious in those markets to be too aggressive with price because those are markets that typically with a few exceptions \u2013 there\u2019s some locations in Latin America and in Eastern Europe where we\u2019re very comfortable with our market penetration but there are other areas where we\u2019re still building market share. But we have actually initiated four regional centers of excellence in terms of revenue management even in the emerging markets now. George Tong : Yes, that makes sense. And as your pricing initiatives continue to get implemented, would you view this as a one-time step up in pricing or do you think it\u2019s going to be a sustained lever over the course of several years? In other words, what\u2019s the timeline of revenue lift or what\u2019s essentially the timeframe of when you would expect the benefits to flow through from pricing and when would you expect that to normalize back down to low single digits or inflationary trends? William Meaney : Well, we\u2019re right now I think \u2013 we think that we have a pretty long runway to keep kind of that 3%, 3.5% if we\u2019re looking just purely at developed markets. There was probably a little bit of catch-up because I think we are trending in the high \u2013 like the 3.5% to 4% at one point but we think the 3% to 3.5% in the current inflationary environment that we can continue to do that. So we feel pretty comfortable that we can get a little bit ahead of inflation in terms of the pricing and optimizing value for money that we\u2019re providing our customers, especially as they\u2019re coming to see us as a company that can support them on a number of fronts because the storage is just one part of the relationship between us and them. So they see \u2013 they\u2019re actually even seeing more value that we provide from the storage part of the documents because of what we\u2019re assisting them in doing on getting more revenue or insights from those documents going forward. So we feel pretty comfortable. It\u2019s not kind of a one-and-done type thing that we can continue to drive in the developed markets that 3%, 3.5% annual price increase. George Tong : Got it. Makes a lot of sense. And then lastly around services, the organic growth this quarter accelerated to 7.6%. Can you talk about whether there were any one-time benefits that occurred in the quarter or reasons why you might not expect that growth to persist going forward? William Meaney : It\u2019s a good point. I think we\u2019ve called out a few times when it was kind of on the other side of the equation that especially as we go into more of the digitization project, which we\u2019re really excited about, right. That\u2019s also one of the reasons why we\u2019ve established a partnership with Google. Those are going to be more lumpy, right. There is a recurring part of that especially the digitization projects that then rely on Iron Cloud to do the ongoing storage, so that would look more like a SaaS-type contract where there will be a recurring part of it. But there is many times a lumpy part of those contracts which is the initial digitization piece. So that is part of the thing that has driven that blip and that\u2019s also why we \u2013 you\u2019ll notice that I talked about it both the 7% plus that you\u2019re referring to but also the 4% plus on the first half because there will be some movement back and forth. In addition to that, we did also have a very strong quarter on shred fueled partly by paper prices, partly because we\u2019ve had some documents that have come off legal hold that are getting destroyed. So that fuels some of the \u2013 so I would consider that kind of a one-off destruction volume hit because of these documents that have come off legal hold. That\u2019s not a usual occurrence. And then the other part is we obviously have won some new customers. So there are some one-off I would say aspects of even the shred business mainly around these legal hold documents but also you will see a little bit more movement up and down as these projects roll, even though that there\u2019s a recurring aspect for both of these digitization projects. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Bill, I\u2019m going to go back to my gold and goose question. In terms of the revenue stepping up from pricing and looking at that with some of the volumes coming down, how are you kind of ensuring that you\u2019re not killing the goose that laid the golden eggs in terms of \u2013 we saw the volumes go down? You mentioned legal aspect of that kind of a cliff. Maybe you can go into that a little bit more? And are we going to see the volumes come back towards \u2013 or hover around 0 plus or minus or should we really expect that in mature geographies we\u2019re just going to see the volumes really just start to decline now? William Meaney : It\u2019s a good question, Shlomo. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to ask any other questions. That\u2019s fine. Shlomo Rosenbaum : [Indiscernible] also by the way. William Meaney : So coming around the goose, so the one thing \u2013 I think last time you and I spoke about it is I said, look, we are pushing price so there is always the potential to be some slowdown from existing customers. The one thing I was encouraged this time \u2013 and so we do watch that, right. To say that there was no elasticity out there is probably not fair, although I think there\u2019s less and less elasticity going forward especially as we broaden what we\u2019re doing for the customers across this kind of hybrid digital physical world. But specifically we were encouraged that if you look at new volumes from existing customers, that stayed steady from last quarter to this quarter. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a \u2013 there may have been a little bit of an impact but I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not getting worse. So I think that\u2019s kind of flattening out. So I think that\u2019s encouraging that we can continue to drive the type of price increases that we\u2019ve been pushing through. Knowing that, yes, it may slow down that a little bit. The big difference this quarter was really around these legal holds and you can see that \u2013 in terms of the destructions, that\u2019s kicked up. And just to give you, put some context on that, so the thing is we\u2019re \u2013 on a trailing 12 months if we look just at developed markets because developed markets is where we see this trend that you\u2019re describing, right, which are the more mature markets. So if I just look at developed markets, we continue to get in about 28 million boxes a year on an internal basis before acquisitions on a trailing 12-month basis and that\u2019s staying pretty steady, so we think that\u2019s really good. So we don\u2019t see it drop off on what new is coming in. Historically \u2013 you\u2019ve watched the starts a long time, we average about 20 million boxes of destruction a year that go out. And now we\u2019ve seen this uptick which is driven mainly around legal hold which both before and after the GFC. So during that period of time where the uptick on a percentage term turns out to be 2 million or 3 million boxes of additional destruction on that 20 million base. And we think it\u2019s going to take some time for that to wash through. So if you said to a net-net where that all leaves, we\u2019re still kind of in the same guidance that we\u2019ve provided last time as I think that we do expect the developed markets to be flat plus or minus on the zero. We still see especially with the federal government and some of the middle market which is going to be also lumpy how those things come in. We will have some quarters that are going to be on the positive. We\u2019re going to have some quarters that are on the negative. If you ask me looking forward over the next 12 to 14 months that they were going to have more quarters on the negative side of zero than the positive side, we think it\u2019s going to be kind of in that range. So we don\u2019t see an acceleration in terms of the drop off. And so we feel very comfortable that we can continue to drive the kind of internal revenue growth even from the developed markets that we\u2019ve been able to achieve. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So we should see this improve? We should see that we\u2019re going to go ahead and get volumes that are going to get closer to zero or even plus a little bit at some point in the next 12 to 24 months? William Meaney : I think the next 12 to 24 months I think we\u2019re going to be more in the negative side, but after that yes I think we\u2019ll have some quarters that we\u2019ll be in the positive column. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So over the next one to two years we should expect this to be a negative trend? William Meaney : I wouldn\u2019t say negative trend. I would say it\u2019s going to be at about the same trend if I\u2019m kind of looking through these legal holds that are kind of flowing through and I\u2019m looking through in terms of how our pipeline is building with some of the less penetrated areas of our business before, which is the middle market and the federal government, then I would say if you kind of looked through that, I think we\u2019re going to kind of be in the same volume trends \u2013 not trends I would say but kind of the same volume levels that we\u2019re seeing right now on a quarter-by-quarter basis but not trending negatively but kind of staying in that kind of range. So I think we\u2019re going to be probably on the negative side of zero. But I do see as the destruction levels go back up to normalized trends and looking at the forward pipeline if you\u2019re saying to me do I think there\u2019s going to be some quarters that will also be on the positive side, yes. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So if you kind of keep the volumes flat, what you\u2019re saying is, is that after you comp on a way that makes the quarters go negative on a year-over-year basis but essentially you\u2019re not accelerating the decline? Did I understand that correctly? William Meaney : That\u2019s correct. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And just if you look at the organic revenue growth on storage and like each market, except other international, the organic revenue growth, I\u2019m not talking about volumes, just the revenue growth seems to have gone down a little bit lower than in the last four or five quarters. Is there something going on over there or how should we think about that? William Meaney : Well, I think if you look developed markets, right, to your point it kind of \u2013 let\u2019s just put it in the total, it comes out to I think around 2.3%. And then if you do the kind of \u2013 if you do on a monkey math in terms of if you take the volume, you take the revenue and you get like around 2.3%, 2.4% in terms of price that we\u2019ve got and we normally are getting 3%, 3.5% in that growth. There were some one-offs that were from a comparison last year that kind of suppressed that comparison. So we\u2019re still tracking in that 3%, 3.5% of price increase on an annual basis in the developed market. So we don\u2019t actually see it trending down. There were some one-offs in Q2 last year that made that comparison look \u2013 again, monkey match acknowledging that volumes on a trailing 12-month prices on year-over-year or revenues on year-over-year. But if you do the monkey math you get to 2.3%. But if you kind of correct for that, we\u2019re still kind of in the 3%, 3.5% range. So we expect that to continue to trend. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. I\u2019m going to have to take that offline just because what I\u2019m seeing is storage internal growth in NA RIM at 1.4% and then data management 0.7% and then 1.8% in Western Europe and each one of those is a decel? Stuart Brown : Just to add on to what Bill said, there was \u2013 remember we\u2019re cycling over a strong first quarter and NA RIM a year ago and there were some one-time benefits on an annualized basis, not a big number but impacted the second quarter by probably about 40 basis points. So actually you\u2019re sort of \u2013 if you normalize for that you wouldn\u2019t see the same trend you\u2019re seeing. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then just \u2013 the services projects are on one hand encouraging, the other hand they\u2019re more volatile and George got into some little bit. I thought maybe you could talk about it a little bit more. Is there a portion of these businesses that we\u2019re not just going to see a bunch of projects that go up and down, up and down? Is there a portion of these businesses that are going to really \u2013 or projects that will end up being recurring multiyear type of items that will bring the services business to strength on more of a regular basis? William Meaney : Yes, that was what I was trying to highlight before is that there is kind of two aspects with a lot of these projects, not always but more and more especially since we\u2019ve launched Iron Cloud. It is the part which is getting the information in digital format that they can either apply machine learning to or they can just taking physical documents and putting it into electronic documents. There\u2019s a project aspect to that and that will continue to be lumpy. And then there\u2019s the other aspect when they\u2019re utilizing Iron Cloud, then that becomes more like a SaaS project. It\u2019s an ongoing recurring revenue associated with that digital storage that we\u2019re providing through Iron Cloud. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So if you look at some of the projects that you have right now, are these going to be ongoing for several quarters or should we infer that if you had a really strong quarter like very often then we\u2019ll see the next year, you have very tough comp or even the next quarter, it drops down because of that. William Meaney : I think as we start up, you\u2019re still going to see probably similar kind of lumpiness that you\u2019ve seen historically, so I wouldn\u2019t say that you\u2019re going to see a major change in the next couple of quarters because the Iron Cloud we just launched in the last few months. So we\u2019re just starting to get that, what I call that recurring base that comes from that aspect of it. But I\u2019ll give you an example. We signed a market research company just recently which is a five-year contract which is just recurring revenue year-after-year-after-year, right, and we expect to renew after five years because it\u2019s still going to need access to that data. But it\u2019s going to take some time for the Iron Cloud to ramp which is the main part of the recurring. We do have some other projects that recur as well. But I think if you look at for the next few quarters, Shlomo, I think you\u2019re going to see continued lumpiness. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. And then I\u2019m just going to leave off with this. It seems like the focus on data center, the capital is going there versus \u2013 or some reallocation from records management. Typically records management acquisitions have helped keep the volumes up as well. Is that going to kind of change the volume look on a go-forward basis as more of the capital is allocated through the data center side? Stuart Brown : You\u2019ll see more \u2013 I think we\u2019ll be able to continue to deliver growth on the records management side. I think what you see from a capital discipline standpoint what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve gotten \u2013 we\u2019re building less in advance before we\u2019re building out racking sort of two to three years in advance on the storage side. So we\u2019re able to continue to keep the records management growth. We may not be building out quite as much. So we\u2019ve been able to take some of that capital, reallocate that to the data center business. And so as you\u2019re taking the strong base that we have from EvoSwitch with a strong ongoing earnings revenue, take customers out of their existing data centers, expand them out. You\u2019re seeing us get good preleasing on the development side, so we\u2019ll continue to get earnings expansion from that and the strong capital returns. The capital returns from a racking is obviously the best returns and we\u2019ll continue to allocate capital there as we have the opportunities. But the data center business I think longer term is really going to continue to create the most value for shareholders as you\u2019re developing those assets at a low to mid-teens return in a business that\u2019s got cap rates that are mid to upper single digits. So that creates a lot of value for shareholders. William Meaney : And the only thing I would just add to what Stuart, Shlomo, on that is that it goes back to the pricing what we\u2019re doing on yield management in developed markets. So if you look at North America for instance and you look at North America two years ago is our internal revenue growth was almost completely driven by volume. So we were adding racking to support that. Now we\u2019re actually getting higher internal revenue growth out of North America and we\u2019re doing that without any additional racking or nearly \u2013 almost no additional racking. We thought to add racking in a couple places but much less racking than we have to do to drive that. And you can see that in a chart that we introduced this time around looking at NOI growth in terms of our records management business is we\u2019ve grown it not only on absolute terms but we also have grown it on a square foot basis. So we are getting much better yield also out of mature markets and that allows us where we had to spend money on racking before is to be able to reallocate that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Good morning. You\u2019ve made several larger data center acquisitions with personnel from the different companies. I was wondering if you could touch on how integration in that line of business is going. And also any examples of cross selling the data centers to Iron Mountain storage customers? William Meaney : Thanks, Sheila. It\u2019s a great question. So first of all we\u2019re really \u2013 I think I said this last time, we\u2019re really pleased and we\u2019re pleased with the assets that we have but we\u2019re really pleased with the people assets. In fact, Mark Kidd had an offsite with his management team I think it was about 10 days ago that I went and spent a little bit of time with them. And the level of engagement, the expertise, the customer relationships that those folks have brought across both at IO and Eric for EvoSwitch, for instance, was in the room as well that he\u2019s bringing in terms of strengthening our position in Europe is fantastic. So I feel really both fortunate the people that we were able to get as part of the acquisition and just the sense of their engagement, motivation and excitement of being at Iron Mountain because a number of them felt like they were capital constrained before we bought them because obviously their companies were getting ready for sale, et cetera. So I think the excitement is really good and the talent that we got is really good. I think where we\u2019re continuing to work through on the integration, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re all done on the integration. I think the people integration were pretty far along but we still have some operating systems that were still standardizing and integrating because obviously every time you buy one of these companies, they have their own operating system. So we\u2019re still integrating across that. In terms of the cross selling, yes, we\u2019ve seen it in both ways. So we have a relationship with pretty much, on the Iron Mountain side with all of the \u2013 almost all the large global financial service customers. And as a result of that, some of the data center folks have been able to expand their footprint using the Iron Mountain relationships in those financial service customers which they were unable to before. And on the other side even we\u2019ve had cases where say IO was serving a bank but they didn\u2019t have the northern Virginia location and we\u2019ve already seen cross selling within the data center business of being able to take customers that we might have been serving in northern New Jersey, for instance, into our northern Virginia facility which has been also great in terms of retention of some of the sales folks that we\u2019ve been able to get through these acquisitions because we\u2019ve effectively given them more shelf space or more product on the shelf that they can sell. So we\u2019ve seen revenue synergies, if you will, by just building the footprint and getting our sales people more product to sell by geographical expansion. And then we\u2019ve also seen some relationships that we\u2019ve had on the records management side that we\u2019ve been able to facilitate so they can actually add new logos. So, so far it seems to be really positive. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And then moving to the venture with Google, just to understand how that came about, does it require new employee hires for Iron Mountain and who is offering the marketing? Is Iron Mountain marketing this to their customer and Google is just the tech programming part? Just a little bit more detail how you expect this to unfold. William Meaney : We\u2019re excited about the Google partnership. So to me it\u2019s kind of little bit the Reese's peanut butter cup, right. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s the chocolate and who\u2019s the peanut butter. But I guess it depends on which you like. I like chocolate better so I\u2019ll stick with the chocolate. But I think that it was one of these things where I think we were both looking at this. We continue to work with our customers and our customers continue to come to us especially as they go through their digital transformation on how we can help them in this hybrid digital and physical world. And because we have a lot of their physical content, we\u2019ve been historically helping them digitize that and we have their trust. You were a natural person for them to come to. So we started looking at could we find a partner that would help facilitate some of the machine learning, because we\u2019re not an artificial intelligence or machine learning company but we know how to actually ingest data, tag it and put it together in a way that actual machine learning can efficiently be applied to that and then store the results afterwards in a secure \u2013 both the cyber secure and from an intellectual property secure methodology. So we had actually independently started looking at this space. We\u2019ve hired a number of people from the tech community. Fidelma Russo, as you know, that we brought over from EMC about 14, 18 months ago. She\u2019s systematically recruited a team not just for this area but for a number of areas where we think technology can really drive new revenue streams for the company. So we\u2019ve brought in a number of people that actually have developed what we call records management as a service, this product offering. At the same time Google has been looking at that space. And if you kind of look at \u2013 I think you have to ask Google but when I speak with Google, the reason why they were attracted to us really is kind of two levels. One is that we have such a deep trusting relationship with 950 of the Fortune 1000 and we truly are a B2B marketing and selling organization, which is slightly different than Google. The other thing is, is we have that trusted position and we have tons of data. So if you look at the medical records, for instance, we have 850 million medical records. Now it\u2019s not going to be our decision to do this. This is our customers come to us and say they want to try to get more insight and do things faster and better in a more compliant way with their information. So when we have those opportunities, coming to your question who\u2019s selling it? Iron Mountain is selling. And we put something together for the customer and transparently if the customer says, yes, we want to actually apply machine learning to that, Google as you know is one of the strongest machine learning artificial intelligence companies around and has the scale to actually do these type of applications on a global footprint, not just in the United States. So we\u2019re really excited. It\u2019s early days and as we say we\u2019ll launch it in September. So we\u2019ve already done proof of concepts in a couple of industry verticals and we were at Google next last week speaking about it and Google was also speaking about it. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And one last quick one. In the supplemental there was a ratio on internal data center growth which was negative. Was that skewed by that lease termination fee that you mentioned in the year-ago period? Stuart Brown : Right, exactly. There was a lease termination fee. SimpliVity paid a lease termination fee after they got acquired last year. It was about $4 million. Sheila McGrath : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Stuart Brown : Thanks, Sheila. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, Stuart, how much cost efficiencies are left in the transformation initiatives and the recall synergies? And what will drive margins forward past these two areas? Stuart Brown : When you look at sort of our margin outlook and our 2020 guidance, you sort of get an ongoing call it up and down a little bit to sort of 60, 70, 80 basis point margin expansion per year. And so a piece of that is obviously continued efficiency improvements, some of those efficiency improvements will drop to the bottom line, some of that will continue to reinvest in back office improvements and the customer service initiatives \u2013 customer solutions that Bill talked about, so some of that will get reinvested. Obviously we get margin expansion as well from revenue management so that contributes to it as well. And over time as the data center business grows, that\u2019s a higher margin business also. So that just from the mix standpoint will wake that up. Andrew Steinerman : Right. And so Stuart I think you just answered the second part of the question on kind of past initiative, but about the first part. When you look at those two buckets, transformation and recall synergies, how much is left in those? Stuart Brown : Yes, from recall we\u2019ve got about $5 million to $10 million of synergies left. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Stuart Brown : And most of that is coming from the real estate consolidation. Most of the benefits are flowing through what we talked about is the piece that would be trailing would largely be around the real estate consolidation just because it takes a little while to set that up. Andrew Steinerman : Right. And then all your original transformation initiatives, is that ongoing or --? Stuart Brown : Yes, we\u2019ve captured most of that as well and that\u2019s inherent in this year\u2019s guidance already. Andrew Steinerman : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Eric Compton with Morningstar. Eric Compton : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick ones. One, just on data centers. So I\u2019m looking at kind of Q2 the revenue per leasable square foot and per leasable megawatt compared to Q1 and I\u2019m seeing kind of some trends up there. I\u2019m wondering is that just the function of some of the mix change maybe adding Amsterdam now or is that like \u2013 is there something to that trend or maybe I\u2019m reading a little bit too much into that? And then related to that, just maybe a little more color on your take of supply and demand what you\u2019re seeing in the data center market pricing, anything along those lines? William Meaney : Because we\u2019re looking at a number of different markets, there is a mix issue. In other words, it depends on how much hyperscale, how much smaller colo and obviously retail has a different pricing per kilowatt. In terms of the trend, we continue to see \u2013 first of all, we are emphasizing on the top 20 global markets, top 10 in the U.S. and top 10 in international and those markets by their own definition have the highest absorption rate. So we continue to see very strong demand pipeline. You noticed that we announced the expansion of the Phoenix campus, for instance, with the first 24 megawatts being available by July next year, so about a year\u2019s time. We do that based on the pipeline of commercial deals that we see coming in. So we really remain very bullish on the data center segment especially in these high absorption markets which we\u2019re focused on. Stuart Brown : And just to come back on the supplemental, when you look at that, the majority of that change is really the layering in of EvoSwitch during the quarter. Eric Compton : Got you. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And last one for me just on the corporate and other segment, I know there is a lot of kind of moving parts in there. But I\u2019ve got in my notes just \u2013 the goal is maybe 140 by 2020 if I\u2019m reading this right. So I\u2019m just curious, I know we had the art acquisition I believe was last quarter, so maybe any updates there as far as growth and what the \u2013 just kind of maybe an updated run rate there where future growth might come from in that segment? William Meaney : You\u2019re picking up the general right now, because what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve had that the art segment as you highlighted before and we this year have actually taken the entertainment services which used to be part of data management and we\u2019ve put that together with art, because whist the \u2013 a number of the customers are obviously different is the way we go to market and the type of services that we offer whether it\u2019s the entertainment services or the art market are very similar. So when you look at those businesses, they do tend to have growth rates that are on an organic basis in the mid to upper single digits. And we can see that consistently. And we\u2019re also seeing \u2013 we\u2019re getting some synergies on that. But we\u2019ll provide more guidance as we go forward. But right now we\u2019ve put it in the corporate segment because it\u2019s actually still relatively small to the whole. Stuart Brown : And the other thing to remember is Artex which is the art business that\u2019s really been focused on the museums was acquired late \u2013 was closed late in the quarter and so that had very small impact. But that integration was going well already. Eric Compton : Got you. All right, thanks, super helpful. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We have a follow-up question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Bill, I just want to see if you\u2019d let me back in. William Meaney : I always let you in, Shlomo. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Yes, I\u2019m just kidding with you. I just want to ask, absent the data center acquisitions, would you still hit that 2020 plan in terms of margins? William Meaney : I think we would be close because the way that the data centers \u2013 look, the data centers have a higher margin. Even when they stabilizes we say they\u2019re kind of 55% let\u2019s roughly margins. That being said, between now and 2020 because of the growth in the data center business if we\u2019re not running that portfolio on a fully stabilized basis, over time you can expect that that\u2019s going to give us more tailwinds behind our margin expansion. But between now and 2020 given the development pipeline, it may add a little bit but still the bulk of our growth is in the core business. Stuart Brown : The only thing I\u2019ll add, Shlomo, is that we did update the 2020 plan after we bought IO. We actually increased the margins at that time. So we had already made an adjustment for that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : But I\u2019m just saying if you go back and I looked back and all I could say the last Analyst Day that you guys had a 2020 plan. Are you getting back a little bit to what Andrew was asking, are you guys on track with the overall core business? Stuart Brown : We\u2019ll probably answer \u2013 if you look at the trends rates that we\u2019ve been hitting and the benefits of the revenue management program, we probably would be exceeding those targets. William Meaney : Yes, and you can see that in the results that we\u2019re printing now. We\u2019re actually continuing to grow EBITDA and this is \u2013 and a lot of the data centers not fully stabilized now. So it\u2019s adding a little bit benefit but the bulk of the benefit is what we\u2019ve been able to drive through the integration of recall, transformation and the general health of the business and then you layer on revenue management. So the bulk of the \u2013 coming back to the margin expansion, over time though I would say once you get beyond 2020 and every year as the data center business continues to go, obviously that\u2019s going to just fuel the EBITDA margin growth even more. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. As there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to turn the call to management for any closing comments. William Meaney : Thank you very much. Have a good weekend, everyone. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session and today\u2019s conference call.

With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Greer, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, I first wish to welcome Greer to Iron Mountain in her role leading Investor Relations. Finding someone who has the skills, experience, and reputation to replace Melissa wasn't easy. We therefore felt very fortunate when we found that person in Greer. So, welcome, Greer. We're very pleased you are here. To Melissa, who'll be retiring at the end of the year, I wish to take a moment to thank you as this will be your last earnings call. And Melissa, as you know, started at Iron Mountain the same time as me. And it is impossible today to thank her appropriately. But I do wish to mention that we will be eternally grateful for all she has done doing a superb job leading not only our IR function, but much of our communications as well over the last six years. She has done all this against a backdrop of the company executing an agenda, delivering significant growth to our business, which has been transformative. Thank you, Melissa. I don't know how we would have done this without you. Now, moving on to the quarter. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial performance coupled with marked progress and our strategic plan as articulated four years ago designed to support the shift in our business mix. Our plan revolves around three pillars : getting more out of our developed markets in terms of yielding cash flow, expanding our Records Management model in the faster-growing emerging markets, and building on our strong customer relationships with 950 of the Fortune 1000 coupled with our know-how in order to expand into adjacent business areas. To this end, we are very pleased by our progress across these three pillars. A few proof points of this can be readily illustrated at a high level. We continue to maximize yield from Records Management in developed markets with adjusted EBITDA margin in North America RIM now over 46% with growing internal revenue, albeit on lower volumes. We achieved internal service revenue growth of 7%, which is a result of growth in Shred in business areas such as Information Governance and Digital Solutions or IGDS. We progressed towards our goal in making Records Management in the faster growing emerging markets, a bigger part of our mix where these markets represent 18% of our revenue whilst continuing to improve EBITDAR margins which are now over 30%. And we advanced the expansion of our data center business, which even at this early stage is now making a marked impact on our EBITDA and AFFO growth given it is now more than 8% of our adjusted EBITDA and is already expected to contribute 100 to 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA growth on a consolidated basis. All told, the consistent delivery against our strategic goals has continued to drive strong growth in profitability as measured by year-over-year expansion in both gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin supporting healthy cash flow generation to fund our business investments whilst also reducing leverage over time. As a result, this morning, we announced a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend per share in line with our 2020 plan. This is supported by our year-to-date AFFO growth of 13.7%, which is well in excess of our 8% increase in share count. For the full year, our AFFO payout ratio is expected to be sub-80% versus our original guidance midpoint of 81% even after increasing the dividend. Our third quarter performance outlined on page 3 of the presentation is highlighted by total revenue growth of 12% on a constant dollar basis, solid growth in adjusted EBITDA with an 80 basis point increase in EBITDA margins, continued durability of our storage business with total internal revenue growth of 2.3%, strong internal service revenue growth of 7.1% for the quarter, good progress on integrating our data center acquisitions illustrated by strong data center portfolio utilization of 91.1% and continued organic expansion of our global data center platform, through internal development including breaking ground on our second phase of capacity in Phoenix and entering into a development agreement in Chicago, a top 5 U.S. market. In addition, we continue to achieve total internal revenue growth across all markets supported by internal storage revenue growth and strong internal service revenue growth. We also continue to focus on optimizing both utilization and storage rates to maximize yield as evidenced by further increases in net operating income per square foot as shown on slide 4. Volume across our Records Management business was down 0.1% on a global basis prior to acquisitions or about 700,000 cubic feet. This was driven by negative internal volume growth in North America and a slowdown in, albeit, continued positive volume growth in Europe. The May implementation of GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation is having some impact on behavior related to destructions. Whilst a European regulation focused on protection of personal identifiable information, this regulation has global reach and covers record held by European nationals inside and outside of Europe. Beyond regulatory changes leading to increases in destruction activity from time to time, we have also seen a slowdown of incoming volume. As the incoming rate of new boxes decelerates, the boxes held in inventory naturally age during this period. As the deceleration continues, we expect the ratio of destructions to remain elevated until the rate of incoming global volume normalizes. This interim increase in the rate of destructions is expected to flatten out over time. However, we expect this net volume dynamic to continue for the next few years, and are running our business based on this expectation. Importantly, this impact is de minimis on a bottom line financial basis and does not affect our financial plan in terms of growth and profitability in cash flow as we continue to expect to offset any volume decline through revenue management, as well as growth in new services. Stuart will walk you through some of the financial aspects of all this in a few minutes. In addition, I mentioned earlier that our Information Governance and Digital Solutions business is growing nicely and should, over time, offset some of the volume declines in physical storage as our customers increasingly manage a hybrid physical and digital world in terms of how they conduct their Records Management operations. IGDS provides our customers with the ability to convert physical documents into digital content through the use of migration services supporting customers' digital transformation. Growth has been supported by a robust pipeline of increasingly larger opportunities, as well as greater customer traction. Moreover, in terms of further growing our digitization efforts, our newly announced partnership with Google shows early signs in its potential to increase our IGDS pipeline. With our recently announced InSight Platform, we have already developed proofs-of-concept, working with customers in oil and gas, financial services, and an internal legal application. Additionally, within our services business, we are \u2013 Secure Shredding unit experienced another strong quarter, driven by a significant increase in paper prices coupled with a 13% increase in tonnage year-over-year. Moreover, we continue to see new opportunities in largely unvended channels such as the federal government. Specifically on federal government, we were awarded a $65 million five-year blanket purchase agreement with the Department of Homeland Security or DHS. With this agreement, we have the opportunity to deliver significant efficiency gains for DHS providing not only storage and retrieval services, but also accelerating the digital transformation initiatives towards a more modern information governance program. Additionally, we had another award to help the U.S. Army Heritage and Educational Center with their digital transformation and the preservation of historical artifacts. This is an example of what we expect to be an acceleration in U.S. government outsourcing and demonstrates that our efforts over the last few years are delivering results. Another government win came from our Fine Art business where we were subcontracted to relocate the collection of the National Air and Space Museum to temporary storage as a result of extensive renovation that will take six years to complete. Turning now to emerging markets for our Records Management business, we continue to deliver solid internal revenue growth as well as attractive acquisition opportunities to expand our presence in faster growing markets. For example, we recently acquired businesses in China and South Korea which together added more than 3 million cubic feet of storage increasing our scale and further strengthening our position in these countries. Our data center business continues to perform well with revenue, adjusted EBITDA and investment forecast on plan for full year. Development opportunities to provide capacity to support customer demand in high absorption markets at attractive returns remain robust. To that point, as I mentioned earlier, in Q3, we began construction of our second phase of capacity in Phoenix, which is expected to be completed in June 2019. This phase of capacity will be a hyperscale-ready data center for which we have entered into renewable energy commitments that offset 100% of the power. The facility, including future phases, will add more than 530,000 square feet and 48 megawatts of capacity at full build-out. In addition, we are entering the Chicago data center market through a development agreement with the Pritzker Realty Group to develop a 13-acre parcel in this attractive market, which has been tight on capacity for some time. We are currently finalizing design plans and at this time, have not invested any material development capital. The site is expected to permit construction of a 36-megawatt colocation facility to support the digital transformation initiatives of global enterprises, as well as meet the security and performance expectations of the largest public cloud providers. Turning to our Fine Arts business, we continue to focus on expanding our presence in this faster-growing storage-related business, leveraging our core storage expertise and customer service capabilities whilst being accretive to our focus on maximizing yield across our range of storage offerings. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we completed two transactions in the Fine Arts storage business, further strengthening the market position of Crozier Fine Arts business. The first, L.A. packing, crating and transport, strengthens our position in the Los Angeles market. The second transaction, we will assume operations of Christie's Park Royal Warehouse in London, representing Crozier's first Fine Arts storage and service location outside North America. As shown on slide 5, we remain firmly on track to achieve continued internal revenue growth on a global basis fueled by further yield management with ongoing expansion and development in our data center platform and continued growth in our adjacent businesses. Moreover, given the expansion of our higher growth portfolio, which consists of emerging markets, data center, and adjacent businesses, we are approaching approximately 19% of our internal revenue or 23% including the acquisitions in the last 12 months with a goal to be 30% by the end of 2020. Additionally, we continue to deliver improvement across the organization in terms of optimizing utilization and driving margin improvement over time. Altogether, we are within reach to achieve a business mix delivering adjusted EBITDA growth in excess of 5% before acquisitions by the end of 2020. On slide 6, I want to reiterate that we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratio targets, which assume a 4% annual increase in dividends per share between now and 2020. We have increased the midpoint of our constant dollar AFFO growth guidance from 9% to 14.5% for the full year 2018. Stuart will discuss the strength of our balance sheet shortly. Overall, we expect revenue growth in 2018 to be between 9% and 11% versus our original guidance of 7% to 9%. We continue to be unique within the S&P 500 in that we are a top yielding company with durable cash flow delivering low- to mid-single digit internal revenue growth, expanding margins, a solid balance sheet, and great long-term growth potential supported by acceleration and contribution from our faster growing portfolio. These factors are driving consistent growth in both the top line and in cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share at an attractive rate whilst funding investments and delevering over time. This dividend growth model has been further underscored by our announced 4% dividend increase and solid balance sheet. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and thank you all for joining us this morning. In the third quarter, we delivered strong cash flow growth with solid progress towards our strategic objectives. Our leading Records Management business performed well with steady internal revenue growth and strong margin expansion. Our faster-growing emerging markets, data center, and adjacent businesses are gaining scale and expanding margins, and our disciplined capital allocation supports strong cash flows to fund our multi-year plan. We continue to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders through maintaining healthy performance in our durable records and information management businesses, while investing in data centers and other adjacent businesses for further long-term value creation. This is all underpinned by a substantial high quality portfolio of owned industrial and data center properties. I'll start off with the performance highlights, which you can see on slide 7 and 8 of the presentation. We are trending at or above all of our key financial metrics from our original 2018 constant currency outlook and have increased our guidance for both revenue and AFFO. For the quarter, revenue exceeded our expectations approaching $1.1 billion, growing about 10% on a reported basis, but more than 12% on a constant dollar basis, driven by contributions from our data center acquisitions and strong service revenue growth. Total internal revenue grew about 4.1% compared to the prior year, and we grew internal storage revenue by 2.3% for the quarter or about $14 million and 2.6% year-to-date. We are pleased with the results from revenue management, but these are partially offset by slower volume growth, which I will discuss in more detail later. Internal service revenue grew by 7.1% in the third quarter and by 5.2% year-to-date primarily due to increased contributions from our Shred business, which Bill discussed, as well as additional digitalization and special projects. Our adjusted EBITDA grew almost 15% on a constant dollar basis for the quarter to $364 million, with margins expanding 80 basis points year-over-year to 34.3%. The margin improvement resulted primarily from the flow-through of revenue management, the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and labor productivity including ongoing synergies from the Recall acquisition. I'll provide more color on performance by segment in just a moment. SG&A as a percentage of revenue, excluding Recall and related costs, increased about 30 basis points year-over-year due mainly to investing in new growth initiatives and other technology. The adjusted EBITDA margin improvement came even while making these investments. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per share, down slightly compared to last year, due mainly to the increased depreciation and amortization associated with acquisitions, as well as an 8% increase in shares outstanding following our December offering to fund the acquisition of IO Data Centers. This is all in line with our guidance at the time of the announcement. AFFO was $680 million year-to-date, up about $80 million or nearly 14% over the prior year, reflecting the strong operating performance, expansion of our data center business and a very disciplined approach to capital allocation while increasing investments in new businesses. We increased the midpoint of our full-year AFFO guidance by $40 million, of which $30 million was from business performance and $10 million was from the adoption of the revenue recognition standard. Year-over-year, AFFO growth is expected to exceed 13%. I'll touch on operating performance in a little more detail. On slide 9, you can see developed markets internal storage revenue growth came in at 0.7% for the quarter despite the negative volume growth, reflecting the impact of revenue management. Internal service revenue in developed markets increased 7.1% for the quarter due mainly to growth in our Shred business, project revenue and digitization as mentioned earlier. In Other International, we continue to see steady internal storage revenue growth of 5.1% \u2013 5.9% for the quarter on 3.6% growth in internal volume for the trailing 12 months with internal service revenue growth of 6.6%. In other reporting segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the data center business delivered strong internal revenue growth of 27% for the quarter, though off a small base pre-acquisitions. Turning to slide 10, you can see the detail of our 80-basis-point adjusted margin \u2013 EBITDA margin expansion with growth in most of the segments. We did experience a margin decline in North America Data Management or tape business, driven by lower volumes as well as customer mix. In the tape-storage business, the amount of digital data being stored continues to grow; however, greater density on data protection tapes is resulting in lower physical volumes. In Western Europe, margins in the quarter were lower than last year as we experienced higher bad debt in France where we are now integrating Recall's business. Note, though, the Western Europe margins are up 190 basis points year-to-date, reflecting our focus on continuous improvement. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins have improved over 44% year-to-date, reflecting increased scale of the business and progress on integration activity. We expect data center margins over time to move closer to a mid to high 50% range as we fully integrate recent acquisitions and add more scale to this business. Year-to-date, we have executed 6.3 megawatts of new and expansion leases primarily with enterprise customers and the federal government while churn in the quarter was less than 1%. We remain on-track to achieve 2018 revenue of more than $220 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million, which includes integration cost of $7 million to $10 million. We continue also to expect leasing of around 10 megawatts for the year of new and expansion space. Turning to slide 11, you can see that lease adjusted leverage ratio was 5.6 times at the end of the third quarter, very much in line with our original outlook while having debt funded the acquisition of EvoSwitch data centers in Amsterdam. Our current leverage ratio was comfortably in line with other REITs especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors. As of September 30th, our borrowings were 72% fixed rate, our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.8% and our well-laddered maturity is an average of 6.3 years with no significant maturities until 2023. Our strong balance sheet and capital structure is supported by our significant real estate portfolio and long-term nature of our customer relationships. Turning to our revised outlook for 2018, we now expect total revenue growth of 9% to 11% with total internal revenue growth between 3.5% and 3.75%, up from 2% to 3% initially. Our outlook for internal storage rental revenue growth is revised downward to 2.5% to 2.75% with total volumes expected to be slightly down for the year 2018 prior to acquisitions. We've also increased our outlook for AFFO growth, while narrowing our adjusted EBITDA guidance. The details of which can be found on page 6 of the supplemental. We would also like to remind you about the exchange rate impact on our reported results that we communicated on the Q2 earnings call. Exchange rate headwinds have strengthened since then and we've added reported dollar ranges reflective of the headwind to our guidance page in the supplemental. In addition, we have refined our cash available for dividends and discretionary investments schedule on slide 12 to reflect our expectation of lower cash taxes and interest expense, as well as a lower level of acquisitions in Records Management and slightly higher proceeds from real estate dispositions generating more internal cash to fund investments. While we plan to provide comprehensive 2019 guidance on our February earnings call, at this time, we're basing our business plan on an expectation that internal volume will continue to be negative in North America and total internal revenue growth to be in the low-single digits. As in this quarter, we continue to expect revenue management to more than offset any global volume decline and to continue growing our internal storage rental revenue in 2019. While we continue to see good progress in our IGDS business, we do recognize that paper prices in our Shred business are at all-time highs which we do not expect to repeat in 2019. We remain confident in our ability to grow adjusted EBITDA, cash flows and, ultimately, our dividend in line with our 2020 plan. To further underscore our confidence, I would like to provide some perspective around the volume moderation. For illustrative purposes, what for example might be the impact, if we had a global volume net decline as large as 1% of total volume or 7 million cubic feet, which is 10 times larger than anything we've experienced. If you assume the volume decrease comes from a combination of fewer incoming boxes and increased destructions, the revenue lost from the fewer incoming boxes would be largely offset by an increase in destruction-related fees even before any paper revenue. So, in the first year, the EBITDA impact would be de minimis. In second year, the lost revenue would be about $20 million or $3 per cubic foot. So, even if the global level of decline was 10 times greater than what we're currently seeing, we could absorb the impact with faster growth in our other businesses, better revenue management or cost saving initiatives and continue to achieve our 2020 plan. In summary, we remain on track to continue strengthening our balance sheet while funding our targeted dividend increases such as that announced this morning. We expect our strong cash flow generation to enable us to fund dividend increases while improving our AFFO payout ratio. We are pleased with our third quarter business performance and results year-to-date. Our revenue management is working well, driving steady growth and strong margin expansion in Records Management business. Further, we remain intently focused on integrating and scaling our data center platform. We look forward updating you on our progress and providing more detail to 2019 guidance on the Q4 earnings call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we'd open it up for Q&A. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Stuart. To summarize, we've had a strong quarter both in terms of financial results, as well as progress on our strategic plan. Key financial highlights include upping our AFFO and revenue guidance for the year, increased dividend by 4% whilst improving dividend coverage. In terms of key strategic highlights, continued margin improvement, build-out of our faster-growing adjacent and emerging business areas. They now represent almost 19% of sales mix or 23% post-acquisition. This mix is already delivering 4% organic EBITDA growth, some 200 basis points better than three years ago and in line with our 5% organic EBITDA growth goal for 2020. So, we are well on track for our 2020 objectives, given our successful shift in business mix. Now, operator, we would like to open up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You've indicated that you're largely done with implementing your revenue management initiatives in the U.S. Can you discuss your progress on rolling out your initiatives in Europe and Asia and frame how continued rollout will alter your internal growth rates going forward in storage? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. No, it's a good question, George. So, I think \u2013 let me answer it in two parts. So, first is that when we say we've completed roll \u2013 we've rolled out the infrastructure but we continue to expect similar levels in absolute terms of revenue management benefit in developed markets next year as we did this year. So, continuing to get that kind of benefit that we've seen in this past year from revenue management for North America in Europe. In terms of how we're rolling that out, you can even start seeing that in this quarter in terms of \u2013 historically, you'll recall that if you've looked at our internal revenue growth in the emerging markets, you would see that that was almost all driven by volume, and you can now start seeing that we're actually getting positive traction if you \u2013 I know one's on a sequential basis and one's on a year-over \u2013 or trailing 12 months basis. But if you look \u2013 the numbers aren't \"directly comparable\", but you can start seeing that they're starting to actually get a positive spread. So, we've rolled out \u2013 doing this top of my head, we have a center now, I think, it's in S\u00e3o Paulo. We have one I think in Hong Kong. We have one in Budapest, and there's one in Sydney or Melbourne, I should say. So, we've got four new pricing clusters if you will or where we've actually invested in pricing expertise. And you're now starting to see that spread where we're getting even more in the emerging markets and we expect that to accelerate. So, if you say, if we go forward into 2019 just to underscore this, we expect to get a similar level of absolute dollar benefit or uplift from Western Europe and North America as we did in 2018. And we expect to get further increases next year. So, we'll do even better on revenue management, but it will be coming from the emerging markets. George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up shifting to look at your services business, you talk a little bit about shred paper price trends for next year. Can you talk about on a underlying basis, how service activity is currently evolving, how conversations with customers are changing there and how retrieval and new business activity will alter or not alter the growth trends in services? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So, yeah. So let me answer it at a \u2013 in a first cut and then Stuart may want to talk a little bit more about paper prices because paper prices are a big driver in terms of the results that you've seen in service, because we're benefiting from quite strong paper prices right now. So, if you think about it kind of in roughly three buckets of service as we have the Shred, we would have what I would call the normal transportation and activity service level around RIM. And then we have new business service areas around IGDS. So on the Shred, there's two aspects and I'll ask Stuart to comment again about the paper pricing. But if you see that our volumes are up by 13%. So in other words, we are actually \u2013 so there is an activity aspect about Shred which we expect to continue through in 2019. The other part is the benefit that we get on service revenue from selling the paper. If we look at the transportation, our transportation activity continues to slow down, but I think as we've said before on previous calls, if we look at the box business, that's starting to hit a more steady state level. On the tape business, we still see a drop in terms of transportation as the tape business is becoming more archival as well. But where the real improvement has been in service, so the story of all of a sudden going to positive service is not so much a change in the transportation; it's more about these new digital services or Information Governance and Digital Services that we're operating. And over the last two or three years, we've seen a doubling in that size of that business. So it's really \u2013 we're quite encouraged that as our customers are trying to manage this hybrid digital physical world, the relationships that we have developed with them on information management over the decades where it was historically more in the physical realm is really giving us the opportunities to help them manage that transition. And we think partnerships such as the Google partnership will continue to add products in that pipeline that can only accelerate that. So, we feel really good in terms of our set-up for 2019 to continue to build out and grow the Information Governance and Digital Services. And we've had a great last couple of years in terms of growth and we expect that type of growth to continue. I think the transportation to me now is, it's still waning a little bit, but it's being more than offset by our growth in Shred and in IGDS. And then going into 2019, I'll turn it over to Stuart, is that the paper prices are an impact in terms of what 2019 will look like. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. So just to quantify the impact of paper prices, were paper prices to revert back to the historical three-year average from where they are today, that would be about a 100-basis-point impact on service internal growth. George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue management approach. Do you believe some of the elevated destructions are a result of customers revisiting these boxes under a higher pricing scheme? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's a good question, Sheila, and we continue to monitor it. We don't see \u2013 it could on the margin, but we don't see a major link in terms of what we're doing on pricing in terms of increasing destruction. The major increase in destruction, as I said, was in part by the GDPR coming into effect at the end of May. So, that was forcing people to re-look at the way that they retain Personal Identifiable Information. By the way, it also leads to more opportunities on the IGDS, I should say. And then, the other part is is we have seen a deceleration in terms of incoming volume from verticals \u2013 or from customer segments. I should emphasize that virtually every customer segment is still sending us new boxes, but as the rate has reduced over the last months is what happens is that you get a deceleration of incoming, the boxes that they've already sent us are not being replaced at the same rate. And, generally, what we find is in the 0 to 7 year mark is when people more \u2013 it's usually around the 7 to 10 year mark is when people do their destructions. If they keep things over 10 years, it tends to be kept for very long periods of time. So, it's in that 7 to 10 year \u2013 the number of boxes that are in the 7 to 10 year mark is the one where we see the destructions happen. And if incoming boxes are coming in at a slower rate, then you get an imbalance between what's being destroyed at year 7 or 10 versus what's coming in. So, we just have to kind of go through this process of albeit it's still positive incoming volume, but get that into balance and then we expect it to even out over time. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The other thing I'll add, Sheila, is just to remember, so if you look at implied price in North America Records Management, it's about 3%. So it's nothing really extreme. It's just higher than what it was historically. And you also have to remember, this is a pretty small part of people's cost base in terms of where they're trying to save money. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Just one follow-up question on margin. It was positive to see EBITDA margin increase 80 basis points in the quarter. Just wondering when you look at your mix adding the increase in the data center percentage, just the outlook of margin trends' bigger picture over the next few years. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. One thing. If you look at the margin trends in the quarter, we're impacted also by the increase in service revenue, which is a lower margin business. Over time as the data center business continues to grow, that will be at a higher average margin in the rest of the business. So you'll get some positive mix impact from that. So, if you go and you look at our 2020 guidance, that implies basically from where we are at 2018 of 200 to 250 basis point margin expansion over time. So a lot of that will come from the continuous improvement initiatives that we have, around cost of sales, SG&A, obviously the pricing flow through on the revenue management that we were talking about a little while ago, as well as we'll continue to get margin expansion in emerging markets as we lever up with \u2013 continue to grow those businesses and get the leverage of higher revenue on a fixed cost base. So, every part of that business should contribute including data center growing as well as the margin there expanding from where we are today. Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll just keep going with the margins here. We've heard a lot of kind of outsourced business service companies talking about the impact of the tight labor market, as well as fuel costs. Stuart, probably for you, can you just comment on how that affected the quarter and how that's impacting your outlook as you move into 2019? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. If you look at what's going on in the \u2013 actually in labor in the third quarter, actually was one of our biggest margin improvement drivers and that's continuing synergies from Recall. So, actually if you look at our current results, actually our labor was favorable. Some of that are also driven by the health and welfare costs as we've changed our provider and continue to manage those costs well. The other side of it, if you look forward, we are seeing labor pressure and there's lots of demand for warehouse workers and for drivers. There is a somewhat of a pass-through to our customers in terms of the revenue management, right? It's one of the things when we're talking to our customers, they understand that there's a labor inflation going on out there, so it's one of the reasons that we're able to get the pricing float that we do. In fuel which we mentioned, fuel, there's \u2013 that we do have a fuel surcharge that we can pass through to our customers as well when prices move up. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. Just one thing I'll just add, Andy, to Stuart's comments is that the fuel, let's just say, from most of the logistics companies is positive, but the other thing is, is that we still have a long way to run in terms of the productivity that we think we can drive. So, whilst at one level, you're right, the competition for warehouse workers and drivers is keen. On the other side, if you look at this year, we consolidated 30 facilities and we expect to consolidate another 19 next year. So, we are looking for ways to continue to streamline our back end. It allows us to get more labor productivity. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Helpful perspective. Thanks on that. Just on the data center strategy next kind of to finish up on this one at least for me. Previously, I guess you reiterated the greater than $200 million of revenue. I think, previously, you guys talked about a little bit more EBITDA than you signaled on this call. Just curious as to what the differential is on that. Is it just \u2013 is it timing of when some of these kick in? Is it the rates that you're able to achieve, maybe just kind of an update on kind of on the lease-up and the profit margins that you expect here? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I'm glad you asked the clarifying question. The numbers in my script included integration costs. So, we've talked previously about exit run rate and we're right on track with those numbers. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: About $10 million of EBITDA. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. About $10 million more of EBITDA over what the 2018 number is when you look at the exit run rate. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Nathan Crossett of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets : Yes. Just to kind of follow up on the data centers, I believe you said it's around 8% of EBITDA in your prepared remarks. When we think kind of long term maybe five years plus, how should we think about where that percentage could migrate to? Could we get to a level that could be 30%, 40% data centers for you guys? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So, Nathan, I think, at this point, we've only guided out to 2020. So, what we thought \u2013 so, yeah, I'd love to give you a longer-term guidance, but so good try. But, anyways, in 2020, we've guided it will be about 10% of our EBITDA. But if you \u2013 you can even see it at 10% given the growth rates that we're getting. That's why we're saying this is driving 1% to 2% of the consolidated EBITDA growth just in and of itself. So, it's already becoming an important driver towards our march to 5% EBITDA growth in 2020. And just a reset because I know that you've come on to our story recently, when we started this journey before, we were only at about 2% organic \u2013 even a little bit less than 2% EBITDA organic growth. So we're actually making good progress and data center has already proving to be a large component. But we'll keep you updated as we start extending our horizon beyond 2020 in terms of how we see that shaping up. But you can expect it to be, continue to be a major driver in terms of our EBITDA growth. Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets : Sure. And maybe you can comment just on potentially converting some of your storage facilities to data centers. I remember you guys saying when you did the EvoSwitch transaction, there was I think a few facilities nearby that were storage facilities that you could convert. So I'm just wondering if you did an analysis kind of across the rest of your portfolio and just wondering how many centers could maybe be converted over time? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's a very good question. So you're right. I'll be specific. In Amsterdam, there is a facility that we're looking at Amsterdam to do exactly that. And there's two other facilities in North America one which we've gone to a fair amount of detail and it's associated with a potential customer. And then in other case, it's because of the advantageous power rates that we can get because of our historical footprint. So there's two facilities in the U.S. that we're actively look \u2013 two locations in the U.S. we're actively looking at. And then obviously you just highlighted the Amsterdam one which we've talked about before. So those are three areas where we continue to develop our thinking. Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick final question. Can you talk a little bit about the China storage acquisition and kind of how you view the long-term opportunity in China? Is that a large untapped market for you guys? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, it was \u2013 it's a really good question. So, China is growing low-double digits in terms of organic volume growth. So, it is an important market for us and we are now the leading international player. We were before, but now we're firmly the leading international player in that market after this recent acquisition. There are two parts of the Chinese market, so I feel really good about our ability to serve multinationals in the China market. And the way we approach the market, the types of services we provide is very familiar with them because they expect that kind of service everywhere they go in the world. The other part of the market is the state-owned enterprise in China. And we do have some state-owned enterprise customers, but that's an area which is more difficult to penetrate quite frankly as a multinational. So, our business case and business plans associated with China are more around serving multinationals or Chinese companies that are looking for that kind of service. And, over time, we think we will be able to access more fully say the state-owned enterprise channel. But, right now, I would say our state-owned enterprises and as you know is a big part of the Chinese economy is relatively limited. Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. This is Michael Cho in for Andrew. I just had a follow-up on the margin discussion that we just had. I guess, first, the clarifying question was does the change in the margin guide for 2018 is just a difference in business mix? And two, just more longer term, Stuart, I know you gave some color on it. But, historically, we've thought about Iron Mountain's margin expansion from really two buckets of Recall and transformation or efficiencies, and then I realized there's pricing and other efficiencies in data centers that you talked of. Can you just help us frame a little bit better the magnitude of contribution from some of those pieces that you mentioned as we go from 34.0% margins to 36.8% at the midpoint in 2020? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, Michael. So, first of all, yeah, the 2000 \u2013 in terms of taking the revenue guidance up and keeping the EBITDA guidance largely the same, it is primarily mix and really in the service business and you can see that obviously the internal growth on the service side. So, then, if you take that and look forward to the sort of the 250 basis point margin improvement, then that sort of is implied from the current midpoint of guidance in 2018 to sort of the midpoint of 2020 in terms of what that plan is. The 250 basis points, I think you can think about it in the sense that about half of that will come from continuous improvement and cost reductions. Bill touched briefly on productivity improvements we think we can keep making. And then, on top of that, then you'll get some mix benefit from data center as the data center margins itself grows, as those businesses integrated, as well as that business growing. And then, you'll get leverage in emerging markets from M&A primarily as well as organic growth as we've over time built up the infrastructure to support a larger business. And you continue to see the margins in emerging markets expand quite nicely and then margin expansion in developing markets in addition from the continuous improvement also coming from revenue management. Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Eric Compton of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to kind of switch back to the volume growth kind of discussion. So, I guess, first, as people are changing, not bringing as much physical paper storage or whatever and they're switching to digital, do you guys disclose any numbers on what percentage of the business is being replaced kind of with these digital initiatives? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No. I mean, other than the segments we already report, no. But, also, let me just kind of put it back into context. So, if you look at the math that Stuart took you through and let's take the year two because the year two is after you don't get the benefit for the one-time charges when people actually pull things out for destruction is that we're talking about at the rates that we're seeing around a $2 million EBITDA impact because, remember, he gave you an example that's 10 times anything that we see or expect to happen in what we can see going forward. So, this is really a very small impact. I mean, on a business that's approaching $1.5 billion for that matter in EBITDA, but over $1.4 billion as we sit here today, a couple million in EBITDA associated with this trend is de minimis, so it's not a major thing. We don't break out the segments more fine than you want, but on the other side is where if you ask me the question a different way, are we getting more than $2 million of EBITDA from our uplift in IGDS services or Information Governance and Digital Services, absolutely. So, we're more than getting \u2013 we're getting \u2013 as we're helping our customers on this digital transformation journey going from the \u2013 in this hybrid world is we're more than picking up what we're losing on the volume side. So, it's not one versus the other. Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Got you. That's super helpful. And then, my last one is, you said you kind of expect some of the change in customer behavior with this volume to potentially reverse over time. Is that just related to kind of, if I understood your first example correctly, kind of a silly example, you might have a client that was previously bringing maybe five boxes a year and now they've changed to four, so you'll kind of get that one-time downdraft. Then as long as they stay at four, kind of that initial decrease will sort of reverse so to speak. Is that kind of the main driver there or are there any other kind of longer term reasons you'd expect this kind of acceleration in declining volume to reverse? Thanks. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. You've got it. Absolutely. That's exactly the dynamic is going on. And then the wildcard, so to speak, on the up side is that if some of the un-vended market or less vended markets that we've talked about before is those things start coming in and those things can kind of offset that while you're going through that process. But that process alone is the thing that's the key driver at this point. Operator : The next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Stuart, I think you said in your comments that there was about $30 million of business changes that drove the AFFO guidance increase. Can you just detail what contributed to that $30 million? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Karin, I think probably the easiest thing to do is to refer you to the year-to-date calculation in the supplemental of the reconciliation of AFFO. But a couple things that I talked about is, you've got taxes coming in lower than we originally expected, interest expense is favorable from a capital standpoint, continuing to focus. Yeah. I should also refer you back to the guidance page as well where you see some of the detail, but some of the efficiencies that we're getting around maintenance capital as well as then just sort of the underlying business performance. Those are the key drivers, and I did mention that of the total $40 million increase in the AFFO at the midpoint, about $10 million of that is from better flow-through to AFFO of revenue recognition change. So I did want to call that out because that is different than our previous guidance as well. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And I wanted to go back to that volume loss example that you described. You're expecting continuing volume pressure next year on top of what we've seen this year. So, if you think you'll see a bigger impact in year two versus year one, given the fact that you no longer have the fees offsetting, should we expect more pressure on revenue next year given that sort of pattern there? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So I think as Bill discussed with \u2013 the trends that you see are really incredibly small, right. So, even if it was the same global volume declines we saw now, it was around $2 million. So, the example I gave is what I would probably classify almost as an extreme scenario, right, 10 times what we're seeing today. And which Bill talked about was easily offset by digitization services, but there's lots of other things we can use to offset that as well. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. But understanding that the numbers are in the $2 million range, just trend wise, we should expect to see a little bigger impact if volumes continue to come down next year versus what we saw this year, right? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's not a \u2013 we expect it to maintain around this level, Karin. So, we're not seeing a compounding effect if that's what you're getting at. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. That was my question. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So, we're not talking about next year would be compounded on top of that. We would see it at a similar level as what we have now. Yeah. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Great. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: That's what we're planning for and then we'll issue guidance in February. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Just a question on pricing; so developed market internal revenue growth was 70 basis points. That was a 60-basis-point deceleration from the 2Q level. The volume deceleration was only 30 basis points. So, should we read into that that you're getting less benefit from pricing and revenue management from 2Q to 3Q? William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No. And I know it's always hard to put together because we do it on two different bases. But if you're just kind of trying to do the rough mathematics, it's still that we're getting kind of high 2% range for North America and on a blended basis, you're getting the mid-2%s across the globe. So, it's still in the same range. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. And then, last question's just on data center. So, it looked like in the supp, there were a few changes to your investment volume and timing on a few of the different projects, Arizona being the biggest. You talked about that one. It also looks like Northern Virginia and then in the Boyers and Other category, there were some investments you showed in 2Q that are no longer there. Can you just talk about what those changes were? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. In the supplemental and the development activity, we actually added more detail to clarify sort of what's actually under construction today versus what's future construction. So, we broke those pieces out because there were some things that were \u2013 that are held for future development and able to be built up, but not currently under construction. So, we just broke those pieces out for you. So, the data is still there. It's just in separate columns. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. And can you just talk about the size \u2013 the potential size on your return expectation on the new Chicago development? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's still early days in terms of what it's going to be. We're in the process right now as Bill talked about in the script. This is \u2013 the Pritzker Realty Group has got land in the Chicago market that is currently being prepared. They're doing site preparation work now. We will develop about 36 megawatts on that site is what the plan is. It won't actually start construction probably until \u2013 it could be late Q4, probably in the first quarter. And so, we're mentioning this today. We'll put out a formal announcement to the broker community soon so we can start pre-leasing on that. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: And you'll buy the land and provide the capital for the project? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The land will actually be contributed. So, it'll be \u2013 it's not a legal joint venture. It's structured as a land lease, but it'll basically operate like a joint venture where the Pritzker Realty Group can participate in the upside as they help us with \u2013 in the Chicago market with local companies and things like that. So, they've got some skin in the game as well and get part of the upside. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you. Hey, just one thing I wanted to \u2013 it feels like the business is a little less predictable just kind of looking at kind of the pure storage versus service components over the course of this year. So, what I want to do is there any way to frame out like what the delta is between kind of the step-up in the service because it looks like this service has been over kind of 7%, which is a great outcome for you folks. But how much of that is kind of sorted office paper, how much is the pickup and destructions, and then how much of that is the new GMBS (sic) [GDPR] initiative? And that was actually my first question. And then, just what percentage of the EBITDA today is sorted office paper? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: If you go back and look at \u2013 if you look at total Shred business, Kevin, you've got about a third of that is from the sale of paper. So you can go back and... Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...sort of do the math on that. If you look at sort of third quarter, total shredding revenue was up about 15% or $15 million year-over-year. And if you remember, from a paper pricing standpoint, last year was actually a little bit of a dip compared to where we are this year. So, of the $15 million increase, about $6 million to $7 million of that increase is paper price. And the rest really has to do with volume in bin tips as the business continues to grow. We've done some tuck-ins as well in that business. And so, you've seen good margin expansion in the performance. Business is performing really, really well. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: But I think, Kevin, just to pick up on your predictability, as you've been following this story for a long time, so you kind of go back is when you first started, we were 2% organic EBITDA growth. We're seeing here 4% EBITDA growth. The company was struggling to maintain $900 million of EBITDA. We're now approaching $1.5 billion of EBITDA. So, when we talk about $6 million or $7 million coming from paper, this is \u2013 quite frankly, I'm not complacent. I chase every million dollars, but this is noise in the way we run the system. So, if you sit there and say we're approaching 5% EBITDA growth organically before we do an acquisition whereas when you started following us, we were less than 2%, is the business is a lot easier, it can take a lot more noise in the system than it used to. So, I actually think the predictability of the robustness of the businesses is really strong. Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just, Stuart, the delta because it looks like the storage revenue, the guide for the full year came down to 2.5% to 2.75% versus 3% to 3.5%. Does that imply that back half deceleration and was that primarily all volume-driven? Is it kind of took those numbers down? Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. I mean you see it in the year-to-date numbers, so it is primarily volume-driven in the storage side. As well, the offset looking forward, right, some of the other storage businesses as companies get more digital, we continue to invest in Iron Cloud and Iron Mountain in the InSight product that we're offering. So, we're continuing to talk to our customers about what needs they have. And so, going back to sort of Bill's point on the predictability, these are numbers despite us actually increasing investments in some of those new businesses. Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session and today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Steve. Hello, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. The user-controlled slides that we will be referring to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us/Investors/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights press release, the presentation and full supplemental financial information together in one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com under Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all related documents as one 8-K, available on the IR website. On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results and our 2019 guidance. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we expect to file later today for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in this supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Leo Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. We\u2019re pleased to be here this morning to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 performance. 2018 marked a year of continued strong growth for Iron Mountain highlighted by global storage organic revenue growth, significant growth in our data center business and further scale in our emerging markets. Turning to slide 3 of our financial results presentation, full year increased 10% which was in line with our expectations, driven in part by the contribution from recent data center acquisitions and strong growth and services. Notably total organic revenue growth was 3.6% for the full year, a strong acceleration from the 2.3% we reported in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was also in line with expectations growing 14% year-over-year and resulting in a 120 basis point improvement in our margin. Lastly, we generated 16% growth in AFFO at the high end of our expectations, whilst continuing to reinvest in the growth of our business and supporting our commitment to our dividend. The strong AFFO performance compares to an increase in our fully diluted shares outstanding of 7.4% and resulted in a 160 basis points reduction of our payout ratio to 78%. As it relates to our fourth quarter performance, we achieved constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% and 12% respectively, whilst our margin expanded a 100 basis points year-over-year. I\u2019ll provide more detail around volume trends in a few minutes. When on a global organic basis Records Management volume was flat in 2018. Importantly, 2018 was a year of continued evolution for Iron Mountain. We made significant progress in increasing our mix to high growth businesses, completing more than $1.7 billion in targeted acquisitions. This evolution is highlighted by the ongoing expansion of our global data center footprint with the acquisitions of IO, the Credit Suisse Data Centers and EvoSwitch. We continue to also expand in faster growing emerging markets with acquisitions that increase scale and reach in key markets including South Korea, China and the Philippines. We continue to build from our strong capabilities and core competencies developed over many decades of managing our customers\u2019 valuable physical and information assets to extend our storage capabilities beyond Records Management and Data Management to a more comprehensive portfolio of physical storage solutions. Today, we store many of our customers\u2019 valuable assets in addition to information assets, which leverages our know how and utilizes our existing storage facilities and logistics expertise whilst maximizing our revenue in NOI per square foot. To this point, we made targeted acquisitions to further a number of our faster growing businesses, such as market leading Fine Arts and entertainment services capabilities and valley consumer storage. All of this enables us to help customers manage the storage of valuable assets beyond the more than 690 million cubic feet of records in digital information we store in our Records and Information Management or RIM business area. Turning to our business performance, Organic Records Management global volume was flat, a modest improvement from Q3 as new volume increased 10 basis points sequentially. More specifically in North America new volumes from existing customers and new sales together increased almost 40 basis points sequentially whilst destructions ticked up 10 basis points. In a few moments I\u2019ll highlight some of the recent wins in North America Records and Information Management that have helped to support this performance. Volume in the emerging markets continues to grow at a faster clip increasing 7% for 2018 though we saw a modest tick down in new sales compared to Q3. Our investments are focused on increasing the scale of our businesses in these geographies and growing market share as evidenced by the recent acquisitions I highlighted earlier. Organic storage revenue growth increased 1.9% and 2.4% year-over-year in Q4 and 2018 respectively, as revenue management continues to contribute positively to growth. Destructions remain at elevated levels though we saw a moderation in recent trends. Organic service revenue growth was strong in 2018, growing at 5.4% driven in part by continued strength in Secure Shred as well as momentum in digital projects from our Information Governance and Digital Solutions business or IGDS. Overall, we had a successful Q4 with a number of strong new business wins across the North America RIM. Turning to slide 4, an example of one such win was a 5-year agreement with CitiMortgage, which was looking to outsource their non core business function within their mortgage workflows. Once successfully implemented, we expect to gain 550,000 cubic feet of records plus more than 820,000 files. Additionally, a new customer signed in Q4 was the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. The Hoover Institution has begun a major renovation of their facilities at Stanford, which will directly impact their archival collections located in three historic buildings. Most of their collections are moving off-site during the renovation some indefinitely and Iron Mountain was selected to relocate 64,000 cubic feet of material from Stanford University to a customized Iron Mountain facility. Specialized relocation processes designed by our team along with the Hoover archivists and preservationists will be utilized during the move. The collections will be maintained and circulated from our private climate controlled vault modified specifically for this project. This is a great example of our teams working to implement solutions to meet our customer specific needs. Turning to our federal business, we\u2019ve made significant inroads and further penetrating this historically un-vended channel. Across our entire federal business revenue grew 14% year-over-year in 2018 led by strength in data center and Records Management. To this point, a U.S. government regulatory agency expanded with a new data center deployment in Northern Virginia adding to their existing deployment in New Jersey. On the Records Management side of the federal business we had net cube growth of 4% during 2018 and continued to see good momentum. We\u2019re encouraged by the progress made in Q4 in North America and accelerating volume from existing customers and driving new business to Iron Mountain. Another area of solid progress in 2018 was the momentum of our IGDS business as customers increasingly live in a hybrid world of both physical and digital storage. We recently signed a contract with a large retailer to enhance our value adding services. We\u2019re beginning a digital solution involving more than 75 million images of employee files, which are currently housed on premise at each individual store as part of an HR file conversion project. Digitizing HR documents and centralizing into a single repository helps achieve greater efficiency, reduce risk and improve compliance with a variety of federal and state requirements. We\u2019re currently in discussions with this customer to assist them in extracting even greater value from their HR information through the use of our InSight platform and its machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. These are great examples of how we\u2019re solving problems of our customers and adding value in the areas of digital transformation and compliance. We had an extremely active pipeline of opportunities for our IGDS business as we ended 2018, nearly 50% increase over the prior year. Importantly we\u2019re seeing these opportunities increasingly translate into income as revenue is doubled over the past two years. Regarding our data center business on slide 5, you can see Q4 in 2018 performance was strong with full year revenue of nearly $230 million and adjusted EBITDA of a $100 million. We continue to see solid leasing momentum as we closed out Q4 achieving our targeted 10 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for the year consisting of 261 leases signed with strength in the financial services, professional services and federal vertical. Of those new and expansion leases 34% were new logos to our data center platform of which 43% had a pre-existing customer relationship with Iron Mountain reinforcing the strength of the Iron Mountain brand and its extension to our data center business. To that point, we signed a new cloud base provider of medical information in Northern Virginia as this customer was very sensitive to proximity to its own local IT team. Additionally, this customer also has a longstanding relationship with our Data Management team, so our core competencies and compliance and security resonated well with their data center needs. Another great example of a new customer is Wasabi Technologies, a hot cloud storage company, which deployed in Northern Virginia. Iron Mountain was able to fulfill all of their data center requirements including a hyper scale ready facility which meets the strict compliance requirements for Fed ramp. Demand from existing customers remain strong with a number of customers expanding their footprint in existing data centers as well as deploying with us in additional markets. A large global bank which came to us as a data center through the IO acquisition increased its capacity needs three times during 2018 expanding its usage in New Jersey by 47%. Turning to slide 6, our development pipeline reflects construction in key markets including New Jersey, Phoenix, London and Amsterdam as we continue to see good demand from existing customers. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we acquired a part of the land in Frankfurt with power reserved in a permitted design which will ultimately support 20 megawatts of capacity. Frankfurt is the second largest multi-tenant data center market in Europe beyond London. This land acquisition improves our competitive position across Europe and allows us to have a presence in three of the four key European metro areas. We now have total potential capacity of almost 350 megawatts across our data center platform including the land in Frankfurt and Chicago. We expect the leasing momentum exiting 2018 will continue into 2019 as we build on our strength with enterprise customers and attract more hyper scale demand. We currently expect to be able to achieve robust leasing activity with a target of executing 15 to 20 megawatts of new and expansion signings in 2019. Turning to slide 7, our strong performance in 2018 has enhanced the solid foundation we\u2019ve created and increased our financial strength as an organization to support sustained growth. Once our acquisitions from last year are fully incorporated in our base numbers, the business as it is configured today is expected to deliver 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth going into 2020 well in line with our original 2020 plan to exit 2020 with a 5% organic EBITDA growth. This is all compared to less than 2% growth just five years ago. As it relates to our outlook for 2019, we issued guidance this morning which reflects consistent performance expectations for Records and Information Management business fundamental with further physical storage potential from newer adjacencies. Ongoing strong growth in emerging markets data center and adjacent businesses and continued investment in the business to support strategic initiatives and innovation around digital solutions to support our customers\u2019 evolving needs. We do anticipate that the strong dollar will create headwinds over the course of 2019 relative to our reported results, though this has no operational or margin impact. On a constant currency basis we expect revenue growth of 3%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% and AFFO growth of 4.5%. And if we normalize for the impact of adoption of lease accounting our adjusted EBITDA margin would increase by a 100 basis points further. Stuart will have more detail on our 2019 guidance in a moment. Putting this all into historical context Iron Mountain is entering into 2019 in great shape. Our brand continues to resonate with our customer base where trust is ever more important especially when it comes to information as well as valued assets. This trusted relationship with more than 225,000 customers in covering over to 95% of the Fortune 1000 is demonstrated both by the continued relevance of our RIM business with expanding margins through higher pricing as well as the rapid growth of our digital solutions business and data center offerings. In terms of how our services have delivered bottom-line value is worth noting the accelerating growth of the business since 2014. We have grown revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis at a 10% CAGR. AFFO has delivered a 10.9% CAGR with a 7.8% CAGR in share count. Our business is more diversified both by business line as well as geography all yielding the acceleration in underlining growth mentioned earlier. All together over the past five years we have built significant momentum into the business and feel good going into the year. We will remain disciplined regarding the pace with which we deploy capital to support these growth initiatives, whilst ensuring we remain true to our financial model. With that I will turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart Brown : Thank you, Bill and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter and 2018 results conference call. We delivered very strong AFFO growth in 2018 of 16% and continue to expand our adjusted EBITDA margins while also achieving 3.6% organic revenue growth. This growth was supported by results of our revenue management program and continued expansion of value add services and our data center platform with growth of records volumes in our international markets offsetting declines in North America. We are pleased with the healthy performance across our business segments as well as our progress investing in and integrating faster growing businesses. Not only do these new businesses create value for shareholders, but also allow us to be better partner with our customers for their critical physical and digital storage needs. I'd like to start off the financial discussion with the performance highlights which you can see on slides 8 and 9 of the presentation. For the quarter revenue was in line with expectations approaching $1.1 billion growing about 7% on a reported basis then almost 10% on a constant currency basis. This is driven by contributions from our recent data center acquisitions and strong organic revenue growth including solid contributions from our emerging markets in our businesses. Total organic revenue grew by 3.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 3.6% for the full year. Organic storage revenue grew 1.9% for the quarter and 2.4% or by $60 million for the full year. Organic service revenue grew 6.1% in the fourth quarter and by 5.4% for the full-year. Service growth was primarily driven by increased contributions from our expanding Secure Shred business, continued strength and recycled paper prices as well as additional digitization and special projects. Our adjusted EBITDA grew over 12% on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter to $360 million with margins expanding 100 basis points year-over-year to 33.9%. The margin improvement resulted primarily from the flow through of revenue management, the impact of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard and improved labor productivity. SG&A as a percentage of revenue excluding significant acquisition costs declined about 80 basis points in the fourth quarter versus a year ago due in part to lower bad debt expense and increased operating leverage on the revenue growth. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.25 per share down from 2017 due mostly to higher depreciation and amortization associated with data center acquisitions and impacted by a 6% increase in shares outstanding following our December 2017 offering to fund the acquisition of I/O data centers. For the full year AFFO was $874 million up $122 million or 16% over the prior year reflecting the strong operating performance of our data center acquisitions in a very disciplined approach to capital allocation while continuing our investments in new products and businesses. AFFO came in at the high end of our expectations due to lower cash taxes and interest as well as slightly lower capital spending. To touch on operating performance in more detail, on slide 10 you can see developed markets organic storage revenue growth came in at 0.9% for the quarter slightly better than Q3 and 1.4% for the full year despite the negative volume growth again reflecting the contribution from revenue management. Organic service revenue in developed markets increased 5.1% for the quarter and 5.2% percent for the full year due mainly to growth in our shred business, project revenue and digitization projects as mentioned earlier. In other international, we continued to see healthy organic storage revenue growth of 4.1% for the quarter. Full-year organic storage revenue growth was 5.4% and 3.2% growth in organic volume. Organic service revenue growth was 6.1% in the quarter and 5% for the full year in this segment. Further the data center business delivered strong organic revenue growth of 12% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Our adjacent businesses also performed well with revenue growth growing almost 19% on an organic basis in the quarter and nearly 11% for the full year. Turning to slide 11, you can see the detail of our fourth quarter 100 basis point adjusted margin expansion with growth in most segments. We saw a margin decline in North America data management or our tape business driven by lower volumes and mix as well as investments made in growing new products and services. In the tape storage business the amount of digital data being stored continues to grow, however, greater physical tape density is resulting in lower physical volumes. Revenue management has helped offset some of the tape volume trends and margins have remained north of 50%. In Western Europe fourth quarter margin expansion returned to levels seen in the first half of the year expanding by 240 basis points reflecting lower bad debt, our focus on continuous improvement and stronger project based revenue in the UK, Germany, and Austria. In the global data center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins were 41.5% in the fourth quarter and 43.5% for the full year reflecting the increased scale of the business and progress on integration activity. As Bill noted, we are pleased with our leasing activity reflecting the successful integration of a strong commercial team and demand in the markets where we operate. During the quarter we executed 3.3 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for total 9.6 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily enterprise in Federal Government customers in churn remains quite manageable at 3.2% in 2018. Turning to slide 12, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the year was 5.6 times comfortably in line with other rates especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors, but we did not have any significant financing activity in the fourth quarter, we did sell two properties as part of our capital recycling program which generated net proceeds of $56 million. As of December 31, our borrowings were 73% fixed-rate, our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.9% and our well-laddered maturity average is 6.2 years with no significant maturities until 2023. Our strong balance sheet and capital structure is supported by our significant real estate portfolio and long term nature of our customer relationships. Turning to guidance this is detailed in the supplemental for your review and on slide 13. We\u2019re expecting 2019 revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.08 to a $1.18 and AFFO to be in the range of $870 million to $930 million. This reflects solid performance following 2018\u2019s growth impacted by a stronger dollar, new lease accounting standard and continuing investments in our Insight IT infrastructure and our data center pipeline. 2019 total organic revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 2% to 2.5% including organic storage revenue growth of 1.75% to 2.5%. Global organic record volumes are expected to be flat with declines in North America offset by growth in other international markets. Globally we expect new incoming volume to continue offsetting destruction rates of 4.5% to 5% and outperms of around 2%. We expect service organic growth will be the low single digits for 2019 from continued growth in our shred business and information governance in digital solutions. As many of you know, record recycle paper prices were tailwind to our service business in 2018, but we anticipate moderating paper prices in 2019. We also expect continued strong growth in the data center business with low teens organic revenue growth compared to 2018. We will though have elevated churn in the first quarter in Phoenix due to two customer move outs that were part of our deal underwriting when we acquired IO. Anticipated investments which are detailed in the supplemental will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings supported by the higher expected adjusted EBITDA. We may also utilize third party capital particularly for data center development and equity from our ATM depending on market conditions. We expect our lease adjusted leverage ratio to improve 10 to 20 basis points from the 5.6 times at the end of 2018. As we think about 2019 outlook there are several factors affecting comparability that I would like to bring to your attention. First we divested our fulfillment business at the end of Q3, 2018 which generated approximately 25 million in annualized revenue. Second, the adoption of the new leasing standard is expected to result in a non-cash increase in rent expense of $10 million to $15 million, lower interest expense of $3 million and lower depreciation expense of about $3 million due primarily to certain capital leases converting to operating leases under the standard. Third, current foreign exchange rates relative to 2018 are expected to result in a $60 million to $70 million headwind to revenue and $20 million to $25 million impact to EBITDA. As a reminder on FX, we derive about 40% of our revenue from non U.S. dollar currencies and as a result exchange rate volatility can't have a significant impact on our reported results. Well, we have very low transactional exposure with our costs well matched to our revenue in the respective countries, we do have un-hedged translation exposure and somewhat higher proportion of our debt is U.S. dollar denominated. As the business continues to evolve with data center growth, we will also be reviewing our disclosure to determine where we can make changes to reduce complexity and enhance transparency. You should expect to see some changes to the supplemental beginning in the first quarter. In summary, as we close out another year of continued growth and evolution we are pleased to see progress on multiple fronts. Our records and information management business continues to deliver durable cash flow and steady organic revenue growth through solid revenue management. We've had continued success extending into higher growth in emerging markets and our fast-growing data center business and adjacent businesses continue to increase scale and have become very competitive platforms poised for even greater success. We are pleased with the adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and dividend growth rates achieved in 2018 and the contributions from our team serving customers around the world and look forward to strong performance again in 2019. With that I will turn over the call to Bill for closing remarks before we open up for Q&A. William Leo Meaney : Thank you, Stuart. And just a couple of comments before we begin the question and answer is, first of all, it was a very strong year, which was punctuated by double-digit EBITDA and AFFO growth well ahead of the shares we issued to support our acquisition of the IO data center. The business also has never been stronger or better positioned, continued organic storage revenue growth with remaining untapped storage segments or reserves, a broader range of businesses and services still tied to our existing business relationships built on decades of trust and accelerating organic growth of EBITDA and AFFO which underpins future dividend growth whilst de-levering. With that operator I'd like to open it up to questions. Operator : Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nathan Crossett with Berenberg. Nathan Crossett : Hi, good morning. Maybe you can just talk a bit about your appetite for further data center acquisitions. I know you have plenty of room to build out based on the current pipeline. But wanted to get your thoughts on just outright acquisitions. Is it possible to see some more EvoSwitch type transactions going forward? William Leo Meaney : Good morning, Nate. Look I wouldn't rule it out but it's not really what we think we need to do in the plan. In other words the EvoSwitch, if you think about EvoSwitch specifically which as a good example is we look at the top 10 international markets and the top 10 U.S. markets and we say okay, do we feel, how do we prioritize those, which ones do we think we should enter. And then, when we look at that is, we look at what's the best way to enter that market. So Chicago, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt are all great examples where we decided the best way for us to enter that because it's important for our customers that we have decades of relationship with, plus some of our newer customers on the data center side that we have product on the shelf in those key markets and we decided the best way to enter those markets was through Greenfield development which we've done. In Amsterdam, we looked at the same thing because as you know, in Europe we refer many times to the flat markets, the top markets in Europe are Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris. So Amsterdam is absolutely a key market in Europe and it's one that our customers wanted to see us in. and when we looked at Amsterdam, quite frankly EvoSwitch for us was the best entry point. So, that's how we think about those markets but if you think about overall in terms of our growth plan, we're now almost 350 megawatts of capacity that we can build out both with sites that we've already started building in the Frankfurt in Chicago site and we feel really good about being able to achieve our financial plan with little or no acquisitions. Nathan Crossett : Thanks, that's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, can you talk a bit about this datacenter competition. We've heard from some of the wholesale providers that price can be very competitive in certain markets. So, I'm just curious to hear your thoughts and maybe you could talk a bit about how you're trying to differentiate? Stuart Brown : I think it's a good question, Nate. I think that well first of all I would differentiate between the enterprise customers in a hyper scale. So, it's fair to say right now, we as Iron Mountain is we're more the bulk of our customers are in the enterprise segment which is what you would expect. We notice that of the new logo who signed this year, 43% of them we already had an existing customer relationship, where then obviously those were enterprise customers. So, for us I think when you talk about pricing, we see less price sensitivity on the enterprise side quite frankly. So, Iron Mountain hasn\u2019t been exposed to that as much. When you see the analyst talking about the pricing compression, it's more on the hyper scale. Now, what does that mean for us is we do have an appetite to be present in the hyper scale market and I think I've covered this before on the calls and it's more about getting to optimize in the yield on the site. So, if you look at Northern Virginia which is 82 acres and can build out well north of 80 megawatts of critical IT load. Then if you want to fill that, the rate that you fill it is it's important in some ways as what the specific revenue per kilowatt that you're getting on that site. So, to fill that out at a pace that we think is optimum, then we would expect that site to be somewhere at when it's fully built out between 40% to 60% hyper scale. Now, on our standpoint is our models are built on current hyper scale pricing. So, I think what you're hearing coming out of the industry is hyper scale pricing has come down and quite frankly these things typically are kind of 8% to 9% cash-on-cash returns. They are at least approaching that level now but that's where we built our model and that's where we expect our entry point, which are still well above our weighted average cost of capital and it's still a good return. So, I think the noise coming out of the market I think is more about people who have been heavily present in that segment before and they're realizing the pricing is coming down to what I would call the normal clearing price in terms of what a reasonable return is for these very large scale projects which have very long contract duration. Nathan Crossett : That's helpful, thanks. I'll get back in line. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good morning. Your EBITDA margins in 2018 continue to improve, just wondering what your outlook for merging improvement is in 2019. Is it achievable to maintain or grow margin in North America in storage. And how is the mix shifting to datacenters driving margin improvement? Stuart Brown : Yes, hi. Good morning, Sheila, this is Stuart. Just if you look at sort of the midpoint in guidance implies about a 30 basis point improvement in margin and as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks where that's impacted also negatively by the change in lease accountings if you normalize for that it's a 50 basis points to a 100 basis point margin expansion. And I think you're going to see similar trends in '19 to what you saw in '18 with revenue management continuing to contribute to margin expansion in the developed markets. Emerging markets, you'll see some margin expansion really due to continue in increased scale because we're not we've got pricing program in those market but we're really there focused on driving scale and continuing to increase our market presence. And then you will get then in the datacenter business or that business grows as a percentage of the total business. You will get some uplift in margins because that business is higher average EBITDA margin than the rest of the business. Sheila McGrath : And as a follow-up, Bill you mentioned the federal vertical records growth of 4% in 2018. Just wondering how that backlog is looking in 2019 and any insights on how meaningful that opportunity might be? William Meaney : No, thanks Sheila. No, I think that we expect to continue to build on that, obviously it's with the federal government the gestation period of it is longer than our say normal private enterprise customers. But we continue to see the backlog growing and I think we highlighted our homeland security win on the last call. And we start getting those what I call kind of an iconic brand is the momentum that's starting to build in the business. And we see that, we see an acceleration in terms of the pipeline. With that being said is that the government is one fiscal budget. So, you work this year to deliver the project generally for next year. But we really like what we see in the pipeline in terms of momentum. So, I would expect that to tick up over time. Sheila McGrath : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi thanks, good morning. You are now several years into your revenue management initiative. Can you provide us with an update on the roll out of revenue management across your geographies and the amount of pricing benefit you expect through 2020? Stuart Brown : Yes, good morning George. So, first of all in terms of the program is that it's pretty much completely rolled out obviously in North America and now Western Europe. We start rolling it out this year or past last year in 2018 with four centers across the broader international market out beyond Western Europe. So, we expect to see some real traction in those markets whereas Western Europe will be fully online this year, last year was partially online, obviously North America will continue online. So, what we expect is similar levels of price increase in North America. In Europe as we while in North America is we got this past year, we expect an uptick on coming out of Europe and also the emerging markets, and so the international markets this year. So, we feel pretty good in terms of the momentum that we're getting on that. So, I think you can expect that we'll have further strength from price in revenue management coming in to 2019 and we built that into our guidance. George Tong : Got it, that's helpful. And on margins, we essentially achieved all your targeted transformation savings and recall cost synergies to the end of 2018. Can you remind us of your 2020 EBITDA margin target taking into account the lease accounting changes and discuss some of the initiatives you have to bridge from your current margins to 2020 margins? Stuart Brown : Yes, I mean if we normalize for the impact of the lease accounting and even if we go back which to normalize actually for the rev rec accounting that we had that helped us in 2018, while we've been achieving margin expansion of 50 basis points to a 100 basis points a year. Looking forward, right investment benefit also by the obviously the flow through of rev rec as well as synergies, we continue to have cost improvement programs in place that you will continue to see benefit from going forward. So, we expect to see sort of similar levels of margin expansion going forward. But in addition, we've historically been investing $20 million to $30 million a year in our new business growth and new business initiatives and starting to see some green shoots come out of those businesses. And as you look forward, we expect to see some margin expansion that coming out of those business as well. So, I think as you look forward, feel quite comfortable with sort of continuing a similar track of a margin expansion. George Tong : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And then the next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Company. Andrew Wittmann : Yes, great. I guess my question kind of builds on the last question here. Just want to understand some of the moving parts of -- I know the long-term guidance to 2020 that you gave. As talked to obviously multi -- your look is going to have lots of puts and takes as things change over the years. But maybe just to start out level side us. Stuart, can you talk about can you quantify the FX headwind that the target is seeing to revenue and EBITDA, so we could kind of really look on it as on the 2019 currency rates. And I mean it looks like you need to find something like I don\u2019t know exactly what the FX it is but double-digit EPS growth or EBITDA growth into next year in margin increases '20 over '19 of a 200 basis points or so. So, can you just talk about some on the puts and takes in a little bit more detail and achieving that 2020 guidance and how you feel about the key matrix of revenue and EBITDA specifically? Stuart Brown : Yes. I'm glad you asked the question. Again, and today we're really focused on the 2019 guidance. So, we didn\u2019t want to sort of confuse that with sort of putting out 2020 numbers. So, let me walk you through the puts and takes to how to get there. And to answer your first question on the currency, if you go back to my script, we talked about in 2019, FX headwinds by itself on revenue were $60 million to $70 million on an EBITDA or $20 million to $25 million. And --. Andrew Wittmann : Can you give that cumulative business beginning now just so we can kind of compare more easily, do you have that handy for each one? Stuart Brown : I don\u2019t have that handy. Again, the exchange rates prior to sort of the recent changes haven\u2019t been that significant, so we go back to what our 2020 plan has been. This is now really the biggest impact. And yes, remember the 2020 plan was built on currency rates at a certain period of time. So, you should, we should always be normalizing for FX when it goes up or down. Andrew Wittmann : Right. Stuart Brown : So, but if you look forward and relative to our last 2020 plan, right, you can see that we've delivered right on track for 2018 to get to the 2020 plan adjusted for FX from 2018 reported results, EBITDA would need to grow about 15% or $200 million to get to the range of the 2020 numbers. So, when you think about you got about 4% organic EBITDA growth per year, so that adds in and of itself run a $120 million, continue to expect in our long-term plan, continue to expect a 150, actually a $150 million plus of M&A per year. So, that $300 million total M&A, that would add about another $50 million of EBITDA and anything about the comments I just made around, we've been investing in new businesses and services about $30 million per year. So, those should start to deliver EBITDA growth as well combined with savings from continuous improvement can get you back into that range for what our longer term models were. We will, at some point be issuing sort of new long-term growth targets in the future. We're looking at sort of when the best time is to do that now. William Meaney : And the only thing I would just add Andy on this is that from a FX standpoint is that in our view as we take FX right and the good news is we don\u2019t have a margin exposure on that. So, whether it gives us a tailwind which it did a couple of years ago and now it's giving us headwinds is what your where our shareholders are paying for us to do is to manage the business through those tailwinds and headwinds. So, we're really focused on line-of-sight to the operational plan that we have to do to deliver that original 2020 guidance and we're well on track with that. And we think the looking at some of the R&D pipeline that Stuart relayed, mentioned the $30 million that we're spending roughly a year on that that includes things like Iron Cloud and InSight which we effectively have seen very little benefit to date on. So, we feel pretty good in terms of where we stand versus our original outline. Andrew Wittmann : Great, that's helpful. And then, just kind of a cleanup question here. On the AFFO for the year you guys came in and better how you mentioned. I think it's just some taxes but the thing you control most here is the CapEx side. Is that a delay of some plan to CapEx and that we're going to see in the future or have you been able to manage the business so that the CapEx is altogether and needed? Stuart Brown : Let me just give you a quick example of one of the big drivers of CapEx improvement. I can't remember if I talked with this on the last call or not. But if you look at that what we spend annually on our fleets for example, a few years ago our operation seemed to do a great job putting in place new management tools for our drivers to improve fuel utilization; reduce wear and tear on the trucks. As we've gone back now and reevaluated the impact to that, we've realized that the quality of our trucks and the time that they can stay on the road is increased. So, we've been able to actually reduce the rate at which we replace trucks annually and goes around $15 million or $20 million of capital saving in and of itself this year. Andrew Wittmann : I understand, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P.M. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Michael Cho for Andrew. My first question, just a quick clarification. Should we still assume the previously stated 2020 plans has not changed, that's right. I know you mentioned new long-term growth targets are coming but you're referring to something past 2020, right? Stuart Brown : Yes, we will. I mean again, we want to keep those long-term targets out there and if you look at there what we've been talked about in the past in terms of growth rates of a dividend, how do we support that with AFFO and EBITDA, those general trends all remain on track. And we think our current business plan support those. And the only thing that we'd say, the only thing you need to make sure that you're doing is when you're looking at 2020 is first of all is to make sure that you're looking at the FX impact to that and adjusting those targets for that. We're not issuing 2020 guidance today. William Meaney : But I make you a point is that the walk that Stuart just took Andy through. Since that we're still on the 2020 number correcting for the 5% at the end of 2020. So, what we expect that the momentum will continue to build in the business. So, exiting '20 we're sitting here at a little over 4% organic EBITDA growth as we sit here today which we think is really great progress because we started as you can find the story as we started less than 2% four or five years ago. So, we've got that up to a little bit north of 4% on an organic basis and we have lined aside in on track to exit 2020 at 5% organic EBITDA growth. Stuart Brown : I had one other point as well, just that people don\u2019t think we sort of walking back as on our leverage target as well, right, the original multi-year plan we've got in there either five times lease adjusted EBITDA if we issue the full 80m or 5.2 times target for the end of 2020 and that remains our target as well on our business plan. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. That's helpful. And just one quick on the datacenter side. You mentioned now that book digits organic revenue growth outlook for 2019. Can you give a quick comment on EBITDA contribution as well? William Meaney : Go on, I'm sorry. Unidentified Analyst : EBITDA, on datacenter. Stuart Brown : Yes. So, I mean the EBITDA on the datacenter, we're sitting right now with the at the mid-40% range on the EBITDA margin. As that scale continues to grow, EBITDA numbers still sort of putting the infrastructure together from an integration standpoint. And also still incurring integration cost, we had a little over $2 million of integration cost in 2018. So, we're well in track to sort of getting back to the mid-50 margin and a 10% of total EBITDA by the end of 2020. Unidentified Analyst : Understood, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from MaryAnn Bartels from Merrill Lynch. MaryAnn Bartels : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted a clarification. So, on the leverage target, you said you would get down about 20 basis points the 5.2 time. So, I'm sorry can you clarify why that's not the five plus five times? Stuart Brown : So, the 10 basis point to 20 basis points to expansion is or improvement is in 2019 rowed up to the 5.6 at the end of 2019. So, we'll get down to 5.0 -- 5.4 at the end of 2019 and then another improvement in 2020. William Meaney : And I think to your point about the difference between the 5.2 and the 5.0, it's whether we run the ATM. So, as you know we have a $500 million ATM which we've draw down a little over a 60 million off. So, and we haven\u2019t run that for over a year now. If we ran that, that would reduce the leverage by 0.2, if we don\u2019t run the ATM, then instead of 5.0 it would be 5.2; would be the endpoint for 2020. MaryAnn Bartels : Got it. And is there a longer term target that you think is ideal for the business but how are we to, so? Stuart Brown : I think what we've always said is that to us it's not about our ability to run the business or finance the business. And you could see that when we issue debt it's usually at the upper end of investment grade as it stands today. It's more where our covenants cut in. so, our covenants are at 6.5 and we think that ideally we would like 1.5 to 2.0 turns of daylight between wherever our covenants are and where our leverage is. Because it just gives us much more flexibility, whether it's looking at our own stock from time to time or if it's looking at opportunistic acquisitions, we just think that 1.5 to 2.0 turns between your covenants and where your debt levels are as ideal. So, we're not in a rush, that's why we our view is the right balance again from capital allocation as we continue to invest in growth in the business. We continue to grow the dividend and that still leaves us enough leftover that we can slowly tick down leverage to the targets that we set for ourselves. And over time that will continue to go down. MaryAnn Bartels : Great. And then just lastly, in terms of how high you would go for the right datacenter or acquisition or any thoughts on that? Stuart Brown : Well, it's really hard to talk about hypotheticals. We because look at we really like our plan. Obviously the area where the biggest demand for CapEx, don\u2019t forget we have a 150 million of M&A built into the plan annually and another 250 million plus built in terms of expanding datacenters. So, it's not like we're constraining the business for capital. So, you put those two together, we got over $400 million that we're ploughing into growth and M&A for the business each year. So, and then if you said that we -- just in datacenter being the one that is probably the most obvious, is we with what we have in terms of Greenfield and sites that we've already started developing is we can take that to over to almost 350 megawatts. So, we got plenty of daylight in our plans, so it's really hard to respond to a hypothetical at this point. MaryAnn Bartels : Great. Well, thank you for taking my question. Stuart Brown : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : Well hi, good morning. I wanted to see if can get a little bit more detail on the assumptions underlying the 1.75% to 2.5% organic storage revenue growth forecast. I think you said in your comments that you think volumes to be flat. Does the low-end of the range accommodate volume declines at all and what do you think is going to be the primary driver of the acceleration from the 1.9 you printed in the fourth quarter to 2.1% at the midpoint? Stuart Brown : No. Good morning, Karin, this is Stuart. I think if you look at sort of the trends that we had overall, you get some variability from quarter-to-quarter and you got to remember our volume numbers is our trailing four quarters. So, when you get around to the end of the year, you're looking at total volume changes by market is what we put in the supplemental and you also then can come back into sort of implied price. If you look at sort of the buildup in the number and you look at developed markets and emerging markets both volume and pricing, actually don\u2019t expect to see that much difference in trends in 2019 from 2018. So, we've talked about revenue management and our ups continue to upside in that program. And if you think about sort of what those are, it's not really pricing consistent with inflations, so we're not out there doing anything too crazy on that front. You will get some tick down from organic revenue growth in the data management business; we talked about that as well. And then, that will be offset by continued growth in the datacenter in the adjacent businesses where you're getting storage and service growth on both of those. Albeit in 2019, the data center cooler base or organic base will grow as the acquisition sort of move in to as we lap over the acquisition dates. So, I think very comfortable with the growth rates that we've put out there. Karin Ford : Thanks. Second question is where are EBITDA multiples on business acquisitions today and where are cap rates on real-estate acquisitions today? Stuart Brown : We haven\u2019t really done a lot of real-estate acquisitions today in that sense. I mean, the real-estate purchases that we've done are really opportunistic and it's more we've done some -- we will do some real-estate acquisitions in 2019 where we've got a couple of purchase options. Actually in California in a couple of record center that are well below market and that's in our plan will fund that with capital recycling from selling some other real-estate which is also in our plan. So, we'll continue to recycle capital opportunistically. If you look at sort of where multiples are creating in the business from a multiple of revenue basis and again we try to look at it actually including integration cost and things like that and we're still sitting sort of 3% to 3.5% shred, actually quite a bit little bit cheaper than that. And as a multiple of EBITDA six to seven times EBITDA and that's pre-synergies. So, our synergies will add another turn or so improvement on to those numbers. Karin Ford : On the capital recycling front, what's the spread do you think between dispositions and acquisitions this year? Stuart Brown : As we talked about in the past sort of in the -- the spreads are -- you'll see the gains, we saw the gains actually that we recorded in the P&L in the fourth quarter from some real-estate sales. And we'll you'll see some nice numbers next year as well. I mean, cap rates on industrial real-estate and we did some evaluation work with the east still last year. You look at the real-estate portfolio that we own in just North America is for the excluding racking before racking is about $2.5 billion and that's on a six cap rate. I'd argue cap rates are actually probably below that given the markets that we're in. and we would primarily end-markets like Boston, New Jersey, California, Chicago, Dallas, we really try to own in the primary markets. And you'll actually see a selling, actually the real-estate we're going to sell or recycle is going to be more the secondary and tertiary markets. Karin Ford : Great. And then, just last question just a technical one on Page 7 of the slides. You show that the growth portfolio moves from about 19% of the revenue mix to 25% from the third quarter and fourth quarter. Was it just a reclassification or why that number moves so much? Stuart Brown : That's more of a pro-forma just because we're lapping the IO EvoSwitch in Credit Suisse datacenter acquisitions. So, we were quite busy in 2018 and if you actually once those are all lapped, we're sitting at a 75/25 mix today. Karin Ford : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question is a follow-up from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Nathan Crossett : Hi. I just wanted to ask about investment grade potential. I'm just curious to hear about any in our recent conversations with the rating agencies and how they are viewing the data center build out. And the reason I asked is because DLR has similar leverage levels and they have investment grades. So, --. Stuart Brown : You just say that to make me jealous, don\u2019t you Nate? Nathan Crossett : No. just give me a sense -- I feel like, good. Stuart Brown : No, it's I can look at a number of my peers across the REIT sector they have similar leverage levels and in better ratings that we do. We've been having ongoing discussions with both S&P and Moody's in a very healthy way, as our business had shifted from historically business services we became a REIT. We're continuing grow the datacenter business. I think Moody's actually has put out a report and published that we've moved over to their REIT team and so I think we're making good progress, we're having great dialogue with them. And I think they over time will give us more credit for the REIT like durability of the cash flow that comes out of the business. William Meaney : And the only thing I would just add to that to Nate is that we've done like totally -- we're both focused that we would love to be treated like digital. The other part for us is we still want to de-lever because of this free space that we have where our covenants, our covenants are set at 6.5 why that's historical but that is what it is. One thing I would say is we're already getting kind of upper end of investment grade pricing when we go out and issue debt. So, we're already getting the benefit, it's just that rating agency is just all rated that way. So, you actually see our debt get priced is we're not far off but it would be nice to have the rating as well. Stuart Brown : Yes. Our debt investors give us credit for the strength in the balance sheet and cash flow. Nathan Crossett : That's helpful, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question also is a follow-up from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes, I was wondering given your storage locations in North America are close to many major metropolitan areas and you have the trucking and logistics expertise. I'm wondering if there is a way to capture some additional demand for your storage base from last mile demand or is that what flex the industrial company that you've referenced before, is that kind of a last mile offering? William Meaney : That's a great question, Sheila. So, it's kind of I would say three things that and I kind of highlighted it and will try to incorporate that so the people can see the total volume that we're storing rather than just purely the records information; the 690 million cubic feet of records that we are storing, doesn't include these things that we're already doing like under the flex program which is exactly which has similar margins by the way or revenue per square foot as our core business. We also have a similar type of operation in Amsterdam where we're doing both last mile customs and delivery for a number of the large global e-commerce platform just well as local post European postal offices. And the third area which I also alluded to is and we've talked about a few times is that we continue to like certain aspects of the Wallet consumer storage which is a logistics heavy portion of the consumer storage market. So, we think those three areas are areas that will continue to add volume to our network. And we our intention is to be able to incorporate that in the number, so you see it because right now it's hard to actually see the level of impact. Stuart Brown : The thing I'll just add on quickly to, and when you think about how do we leverage our real-estate and locations, our logistics know how our asset tracking. And you can really see it in our Art business as well and entertainment services where we're doing a lot of specialized transport packing tracking of unique items and a number of the major auction houses have outsourced their back office to us for us to handle that for them. So, how do we keep expanding that and growing that, we think that's an interesting area. Sheila McGrath : Great. And if you could quickly comment on the pre-leased development pipeline and datacenters moved up especially in New Jersey, just comment on the leasing activity there? Stuart Brown : Yes. Now, let me again, we had a strong fourth quarter leasing activity. We're a little over a 20% pre-leased in the development pipeline. And as Bill mentioned, we had a large global bank take additional space at that location and we continue to see good leasing pipeline in almost all of our markets. Sheila McGrath : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Yugo Weiwei [ph] with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Good morning. I had a follow-up question on that investment rate question that was just asked. As on the financial policy perspective, do you want to be investment grade or are you working towards becoming an investment creative company? William Leo Meaney : What I would tell you is that unfortunately I don't control the ratings. The rating agencies do. I mean we want to operate the business a heading in a direction that we think is prudent for us to be able to continue to grow and run the business. But I wouldn't say that there's something that we're aspire to. We want to keep those types of metrics, but it'll be up to the rating agency to figure out what they do. Unidentified Analyst : So from the company's perspective respective of what the rating agency says you're sort of not managing the balance sheet to become of investment grade. You want to remain in high yield. William Leo Meaney : I think yes, I would say we want to manage our balance sheet consistent with they being able to fund a business and not that different than other REITs and if you look at their balance sheet structure I think we're pretty close to that today. Unidentified Analyst : And then sort of the lease versus owned mix, are the agencies I think in the past have had an issue with that as a way to compare to other REITs lease versus owned is that still an issue from their perspective or have they moved on? William Leo Meaney : I would say first of all, let me refer you back I think it was the May REIT presentation that's on our website from last fall where we disclosed some of the valuation of our real estate in a little bit more detail. We've done that a couple of times and obviously we shared that with the rating agencies as well and so there's some detail in there. The important point here is that you have to look at it on a percentage of value versus a percentage of square feet. So while it looks like we own 30% of our overall square feet if you look at it from a valuation perspective the markets that we own or the markets you want to be in and control real estate so from a valuation perspective we're over 50%. Unidentified Analyst : And are the agencies come around to that way of thinking you think? William Leo Meaney : I think the Moody's changing the ratings team is maybe a sign of that. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you very much. That's all I had. William Leo Meaney : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Kate. Hello, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that we will refer to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with a link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation, earnings press release and the full supplemental financial information at ironmountain.com under about us/investors/events and presentations. On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss first quarter performance and progress towards our strategic plans; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover additional financial information and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to Q&A. Referring now to the Page 2 of the presentation. Today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and a reconciliations to these measures as required by Reggie are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin. William Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. The first quarter of 2019 was marked by continued progress against our strategic plan. Some of the highlights included : revenue growth ahead of our expectations, solid global volume performance from our traditional records business, progress and increasing our exposure to new storage areas, in part highlighted by the recently announced MakeSpace JV in the consumer storage area and continued build out of our data center business. Tempering this progress was the underperformance of adjusted EBITDA against our expectations for the quarter of - by approximately $10 million. We should emphasize, however, we remain confident in achieving our budget expectations in line with the full year guidance targets we issued in February. Continuing from this summary in a little bit more detail, as you saw in our earnings materials, revenue growth in record storage volumes continued to be very durable with total revenues increasing 4.5% on a constant currency basis, whilst our organic storage revenue grew 2% consistent with the 1.9% organic storage growth recorded in Q4. Our revenue performance was slightly ahead of our expectations due to strong volume and revenue management and despite softer service revenue, we expect total revenue to remain on track with our outlook for the year. Separately, we experienced higher-than-anticipated labor cost, which are temporary in our secured destruction or shred business. This was the single biggest contributor to our adjusted EBITDA underperforming our expectations by $10 million or 3% for the quarter. Let me give you a bit more color what led to the earnings results this quarter. Our performance remains on track with our expectations in the first 2 months of the year with our underperformance occurring primarily in our shred business during the month of March. Shred increased head count in an overall attempt to reduce overtime that we did not achieve the reduction necessary to deliver the targeted level, which resulted in unanticipated higher labor costs. Our confidence in delivering full year guidance is in part driven from the investment we made at the beginning of the year in our global operations support team. This team is tasked with driving improvement in both operating in overhead cost globally. As a number of these improvements continue in their implementation, we expect it will ultimately lead to more of a marked improvement and performance in the second half of the year. Moreover, we believe a number of these initiatives will result in a stronger exit rate than we initially planned. From a strategic standpoint, this implies we expect to exit 2019 with an organic adjusted EBITDA growth rate of approximately 4.5% and on track towards our target of 5% for the end of 2020. Stuart will provide more detail around our expectation for the rest of the year including other items impacting comparability. After adjusting out the $10 million of the unfavorable cost performance, you'll see that the first quarter corporate overhead cost increases year-over-year as we continue to invest in operational improvement as well as continued investment in innovation and new product development. These investments are in some areas already leading to both the identification of areas for improved cost performance and revenue opportunities, which should continue to both drive future growth in earnings and fund our growth in dividends to investors. Our recent example of the - one recent example this could be seen in our continued progress with our insight platform and partnership with Google. 3 weeks ago, at Google Next, Google awarded Iron Mountain its artificial intelligence and machine learning partner of the year. We are proud of receiving this award in an area so important in the realm of information management. Let me now turn to volume performance in the quarter as well as changes to our volume reporting, which can be seen in our quarterly earnings supplement. As Stuart mentioned last quarter, we took a fresh look at our disclosures to streamline where possible as well has insured we are providing our shareholders and analysts value-added information to properly evaluate our businesses and related performance. We revised our volume recording to better reflect how we manage the business and provide visibility into our comprehensive portfolio of physical storage solutions above and beyond records including Tape, Valet Consumer Storage and our Adjacent Businesses of fine arts storage and entertainment services. Whilst the non-box storage currently only represents approximately 1% of our storage volume, we believe these areas have the opportunity to represent a significant amount of growth going forward. Turning to our actual volume results for Q1. By all measures, it was a solid quarter for volume growth. First, let me focus on organic volume growth from our traditional records management business. In the first quarter globally, our cubic feet of record storage increased from 686 million cubic feet a year ago to 696 million cubic feet with $2.4 million of the $10 million cubic organic, delivering 30 basis points of the year-over-year growth. Moreover, during the first quarter, we delivered growth of 3 million cubic feet organically or increase of 40 basis points. Breaking the worldwide volume down further, we continued to see a consistent trend in North America with a decline of 130 basis points year-over-year. This is a slight improvement from recent quarters due to lower destructions and flat Q4 to Q1 organically. Western Europe and other international continue to deliver consistent levels of organic volume growth, 2% and 3%, respectively year-over-year. Turning to our new reporting of storage volume achieved form Adjacent Businesses, primarily fine arts and entertainment services and consumer, we have routinely included these businesses when reporting or revenue per square foot and occupancy, but not in our volume reporting. Starting this year, we will also provide a breakdown of the volume stored in these businesses. You can see in our reporting that these businesses while small have delivered approximately 5 million cubic feet of net growth over the last 2 years, representing 20% of the overall volume growth for the company. Moreover, we see the volume contribution of these businesses accelerating as we continue to build further scale in these relatively new storage areas for Iron Mountain. A good example of this growth potential is illustrated by our recent expansion in the consumer through the partnership with MakeSpace. We're excited about the opportunity to serve as a logistics and storage arm in the valet consumer space. This venture combines the strongest capabilities from both of our organizations that leverage is MakeSpace a strong brand and front end customer acquisition technology platform with our world-class operational scales and logistics expertise. Iron Mountain has the opportunity to accelerate growth in the consumer market the MakeSpace's strong market position and ambition to expand into new markets. Finally, we continue to make steady progress in our data center business. You will see in this quarter, we signed a new or expanded leases for almost 4 megawatts versus the 3.3 megawatts in Q4 on a total build out capacity of a little over 100 megawatts. Whilst today, data center is about 6% of total revenue, it is already contributing more than a third of our annual EBITDA growth. Before handing the call over to Stuart, I wish to reiterate that we remain confident in the health of the underlying business characterized by the growth in revenue from our records and information management business as well as the increased momentum of our growth portfolio including Emerging Markets and data center. While we're disappointed by the cost impact this quarter, we continue to see the full year in line with our guidance and with an expected slightly improved exit rate going into 2020. With that, I will turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart Brown : Thank you, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. I'll start off the details around Q1 performance, with additional information around the cost control issues and overall results, including the initiatives you're taking to expand margins and deliver on your expectations for the remainder of the year. Slide 7 of the presentation summarizes our quarter's financial results. As Bill mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter revenue, which approach $1.1 billion, reflecting growth of 4.5% on a constant currency basis. Storage rental revenue increased 5.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in our data center, emerging markets and fine arts businesses and better organic volume performance. Service revenue increased 3.5% excluding currency changes. Total organic revenue grew by 1.9% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Organic storage revenue grew 2% for the quarter or about $13 million, supported by good results by an revenue management and from organic records management volume growth, which increased 30 basis points in the quarter and acceleration for prior quarters. Organic service revenue grew by 1.8% in the first quarter, a bit less than we anticipated to the lower box destructions in North America, lower project revenue globally and lower prices for recycled paper. The gross profit margin declined 70 basis point from last year to 56.3%, due in part to the operational issues Bill discussed as well as a 20 basis points impact in the change in lease accounting. I'll have more on the cost actions we're undertaking in a moment. Our adjusted EBITDA declined $18.5 million or 5.4% to $325 million, with the margins contracting 210 basis points year-over-year to 30.8%. Excluding the impact of currency changes, adjusted EBITDA declined $8.7 million or 2.6%. In addition to the cost of sales already discussed, the margin contraction reflects SG&A excluding significant acquisition costs, growing 140 basis points as a percentage of revenue or almost $18 million from the year-ago. The increase in SG&A reflects higher IT-related costs, including information security and investments in our digital offerings like the Iron Mountain insight platform and partnership with Google. We also invested in a new global operational support group and added G&A with last year's data center acquisitions. Most of this increase in SG&A was anticipated and reflects strategic initiatives and reflect the future. Turning to other metrics, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.17 per share, down from $0.24 per share a year ago. AFFO in the quarter was $193 million, down approximately $28 million from the prior year, reflecting the adjusted EBITDA decline, increased interest expense and slightly higher cash taxes compared to a year ago. Looking at organic revenue growth on Slide 8. You can see developed markets organic storage, rental revenue came in at 1.1% for the quarter, slightly better than Q4 2018, reflecting contribution from revenue management and improved volume performance. Organic service revenue in developed markets increased 1.8% for the quarter, a moderation from the levels seen in 2018, due mainly to lower destruction service revenues, paper prices which have moderated from recent highs and one fewer working day in the quarter. In other international, we saw continued healthy organic storage revenue growth of 4.6% for the quarter and 3.3% growth in organic volume. Organic service revenue declined 0.6% in this segment, due mainly to a slowdown in project revenue. In the supplemental, you can see the data center business delivered organic revenue growth of around 3% for the quarter. Adjusted for the churn in Phoenix, we called out that last quarter, the underlying organic revenue growth was about 9% similar to levels seen in Q4. Churn in the quarter was about 1.4%, when normalized with a phoenix moveouts, which were anticipated when we acquired IO last year. As Bill mentioned, we're trending well towards our target of leasing 15 to 20 megawatts for the year. Aggregated data center leasing in the quarter and the related rate per kilowatt included 1.6 megawatts of powered shell in New Jersey, space which was vacant when we acquired IO. Our Adjacent Businesses also performed well, with revenue growing 10% on an organic basis in the quarter. With the international scale, we have now built, we continue to see very healthy demand from galleries museums and studios. Slide 9 details the adjusted EBITDA margin performance our business segments. On a year-over-year basis, total margins were impacted by the increase in SG&A. The North America RIM margin declined by about 40 basis points largely because of our shredding business, as previously discussed, while the changes in lease accounting impact margin and a segment about 20 basis points this quarter. North America data management margin declined continues to be driven by lower volumes and investments we're making a new products and services, including Iron Mountain. Revenue management is helping to offset some of the declines support healthy margins, which remain above 50%. In Western Europe, first quarter margins contracted 230 basis points, reflecting higher temporary facilities cost and consulting cost for process improvements in France. Other international margins were up 10 basis points in the quarter, despite a 70 basis point impact from the adoption of new lease accounting standards. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins were 42.3% in the first quarter, reflecting the acquisition of EvoSwitch in the Netherlands last May, which operates at lower average margins and the impact of the Phoenix churn, which as mentioned, was anticipated. Turning to Slide 10. You can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio at Q1 was 5.8x, modestly higher than the year-end primarily due to the softer adjusted EBITDA performance. We expect levers to decline in the back half of the year, the capital recycling proceeds and expectations for increase adjusted EBITDA and to end the year around 5.5x as we guided to last quarter. We're on track with our capital recycling program and subsequent to the end of the first quarter, close to a number of real estate sales, generating net proceeds of over $40 million as we consolidate into our new U.K. records facility. We've spent more than $15 million of additional risk that capital for the remainder of the year and are evaluating third-party capital via joint venture to fund the Frankfurt data center development. Before discussing outlook, I want to take a moment to outline the plan to improve margins this year and set us up for success in 2020 and beyond. First, we've been in place over 2 dozen operating initiatives. Without going into details on all of the initiatives, 1 example is improving transportation costs both routing and fleet utilization. This was result in higher-than-previously-anticipated expense in Q2, there's one time in nature but should reduce fate and transportation cost in the back of the year and continuing to 2020. Other steps being taken include further labor initiatives and vendor consolidation to reduce supply costs. Second, as previously discussed, we created a global operations support team at the end of last year to identify areas of improvement, focused and additional your labor, transportation cost in revenue management. This includes expanding the use of productivity management tools, with engineered labor standards to improve service margins globally as well as the centralization and standardization of transportation training. The first half of 2019 includes cost to establish the team and some third-party professional fees, and we expect to see the benefits in our results beginning in the second half of the year and into 2020. Turning to guidance. We're reaffirming the range that we provided in your Q4 call in February and remain confident that we can achieve despite the first quarter performance expected residual effect on the second quarter and headwinds from declining recycled paper prices. The operating lower end of our guidance remains a little wider due to uncertainty with regard to exchange rates. We continue to expect a total organic revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 2.5% in 2019, including organic storage revenue growth of 1.75% to 2.5%. We continue to expect service organic revenue growth in the low single digits, though the second quarter will be flattish as we are cycling against tire destruction service revenue in much higher paper prices. While we not generally provide quarterly guidance, given the cost issues experienced towards the end of the first quarter, we wanted to provide some further color on our expectations for the rest of the year. We expect some of the higher labor costs to secure destruction will continue into the second quarter until our actions, which are already underway, again improving cost of sales. We also expect some onetime cost associated with the operational improvement initiatives, I described earlier. However, SG&A cost should decline sequentially and as a result, we expect the adjusted EBITDA margins in the second quarter to increase 150 to 200 basis points from the first quarter. Margins should then improve 200 to 300 basis points per quarter through the second half of 2019 as cost improvements initiatives flow through. As Bill noted, we remain committed to the full-year guidance to provide on our last earnings call. In summary, Q1 performance reflects a strong underlying health and shows the contribution from revenue management and improved volume trends. We continue to see good results from the efforts to extend in the high-growth markets in our data center platform in Adjacent Businesses are shelling encouraging progress as the gain greater scale. We're confident that the actions we're implementing to improve margins allow us to achieve our long-term targets. Then, operator, we'll move to the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Just on adjusted SG&A as a percent of revenue for the quarter, it was, as you acknowledge, elevated at 25.5%. I'm just wondering how much is attributable to labor? Or what are other drivers of that increase? William Meaney : No. I mean the majority of increase is - you get a few things going on. First of all, the increase year-over-year from a dollar basis, we've - with Acquisition of EvoSwitch and then IO late in January last year, you're getting some increase in overall, overhead cost because of that. And then you're also getting increase in operations team, which we operate in cost of that team as well as some consulting cost. And those are the 2 biggest drivers. And so when you think about the global operations team as we stood that out, you've got cost in the first quarter and continued in the first half of the year and those will switch into benefits as they more than pay for themselves in the second half of the year. And as we sort of think about it as we said these things up, right? We're taking cost earlier this year as we're really trying to get them to pay for themselves within the year. We are going to go ahead and just sort of given the operational issues accelerates some things that we would have spread up later in the year and put those forward into Q2. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Great. And then just following up on the MakeSpace acquisition. I just wonder how you view that business setting in it at Iron Mountain? How are you integrating it? Will that business we with Iron Mountain trucks? And how the margin compare to traditional's - your traditional storage business? William Meaney : No, it's a good question, Sheila. So first of all, we're a significant by minority shareholders at JV. So it set up as a JV rather than integrating MakeSpace. So for us, the perfect relationship. So besides being a large minority shareholder in the company, we're also the exclusive provider of the back and services. In the back and services means that our trucks and drivers picking up the material or delivering the material in our facilities soaring. So we're the exclusive service provider to that joint venture, which effectively gets us in the consumer space with a B2B relationships. So we're still a business-to-business with MakeSpace, and we get the benefit of their understanding of the consumer space. And they've proven themselves, not only to have a very effective brand and marketing approach, but very efficient acquisition cost of customers. So we're pretty excited about the relationship. From their spit standpoint, is that we bring the logistics and handling expertise that quite frankly both them and other consumer self-storage companies have struggled with and this particular area. So we're able to leverage what really as our core strength. And also use our real estate footprint. So they're pretty excited because we're able to help them expand much quicker across the United States because we're already in the United States. So we think it's actually very synergistic relationship that we've been able to carve out with them. Sheila McGrath : So the venture will store the - in your facilities? William Meaney : Yes, exactly. Exactly. Operator : The next question is from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Nathan Crossett : I saw on the presentation that you're seeking JV partners for the Frankfurt DC project. So I was wondering if you could maybe provide some color on what that might look like? And maybe the types of providers you are looking to maybe partner with? And then just a follow on to that, just curious to hear your overall comments on the European data center market as we're heading that demand is pretty strong, especially in the flap areas? William Meaney : So Nathan, select me start with the last question and then Stuart was talking about how we think about joint ventures generally and specifically why we called it up that we're considering up for Frankfort. So you're right. I mean we remain bullish on the European data center markets. So we're really pleased in terms we've been able to establish a strong footprint, both in London in the floor space with the acquisition and out with the EvoSwitch in Amsterdam. So we're really happy with that. And now with the land in Frankfurt. So as you know, Franklin, London, Amsterdam and Paris are considered top markets in Europe and the growth there continues to see - we see robust growth across both the wholesale market as well as the retail market. So we're - so far we're really pleased in terms of what's happening here. But I think they probably came into their own a little bit behind where the U.S. outsourcing. But they're definitely picking up pace at a really good rate. Stuart Brown : Yes, on the Frankfurt joint venture that we're evaluating, yes, it's lots of capital out there looking to be put to work in the data center business and the type of structure would be looking at would be something fairly typical for other REIT. Why Frankfurt? Is really because if you look at some of the development we've got in the other markets in Amsterdam and Arizona, there's frankly, would be probably too many conflicts with our existing. So Frankfurt is easy to carve out into its own joint venture, wouldn't be any conflicts with the existing Iron Mountain properties. And we're in the early phases of that. And we will evaluate demands are. So we're looking for long-term partner who can invest with us in Frankfurt and then we wanted to consider other markets outside of that will be open to that as well. Nathan Crossett : Okay. That's helpful. And is there any preference is there any public or private. There the public eye on the best of potential JV? Or can you give any... William Meaney : It's most likely a long-term pension-type money that's looking for these type of investments, it could be some of these are going to be in this for long time as we build it out. Nathan Crossett : Okay. That's helpful. And then just another question on Google partnership. kind of how should we think about that in terms of bottom line numbers? And I know it's very early days, but do you expect us to want to kind of having a meaningful impact on AFFO or any color would be helpful on that. William Meaney : We'll give you more guidance as we get into for sure in for our 2020. This year, what we've - our expectations and your expectation should be that any revenue will we get will be a watch with the cost standing this out. I think I might've mentioned in the last call is that we've done over a dozen proof of concepts across the range of industries, and we're really excited about the results that we're getting from that. So what we see this as a natural add-on to our digital standing business. So globally, we do about $200 million worth of just, what I would call, digital scanning or taking physical documents and turning it into digital formats. And that grows at high single, low double-digit organic growth. We see this as opportunity to actually accelerate that growth because people are looking to get more benefit when they actually digitize historically physical documents. So it's early days, but we really think the way we think about this is accelerating that high single-digit, low double-digit growth that we have in our digitalization business as we're - and this is the tool give more encourage them to do that. Operator : The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Looking at your developed markets appears new sales pig down from 1.6% last quarter to 1.5% this quarter and New volume from existing customers also take down from 3.8% to 3.7% while discretion picked up from 4.6% to 4.9%. Can you talk about where or when you might expect from of these trends to stabilize? And what initiatives you have to potentially drive an inflection? William Meaney : Yes, I think, George, what I would say is and it depends on which - whether you're looking quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year and if you're looking at just North America or North America and Europe. So some of the movements that you're highlighting vice important our whatever call within the range of what we expect. So we don't see any major change obviously, the result that we're reporting this quarter are better than they were reporting in the last 2 quarters. But we don't see it as a major change. So if you kind of look at overall actually, we said that destructions would be at 4.5% to 5% range. And actually in total is - yes, I'm looking at total volume now is we're at 4.5%. Any given market can kind of trench those movements. So I think you're kind of picking it at a specific market. You see overall actually destructions have gone down this quarter. If you look at the total business. But we still think whilst this nice to see 4.5% versus 5%, we still think, we're operating within that range. So I think we should see it's not going to be any big inflection point either up or down in the business. I think this is pretty much steady as she goes and where we will see it change is as we continue to make Emerging Markets a bigger part of the mix then of course globally, that will have an improvement. So the thing if you think, what do we really see has the being that will make a long-term impact? It is now that you've started to reporting the volumes of these other areas that we've been including, if you will, on our occupancy that we've never shown you how much volume it actually drives. So if you look at specifically the non-records business over the last two years, over the last two years on a non-records business so that would be the art entertainment services and now consumer. Well, in consumer we've been doing on her own for a number of years now or a number of quarters. As you'll see that those then amongst themselves generated about 5 million cubic - increased cubic over the last two years, which is about 20% of the growth of cubic feet that we've seen as a company. So small in terms of, if you look at how much it is in terms of total, but in terms of the growth, if you're looking for inflection points, those are the things that you will see changing over time. But overall, in terms of the record business, you could see it as steady as you go with a little bit of improvement consolidated has emerging markets continues to become a bigger part of the mix. George Tong : Very helpful. Your most recent 2020 targets include revenue of $4.6 billion to $4.75 billion and EBIT target to $1.86 billion to $1.76 billion. And Jude discuss the progress in reaching those targets? And where you see EBITDA margins heading, especially given the margins are relatively FX neutral? Stuart Brown : George, you're talking about sort of as we're sort of looking start off margin progression for the year where we expect margins to go. If you look at - for the - through first quarter, we talked about we had some unusual expenses, right? And so the guidance comments that I gave implies about 650 basis point margin improvement in Q1 to Q4, right? So I'll give you a pretty good exit rate from '19. And then if you think about in dollar terms, right? We're a little over $1 billion quarter of revenue. So that implies EBITDA dollars going up from Q1 to Q4 about $70 million. And if you think about one of the big buckets that drive that, but you normally get both revenue management as well as cost improvement initiatives as we move for the year. That will continue to be with the biggest buckets for that. You've always get the correct affections that they're taking to talk about year in this call. You will get lower SG&A as we talked about and you get the benefit from the global team which really switches before from cost of benefits from Q1 to Q4. And that's around procurements service labor and some of the other areas. So that will benefit both North America as well as the international businesses. So I think the sets us up pretty well going into 2020 for the [indiscernible] we've provided longer term. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : It's Andrew. The organic revenue growth was 1.9% in the first quarter and the guide for the year is still 2.0% to 2.5%. What gives management confidence that some acceleration into organic revenue growth as I imagine moves through the year? Stuart Brown : Andrew, this is Stuart. I mean if you - the storage is obviously from a gross profit and cash flow is the biggest driver and that's right on track. As you talk about the service revenue in Q1 and Q2, the growth will be a little bit slower than we had in the year-ago, particularly in Q2 actually going foreshadow that as recycled paper prices come down. But some of the other service areas in terms of project revenue pipeline including some of the information governance and some of the other areas will drive the service growth in the second half. So we remain quite confident in the service - implied service growth and what that means for the total. William Meaney : And if you think about it, Andrew, is that we actually have built our confidence. Our confidence is even stronger about revenue than it was a month or 3 months ago just because we were quarter into the year. And we can see the pipeline going forward, so we feel pretty good about where we are in the revenue front. Operator : The next question is from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Stuart, I was just wondering the dollar strengthens here a little bit since you guys last reported, how does that fact factors into your guidance? Stuart Brown : Yes, I mean it's our guidance range and when built them this year, we sort of changed our process on that a little bit, so we have wider EBITDA guidance this year than we used - sort of had historically over the past few years. It basically goes ahead in our dollar guidance before our guidance was around through constant currency. So I think if you look at the EBITDA impact in the first quarter of currency was actually the broad EBITDA year-over-year down a bit $10 million, that was built into our guidance. And I think where FX is today, you basically right towards the middle of guidance and the upper and lower end of the range taking into account any potential movement. Andrew Wittmann : So last quarter, you guys talked about for the year I think you saw it was going to be a $20 million to $25 million EBITDA headwind on the [indiscernible] line, so you think it's $15 million-or-so - $10 million or $15 million for the balance of the year. Is that another way of saying the same thing? Stuart Brown : Yes, that's about right. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. Just on - just noticed on your kind of on your CAD schedule that there's an incremental $50 million that but I think was called out here from Frankfort and then that was offset by $50 million of capital recycling. Just given that, I wanted to get some sense of confidence around have those assets that you're going to be recycling that identified on the market whether that still kind of in the brick to figure out how that's going to translate? William Meaney : Yes. We've got a package of that $25 million of real estate in North America, I would call it, sort of more secondary markets, Midwest markets in the market right now and seem good demands on that. And so we've got additional package up and ready to go have the first one goes. So then the bigger question around that will be recycling more real estate as the question around doesn't make sense for us to investment partnership for the Frankfurt line of purchase. Now leasing gone into some questions around time and with that. But we feel there's a lot of demand out there for JV with us, just going to make the terms make sense. Andrew Wittmann : So is it fair to assume that $50 million number that you have in there is - that's if you were to do by all by yourself now without a partner. So that could actually not be $50 million, if you found somebody? William Meaney : Yes, correct, correct. If we found somebody, we [indiscernible] land in it and can get capital back from that partner right away. Operator : The next question is from Michael Funk of Bank of America. Michael Funk : I have two quick ones, if you wouldn't mind. So looking at Slide 17 and you showed the $380 million of incremental capital needed for discretionary investments beyond the capital recycling and the JV than other sources of capital. I'd love to get your commentary on how you are thinking about maybe your comfort level with where your leverage is right now? And then you haven't issued equity in a year and half, so I want your commentary about potentially accessing the equity capital markets? I think it was last around 37 so not too far from what your equity is now. And then second question, I think last quarter you talked about revenue manager program, may be being less of a headwind in the second half - sorry, tailwind in the second half of 2019. If I'm correct about that, may be just comment on how that factors into your margin progression commentary? William Meaney : Okay. So let me - I'll start with the revenue management and also just give you a snapshot in terms of how we think about debt overall. And then Stuart will talk a little bit more about what he's seeing in the debt markets and how well we're able to access those. So on the revenue management side, actually it's a little bit back to front from what you intimated is. Generally, in the first quarter, we see around 15% of the revenue management benefit come through in the first quarter, just the way the pricing reviews are done in the contract renewals are done with customers as we go built through the year and then it builds towards the end of the year. So well more than half comes in the last half of the year and Q2 is somewhere between Q1 and the second half of the year, if you will. So the first quarter is only about around 15% of the benefit from pricing. And we see that. This year we expect to do a little bit better than we did last year and pricing because we're starting to get some reasonable progress in the international markets, which only start coming online last year. So we feel good about fear we are with that given the first quarter performance in revenue management. Overall, just to give you a snapshot on the debt and then Stuart can give you a little bit more specifics around the access to the debt markets right now. Is generally we're not uncomfortable in terms of where we stayed with the debt we know very price. So we actually price usually at the upper end of investment grade, buys were not an investment grade data sure. So we feel relatively good about that. If you look at us our leverage relative to say that to reap peers, we're again pretty much spot on to where those folks are. And I think we have a slide, Slide 10 kind of demonstrates that in the debt. So the issue for us and the reason why we say we want to continue to de-lever over time is our covenants are roughly 6.5, and we would like 1.5 to 2 turns over time daylight between wherever our covenants are and where our leverage states. Just to give more dry powder for opportunistic events that may present themselves. So we don't feel like we are in a rush to deliver because the only thing we will deliver is to create more opportunistically. So you wouldn't do anything just to de-lever for that. And we - and given the cash generation of our business is, we feel really comfortable that we continue to grow the dividend and de-lever over time. Now in terms of equity issuance, is we look at like any investors, we look at the NAV of the company. And we say, does it make sense to actually issue equity or not? And we have an opinion right now that this is not the best time to be doing that given your share price is sitting. So we kind of look at in terms of what's the best investment. And then we also look at the best way to find that. And right now, when you look at equity you have to look at the NAV of your company, but before I headed over to Stuart is it is fair to say that we're in the data center business that we - data center is capital-intensive and growing and building data centers takes a lot of capital and hence the reason why we're looking at a partnership at Frankford. That being said, don't forget the thing that separates us from some of our data center peers is, we have an almost as north of $1.4 billion EBITDA business. And most of that generated in the mature markets in our core business, which generates a lot of cash. So what we like to say is that we have a very large strong payee bank alongside a $100 million-plus EBITDA business growing very quickly of data centers. So we actually have a natural in-house funding source that not only fuels the growth of the dividend, not only can deleverage slowly over time, not doing massive delivery, but also is a thing that allows us to do this year we guided about $250 million that we're putting into our data center business. So obviously, if we will try to put $250 million and we were $100 million EBITDA business, that would be a strain. But we're fortunate that we have another relationships that comes with that $1.5 billion EBITDA, but we - it is most of that in mature areas that we're able to harvest a fair amount of cash. But I mean, Stuart, you may want to talk about specifically the data - or the debt markets? Stuart Brown : Yes. Let me go overall just to be - just quickly. As from an debt investor stand point, we get so much credit for the durable cash flow that comes out of the business. So as Bill mentioned, it's right, we price that close to investment grade, even though the rating agency have historically not treatise the same way. We talked about in the last earnings call. We'll actually deliver over time as EBITDA growth, right? Because if you look at for the investments are that need and incremental capital. It is around building out the data center platform. So we've had a great platform, but as we've done the acquisitions, it didn't have a lot of capacity to least out. So we have to build out and developed. So that's really what's driving the $250 million of the capital needs. And investors understand, I think the rating agency understand that as well. So quite confident as it grows and leases up, the value of the data center platform will only continue to increase. One other thing I'll add to Bill, is that when we're looking at, hey, what's the way to source that? We look at debt. We have an ATM in place again today, if you look at where the ATM is and you look at where the cap rates are an industry really states. We've chosen right now to recycle capital and some of the industry real estate some of the higher invested and if you look at our credit, people who want to do sale lease back transactions love our credit and the rates that you will see on these are really good. So we are going there. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Stuart, can you just walk me through again the labor cost in the U.S. You hired additional people in order to not have over time with the existing ones, but the timing didn't work out right. Can you just walk me through that exactly on the ground how that it works? Stuart Brown : No, I'll give you a little bit more detail here than we normally would. With all great intentions, right would chew seen in the liver markets of North America is more demand, particularly around warehouse workers and drivers. And we took some steps last year wage rates. And with the raise in the wage rates, we were - we had a lot of overtime. So we'll take these rates up that will get offset by lower time and which is sort of a natural thing to assume. When you hire people you also have period of trainings, so your productivity is going to suffer for a little while as you're stacking up. I think what happened is we weren't managing that change very well and actually overstaffed because good news is attrition been done were able to retain people, but we did manage the productivity after the training period. And therefore, ends up with too much overtime. The month of January is a strong month for sort of - for the bin tips, it's really around sort of drivers people in the field. And so the issue really manifest itself in March when those productivity improvements, that should have been there, didn't show up. So overall, when you look overall in Iron Mountain, our labor rate as a percentage of revenue actually declined. It didn't decline as much as we expected to, and this was sort of a major cause of the issue of the shortfall in trade. Paper prices were actually down on the shred business were down a little bit below we expected it to be as well. You get paper prices in the quarter really move down and March was little bit lower. So that was a piece of the overall shred business but majority was sort of labor productivity. The good news is that the course correction as pretty quickly. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then this is completely different though it than Western Europe? Or using the same kind of labor issues over there as margin was down as well over there with 230 basis points? William Meaney : Yes, it's similar - the different issue the labor there was impacted greatly we had some good project revenue in Q1. Do you have a good pipeline and the project revenue in Q1 was down and we did manage some of contingent labor as well we should have on the server-side around projects. We lost some productivity and that as well. Again, correctable add regrettable as well, but you were taking actions on it. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. That's good color. And then is there a way - first of all, I mean there's discussion on paper prices and EBITDA and it does seem to catch investors by surprise. Can you just give us the number or in terms of percentage of EBITDA that paper is? Or what it is this quarter versus last quarter a year ago quarter? So that we could kind of gauge and not be surprised by stuff like that? William Meaney : Yes, I think the paper prices are volatile. If you take a step back in the overall shred business, revenue was around $440 million, 4450 million a year. And about a third of that revenue comes from the sale of paper for recycling. And so that what's give you a majority of that close through. It doesn't flow through at 100%, but it flows through at probably 90% in the EBITDA. So that sort of where you get the volatility. If you take those numbers the paper prices can be really worried to last year. Again, it peaked in the second quarter last year. So Q1 we are actually stable Q1 was actually a tailwind for us this year. You too will be a headwind for us. So that gives you an idea what the magnitude of the scope of the businesses. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. That' sounds good. And if I could just sneak in one more. Just - and the acquisitions of customer relationship, is there a way for us to triangulate is to how much volume you contribute through those, like $33 million or $34 million this quarter? How much volume does that add to your organic volume when you make those? Is there like a per million dollars we add x amount of volume? Or how can we think about them more broadly? Stuart Brown : In that number also includes things like service acquisitions, which could be in shred or other businesses. If you look at sort of historically and how we sort of look the normal pace of the businesses we typically pick up on an annualized basis about 3 million to 4 million cubic week per year through customer acquisitions, through acquisitions and customer contracts. And we've always included that organically because really the alternative is to go out and pay commissions to somebody else, which really, if it wasn't the commission lines, it sort of wouldn't be a question about it. We're not buying assets, we're not buying businesses. It's really acquiring customer contacts. And so that is sort of the other side of the coin. Operator : The next question is from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : I wanted to go back to expense topic again. It sounds like the March cost in the shred and the SG&A line, but you also saw a large increase in storage operating expenses, I think was up 7% year-over-year including a 24% increase in labor there as well. Are you seeing course pressures across the entire business or was there anything one-time in that in that line? Stuart Brown : No, the other piece of the story sides have the change in the lease accounting year-over-year. So that impact to that as well. Nothing to call out. There's no sort of global labor pressures that we sort of see standing out that we expect. William Meaney : Yes, no, if you kind of take, Karin, one more piece of color on that. If you take the two piece so we talked about $10 million that was unexpecting, these thing happens from time to time in the business. $10 million on a $1.5 billion or approaching $1.5 billion EBITDA business, this is not these things generally we catch them early in the quarter, we can manage them and these things happen from time to time. This one was just then you start getting into March, there's not a lot of time to recover. So that kind of one thing. The other product in terms of the increased SG&A, as Stuart said before, was actually planned is. Because if you want to get continuous improvement to pay for itself in year, we have to execute in the first quarter. So when the ramp up programs like this you generally see a frontload of the cost in Q1 into a certain degree of Q2. So that benefits. Now the good result is that we set this group up. And because they've actually week in our expectation when the set them up okay, let's go even harder going into Q2 on some of the programs that they keyed up in Q1, which means that at the end, you're not able to make the $10 million, which is as you say, is not the hardest thing and given the size of the business in 9 months to run. But it means stronger EBITDA margin exit rate when we go into 2020. Stuart Brown : Okay. One of the things I forgot to mention on the other storage as well, you do have the impact year-over-year on the EvoSwitch acquisition, which has got from a higher facilities cost, obviously, and sort of the core part of the business as a percentage of revenue. So that is one of the drivers just the gross margin storage. Karin Ford : Got it. That actually your answers segues into my next question, which - it just seems like kind of a quick turnaround on the expense side, given the complexity of the initiatives you laid out. What gives you confidence that you can achieve a 650 basis points margin swing, basically in three quarters? William Meaney : It's actually not that - while I appreciate - I'm going to tell my board you have a very complex job I make sure I use that. Right now, it's not a complex as you see. The thing that is - first of all, the labor issue in shred, it is - it takes management. But the bottom line is if you are replacing over time with full time you have to manage the overtime people don't know where it's really been over time we didn't do that properly. There was a learning lesson for us because we don't do that that often. We actually run our place pretty efficiently, but many times overhead - overtime so edifies that we have to do this large hiring and then manage that out. So that we're able to reverse that very, very quickly. So now that we've been able to identify and put people on it. I think in terms of the SG&A, first of all, and that area is, as Stuart said, we actually brought consultants in to help build out the upstream, the global upstream and into initiate a number of those projects. So those are - that was planned cost to come in and come out. So that's actually already done and pretty straightforward. And then, the other area and some of the areas in terms of the get to what our global ops team have identified in Q1 and start initiating some of it was just global best practices on transportation. So we actually in any given day around the world the good thing about having transportation being a heavily demanded area is we have open racks or open positions in our pretty much globally and our transportation. And we're able to manage that cost out pretty quickly by just not feeling or canceling some of those openings as we bring productivity into our fleet. So that's one area. And the other area, which I don't think we did mention in our remarks, a big chunk of our improvement issue believe it or not coming is from procurement. We've done a pretty good job in speeding agility a few years ago and procurement. That was primarily focused in North America. And now we've actually given, with JB coming in as the Chief Operating Officer, we've expanded his - including procurement, and procurement now's a global exercise. So fairly straight, we're still, I would say, at the low hanging fruit stage. I'm sure it will get complex. I'll make sure I'll tell my Board that in the years to come. But right now, it's fairly straightforward. Karin Ford : Great. And I'll just finish up with data center question. Can you give us an estimate of what you think the mark-to-market is going to on the 68% data center rent you have expiring over the next three years? William Meaney : I think, overall, again, we - from a GAAP standpoint, right, we adjusted through the acquisition on IO and EvoSwitch, basically two market on GAAP basis. And we did both of those acquisitions, we found them pretty close to the markets. So we don't expect a big mark-to-market on the turnover. Stuart Brown : Yes, I think the good about, Karin, is we're relatively new in the data center space. So it was a lot of - I think the question behind your question, there was a lot of price compression I think over the last 3 or 4 years. Our contract is still relatively new other than the mark-to-market during the acquisition. And when we look at our exposure in the hyperscale is still relatively small. We think that's an important segment and we continue to grow and look for ways to expand in that business. But our models are based where the prices have adjusted to now rather than us trying to hang on to business that was priced at higher historical pressures. We think pressing now it's pretty much leveling out to where the clearing price is based on the expected returns that underlie our sales should expect. Operator : The next question is from Kevin McVeigh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Billing or Stuart, is there anything in terms of revenue? I mean the organic growth came in at 1.9%. I think if you have it right, it's the easiest comp of the year and then the comps come and get more difficult. Is there anything that kind of comes in and helps that grow over factor. How should we think about that over the balance of 2019? Stuart Brown : Kevin, this is Stuart. From a growth perspective year-over-year, I mean you get a little bit of lumpiness. But again, on the 700 million cubic week of volume, right, that we're storing for the customers that think paying every month. On the margin in the numbers you talked about on seasonal stand point of view are really small. So as I think Bill mentioned little bit better than we expected, both from destruction as well as in new sales from existing - new customers. And we've got to feel good about the problem that we have for the year. And so we're pretty much right along with her outlook. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And to your point to kind of have a wider range given the FX. At this point do you plan on become - would you think you're coming with the lower end of the range or the higher rent based on where we are in quarter into it? Stuart Brown : I think the Rangers upper hand or both FX dependent, and I'll leave it at that. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. This concludes our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Kate. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that we will be referring to in today\u2019s prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations website along with a link to today\u2019s webcast, the earnings press release, and the full supplemental financial information. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain\u2019s President and CEO, who will discuss second quarter performance and progress towards our strategic plans; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover additional financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to Slide 2 of the presentation, today\u2019s earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance.  All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.  In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and a reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? Bill Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We\u2019re very pleased with the continued durable revenue growth across our businesses and the improved operational execution in line with our previous outlook. Some of the highlights of the quarter included total organic storage revenue growth of 2.4% and total storage growth of 4.6%. We continue to make good progress in identifying new storage opportunity whilst organic volume increased 40 basis points in our global records management business.  Good momentum driving improved operational efficiencies across the organization and data centers delivering strong organic growth. We have leased 7 megawatts through the second quarter in line with our full year expectation of 15 megawatts to 20 megawatts. Moreover, Q3 is getting off to a strong start with a 6-megawatt lease signed in Northern Virginia.  Starting with a review of our financial and operating performance in the quarter, total revenue increased 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $1.1 billion. This growth was driven an almost 5% increase in storage revenue, partly offset by lower service revenue growth reflecting lower recycled paper pricing, which I will touch on in a few minutes.  The cost issues we experienced in Q1 were fully corrected during the quarter, which is evident in the sequential adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 210 basis points above the high end of the 150 basis points to 200 basis point margin expansion we guided to in our last call despite some onetime cost. As you saw from our press release this morning, we have tightened our guidance range is given we are halfway through the year and there has been less variability in FX rates than we expected when we provided our initial guidance.  We now expect revenue to increase between 2% and 4% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to increase between 2% and 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis remaining within our initial guidance ranges. We remain focused on successfully executing in the second half despite some external headwinds with a strong finish to the year anticipated setting us up to enter 2020 in a good position.  Turning back to Q2 performance, we also continued to see good organic growth with the organic storage revenue growth up 2.4% for the second quarter and 2.2% year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from data center, the other international segment, adjacent businesses in stable performance in Western Europe and North America. Revenue management particularly in North America is trending ahead of our expectations. Total organic service revenue growth was negative 2% for the quarter and roughly flat year-to-date due to lower recycled paper prices. We expect this to remain a headwind for our service business for the remainder of 2019 as we cycle over record pricing a year ago. It should be noted, however, the headwinds from paper price on a year-over-year basis amount to $20 million to $30 million on what was last year $115 million of revenue from the sale of paper. The actions we have taken are more than enough for us to manage this headwind and maintain our profit goals, given it is less than 1% of the revenue in the overall business, albeit a little less than 2% of the profit. Turning to business performance, we continued to see good growth in the alternative storage categories including adjacent businesses, consumer and other. Volume and consumer and other grew more than 760,000 cubic feet sequentially or 31% in part reflecting strong demand for high touch consumer storage during the peak season. And our records management business, we organically added roughly 3 million cubic feet of net record storage volume worldwide over the past 12 months representing 40 basis points of growth and increasing trend driven by both new sales and lower destruction.  More specifically, Developed Markets organic volume declined by about 60 basis points. A slight improvement from Q1 organic volume growth in the other international segments continues to grow at a faster clip, increasing 3.4% driven by an increase in new sales of 9.7% and modestly lower destructions. We encouraged by the consistent performance of our global records management business and continued to see a solid commercial pipeline. Shifting to our Digital Solutions business, we continue to support our customer\u2019s evolving needs by providing a number of Digital Solutions. To this point, our Information Governance and Digital Solution team or IGDS at a very good Q2 with a number of wins in a healthy pipeline that is expected to deliver strong double-digit revenue growth this year. In conjunction with our Federal team, IGDS was awarded a nearly $13 million contract from General Dynamics Information Technology under a sub agreement Iron Mountain will perform work is part of a digital transformation initiative for a government agency. As it relates to our Iron Mountain insight platform and partnership with Google, we continue to see good momentum for this innovative solution, which is powered by existing Iron Mountain products and services adding even more value to our portfolio of Digital Solutions. In Q2, we signed a deal with a large financial services customer for a comprehensive solution to manage the document workflow process of auto loans. In addition to providing this customer with scanning and secure storage of loan documents, insight extracts and validates the data, verifies the signatures and certifies authenticity of the loans and associated collateral. We decided this quarter to evaluate alternatives with regards to the infrastructure supporting select offerings within our Iron Cloud portfolio.  We generally approach our Digital Solutions based on a hybrid model in terms of what we developed internally and who we can partner with for best-in-class technology solutions for the right cost. This evaluation has led us to a shift in partnership approach for some of our Iron Cloud solution such as object store and resulting in a onetime drag on our reported results this quarter, which Stuart will discuss in a moment. Finally, as mentioned earlier, our data center business continues to build leasing momentum in conjunction with the build out of our platform. As mentioned earlier in early July, we signed a 6-megawatt deployment in Northern Virginia, which is expected to commence later this year. I want to congratulate the data center team for the successful execution of this deal. It\u2019s a great accomplishment and should add significant value to our campus ecosystem.  Looking at data center leasing activity in Q2, we signed 3 megawatts of new and expansion leases, primarily driven by enterprise demand. Year-to-date, including the new lease in Northern Virginia just mentioned, we have leased 13 megawatts with clear line of sight to achieving the high end of our annual target of 15 megawatts to 20 megawatts. Furthermore, we continue to demonstrate the strengths of our customer relationships when winning retail sales focused on large enterprises building private cloud infrastructure. Consistent with the first quarter activity approximately 40% of our leasing pipeline, we\u2019ve generated by our non-data center sales team. Cross selling opportunities like this will continue to help us realize synergies as the data center business growth. As it relates to development activity, we are on track to deliver the first phase of new capacity at our Phoenix campus expansion with the grand opening scheduled for August 15, and an additional 5 megawatts of capacity scheduled to be delivered across the three international markets in Q3. In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter that demonstrates the durability of Iron Mountain with continued improvement in global storage organic revenue and volume growth, enabling us to continue to invest in new growth areas to support our long-term business model. We are encouraged by the momentum we see in our data center business and we\u2019ll continue to expand that platform and drive further synergies across the business. Whilst our digital services and solutions are helping our customers solve new business challenges.  With that, I will turn the call over to Stuart. Stuart Brown : Thank you, Bill. Thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2019 results. As Bill mentioned, we are pleased with our second quarter performance with revenue of nearly $1.1 billion. Total revenues increased 0.6% or 3.1% excluding the impact of the stronger dollar. Our storage rental revenue increased 4.6% on a constant currency basis, driven in part by growth in our data center, emerging markets and adjacent businesses. Total service revenue increased 0.7% in constant currencies.  As you can see on Slide 6, total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated to 2.4% in Q2, reflecting results from revenue management and global volume growth. More specifically, Developed Markets organic storage revenue growth came in at 1.3% for the quarter, reflecting continuing contributions from revenue management and volume trends. In the other international segment, we achieved continued healthy organic storage revenue growth of 3.7%. Year-to-date, organic storage revenue growth was 2.2% and with the strong commercial pipeline and a modest decrease in records destructions, we now expect full year organic storage revenue growth of 2.2% to 2.8%. This underscores the consistency and durability of our high margin storage business and strength of our commercial teams. Organic service revenue, however, declined 2% in the second quarter as we cycle over growth of 7.6% a year ago. This mainly reflects swing in paper prices, which were record highs last year and currently about 20% below the five-year average, driven in parts by two large paper mills in North America that were offline in Q2 and lower pulp prices leading to an oversupply of paper for recycling. Assuming prices stay at these low levels, the year-over-year impact to revenue and adjusted EBITDA is about $25 million and assumed in our current outlook. Given this and lower destruction service revenue, we now expect service organic revenue growth to be flat to down 50 basis points for the full year and therefore total organic revenue growth to be in a range of 1.3% to 2% in 2019. While reported service revenue was lower than we anticipated, remember that many of our services provide important support to our core storage business, promote deeper customer relationships and are increasingly designed to solve our customer\u2019s problems, managing and analyzing both physical and digital assets. Our digital services are growing nicely and we continue to evaluate test and grow them to enhance our business and grow new lines of revenue over time. Lastly, as it relates to organic revenue growth, we generate some of our best returns on capital from acquisitions of customer relationships, which are not dissimilar from paying commissions to our sales teams, as we pay a local competitor for their customer contracts and integrate with our existing business. We include the revenue as well as the investment is part of our organic growth, given their similarity to competitive takeaways, but the timing can be a bit lumpy. To give perspective, over the past three years, annual investments have range from $30 million to $70 million. These low risk, high returns sales enabled acquisitions are part of our core growth strategy, particularly in developed markets. Year-to-date, they have contributed about 60 basis points of the 2.2% total storage organic growth. Now turning to our data center business, we are very pleased with the leasing progress momentum. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth around 6% in Q2 and signed 3.2 megawatts of new and expansion leases. Churn during the quarter was a more normal 1%, but this will vary over time given the size of our data center portfolio and we\u2019ll tick up again in Q3. Additionally, we agreed with one of our customers to shorten leases in two of our markets in exchange for higher rental income during the remainder of their modified term. While this will generate elevated turn in the first quarter of 2020, this was a strong positive for our data center business has a freed up capacity in Northern Virginia, enabling us to win the 6 megawatt deployment that Bill mentioned. As you can see on Slide 7, SG&A excluding significant acquisition costs grew about $8 million from a year ago. This was primarily caused by higher compensation expense related in part to the consolidation of acquisitions and our investment in a global operations support team, as well as by increased technology expense. Our adjusted EBITDA declined $17 million year-over-year or 5% to $351 million. Excluding the impact of currency changes, adjusted EBITDA declined $9 million or 2.6%. As Bill mentioned, there were some \u2013 there were several one-time items that impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $10 million in the quarter. These included a $4 million charge related to our Iron Cloud infrastructure and the remainder for charges related to building damage that occurred during the quarter. AFFO in the second quarter was $210 million compared to $228 million a year ago. This decreased reflects a stronger dollar and other changes impacting adjusted EBITDA, as well as somewhat higher interest expense in quarterly cash taxes, partly offset by lower non-real estate investments. Slide 8 details the adjusted EBITDA margin performance by business segment. The North America RIM margin resumed year-over-year expansion in the quarter, as we addressed the cost issues experienced in Q1. Excluding the change in lease accounting, which reduced margins in the segment by about 20 basis points compared to a year ago, EBITDA margin in this segment expanded 30 basis points. The North America data management margin declines continued to be driven by lower volumes as well as product mix. Revenue management is helping to offset some of the declines that support healthy margins. In Western Europe, Q2 margins contracted 20 basis points, reflecting higher temporary facility costs and professional fees for process improvements. Some of our recent acquisitions of customer relationships in the region are operating at lower margins until we can fully synergize. Other international margins were up 30 basis points in the quarter, despite the 75 basis points impact from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, reflecting the increased scale of geographies and continuous improvement initiatives. In the global data center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins were 44.4% in the second quarter, partly reflecting the acquisition of EvoSwitch and the Netherlands last May, which operates at lower average margins and the impact in churn that occurred in Phoenix in Q1. As you have seen in our release, we have had an immaterial restatement of our prior period results. During the quarter, we received a notification of assessment from tax and custom authorities in the Netherlands related to value-added taxes on specific business to business customs activity performed by our Bonded business, which we acquired in 2017 and as part of entertainment services. As a result, we have made an immaterial restatement of our prior period financial statements, which can be seen in our 10-Q to be filed later today. Turning to Slide 9, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio remains in line with other REITs and was flat with Q1. We are on track with our plans to generate $100 million plus of capital recycling proceeds this year from the sale of real estate and we continued to explore options for a JV investment partner for our Frankfurt data center development. And therefore, we expect our leverage ratio decline in the second half of the year. Also, we\u2019re encouraged by the recent momentum we have seen by the REIT coverage teams at the rating agencies. As we mentioned in Q1, S&P revised our outlook from stable to negative. Similarly, Moody\u2019s revised our outlook to stable in June based on the strength and diversification of our business model with strong cash flows from our core storage business. Our balance sheet remains solid and we continue to invest and grow the business at very attractive returns with low risk. Turning to outlook, you can find the details and underlying assumptions in the appendix or in our Q2 supplemental. Given these \u2013 given the investments we\u2019ve made to improve efficiencies coupled with the operational improvements implemented in Q2 and additional initiatives underway, adjusted EBITDA should continue to ramp through the back half of the year. AFFO and adjusted EPS guidance ranges have been adjusted to reflect the revised EBITDA guidance and for earnings per share also for higher depreciation. We\u2019ve also updated our expectations around capital allocation. Given the increase in leasing activity, we now expect data center investments to be about $50 million higher this year, but have reduced our outlook for business acquisitions due to the expected timing of closings of deals in the pipeline. As a result, we are reducing our expectation for M&A capital to $100 million from $150 million previously. In summary, Q2 reflects healthy and consistent revenue performance from our storage business. While the paper price environment is a headwind, we\u2019ve been taking steps to mitigate its impact on profitability. Our actions to improve margin performance from Q1 levels are evidenced in our results and we are confident in further improvement in the back half. We are excited about the leasing activity and pipeline in our data center business and remain pleased with solid and sustainable revenue growth our teams are delivering. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bill for some additional comments before opening up the line for Q&A. Bill Meaney : Thanks, Stuart. Before we open up the call to your questions, I wanted to take a step back from the quarterly detail and remind you of our long-term business model, which is supported by the durability in the records management business. As an organization, one of the biggest assets we have is extremely deep and long lasting customer relationships, which provide us access to 950 of the Fortune 1000. These relationships are built on decades of trust and delivering best in class storage and value-added services. Having earned the reputation of trusted guardian of our customers assets allows us to leverage these relationships to identify cross-selling opportunities in drive significant synergies across our growing data center platform, particularly amongst enterprise customers, establishing a private cloud infrastructure and looking for a secure and reliable IT environment. A second key asset that Iron Mountain possesses is our durable developed markets record management business, which is allowed and will continue to allow us to consistently deliver strong organic cash flow, enabling us to fund future data center growth, scale our emerging markets footprint and invest in innovative solutions to meet our customer\u2019s needs. These two significant assets underpin our overall financial strategy and continued to support and grow our very strong customer relationships. The resulting sustainability of the core business and growth in the data center business will support our target of achieving consistent 5% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth flowing through to AFFO growth and generate returns above our cost of capital. We will remain very disciplined in our capital allocation decisions, balancing investments that will create value for shareholders, whilst providing more solutions to our customers. With that operator, please open up the call to Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good morning. Bill, at first quarter, you did have some impact from excess labor that impacted margins. It looks like you righted the ship better than your guidance in second quarter. I was just wondering if you could update us on cost optimization initiatives, how they\u2019re progressing and if you have any change in how you expect the margin improvements to play out for the second half of the year. Bill Meaney : Thanks, Sheila. So yes, we were pleased as you noted that we were above our guidance in terms of sequential EBITDA margin improvement. We\u2019ve updated the guidance by actually tightening the range and what we do, we will see is continuing stepped up of the margin over the course of the year. In other words, there will be a ramp in the second half of the year, but we feel really good about the line of sight that we have to be able to finish up the year in strong shape.  So the improvements that we made in Q2 more than offset the \u2013 change things structurally that more than offset that missed on the labor in the first quarter. So we feel really good in terms of the setup for the second half, but there will be a ramp. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. And I just wanted your view on the markets not giving you credit clearly right now for the premium dividend yields given where shares are, just your like bigger picture thoughts on either bringing in the capital partner on some of the data centers, so to create liquidity to buy back shares at these levels. Bill Meaney : Well, I think we\u2019re \u2013 I think you probably appreciate, we\u2019re not going to talk about the buy back on the call. But from a capital allocation standpoint is a board. We look at everything about in terms of where we invest money and how we deploy that and that includes everything from how we give money back to the shareholders whether that\u2019s through a dividend or share buyback.  So everything is always on the table when we look at it. But I think dividend yields, at some point that your shares become pretty good value. But we\u2019re not \u2013 we looked at the full range of options right now. We really like the capital allocation decisions we have in terms of growing the data center business and also building out our business \u2013 our traditional business in emerging markets in some of our new digital solutions and we\u2019re seeing the growth. And I\u2019m always the optimist. I feel that at some point our dividend yield reflects probably a lack of appreciation for what we\u2019re doing as a company and eventually gravity does reinsert itself in that, that itself correcting if the share price goes up. Sheila McGrath : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on that margin improvement question. I think on the last call, you kind of got into 600 basis points ramp by the year end. So I know you said that it\u2019s going to ramp through year end, but is that 600 give or take still in place. Stuart Brown : Hey Nate, this is Stuart. Yes, if you look at the ramp in the margin that\u2019s implied, I think that the way to look at it, right, if you think about sort of Q2 normalized EBITDA adjusting for the $10 million that we talked about Q2 normalized EBITDA was that $361 million. So guidance of the $1,440 or $1,480 by just backing into what the second half EBITDA growth is and plus in EBITDA growth of 7.65% to 8.05%, but on that range. So that\u2019s a ramp in Q2 normalize about $20 million to $40 million per quarter. And you think about even just the first quarter, we improve $35 million from the first quarter. So the ramp and EBITDA margins, you should continue to see and the benefits that we get as we move through the year, we talked about in the last quarter call, right. We\u2019ve got revenue management and most of our pricing takes place in Q2 actually more of it takes place in Q3. So you get the benefit as we move through the year of pricing. And then the continuous improvement initiatives that Bill touched on led by the global operations support team, which really continues to focus on improve labor productivity, particularly in things like Latin America service margin focused on fleet utilization and number of other areas. We\u2019ve got initiatives underway to meet the guidance. Nate Crossett : Okay, thanks. And then on just the organic growth number, I appreciate your comments on how much customer acquisitions effects that number. And so I just want to be clear that if you take the 2.2% and you subtract 60 basis points, is that 1.6% a true same-store metric by real estate standards or\u2026 Stuart Brown : I don\u2019t think you can compare it to real estate standards, because real estate \u2013 the REIT industry does NOI on a building by building basis, you\u2019ve got to remember the nature of our business is that we store our customers, records and information. They don\u2019t care which building it is. So it\u2019s not a building by building basis, I think about for an office building or a warehouse. So that\u2019s why its organic growth and not sort of the same-store growth. Nate Crossett : Okay. And then just one last question on the NoVa lease. I\u2019d be curious to get a little more color on how you won that deal, because some of the other guys have been saying that Northern Virginia is very competitive and there\u2019s pricing pressures. And so I\u2019d just be curious on how you won that. Bill Meaney : Yes. I think look, we continued to see our down select ahead of where we have capacity deployed. And I think it\u2019s partly because of the brand, I\u2019d mentioned the cross selling, in fact that we \u2013 the last two quarters been consistent about getting 40% of our lead generation from the other side of the traditional side of the business. And our focus on those customers that are heavily regulated have very high requirements, which is mainly financial services, government and healthcare. I mean, not that all our customers are in those categories, but that\u2019s kind of our focus. So we continue, we look at Northern Virginia, I totally take your point. There\u2019s a lot of capacity in Northern Virginia. It is the largest data center market globally. So there\u2019s also a lot of absorption. But that focus I think it\u2019s a lot of to build a pretty good pipeline. We feel really good about the pipeline we have for the Northern Virginia right now. Nate Crossett : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question is from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the Northern Virginia lease. I know we\u2019ve heard from some of your competitors that pricing and returns have been kind of compressed there. So I\u2019m just curious for some of these larger scale leases, if you\u2019re underwriting kind of a lower return, but longer contract duration or how you kind of look at that balance particularly as you sign these larger scale leases and data centers? Bill Meaney : It\u2019s a good question, Eric. So let me ask the question two different ways. So we actually had quite a bit of leasing activity in Northern Virginia in Q2 and we see those at kind of normal rates when I\u2019m talking about the retail sector or retail contracts or leases. On the specific 6 megawatts that is a hyperscale lease. So we\u2019re seeing kind of the 8% to 9% cash on cash returns, which is where we built our business model. So that will, when you start seeing that come through, you\u2019ll see that at a lower rate, but it\u2019s in \u2013 but we think it\u2019s very consistent, not just with Northern Virginia, globally, we expect those kinds of cash on cash returns when we sign up a hyperscale customer. You\u2019re obviously getting bigger deployments. So the \u2013 when you actually look at the overall returns \u2013 in the returns on the campus, as we said, I think previously on calls as we think that they maximize or optimize returns on a campus the size of Northern Virginia. We expect to have somewhere between 40% and 50% of the leases in those kind of 8% to 9% cash on cash returns when the site is fully built out and it\u2019s consistent with that. But I would say the pricing on that 6 megawatts is less to do with Northern Virginia to do with the returns that are in the market for those types of customers. Eric Luebchow : Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one more for me, given that you took data center development CapEx up $50 million, curious how that impacts your leverage outlook for this year and into next year versus previously. And then could you talk about potentially your ability to recycle more of your industrial real estate portfolio above the $100 million that \u2013 $100 million plus you have in your guidance? Stuart Brown : Yes. Thanks, Eric. As we\u2019ve said over the last couple of quarters, we see ourselves landing lease adjusted leverage of around 5.5 times at the end of the year. If you look at sort of how it\u2019s goings to come down from where it was at the end of Q2, right. We\u2019ve benefited really from three things. First of all, the increasing EBITDA year-over-year, right. The leverage is calculated on trailing 12-month basis. Second, the capital recycling underway. We\u2019ve got a sale leaseback portfolio in the market now of industrial properties and a second property, we\u2019re about to start marketing.  So feel very confident in the $100 million plus that was just built into our guidance currently. We could do more there is a lot of demand out there for industrial real estate. We\u2019re trying to be prudent and sort of prudent the portfolio the right way. The third thing to call out is the data center leasing. Because the way our covenants work in our credit facility as we get credit, because it\u2019s a trailing 12-month basis, on development properties, we get credit for leases that have been signed. So because you\u2019ve put the capital out to develop it upfront, so you get all 12 months of EBITDA credit related to those leases, so that also helps get to the around 5.5 times. Eric Luebchow : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Blake Johnson : Good morning. This is Blake on for George. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like organic volume growth in other international was supported by growth in new sales in the quarter. Can you discuss specific storage volume trends that impacted new sales and other international? Are you seeing increasing demand in emerging markets or anything else that would be great? Bill Meaney : Good morning, Blake. Thanks for that. Yes, I think we \u2013 I think overall, not just I would say in emerging markets, but if we look at our commercial pipeline in our records management business globally is \u2013 it\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s very healthy, because obviously that\u2019s what we look for to give with our confidence going forward into the further quarters.  So just generally, I would say across the globe, we have a pretty good commercial pipeline over the next 12 months to 18 months. Specifically on emerging markets, if we continue to see that, it\u2019s usually in markets like India for instance, where there\u2019s still a very large, what I call on unvended opportunity. I think I might have mentioned previously, there\u2019s a specific customer in India that we just want a part of their business. Historically, it was all in house, there was over 20 million cubic feet. This is a single customer in India.  So if you think about North America, which is 500 million cubic feet in total, there\u2019s a single customer in India that has over 20 million cubic feet in house. So that just gives you the scale of the type of pipeline at we\u2019re building our line of sight to future demand that we have in some of these markets. So we continue to be quite encouraged by what we\u2019re building. Blake Johnson : Great. Thank you for that. Also previously you had discussed specific initiatives of the global operations team including transportation cost deficiencies. Can you discuss progress on these initiatives and what your expectations are for the remainder of the year? Stuart Brown : Yes, Blake, again, it\u2019s built into our guidance. I want to talk about specific results of the initiatives. But yes, we\u2019ve got a number of initiatives going on both to improve efficiency in North America transportation. When we look at our data management business and fleet in the records management business efficiencies on the labor side, particularly focused in Latin America where labor productivity, we think we\u2019ve got some improvements there as we take some of the labor standards that we\u2019ve employed here in North America.  Some of the efficiencies where just to give you a specific example, in Latin America, we traditionally staffed each project team separately, we\u2019re in North America, we sort of cross train people better and we can use them across projects. We\u2019re putting that same initiative in place in Latin America, which will help Latin America service margins as well.  So there are a number of things going on. I think we\u2019ve got \u2013 if we total up each initiative from the global operations support team, I mean there\u2019s well worth \u2013 well north of 50 different things that they\u2019re working on to keep taking cost as part of our continuous improvement initiative. I think having a global knowledge is really cross breed ideas of faster and implement them faster across the organization. Blake Johnson : Great, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Good morning. Looking at Slide 14, bullet one, you raised your organic revenue growth storage range from a quarter ago, it was 1.75% to 2.5% and now it\u2019s 2.2% to 2.8%. What factors give you confidence to take up the range? Maybe what are the most important facts to take up the range? Is it lower destruction, higher revenue management, higher backlog? Just give us a relative sense of what are the most important factors that improved over the last quarter. Bill Meaney : Andrew, good morning. You almost answered the question for me. It\u2019s pretty much three of your four. So if you think about it, first of all, we\u2019re looking at the commercial pipeline, when we move these ranges. So really liked in terms of the pipeline that the \u2013 and we look at what stage they are in the pipeline in terms of how long we can speak to the customer. So that\u2019s one aspect.  Destructions are ticked down slightly. So last year I think they were up, destructions were up. So if you look at this year as they trending back to what I would call more normal levels. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re down unusually, but they\u2019ve come down from last year. So that\u2019s the second aspect. And the other thing is, we\u2019re getting, especially in North America, we\u2019re getting more joy from our pricing initiatives that we\u2019ve actually rolled out pricing initiatives to customers where we were a little bit [indiscernible] those seems to be sticking pretty well. So it\u2019s a combination of revenue management, especially \u2013 specifically in North America. And then looking at destruction levels going back to kind of where I will call more norms and then looking ahead at the commercial pipeline. Andrew Steinerman : Right. And could you just give a reason why you feel like distractions are normalizing now and what gives us confidence that, that\u2019s going to stick? Bill Meaney : Well, first of all, these are relatively small movements, but they have sizable impact, right. Because you\u2019re talking about small movements, if you just on a business of 700 million cubic feet. So a little bit of change and that can make big differences. The \u2013 I think last year, we all have our own hypothesis. We speak to customers all the time, but many times of our customers are crisp in their response. But I think last year probably, it was a combination of some of the GDPR cleanup, people were going into bring themselves into compliance and destroying a lot of their documentation rather than trying to bring it into compliance. And then the other aspect is we did get some legal holes that got released in the financial service industry. So I think those two things alone, probably attracted a bit of it. It\u2019s the best feedback we\u2019re getting from our customers at this point. So our expectations that will kind of trend at the more, what I would call usual levels pre-last year, and you can see that kind of bleeding through this year. Andrew Steinerman : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much. Can you delve a little bit more into the pricing in North America, you said, I think you described it, Bill, as getting more joy over there. What exactly is it \u2013 are there charges there in put through straight off contracts? Is it something that you feel is, as a sustainable thing that you could do on a regular basis? If you could just give us just a little sense of that. Bill Meaney : Okay. Good morning, Shlomo. So I think the kind of two aspects, I mean, one is watching the story is about two-thirds of our pricing actions come in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So we have that normal uptick. But specifically and what\u2019s different this year than last year. It is that \u2013 quite frankly, if we started rolling out revenue management, the ones you\u2019re always shy of is your largest customers, right, because there is any elasticity. Obviously, you feel it in volume in larger dimensions. I think the last couple of years have given us confidence as a team and specifically more North America, that we\u2019re able to rollout the same kind of revenue management or pricing discipline to our larger customers as we were to come by midsize customers. And that was built on a confidence with mid-size customers and as we\u2019ve gone into this year, in the first half of the year, we\u2019ve seen that we have been able to actually achieve that. So lot of this, I think I\u2019ve mentioned before on pricing, a lot of it is change management internally. In other words, giving our folks the confidence that they can charge the right price for the service that we\u2019re delivering. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then if you could just an \u2013 in the supplemental Slide 9, the records management in Developed Markets. So there\u2019s a trend that tend to be going on from like 4Q, where the volumes were declining sequentially. You bucked the trend in 1Q, ticked up and then its down again in 2Q. Why is that trending down even if destruction seem to be moderating. I\u2019m just trying to get a handle as is the trend continuing downwards. Or are we stabilizing? Just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s going on there? Bill Meaney : Yes, I think it\u2019s more of a stabilized trend. I mean, if you look at the, specifically, on the developed markets, the chart that you\u2019re referring to, is if you\u2019re going to go down into the detail, I\u2019d say, a moderation in terms of new sales in Q2, but if you kind of look at over 12 month basis, that goes up and down. So when we look at that and we look at giving our projections going forward, if we look at the commercial pipeline. So I think it is \u2013 developed markets will be \u2013 as we said, it will be more on the negative side of neutral, so I think, it will be a slight downward tick more than offset by revenue management. So we built that into our projections and at the end of the day, what we\u2019re delivering is total organic revenue sales, our organic storage sales. We feel really comfortable with that. But in terms of looking at the volume that your question that you\u2019re asking is, we then look forward at the commercial pipeline. We think it\u2019s going to be kind of in that range, it kind of up and down. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. If I could just sneak in last one, that 20 million cubic feet customer in India, when \u2013 is that already rolling in now? What \u2013 when is that supposed to roll in? That sounds like an actually a pretty big deal, for which kind of business. Bill Meaney : I wish it was the whole 20 million. They\u2019re not outsourcing everything that they have. And they actually split it between two of us. Actually, we got more than half. So we got the bulk of it. So they didn\u2019t outsource the whole 20 million. I think over time they will and that\u2019s already starting to flow into our Indian operation. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Andy Wittmann : Okay, thanks for taking my question guys. Stuart, I appreciated your comments on the acquisition of customer relationships, otherwise known in the industry as the pickup and move business. I guess, as I look at this, I want to understand it a little bit more. I guess, last year you guys spent about $60 million, this year you\u2019re on track for about $90 million for these types of customer relationship acquisitions. You mentioned that, you pay a sales commission anyway, and so there\u2019s costs either way. What is the delta in cost, if you look out on a per box basis or some normalized basis between the two as you compare them. I mean, $90 million this year, I mean, it\u2019s clearly driving growth. You said 60 basis points of volume. But how does that compare? It seems like, it\u2019s more expensive than a sales commission, but why don\u2019t you help us understand that a little bit more? Stuart Brown : Yes. I think it\u2019s actually not very complicated, right? So on average, we\u2019ve spend, I think probably at $60 million a year and this year, I would expect this to be sort of around that as well. And that includes, mostly boxes, mostly in the developed business and the developed markets. Some of it\u2019s little bit of it in the shred business as well. So it gets sort of spread between the two. And as we said before, typically, we will bring in 3 million to 4 million cubic feet a year in tuck-in. When you\u2019re comparing the cost between, bring it in through a salesperson or you typically get a number of different costs, because when you bring it to salesperson, depending upon if it\u2019s at the customers today or in the competitors, you get some different costs. So you\u2019ve got the sales commissioning you have to pay, but you\u2019re right is a portion of it. If it\u2019s at a competitor, you\u2019re often reimbursing the customer for their permanent withdrawal fees that they\u2019ve got to pay for the competitor, right, which can be pretty substantial. And so you compare that to a [indiscernible] we are typically paying around three times revenue. You actually don\u2019t get that much of a difference, but you get the volume benefit and efficiency benefits of doing it and moving it one time efficiently. And once you\u2019re fully integrated and synergized, you\u2019re at about a 90% margin, so the flow through that\u2019s really good. So you\u2019ve got a payback of less than four years with integration costs. Which is giving you a cash on cash return of 25%. So our goal is to be transparent about it. We view it as organic and because it is like a sales or some other competitive takeaway. We provide the information to investors, but it is part of our organic growth and we think about it that way as part of our organic capital spend as well. Andy Wittmann : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. So in there, I heard that you\u2019re expecting actually $60 million for customer relationships. So I\u2019m sorry if I misquote you in my question there, where I said its 90. So that implies not the difference between the $90 million, that\u2019s in your $515 million and the $60 million, you mentioned there is the customer inducements, which are basically \u2013 those come out from withdrawal fees. Is that the right way to think about it? Stuart Brown : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Andy Wittmann : Okay, cool. That\u2019s what I wanted to understand. Thank you for your help. Operator : The next question comes from Marlane Pereiro from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Marlane Pereiro : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a quick question regarding, can you talk about funding the $395 million of incremental capital for investments and getting leverage to around 5.5 times by year end? Stuart Brown : Yes, I think I touched on this. There\u2019s couple of different ways to look at it. I mean, I\u2019ve touched on the leverage change from year to year end, both from the capital recycling and the thing to remember, Marlene, is that as EBITDA growth, right. That allows you to borrow against that and still reduce leverage. So if our EBITDA growth $100 million organically per year, you can see a radically at five times borrow $500 million and still reduce leverage from where we are at the mid five levels. So you can do both at the same time and fund those capital needs. Marlane Pereiro : Great. So just to be clear, you do expect as communicated last quarter that you expect leverage to kind of to get down to roughly that 5.5 area. Stuart Brown : Yes, which is \u2013 I repeated that in my opening remarks as well. Marlane Pereiro : Yes. Great, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Hello? Bill Meaney : Yes. Kevin McVeigh : Can you hear me? Hey, Bill or Stuart. Nice job on the margin sequentials, the paper headwinds weren\u2019t as much as what we had modeled. Can you help us understand what you use and for the spot price kind of where that came in the quarter. And then how we should think about that over the balance of the year? Stuart Brown : Yes. Kevin. I appreciate the question, because there\u2019s been a number of questions about it. Let me start off with, our initial guidance already assumed that paper prices would be declining. So our initial guidance, we assume that paper prices would decline about $10 per ton from 2018 and on a price per ton basis, $10 per ton equates to about $6 million of EBITDA. So if you so to say, okay, what\u2019s now inherited our current assumptions and Bill touched on his remarks, I did as well. If paper prices stay at current levels and that\u2019s down about $40 per ton from a year ago, right. That $40 per ton is about $25 million, impact year-over-year, right. And so if you think about it versus guidance, that\u2019s about $20 million headwind relative to our guidance. Other things just for people to remember as well, we have really high quality sorted office papers, when we go into market to sell. We do sell it at a higher price and what people maybe saying in the index. Kevin McVeigh : That\u2019s helpful. And then just Stuart, what was it that kind of helped the margin recovery? I mean, I know in the first quarter, it was kind of there were some unexpected cost around labor, things like that. What were you able to put in place that kind of help boost the sequential and then the improvement that we\u2019ll see over the balance of the year? Stuart Brown : Remember, that despite the $10 million of headwinds that we booked as well. And again, we came out of \u2013 we talked about in the first quarter call, we came out with a lot of confidence in terms of our ability to recover, the fact was that the labor issue that we had in first quarter was late in the quarter, we could have recovered in the quarter. And again, I think from an execution, from our operations teams out there around the world, now the ones who really get the credit, both Bill touched on the revenue management of programs we\u2019ve got in place, cost takeout, there\u2019s a lot of work we have to do, right. There\u2019s a lot of opportunities for us in terms of levers in the company to move margins and to get more efficient and we work on delivering those every day. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. But was that maybe, I guess, can you give us some examples was it like maybe lower bonuses to drivers or was it just any thoughts on kind of\u2026 Stuart Brown : Absolutely not. We\u2019re not taking this out of the backs of our \u2013 of the mountain here is out there who are serving our customers every day. If you look, you can see labor efficiencies, our labor actually year-over-year as a percentage of revenue is down. There is some price flow through, again most of them come through in the back half of the year. And then efficiencies and just other costs of sales as well around transportation in some of the other areas. Kevin McVeigh : Got to, okay. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Chuck. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that will be referred today, in today\u2019s prepared remarks, are available on our Investor Relations website along with a link to today\u2019s webcast, the earnings press release, and the full supplemental financial information. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain\u2019s President and CEO, who will discuss third quarter performance and Project Summit, the transformation program announced this morning. Stuart Brown, our CFO, will then cover additional financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to Slide 2 of the presentation, today\u2019s earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance and expectations from Project Summit. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. On today\u2019s call, I would like to cover two main topics. First, we delivered another solid quarter showing adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter on a constant currency basis, further demonstrating the strong and consistent organic growth we are building in the businesses as well as continued progression in the year. Second, we announced Project Summit, which is a transformation program we are commencing in November that will leave us with a simpler and more dynamic management structure, better supporting our future. Before we get into our discussion of the Q3 results, I will first address Project Summit. At a high level, this transformation program focuses on three key areas. First, we will simplify our global structure by combining our core Records and Information Management or RIM operations under one global leader, whilst also eliminating unnecessary work in rebalancing resources. Second, by simplifying our global organization, we will streamline our support structure, whereby we will condense the number of layers and reporting levels from our current average of 6 levels, down to 4 levels. This will create a more dynamic agile organization. And third, we will more efficiently leverage our global and regional customer-facing resources across RIM product lines, creating better alignment between new digital solutions in our core business, resulting in an enhanced customer experience. All in all, Project Summit is expected to deliver $200 million in annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits with all actions expected to be complete by the end of 2021. We expect to incur total restructuring cost to achieve these benefits of $240 million. Of the total benefit, $50 million will be implemented during the course of November and December, with a restructuring cost of approximately $60 million being recognized in the fourth quarter. Whilst there will be little to no benefit from this first phase of Summit in our 2019 results, benefits are expected to start flowing through in the first quarter of 2020 on top of our normal growth. Before diving into more detail on Summit, let me provide some context. Over the course of Iron Mountain\u2019s nearly 7 decade history, we have developed unmatched trust and scale. We have built the global player in the Records and Information Management business today, storing nearly 700 million cubic feet of records with extremely deep customer relationships, including 95% of the Fortune 1000. This global growth, which has in large part been executed through acquisitions, has resulted in certain complexities in areas such as business processes, IT systems, lines of accountability, decision making and other redundancies across our organization. To be able to compete most effectively in any industry today, you must be flexible, have efficient lines of communication and be able to react quickly to evolving customer needs. We have heard from our customers that we need to be more integrated in our approach to solving their problems. This means, tearing down our internal silos, equipping our teams with the necessary tools to better meet customer needs across our business offering, and continue to standardize, streamline and simplify our systems and processes. But in order to take fully \u2013 and to fully take advantage of this significant opportunity, we also need to better align our resources and capabilities, so we have a more simplified and efficient operating model. Whilst the underlying health of the business is solid as demonstrated by the 3% organic storage revenue growth year-on-year, we believe Summit will allow us to continue that momentum, so we can capitalize on future opportunities faster and more efficiently. We expect Summit to enable us to better execute on our strategy, so we can continue to grow both in revenue and profit, whilst also generating more free cash flow. This improvement in financial results will come from furthering our position as the global leader in the Records and Information Management industry, as well as continued investment to build further scale in data centers and create digital solutions for our customers whilst reducing leverage. Moreover, through Summit, we are simplifying our global structure with a view to provide an environment where people can work in a dynamic workplace, all whilst identifying and vigorously pursuing the highest potential opportunities to serve our customers. In doing so, we will undertake steps to improve the efficiency of our operations and increase the pace at which we are able to affect change. And our operations and cost structure will be better positioned allowing us to sharpen our focus on higher growth areas that can provide solid returns to our investors and enable us to enhance the strong customer relationships we already have across the enterprise. As I mentioned earlier, key catalyst for this change, both from a customer service viewpoint as well as an operating efficiency standpoint is to place all of RIM under a single global leader. To this end, we are proud to announce that Ernie Cloutier, our International EVP and General Manager, will now lead global RIM operations in our new structure. As we mentioned in this morning\u2019s announcement, Patrick Keddy will be retiring as EVP and General Manager of North America and Western Europe. Patrick is a seasoned executive who had led developed markets for several years and he will take on a consultative role, assisting Ernie, during the transition into his new role and provide support to Iron Mountain through the beginning of 2021. We are extremely grateful to both Patrick and Ernie for their leadership and efforts to position the RIM business for sustained success under a united structure. In addition to Ernie taking on this expanded role, he will be supported by Greg McIntosh, who is now charged with establishing and leading our commercial operations along with Strategic Accounts. Strategic Accounts is a relatively new area for Iron Mountain as we upgrade our ability to grow and service some of our highest potential customers. In addition to Greg, Ernie will be supported by Deirdre Evens, who leads the North American RIM business. Additionally, Deirdre will report to me, leading the continued development of consumer storage, which includes our partnership with MakeSpace. In terms of transforming the company to be more agile and dynamic to the benefit of our employees and customers, we will condense the number of layers and reporting levels which is expected to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%, including the impact of these reductions, approximately 75% of which will be actioned during the next two months. The program is expected to reduce our total managerial and administrative workforce by 700 positions over the next two years. It should be noted that Summit is causing us to say goodbye to many friends and colleagues. We are now in a situation that we need far fewer senior leaders if we are to serve our customers in a more responsive way. We are committed to providing the right support to these employees that it negatively impacted including appropriate severance and outplacement support. Iron Mountain is a close-knit community. So it is never easy to part ways with team members, but the needs of our business continue to evolve and this realignment will prove to be value-enhancing for our organization, our team, our customers and shareholders over the long term. Turning now to Q3 performance, we delivered constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.7% and 5% year-over-year respectively. This has resulted in a 120 basis points expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin to 35.4%, reflecting the benefits of revenue management and lower overhead costs, as well as the positive impact from the efficiency initiatives we began work on earlier this year, offsetting lower recycled paper prices. Turning to business performance, Global Records Management volume trends continue to be positive with net organic volume increasing by more than 3 million cubic feet or 40 basis points over the last 12 months. This was driven by modest improvement in new sales, whilst destructions were in line with Q2 levels. In developed markets, volume declined organically by about 3.5 million cubic feet or 70 basis points. More specifically, declines in North America RIM volume are in line with prior quarter, down 1.2%, while Western Europe grew organic volume by 1.5%. Other International net organic volume increased by 6.6 million cubic feet or 3.6%, a modest acceleration from previous quarters as new sales growth was strong and destructions moderated. We remain encouraged by the resilience and durability of our core records management business, and believe unifying the RIM organization under 1 global structure will result in unlocking incremental opportunity in the core business and beyond. We will better align resources across the RIM organization to both to bolster our customer experience, globalized processes and extend our reach beyond our core records management offering. For example, the North American RIM team has been successful and leveraging our assets to grow non-core storage opportunities in the area such as consumer, library services and other channel relationships contributing more than 3 million cubic feet year-to-date to our storage portfolio. We continue to make good progress in penetrating some of the historically unvended segments of the North American markets including the federal government. Our federal team had its best quarter yet in Q3 with revenue growing double-digits year-over-year with solid wins across multiple product lines, including core storage, shred, IGDS or Information Governance and Digital Solutions and data center. This is a great example of the sell all culture we are driving toward. Our IGDS business is showing strong year-over-year growth with a focus on increasing the contribution from recurring revenues, we have seen good success with our digital solutions increasingly enabling the pull-through of other revenue opportunities across multiple product lines allowing us to engage with customers on a different level, when addressing a more comprehensive solution that meets their evolving business needs. Just 1 example of this was a recent $4 million win, including scanning some 250,000 cubic feet of documents, where we combined our insight platform with our digitization capabilities. It was this unique offering, which compelled this engineering customer to choose us. Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our growth trajectory across our Global Data Center platform. Q3 was a busy quarter with new turnkey data center capacity brought online in key markets around the world, including Phoenix, London, Amsterdam and Singapore. In addition to the hyperscale lease we signed in the critical Northern Virginia market in early Q3, we are encouraged by the retail-focused enterprise demand we see as evidenced by a growing pipeline. Looking at data center leasing activity in Q3 more specifically, we signed 8 megawatts of new and expansion leases, primarily driven by the lease in Northern Virginia. Excluding that we signed 2 megawatts driven entirely by enterprise demand with nearly 75% of the kilowatts attributable to new logos to the Iron Mountain data center platform. Through the end of the third quarter, we have leased a total of 15.2 megawatts and continue to expect to achieve the high-end of our 2019 target of 15 to 20 megawatts. As we have shared with you on previous quarters, a clear differentiator for Iron Mountain in the data center space is our strong brand recognition and the power of our ability to leverage customer relationships of our traditional sales force. In summary, Q3 was a solid quarter, which highlights the continued durability and stability of the core Records and Information Management business whilst demonstrating the growth opportunities available to us in faster growing markets and businesses. Once implemented, Project Summit will simplify our day-to-day operations and enable us to move faster and ease our ability to capture growth opportunities and execute on our stated strategic priorities through building a stronger, more nimble organization that enhances our service to customers and generate solid returns for all stakeholders. I should add also today, we announced a 1.2% increase in our dividend to $2.47 per share on an annual basis. We are continuing to grow our dividend albeit at a more modest space given the solid pipeline of data center investment opportunities we see ahead in 2020. Durable provide more financial details for Q3 as well as the impact of Project Summit, both near and longer term. Stuart? Stuart Brown : Thank you, Bill. We have a lot to cover today, so let me jump in. Before reviewing business performance and outlook, I want to give you some perspective on Project Summit in the impact on our longer-term financial framework, a framework showing our plan to generate more cash flow to fund our growth investments and an increasing dividend over the long term. The benefits of the structural transformation we announced this morning are expected to expand over the next several years, helping to fund significant opportunities to create value by investing in both our physical storage and data center businesses. Looking out, we expect our storage business to continue to exhibit as consistent and durable characteristics, and see strong demand for data center capacity resulting in low-single-digit annual organic storage rental revenue growth. Service revenue, while more lumpy in nature, should remain flattish as declining core services are offset by new customer solutions. The revenue growth and ongoing continues improvement initiatives should grow adjusted EBITDA organically and consistently around 4% or approximately $60 million per year. Project Summit will continue to help drive higher AFFO, generating increasingly more cash flow. As Bill noted, with Project Summit we intend to invest in higher growth opportunities including data center development and continued scaling of our international operations, while simplifying how we operate. Our strategic priorities and capital allocation plans remain unchanged, as we continue to leverage our global leadership and records management and information governance as well as our enterprise relationships. We will continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation decisions, balancing investments that create value for shareholders, while providing more solutions for our 225,000 customers. The framework demonstrates our commitment to fund the majority of our growth to robust free cash flow, and in turn, reduced leverage. As we grow AFFO, we plan to operate with lease adjusted leverage in the range of 4.5 to 5 times [EBITDAR] [ph], depending upon where we are in the cycle and with our dividend payout ratio more in line with data center and other faster growing REITs. Now turning to quarterly results, we generated revenues of nearly $1.1 billion in Q3. Total reported revenue grew 10 basis points or 1.7% excluding the impact of the stronger dollar. As you can see on Slide 8, our total storage rental revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis in Q3 driven by organic storage rental revenue growth of 3%, reflecting results from revenue management and global volume growth. More specifically, developed markets organic storage revenue was 2.3% for the quarter, reflecting continuing contributions from revenue management and volumes trends that were largely consistent with Q2. In the Other International segment, we continue to achieve healthy organic storage revenue growth of 4.5%. In data center, organic storage revenue growth was 4.1% in Q3, a little lower than previous quarters with churn of 2.4% matching the expectations we had messaged last quarter. Our Adjacent Businesses were also performing well, growing organic storage revenue by 5.2% in the quarter. Total service revenue declined 2.1% in constant currencies with organic service revenue down 3% in the quarter compared to growth of 7.1% a year ago. This change mainly reflects the swing in paper prices, which were at record highs in the back half of last year and are currently less than half of those levels. If we exclude the $13.8 million impact of lower year-over-year paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 20 basis points in Q3, which is below recent trends due mainly to lower project revenue in our international markets. We now expect annual organic service revenue to decline approximately 1.5%, while annual storage organic growth is expected to generate \u2013 to increase about 2.5% resulting in total organic revenue growth around 1%. Remember that generating gross margins of 74%, storage remains the key driver of our profitability. As you can also see on Slide 8, third quarter SG&A declined about $16 million from a year ago, reflecting cost management actions as well as lower variable compensation compared to a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA increased $13 million year-over-year or 3.7% to $376 million, despite the lower paper prices. Excluding the impact of currency changes, adjusted EBITDA increased $18 million or 5%. AFFO in the third quarter was $225 million compared to $227 million a year ago. This decrease is primarily attributable to $9 million of higher maintenance in non-real estate growth investments, including the completion of the number of recent shredding plant upgrades to reduce transportation costs to improve capacity. Slide 10 details adjusted EBITDA margin performance by business segment. In total, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.4%. Turning to Slide 11, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio of 5.8 times remains in line with other REITs and was flat to Q2. We expect leverage to remain flattish through the end of the year held back by lower paper prices and exchange rates as well as the cost of implementing Project Summit ahead of our benefits flowing next year. Importantly, we opened the crossover debt market in early September, raising $1 billion of 10-year bonds at 4.875%, an offering that was 3 times oversubscribed. We use the proceeds to pay down borrowers under our credit facility, which in turn extend our average maturity to 6 years. Further, we have good line of sight to exceeding $100 million in net capital recycling proceeds from the sale of real estate this year after having closed on 2 purchase options in Northern California and selling a portfolio of Midwest properties in Q3. Turning to 2019 guidance on Slide 12, while our core storage and records management business has been strong, this year has had some headwinds that we are not fully anticipated when we laid out the guidance. This includes, of course, paper prices which will impact adjusted EBITDA by almost $30 million for the full year. To a lesser degree, we experienced lower growth in project revenue \u2013 project service revenue than we\u2019d expected. But we have successfully implemented a number of cost savings initiatives. They\u2019ve only partially offset these challenges. We expect Q4 EBITDA to be up slightly from our performance in Q3 with little to no benefit from Project Summit in the quarter. This is below previous growth expectations due partly to lower service results in developed markets. As a result, we now expect fully year adjusted EBITDA to be near the low-end of our previous guidance or a range between $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion, with this change flowing through to AFFO and adjusted EPS. This implies year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of constant currencies of 2% to 3%. While we will provide formal 2020 guidance in February with our Q4 earnings call, given the size and impact of Project Summit, we want to provide some important components to help in modeling. At a high-level, we expect organic adjusted EBITDA growth to continue to be about 4% year-over-year or approximately $60 million. Incremental to our normal organic adjusted EBITDA growth, we should see $50 million of benefit from Project Summit actions taken in 2019 and $30 million of in-year benefit from Summit actions taken in 2020, which will be second half weighted. In addition, current paper prices and exchange rates indicate $25 million to $30 million of headwinds, relative to results anticipated for full year 2019. Putting this altogether, we would expect to see a year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. Also, we plan to treat the cost to implement Project Summit as restructuring, which will be excluded from our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. To conclude, the transformation program that we announced today is expected to yield significant benefits as we simplify how we do business, bringing value to shareholders and to our customers. Implementing this program provides a clear path to delivery of our strategic priorities, including generating cash flow to fund our growth, while helping ensure that Iron Mountain\u2019s position as the trusted guardian of its customers\u2019 most precious assets is protected for years to come. We look forward to sharing our progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year. With that, Chuck, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you to open up the line for Q&A. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hi, good morning. I\u2019m curious to get your sense of how the $200 million in annual cost saves will be allocated, I guess, just in terms of how you\u2019re viewing growth projects like data centers versus, say, deleveraging, what\u2019s the kind of breakout of uses? William Meaney : So first of all, the Project Summit is totally driven in terms of reorganizing the company, so that we\u2019re simpler to work with from the customer standpoint and it allows our mountaineers to work more efficiently and quicker with less obstacles internally. So it\u2019s really about reorganizing the way we do things rather than businesses that we\u2019re conducting. So they\u2019re quite separate in that sense. So if you think about overall in terms of the project is as we said that $50 million will be actioned over the next 2 months. And that\u2019s \u2013 the big change in the feeling of the company will be in terms of the way when we change kind of the leadership hierarchy of the company. So that first $50 million, 40 \u2013 is about really getting us 75% of the way in terms of getting what I would call the top of the house structured in a way that\u2019s going to make us more efficient to both interact with our customers as well as to action things internally on their behalf, because that\u2019s really looking at 45% of the changes or 45% reduction in our VPs and above. So that\u2019s really the first $50 million of change. And then what we talked about was the $30 million of in-year benefit on top of that $50 million for the 2020 guidance. That equates to about $70 million worth of action of the $200 million program. So by the end of 2020 will be up to around $120 million of cost improvement of a $200 million program. So that\u2019s how the things sequence. But they\u2019re very separate from our investment data center. Data center, we continue to see strong growth as both Stuart and I highlighted. If you think about it this year is we\u2019re up about 10% since the beginning of the year in terms of leased capacity. And if you normalize for the churn that we talked about on the last quarter call, which was known when we bought IO; then we\u2019re up about \u2013 we\u2019re up in mid-teens in terms of year-on-year growth in terms of leases that we\u2019ve actioned and brought into online. And then if you look going forward in 2020 is we gave guidance that would be 15 to 20 megawatts that we would book this year. And at the end of the third quarter we\u2019re up a little over 15 megawatts. So again, quite \u2013 yeah, consistent with our guidance that we continue to expect to be able to grow data center between 15% and 20% a year. So \u2013 but it\u2019s very separate from Project Summit. Project Summit is really about reorganizing it, so we can be more effective. Nate Crossett : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, just maybe on the DCs since you talked about it a lot. There is obviously been a lot of chatter in this space in terms of M&A. Just curious to get your thoughts on whether you guys continue to look at opportunities from time to time and what your appetite is to maybe accelerate that DC build-out as a percent of the overall EBITDA of the company, because it is a higher growth area. William Meaney : I agree with you, Nate. But also a lot of these acquisitions are pretty pricy. And fundamentally, when we\u2019re looking at capital allocation, it can\u2019t be just about bulking up. It needs to be a good allocation of capital and it needs to be accretive on both earnings or an EPS as well as an AFFO per share basis. So we\u2019re pretty disciplined on looking at that. We feel really good about the acquisitions we done today. Obviously, the IO being the larger of the ones, which was about \u2013 it\u2019s much about building a platform. But I think now we really have been able to build up the platform and attract the talent that we need to lead that. So I don\u2019t anticipate us doing any major acquisitions. I mean, there are what I would call smaller acquisitions like what we did with EvoSwitch in Amsterdam, which is close to \u2013 those types of acquisitions, when you pencil them out, are close to or near the same cost as it would be cost to build, right? So if there is an acquisition where we think the economics would give us similar cost as a cost of building it, allow us to action quicker into the market, we will do that. But I don\u2019t see us doing any major acquisitions just to bulk up. Nate Crossett : Okay. And then, maybe just one last quick one, organic storage growth 3%, looks like that\u2019s the highest it\u2019s been since 1Q 2018. Just wanted to get your sense of how sustainable that 3% market is going forward. How far along are you in that revenue management initiative you put in place and how much runway do you have on that piece of it going forward? William Meaney : Yeah, we feel \u2013 it\u2019s a great question. We feel really good about it. And exactly, really the two drivers, one is the revenue management now is rolled out globally. So we see that there is still more runway in terms of continuing to get more out of revenue management across all the business lines. And I would say it\u2019s rolled out globally for RIM. But we\u2019re also expanding it to some of our other business lines in terms of the non-RIM. But \u2013 and some of those are storage and some of those aren\u2019t. I think the other aspect in terms of volume, we\u2019re continuing to encourage in terms of the growth that we see in the international markets, and even in North American market, where we see slightly negative headwinds in terms of volume what I would call in the traditional records management business. I think I highlighted in my remarks that year to date, Deirdre and her team have actually brought in about $3 million of non-traditional storage, which has similar returns as our box business. So we see also some of the new areas of storage. So net-net, you put it altogether, is we feel really comfortable to be kind of maintaining in this kind of zip-code for our organic storage revenue growth. Nate Crossett : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good morning. Bill, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more description on Project Summit. After the Recall acquisition, you did have significant cost savings initiative. How does this project compare to that? And did you engage outside consultants for the analysis? William Meaney : Okay. It\u2019s a great question. So the \u2013 so let me kind of \u2013 let me back up in terms of \u2013 I think your question, the other question is the catalyst for this. Is that the \u2013 first of all, when we looked at \u2013 at some point, we knew that we wanted to bring our records management under a single business unit globally. And I think the timing first of all is right for that. So that was the primary catalyst. And you say, well, why is the timing right to bring records management together into a single business unit now? For those of you who\u2019ve been following this story for a while, six or seven years ago, when we started on this journey, is emerging markets were only 10% of our sales as a company and it\u2019s now approaching 20%. We originally set our goal to get that to be 15%. Now, it\u2019s approaching 20%. And it was important to have a separate, a near separate leadership if we wanted to be able to make sure that we are allocating capital in a thoughtful way in getting the returns we needed as we built out that footprint. And both is through one-off acquisitions as well as the Recall acquisition. We feel really good. First of all, we doubled the size of our footprint effectively in those markets. So we feel really good in terms of what Marc Duale and now Ernie and his team has been able to do. That\u2019s point one. So now we actually do have the scale internationally, so having the, what I would call, separate and siloed focus to execute that, is for sure what\u2019s necessary. On top of that is we talked about earlier this year and we talked again today, we have been hearing more and more from our customers, both internal and external. We have \u2013 our employees are telling us how difficult it is to get things done internally sometimes on behalf of a customer. But also, customers are looking for us to show up with integrated solutions seamlessly across the geographies they operate in. And we started setting up a strategic accounts organization under Greg McIntosh earlier this year. We put those two together. We knew that we had to simplify, first of all, the organization by bringing Ernie\u2019s organization together with Patrick\u2019s onto a single leadership. The timing being quite good, because Patrick\u2019s intention to retire in early 2021. We thought now was the time to bring those 2 organizations together. When we brought those 2 organizations together, there is a bunch of costs that just naturally flows out, because you don\u2019t have 2 support functions, supporting 2 different business units. You now have 1 support function serving a single business unit. And we wanted to make sure we took that opportunity to look through the organization completely, especially service part of the organization on how we could actually operate the business differently. So starting in January, if we are taking out 45% of the vice presidents and above as a result of this amalgamation and change, which was the catalyst to relook at the organization. This gave us an opportunity and we think, in terms, of the people who can be around the executive leadership team now. It will be a bigger and more inclusive group, but it will be smaller than the numbers we have before. So our ability to actually communicate strategic intent into action request on customers will be much faster, because we can get more \u2013 we can get the right people around a single table to execute. So that\u2019s really the thing that\u2019s behind it. And then, the good news from a shareholder standpoint, when you do that kind of organizational efficiency, there\u2019s a lot of benefits that flow through. The last thing, I\u2019ll talk about Summit, and I\u2019ll come to your question about advisers is the backend of the project of Summit is \u2013 the front end is really actioning, so by the end of this year, 75% of that reduction of the management cadre will basically be in place. As we go through the program over the next 2 years, is that we will start building new systems capabilities that allow to support that organization, which a lot of it is IT-led. Last thing to your question on advisers. Actually, this is something that we\u2019ve been working on for a number of months, but when we got closer to the execution phase, we did bring advisers in the middle of August to make sure that we were actually executing in a way that was consistent and with speed. So we did bring in advisers and towards the tail end of the project. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Great. A couple of quick follow-ups. You mentioned this was customer driven, do you have to make any meaningful changes to your sales approach? And maybe for Stuart, where will we see these cost savings? Is it more in corporate G&A? Or will it be in segment margins? William Meaney : Okay. Sheila, I\u2019ll take the sales, and then, Stuart can follow on your follow-on question. On the sales, you\u2019re absolutely, right. I mean, one of the things that we hear from the customer. Our customers and this is probably consisting a lot of industry, our customers are asking much more for solution oriented approach to them rather than selling them a product and a product might be digitization, a product might be box storage. And I highlighted the case where we won a project with an engineering company in Europe, where they had 250,000 cubic feet. It started out that they just wanted us to remove the 250,000 cubic feet and may be digitize some of them. And it turned out to be a project, where we really understood what they wanted. We realize the combination of the insight platform to create \u2013 to automate the creation of more metadata as we actually digitize their boxes. And then they said, well actually we want everything digitized and the boxes will be destroyed. So it\u2019s an unvended opportunity. These boxes were stored in their facility. But by actually having a different sales team that\u2019s actually engaging them with a broad set of solutions, we were able to actually do more for our customers. And as a result, win a bigger and better project from an Iron Mountain standpoint. So you\u2019re absolutely right, is that this allows us to actually collapse a lot of sales enablement \u2013 well, sales operations, sales enablement, strategic accounts and marketing will all be under Greg McIntosh, who actually is in Ernie\u2019s organization, so that we\u2019re delivering that our RIM customers. So there is a big part about it, in terms, of changing the way we go to market. Stuart Brown : And Sheila, in terms of how the benefits will flow through, the actions that we are taking here in the fourth quarter, we talked about mostly people action so that will flow mostly through the SG&A line is where you\u2019ll see that. And then the actions we\u2019ve talked about that we\u2019re taking in 2020 are more around cost of sales are continued to be some SG&A improvement as well. And so you\u2019ll see that flow through more in the back half of 2020. And then when you think about sort of the flow through from there, right, in terms of the impact on our customers, as we rollout things like mobile customer tools, so we get fewer touch points between our customers ordering boxes or services or shredding or things like that, we\u2019re going to enable more mobile tools for our customers that have been asking for. And actually simplify some of our billing as well that through the number of M&A acquisitions and things like that that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve got a number of manual processes around billings, which frustrates internally creates a lot of inefficiencies as well for our customers, it\u2019s not always easy for them. So those will flow through in various lines and that will continue to flow through within the later years. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Curious, Stuart, you mentioned that your net lease adjusted leverage were kind of remain flat throughout the year, but ultimately you wanted to get down to 4.5, 5 times range. So maybe you could kind of help us give a bridge for how you will get there and kind of the mix of EBITDA growth and/or capital recycling and data center development CapEx? And how long you think it will kind of take to hit that target? Stuart Brown : Yeah. Thanks, Eric. I think, if you look at what we talked about in our opening remarks, really, our aim is to grow our free cash flow to cover the majority investments, which were obviously, generating good returns on acquisitions and data center. And so our capital \u2013 deployment capital allocation strategy in terms of where we\u2019re putting capital to work and the amounts are not really changing, there\u2019s no change in strategy there. From a leverage standpoint, our leverage is in line with other REITs today. And actually from a rating agency standpoint, the credit markets already treat as if we\u2019re rated higher than we are. You can see that in the results from the bond offering. And so to get to 4.5 to 5 times, is really about optimizing our flexibility over time. So if you look at sort of where the deleveraging should come from, right, with organic EBITDA growth of around 4% and the Project Summit benefits, it will grow to $200 million, those in of themselves will reduce our leverage, right, that will allow us to reduce our leverage. We continue to see this strong demand in data center and other projects, and look at even what our pipeline is today, we\u2019ve actually taken our data center capital for the fourth quarter up a little bit to get some projects started, particularly in Amsterdam and Virginia, where we see strong demand. And so we expect that our leverage will be flat to slightly down in 2020 as the benefits from Project Summit start to flow through from there. And so going back to sort of longer term financial framework at 4.5 to 5.5, obviously, optimizing between 4.5 and 5. Eric Luebchow : Great. And then, just a follow-up on the data center, if you look at your pipeline, how should we think about the mix of kind of the more hyperscale business, which I know has slightly thinner returns and your kind of traditional retail enterprise business. And maybe \u2013 if you could maybe provide an update on the kind of Frankfurt JV process and how you\u2019re thinking about that? William Meaney : Okay. It\u2019s a good question, Eric. I think that the \u2013 if you look at this quarter, for instance, where it\u2019s obviously biased towards the hyperscale win that we had in July. I think that kind of smooths out over time. I think that I would say that we anticipate, we look at size that lend themselves to hyperscale like Northern Virginia, I think, when it\u2019s fully built out, it would be around 50-50 or even 60-40 hyperscale just in terms of a large facility like that, which will still give us blended cash-on-cash returns of the 11% to 12%. So for us, it\u2019s all about speed of fill in terms of the mix between hyperscale and what we call, normal enterprise. The one thing I would add though is the other aspect about hyperscale, which is not lost on us, is we do have some hyperscale customers that have similar returns as enterprise, when they actually deploy an edge-type deployment, so smaller deployment. So when you say hyperscale is a customer for us, but there\u2019s even segment within a hyperscale, they have some requirements that look more like enterprise, when they call edge, and then they have other ones, which are pure large deployment. So \u2013 but we still net-net we think about half of our business will be hyperscale, and we\u2019ll end up with the kind of 11%, 12% cash-on-cash returns. In terms of Frankfurt is we continue to have positive discussions about putting that into a joint venture. It\u2019s not absolutely critical that we do that, but we would like to do that, because it just allows us to stretch our balance sheet or expand faster into other areas. And as you can with the pipeline of 15 megawatts already sold or booked year-to-date, we\u2019re doing \u2013 we\u2019re pretty pleased with that, and we don\u2019t want to slow that down. Eric Luebchow : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead. Andrew Wittmann : Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, the dividend increase here wasn\u2019t the 4% you guys talked about kind of mentioned that you\u2019re going to use these proceeds that you\u2019d otherwise putting the dividend towards deploying into the data centers. Is this the right way to think about the long-term growth rate of the dividend, considering that you\u2019re probably going to continue to have data center investments? William Meaney : Yeah. It\u2019s a great question, Andy. I think that \u2013 and you\u2019re right to kind of cite, because if you think about what we\u2019ve \u2013 it\u2019s about 3 or 4 megawatts that to be by growing the dividend at this rate, allows us \u2013 the exchange is about 3 or 4 megawatts. And given the pipeline we have right now is we think, it definitely gives our shareholders better return, if we\u2019re actually taking that cash and given the 11% to 12% cash-on-cash returns and buying 3 or 4 \u2013 building out 3 or 4 megawatts based on the demand pipeline you can see that we\u2019re \u2013 our occupancy is pretty tight on the data center side. So then if you say on a go-forward basis, we\u2019ll continue to make those kind of trade-offs, it\u2019s probably not lost on anyone, as most of our data center peers are \u2013 have a payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO kind of in the mid-60s to low-70s. So my guess is that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re going to settle out just given the demand that we see on data center. Andrew Wittmann : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I also wanted to ask about the margins in your core North American RIM business. They were noted as down year-over-year, I think, the revenue management techniques were pretty clearly a benefit to the quarter. I was just wondering, how you can reconcile good revenue management likely in North America with the margin performance. What are the things happened there, Stuart, in the quarter that fed into that? Stuart Brown : No. The main reason is obviously the paper price, right. So if you adjust for paper price margins are actually up year-over-year for the quarter. So that\u2019s really the main driver. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. And then could you just \u2013 because there\u2019s always a lot of moving pieces in your numbers, Stuart, could you just help us understand the change in the midpoint of the guidance, what were the key factors there? I mean, you kind of listed some of them paper, obviously, was one of them as well, but if there\u2019s some other things. Just maybe here, can you just help bridge the new guide to the old guide? Stuart Brown : Yeah. I mean, the old guide, the midpoint of [$1,460 million] [ph]. We now lowered that to the midpoint of [$1,440 million] [ph], which is actually the lower end of our previous range. The key drivers are, again, even just since the last earnings call, paper prices are down, so down about $15 per ton. So that in and of itself is about $4 million or $5 million of lower paper price, actually the stronger dollar has also impacted us, so that\u2019s right, given where the dollar is right now, again, that can vary a little bit. That\u2019s about $5 million. The other piece of it is the North America records management. The core services are down, part of it is due to actually lower destructions, which is good for volume. But that\u2019s obviously a headwind or negative for the revenue that comes from the destructions. But we also have lower service gross profit in the UK and France, and a little bit of higher bad debt. Those things have been partly offset with the lower global SG&A due to the cost actions that we\u2019ve taken and lower incentive comps, not where we wanted to be, but I think sort of clear path to where we are in this range. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. So just on that the \u2013 Slide 13 kind of calls out paper separately. So your guidance is actually a little bit lower than the nominal number you just gave there. The biggest chunk that you just reconciled there was paper price for, I think, you said $15 million or so. So all those other factors, how does that go in? Stuart Brown : Yeah. There are different periods is what you\u2019ve got, right. So one of them is, I\u2019m reconciling guidance in 2019 versus what\u2019s changed from 3 months ago. On Slide 13, if you look at where spot paper price is today compared to the average of 2019 is down about $35 per ton. And then we talked about on the last call that every $10 change in price per ton is about $6 million that get you into the low $20 million impact. Paper prices stayed where they are today compared to the average paper price that we\u2019ve recognized in 2019. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. Cool. Yeah, that period is the key thing on the year-over-year guide, that\u2019s the difference here. Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I\u2019d like to dive a little bit deeper into the pricing and volume growth trends you\u2019re seeing in the storage business. Once you strip up the benefits of your very strong data center growth from storage performance. Can you discuss broadly any changes that you may be seeing with pricing and volume growth? William Meaney : Yeah. Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Actually, if you strip out data center, we said it was 3% growth total, including data centers, it\u2019s like 2.8%, 2.9%. So the data center is a bigger impact on EBITDA growth, and it does on the revenue growth. As we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s about 7% of our sales as a company, it does contribute about 1/3, close to \u2013 coming up to 30%, 35% of our consolidated EBITDA growth, but on the sales side it\u2019s actually fairly minimal. George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019d like to go back to your strategy around managing a financial leverage, I know, Project Summit is definitely going to help with leverage. But then structurally longer term, what are your strategies around changing or improving the translation of growth CapEx into generating EBITDA, such that your EBITDA growth accelerates and can support increases in gross leverage over time. Stuart Brown : Yeah. And then \u2013 I appreciate you asking that question, because you get sort of a little bit of multiplying effect, right. You\u2019ll get increasing EBITDA from the results of Project Summit on top of the normal organic EBITDA growth. And so if you look today from a capital allocation standpoint, we\u2019re generating plus or minus $100 million of cash flow after dividend to fund growth, well, that will grow over time, right. So free cash flow after Summit will end, we talked about $200 million or so of EBITDA take a little bit of tax of that. So our free cash flow available for growth investment themselves will allow us to borrow less. So you get higher EBITDA, you won\u2019t \u2013 we won\u2019t be borrowing as much to fund growth. And then you get the benefit of the growth itself. So as we\u2019re putting capital to work, the EBITDA that comes off of the acquisitions as well as comes off the data center growth will then accelerate the deleveraging. So while, you won\u2019t see as much deleveraging in 2020, because of the cost of Summit, as the flywheel starts going, you\u2019ll continue to see leverage come down. And again, long term, our \u2013 we\u2019ll live within a range of 4.5% to 5.5% \u2013 4.5 to 5 times [EBITDAR] [ph] depending upon where we are in the cycle. 4.5 to 5 times, it\u2019s really optimally where we want to be will provide the most flexibility over time. George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Adam Parrington : Hi, this is Adam on for Shlomo. Could you talk more about the trends in record management volumes this quarter, particularly in the developed markets with volumes declining again sequentially? William Meaney : Yeah. Actually \u2013 thanks for the question. I think, actually we were pretty pleased, actually moderated the decline in North America. And you have to remember, this is on a very large base. But if you see this quarter, it\u2019s actually an improvement over the most recent trend. Partly it\u2019s driven by what Stuart said, on the other side it\u2019s a drag on service revenue, because we\u2019ve seen less destructions. So we\u2019re not picking up the revenue there. And then \u2013 so it is slightly negative as you pointed out. And where we\u2019re picking up some volume is on the new storage areas which we picked up about 3 million cubic feet. But overall, actually the trend is that, it\u2019s moderating. We don\u2019t see a major difference. The thing that\u2019s driving the trends in North America, you could look at North America which is slightly negative and you can look at \u2013 in Western Europe, actually which is slightly positive in terms of volume trends, very similar economic statuses, both very mature markets. But I think it really comes down to the rate of change of incoming volume and whether or not boxes are aging out or the average age of our inventory is increasing. So we continue to see a fairly steady trend, but not much of an improvement, not much of a degradation and this quarter is actually a slight improvement. Adam Parrington : Got it, okay. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Andrew Steinerman of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael Cho : Hi, good morning. This is Michael Cho for Andrew. Just a couple of quick ones on the data center segment, just given the healthy activity, really healthy leasing activity, maybe can you just remind us what the revenue growth goals of the data segment are? And the second part of that is, maybe you could provide some pricing commentary as well in terms of the environment you\u2019re seeing? Thanks. William Meaney : Okay. Well, so first of all, we maintain consistency. If you look at it right now, as I said, going back to this year, we\u2019re up about 10% since the beginning of the year in terms of leased up activity. And if you correct for the churn, the customer churn that we called out at the last quarter, which we knew when we bought IO, we\u2019re actually up mid-teens year-to-date if you correct for that. I think that if you look at our bookings this year of 15 out of 20 megawatts target, and so \u2013 I think we\u2019re on track to hit the upper-end of that original range. That again is going to put us in kind of the mid-teens to 20%, so like 15% to 20%, set us up for 15% to 20% growth next year. So we continue to see the growth of our data center business to be mid-teens. In terms of pricing, I would say that the pricing is fairly consistent. In other words that if we\u2019re looking at enterprise, we\u2019re still getting the cash on cash returns anywhere from 12% to 15% depending on the size of the deployment for an enterprise customer. And on the hyperscale deployments, we\u2019re continuing to get 8% to 9% cash-on-cash returns, blended 11% to 12% over an entire site or campus. So the pricing is staying pretty stable from what we see and we\u2019re very pleased with those kinds of returns. Michael Cho : Thanks. And then if I can just squeeze one more on the dividend. I know you \u2013 Bill, you mentioned the dividend comment along with AFFO. So I just want to make sure I got it right. So are you saying that the dividend growth will moderate towards the range of AFFO that you mentioned and you can track AFFO from there? William Meaney : Yeah, I think most likely. I think the thing that drives it obviously is capital allocation, right? So we do want to continue to grow our dividend at what we think is a reasonable rate to get back to our shareholders. But then, if you kind of look at \u2013 if you look at this year, as I say, the difference between what \u2013 we\u2019re growing the dividend this year versus last year, equates to being able to build out another 3 or 4 megawatts for our data center as an example. So if you think \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to think of a proxy on that, if you look at data center peers, they are all kind of in the mid-60s to low 70s as a payout as a percentage of AFFO. And my guess is we\u2019re in kind of the high 70s right now. So my guess is we\u2019ll probably settle out somewhere in that range with our data center peers, given the pipeline of opportunities we see. Michael Cho : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Marlane Pereiro of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Marlane Pereiro : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one, can you discuss MakeSpace in terms of how much accounted for growth in consumer and other cubic feet in storage volumes this year? William Meaney : Yeah, all right. Thanks. It\u2019s a couple of million. I called out we had about 3 million of what I would call other or of new kind of storage. And it\u2019s about 2.5 million. We expect the full year to be about 2.5 million to 3 million cubic feet coming from MakeSpace. So a small but growing and we\u2019re really pleased with the partnership we have with MakeSpace. Marlane Pereiro : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. Hey, you folks are pretty clear. But I wonder \u2013 pretty sizeable restructuring, when did you kind of make the decision that it\u2019s kind of had to happen? And then, the design aspect of it, how long did it take to kind of, number one, determine you\u2019re going to do it and then put the structure in place to announce it? William Meaney : Well, that making the decision to do it was literally this week to how should it be, because you don\u2019t do these things lightly. We want to make sure we had full discussions with our Board before we tackle them. But obviously, we\u2019ve been looking at this for months. So, I mean, that you can imagine that we\u2019ve been looking at this for pretty much the \u2013 since the winter time. Kevin McVeigh : And then, I guess, from a cost perspective, is it primarily on the storage side, where it\u2019s going to sit or the service? And then, ultimately, is there any way to think about \u2013 the 2020 framework on the EBITDA was helpful \u2013 does it assume there is no revenue slippage or any thoughts on what the cash flow impact, like if you were to think about free cash flow in 2020, Stuart, is there a way to maybe just help us frame that? I know it\u2019s not formal guidance, but it seems like the EBITDA is pretty \u2013 there is a range there. But just any thoughts on what that cash flow would like, and again, is there any kind of revenue impact from these actions or is it kind of revenue continues on trend? William Meaney : Kevin, just to be clear on this is what we\u2019re doing \u2013 this is probably atypical that what you hear in a lot of restructure. This is not about the coalface or the people who are actually delivering and picking things up with our customers every day nor about the people at the frontline for the most part. This is really about changing the way we manage and lead the company from the top. That\u2019s why if you \u2013 coming back to it is 45% of people from Vice President and above are impacted, which is difficult for all of us. But the main benefit of this, so coming to your revenue question, is a year from now \u2013 it\u2019s painful going through these kinds of realignments and organizational change, so you can imagine that people are feeling that, because it\u2019s a close knit company. But a year from now, we\u2019re going to have a much nimbler and agile leadership structure, which allows us to action quicker on behalf of our customers in giving them integrated solutions, which quite frankly none of our competitors in specific business lines can do, because most of our competitors are either doing storage or scanning. None of them are doing storage, scanning, artificial intelligence have the data center and have a relationship with them that\u2019s \u2013 with the customers that are global. So this is really about speed. So what we see, we haven\u2019t built any of that into our guidance, but we\u2019re doing this, because we expect to have a positive impact on the revenue side. But we haven\u2019t built that in, because we\u2019re much more saying, we\u2019ll tell you when we see it, we don\u2019t promise something that we don\u2019t see. So, right now, what we laid out with the program by actually changing the way we lead and operate the company, we\u2019ve outlined the cost impact that naturally flows from them. But this is all about speed and ease, both for our internal mountaineers, make their job easier, as well as our customers to interact with us. Kevin McVeigh : Understood. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Keith. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that will be referred to in today\u2019s prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations Web site along with a link to today\u2019s webcast, the earnings press release, and the full supplemental financial information. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain\u2019s President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress for our strategic plan. Barry Hytinen, our CFO, will then cover financial results and our outlook for 2020. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to Slide 2 of the presentation, today\u2019s earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2020 financial and operating performance and expectations from Project Summit. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we expect to file later today, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Before we get into our discussion of the Q4 results, I want to first welcome Barry as our new CFO to the Iron Mountain family. Barry brings a successful track record of navigating transformation and effective change at various organizations. Most recently, he led efforts at HanesBrands to increase operating cash flow, reduce leverage and produce strong international growth. His insights will be very valuable as we rollout Project Summit, our transformation program to simplify our structure and create a more dynamic and agile organization. We look forward to his contributions as we enter 2020 and beyond. With that, let me start with a look back at where we have been on our journey over the past six years. Looking first at total organic revenue, in 2013 it was flat and adjusted EBITDA declined 1%. Today, we reported total organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and 2% if we hold paper prices constant. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, 2019 saw growth of 3% or nearly 5% if we apply 2019 paper prices to 2018. More broadly, progress over the past six years is visible in nearly all metrics not the least being the expansion of EBITDA margin by almost 500 basis points. This macro look back is important as it is the basis that continues to provide momentum going forward. We feel this positive momentum in sales and profitability coupled with Project Summit in a broader portfolio and service offerings to our core customers is the platform from which we expect this trend to continue. Of course, this progress just didn't happen. It is the result of the successful execution of our strategy of shifting our revenue mix to faster growing businesses, including emerging markets, data center and adjacent businesses and successfully implementing our revenue management program. We also made important progress on Project Summit, our transformation program designed to accelerate the strategy and create a more streamlined, simplified and agile organization better suited to solve our customers\u2019 challenges. Furthermore, I am pleased to share with you that we are very much on track with our execution on Project Summit. We moved quickly with a headcount reduction we announced in order to ensure minimal disruption to the broader organization. If you recall, we announced plans to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%. As of the end of December, we had completed approximately 70% of the reductions. We all recognize that change is never easy. In over these last few months, our organization has shown great resilience and focus. This is a testament to our great people and the fact that a large number of mountaineers are already feeling energized by being able to more easily address and serve our customers. As it relates to the savings targets we communicated, the actions we took in the fourth quarter have resulted in $50 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefits that will begin to flow through in Q1. We have good line of sight to the incremental 30 million of in-year benefits we expect to generate in the second half of 2020 with a number of the process and systems improvements underway. We are excited about the new ways we are embracing technology to improve the way we work so we can all show up differently and drive change. Ultimately, we expect Project Summit to expand organic revenue beyond the current growth rates, all whilst boosting adjusted EBITDA by an additional $200 million over the next two years. This is all on top of the 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth we have been achieving the last few quarters. Turning to fourth quarter performance, constant currency revenue increased almost 3% over the prior year. We delivered solid adjusted EBITDA growth of 8%, adjusted EPS growth of 24% and AFFO growth of 18%, while simultaneously increasing investments to support future growth. Barry will provide more detail on the financial performance as well as our outlook for 2020. Turning to business performance, organic global records management volume remained relatively steady with a 10 basis points decline over the trailing 12-month period. To put this into perspective, globally volumes declined approximately 500,000 cubic feet on a base of nearly 700 million cubic feet driven mainly by fewer acquisitions of customer relationships. More specifically, in 2018, we acquired 3.5 million cubic feet of customer relationships which tend to be some of our highest returning investments as opposed to only 2.8 million cubic feet in 2019. We expect the impact of fewer customer acquisitions in 2019 to continue its drag on volume through the first half of 2020. However, we are confident that this is a temporary deviation and that records management volume along with incremental storage opportunities in non-box categories such as consumer and alternative storage and adjacent businesses should result in flat to positive levels of organic volume growth for the full year 2020. Now coming back to current volume trends. Apart from the dynamic I just discussed, the single biggest headwind on volume today is the rate of change of incoming boxes from our existing customers. You will recall from previous calls the average life of a box in our inventory has remained rock-steady at 15 years. Whilst the average age of a box when it is destroyed has remained steady over many years, the average age of our inventory will naturally skew during periods where the growth rate of incoming boxes is undergoing change. For example, if a vertical is experiencing a slowdown in the rate of incoming volume, then the average age of our inventory will reprise. Whilst we can\u2019t predict when equilibrium will again be achieved, we feel in the meantime it will remain a minor impact given that our customers continue to add new boxes to storage annually, just at a lower rate than historically. To help you better understand, let\u2019s take a look at what has become one of our slowest growing yet most stable verticals. The North American legal vertical began its digital transformation journey many years ago. This change in customer behavior is resulting in a deceleration in the rate at which existing legal customers send us new boxes every year until recently. The good news is that we have seen the growth rate stabilize to slightly positive net volume growth. We expect a similar trend across other verticals that are not as far along on their digital transformation journey. To provide further context, let\u2019s say a legal customer stores a 100 boxes with us. 10 years ago, they would send us six new boxes a year and destroy or remove two boxes so they would be net positive four boxes or a 4% growth rate. Today, a similar customer would send us two to three new boxes and still destroy one or two boxes making them flat to net positive 1% growth rate, which is the new normal for this customer vertical remaining stable at this lower growth rate given the age profile of their inventory has stabilized. We should remind you that what I just discussed is only affecting volume from existing customers. In addition to that, we continue to focus on new customers, competitive wins, opportunities in the unvended and federal channel, and as we talked about earlier other methods of customer acquisition. We expect all these various sales channels to continue to contribute to overall organic volume growth for global RIM over time. This is what gives us confidence in the durability of the recurring revenue stream and strong cash flow generation that comes from global RIM organization, and we do not anticipate a change in the foreseeable future. As I like to say, it's the financial beast that allows us to fund growth opportunities, whilst returning cash to our shareholders. We have also made considerable progress in transforming our core RIM business to a more diversified model and are on track to achieve our targeted geographic mix, which as a reminder is 20% of revenue from faster growing markets, by the end of 2020. We ended 2019 with these markets contributing 19% to total revenue, and for comparative purposes faster growing markets represented less than 10% of revenue in 2013. Moreover, over the same period of time, we have expanded the adjusted EBITDA margin for these relatively new and faster growing markets from 20% to 30% in 2019, and we believe we can continue to expand margins as we scale our presence in these geographies and to select new markets that offer superior growth opportunities, all whilst managing our cost structure efficiently. Related, our global digital solutions business had a record year with revenue increasing 10% year-over-year. As we shared with you last quarter, our digital solutions offerings such as InSight are increasingly enabling us to approach our customers with a differentiated solution resulting in a pull through of other products and services. Just one example of this was a recent win with a large, highly regulated financial institution. This customer previously managed its physical file room storage in-house with over 600 employees across five global locations. We will assume responsibility for the management of all file storage, processing of the files and begin providing value-added services. We plan to transform the operation by consolidating locations, reorganizing workflows, adding workflow software and applying digital solutions such as RFID and artificial intelligence and machine learning through our InSight platform. When completed, this effort will not only help our customers significantly reduce costs, but it will also be the foundation for future enhanced digital products. We\u2019re able to win the business based on our unique combination of document management and workflow expertise, combined with our digital solutions which we expect will result in close to $30 million in annual revenue for the next 10 years, making this one of the largest single deals we have signed. Turning now to our data center business. We had a good year executing 17 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including our first hyperscale deal. Whilst we are pleased with the steady commercial progress we have made leasing up our facilities ending Q4 with a stabilized utilization rate of 90%, we did see some deals in the pipeline shift from Q4 into 2020. The 17 megawatts leased in 2019 shows good progress on a base of approximately 100 megawatts at the beginning of 2019. Within our leasing for the year, we were successful in attracting over 100 new logos to our global data center platform, further diversifying our enterprise customer base and underscoring our brand strength in this dynamic industry. We continue to make good progress organically building out our global platform delivering almost 20 megawatts of capacity in key markets around the globe, including London, Amsterdam, Singapore, New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Phoenix. We are excited about our newest development in Frankfurt and currently have a strong pipeline of pre-leasing opportunities in various stages of discussion. Additionally, in Q4, we entered into an agreement for a second site in Slough which will allow us to expand our presence in the important London market by adding an incremental of 25 megawatts of capacity. Under the terms of the agreement, the landowner will build the shell after which we will finish the build out of the data center to our specifications. Our existing footprint in London, which is adjacent to this new site, is nearing stabilization and this new agreement provides capacity for larger requirements in a very desirable market with low latency network conductivity. Looking into 2020, the first half pipeline looked strong with a number of larger opportunities on the horizon. That said, these larger deals tend to be lumpy and timing is often harder to predict. Putting this all together, we would expect to be able to lease up another 15 to 20 megawatts of capacity in 2020. We feel very good about our commercial momentum and a building pipeline of demand, including hyperscale interest in a number of our markets such as Phoenix, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt. In summary, 2019 was not without its challenges in terms of consistently declining paper prices, but we ended the year in line with our expectations having a number of strong commercial wins, whilst making measurable progress on our strategic plan. We are focused on maximizing the benefits from Project Summit, not only financially but in how we operate as a team and an organization. We have a unique opportunity to translate a streamlined and more agile organization into speed to unlock further revenue opportunities through how we connect with and build additional value for our customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry who will walk you through Q4 performance and our outlook for 2020. Barry Hytinen : Thank you, Bill. I am delighted to be here at such an important time in the company's evolution and I\u2019m energized by our strategy, the engagement and strength of our team and the opportunities we have in front of us. Turning now to results. In the fourth quarter, revenue, EBITDA and AFFO were in line with our guidance ranges. We continued to expand margins as adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over last year. Additionally, AFFO increased 18% to $228 million. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 18 million or 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by total organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter, reflecting the volume trends Bill discussed and contributions from revenue management. Total organic service revenue declined 70 basis points in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This reflects the change in paper prices which were at record highs in the back half of 2018 but ended 2019 at record lows. Adjusting for the $13 million impact of lower paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% for the fourth quarter to $386 million, despite lower paper prices and FX headwinds with margins expanding 190 basis points year-over-year to 35.8%. For the quarter, our tax rate was in line with guidance and adjusted earnings per share was $0.31. Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track and in the fourth quarter we\u2019ve recognized $49 million of restructuring charges to implement the first phase. For 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $130 million of additional restructuring charges, and we continue to expect Project Summit to deliver $80 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 and 200 million over the next two years. We continue to expect total restructuring charges related to the program to be approximately $240 million. Now, let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 90 basis points for the quarter. Organic storage revenue increased 2.2%, reflecting volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management. Organic service revenue declined 1%, driven by the change in paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.3% represents an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue management and continuous improvement initiatives. Turning to the data center business, we delivered strong organic revenue growth of 7.8%. We executed approximately 2 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for a total of 17 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily driven by enterprise and federal government customers, and churn at 1.5% remains consistent with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 51.7%, up significantly year-on-year. Profitability was boosted by two non-recurring items. First, a $4 million contractual settlement; and second, a $2 million lease modification fee. Adjusting for those items, margin was 44.4% in the quarter, an increase of 290 basis points reflecting the increased scale and progress on integration activity. Data center development CapEx was approximately $400 million for the full year including 50 million for the Frankfurt land acquisition. In 2020, we expect development CapEx of approximately $200 million reflecting the development projects currently underway. For the full year 2019, revenue of $4.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.44 billion grew 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.02. AFFO was $856 million and dividend per share was $2.45, representing an 82% dividend payout ratio. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Lease adjusted leverage at the end of the year was 5.7x, which was slightly down versus the third quarter. We expect leverage to remain flat to slightly down in 2020, reflecting our strong focus on profit expansion partially offset by project Summit one-time costs, lower year-over-year paper prices and foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to delevering over time, which will enable considerable strategic flexibility. As part of our ongoing capital recycling program, in the fourth quarter, we sold two portfolios which generated net proceeds of $83 million, bringing us to approximately $170 million of proceeds for the full year. We expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. As investors know, part of our strategy is to increase scale in faster growing international markets. We are pleased to report that in early January, we acquired the remaining 75% stake in OSG Records Management, the leading provider of document and data management solutions in Russia. As investors may recall, this had been a joint venture in which we previously owned 25%. We now have complete ownership of the business, which has annual revenues of more than $50 million, manages approximately 18 million cubic feet of inventory and is exhibiting strong growth. Turning to guidance, which is detailed in the supplemental for your review and highlighted on Slide 13 of our presentation. We are expecting 2020 revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.52 billion to $1.57 billion, driven by organic EBITDA growth and Project Summit benefits. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.25 and AFFO to be in the range of $930 million to $960 million. This strong growth is despite continued low paper prices, additional foreign exchange headwinds and includes continued investments in digital solutions, IP infrastructure and our data center business. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, there are several items I would like to call out to consider when modeling the first quarter. First, we expect Project Summit actions taken in 2019 will be a significant addition to adjusted EBITDA throughout the year beginning in the first quarter. Naturally, we also anticipate organic EBITDA growth from our base business. I would also remind you that in the first quarter of 2019, we experienced elevated labor and other costs. Lastly, given where paper prices and the U.S. dollar are currently, we expect both will be notable headwinds in the first quarter. Our 2020 guidance implies total organic revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% as compared to prior year, including organic storage rental revenue growth of approximately 2%. Our guidance assumes paper prices and FX remain at current levels, which combined we expect to result in an adjusted EBITDA headwind of approximately $35 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Anticipated investments, which are detailed in our supplemental, will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings. We may also utilize third party capital for data center development as we have previously discussed. In closing, we expect to deliver organic growth while also realizing the benefits from Project Summit. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be commitment to our dividend, investing in growth areas through both organic investment and strategic acquisitions and reducing lease adjusted leverage over time. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our first quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Good morning. At first glance, Project Summit appears to be focused mostly on cost cuts via employee reduction. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on how any improvements in information technology might be part of the mix and any other changes or tweaks in strategy that would be focused more on revenues. William Meaney : Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So let me answer the question on two levels; one, in terms of the technology aspect that you alluded to and then the other in terms of the operating rhythm in what we\u2019re doing differently in managing and leading the company. So on the technology side is one of the biggest areas of change is going to be upgrading and applying new technology in terms of the way we track and interact with our customers. So to give you specific examples, we have four instances of sales force which is very hard to get a single view of a customer globally. The second thing is, is we have over 40 billings systems, which, again, billing is an area where we need to make sure that we\u2019re consistently not just billing but responding to queries around billing for our customers. So that\u2019s an area where we\u2019re applying technology to allow our mountaineers to have better visibility of our customers, which helps them on the selling side, but also in terms of serving those customers with they have inquiries. So that\u2019s one area in technology. The part that we\u2019re already starting to see a big effect is in terms of how we\u2019re leading the company. So one of the things that we talked about, but probably not as directly on the last call, is Summit isn\u2019t just about taking cost out. It\u2019s actually redeploying cost. So we\u2019re actually adding cost or adding resources around people that are interacting with our customers, especially in terms of strategic account management. So to give you an example of that \u2013 and also in terms of the way we lead the company. So we now have an expanded enterprise leadership team which we met in January. And first of all, the energy in the room was noticeably different because now we have the top 40 leaders and on a regular rhythm every quarter in a room to discuss where we\u2019re going and how to get there faster and better. But also part of that briefing was the strategic account team had the opportunity to put up a slide of one of our most mature customers that we serve globally. And the interesting thing is if you had surveyed people beforehand, they would have said that they\u2019re customers probably 80% served if you look at a matrix of our product offering and the geography that they fit in, and they\u2019re completely a global company virtually in every country we\u2019re in and then some more. And the interesting thing is it was just the opposite. We\u2019re serving about 20% to 30% of the potential of that client rather than 80%. So a combination having strategic accounts taking a global look at how we can serve that customer better, and then the energy being able to have that discussion with the top leadership of the company globally on a quarterly basis I think is going to make a real change. Sheila McGrath : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I didn\u2019t see a sources and uses slide this quarter. I was just wondering if you could provide some insight on your outlook for sources and uses in 2020 and progress on sourcing JV capital potentially for the Frankfurt data center. William Meaney : So, Sheila, I\u2019ll take the JV question and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Barry on the sources and uses. So we continue to look at entering a JV for the Frankfurt facility as we\u2019ve spoken about in the last couple of calls. We\u2019ve slow rolled that slightly because the pre-leasing activity on Frankfurt is very, very strong. So, obviously, we want to line that up before we finalize the negotiations. But we still expect to put Frankfurt into a joint venture. We\u2019re quite far down the track with a couple of potential investors, so we feel good about that. But we also want to make sure that we put our best foot forward and we\u2019re really encouraged and quite excited about the pre-releasing activity to the Frankfurt site. Barry Hytinen : Sheila, it\u2019s Barry and thanks for the question. It\u2019s great to be here. I\u2019ll just highlight a few things and I\u2019ll note that in the slide presentation as well as the supplemental, I think you\u2019ve got basically all of the items that you\u2019d need. But to call out a few things, cash interest, that will naturally be below the interest expense that we guided to in light of sort of deferred financing charges and things like that go through interest. We guided to cash taxes of $70 million to $80 million. And you\u2019ve got all of the \u2013 on Slide 13, all of the various items for recurring CapEx and non-real estate is about 150 million, and you can see the customer inducements, et cetera. We are assuming $100 million of capital recycling. You know that we did more than that in 2019. I\u2019d call out that Summit, as we mentioned, is about $130 million of expected use in the year. And then you\u2019ve got our data center development and base acquisitions, et cetera. So I think you\u2019ll find that if you work through the schedule, there\u2019s a considerable amount of cash available for discretionary and we feel good about where we are at this point. Sheila McGrath : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And right now we have a question from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Nate Crossett : Hi. Good morning, guys. The volume decline in the quarter, I appreciate some of the color you gave, but can you give us some more detail on the declines? Like what\u2019s the breakout of declines for North America versus international? It sounded like you said at the end of 2020, you\u2019re expecting volumes to be flat to up. Did I hear that correctly? William Meaney : Good morning, Nate. So, first of all, we expect volumes to be flat to up for the year, including consumer and other alternative to storage, such as art, for instance. But yes, you\u2019ve heard that correctly. You\u2019re right to also assume that North American is where the negative volume is. The rest of the world; Europe is basically flat, slight positive. It changes from quarter-to-quarter, but think of Europe as flat. And then other international is kind of mid-single digit positive, right, because those were the faster growing emerging markets. So just to come back to it to put it in context, first of all we\u2019re talking about 0.5 million cubic feet of negative decline in the year, over 700 million cubic feet. And if you look at that, that\u2019s more than explained by just the slowdown in the number of customer acquisitions that we did during '19 as compared to 2018. And at that level, that\u2019s totally in our control. In other words, we normally do about 3 million cubic feet. We did less than that in 2019. We did more than that \u2013 a little bit more than that in 2018. And the difference between those two more than accounts for the 0.5 million cubic feet down in 2019, so just put that into context. In addition to that is we continue \u2013 we source volume in three different buckets besides volume coming in from existing accounts. We source it from customers that are completely unvended, not just the federal government but even some of our most mature \u2013 I mentioned one of our most mature customers, they, believe it or not, some places where they still do records management in-house and I actually talked about the file rooms that we\u2019re taking over for this customer which is the largest single customer we ever signed, $30 million a year. We signed that contract because we\u2019re actually providing them a full wraparound solution, but we\u2019re taking over all their volume in their record rooms which historically weren\u2019t in our facilities, right, and this is a customer that we served for many, many years. So there\u2019s the unvended bucket. The second bucket \u2013 and those are our most highest return. The second and third buckets are either competitive takeaways or these customer acquisitions I talked about, which has historically trended around 3 million cubic feet plus or minus on a given year. Those actually have similar returns. And one case is we\u2019re paying paramount fees and sales commissions. In the other case, we\u2019re paying someone that wants to get out of the business or is getting out of business completely and we take over those customer contracts. So if we look at those three vectors, we continue to see that there\u2019s a lot of growth. The last thing I would say just to emphasize is that I talked about the legal vertical. The thing that\u2019s driving the negative trend is not that all of a sudden people aren\u2019t sending us anything. Virtually every customer is continuing to send us new boxes every year. The thing that is driving the slight drag on volume is a secondary effect of slowing down rates as they go through this transformation. So, the legal vertical I gave you for a number of years when it was going through that deceleration was in negative net volume territory because each year the rate of incoming boxes was changing, so the average age of their inventory was ticking up, and so you were getting more boxes destroyed during that period of time. As it\u2019s now stabilized at the new normal at this lower rate, it\u2019s actually stabilized the slightly net positive cube. So we see the similar trend happening with some of the other verticals that may be a little bit further behind the legal vertical on digital transformation. But it is important to note that the legal vertical, which is virtually almost our slowest growing vertical in North America, is actually slightly net positive in terms of cube growth. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Curious, Bill, on kind of your international footprint. I think you\u2019re earlier in the revenue management initiatives in those international markets. So I\u2019m curious what type of impact you\u2019ve seen as you\u2019ve rolled that out and if there\u2019s been any impact on customer retention or volume growth as you rolled that out more broadly across your portfolio? William Meaney : It\u2019s a good question, Eric, and you\u2019re right. We are in the earlier innings on those markets and those are the faster growing markets. So the growth that we\u2019re getting from other international when you see storage revenue growth is mainly from volume growth and only a little bit of revenue management. So far we don\u2019t see any difference in trends in those markets than we did, say, in Western Europe when we rolled out or North America before that in terms of elasticity. But it does take longer for that effect to show up just because some of those contracts are on three years, some of them even on five-year contracts. Of course, some are annual. So what we find is we\u2019re I guess 18 to 25 months into the rolling revenue management out globally and you\u2019ll see that just like it did in Western Europe, it will take I would say another year, year and a half before you start seeing the full effects of that. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Michael Cho : Hi. Good morning. This is Michael Cho on for Andrew. I just had \u2013 my first question is a follow-up on Project Summit. I realize there\u2019s always a number of moving pieces and, Bill, I think you gave an example of up selling [indiscernible]. But if we think about the impact from Project Summit, what\u2019s the EBITDA margin goal for having that as a result of the Project Summit? William Meaney : Mike, I\u2019ll let Barry talk about it. We have talked about it as you said briefly on the last call, but Barry can give you some more color on that. Barry Hytinen : Okay. Hi, Michael. Thank you for the question. If you look at where we are from an adjusted EBITDA margin today and what\u2019s embedded in the guidance and then if you play that out over the next couple of years, as you know, Project Summit is going to generate 200 million or more of EBITDA benefit and you work through both improvements in our base EBITDA as well as Summit, together with a little bit of revenue growth, I think you\u2019d find that over the course of the project as we\u2019re exiting it, probably going to find the EBITDA margin into the high-30s and we feel very good about where we are trending. I\u2019d say Summit is well underway. The fourth quarter actions were taken and completed very successfully. And we have very good line of sight on the in-year benefits here this year. Thank you for the question. William Meaney : Operator, can we go to the next question please? Operator : Yes. [Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019d like to delve a little bit deeper into your physical storage volume trends. Your global volumes grew 90 bps year-over-year in 4Q, but this did decelerate from nearly 2% growth in early 2019. This is rather a large move for a relatively stable business and you talked about legal and the declining rate of change with new boxes. Can you maybe elaborate on what\u2019s causing the increase in the second derivative of change and perhaps what needs to happen for volume growth to stabilize or improve, which is what you\u2019re assuming for 2020? William Meaney : Hi, George. So let me first start with your observation on Q1. So the reason why I also said that we expect the trend that we saw in Q4 to continue in the first half of 2020 is the Q1 was also a high quarter where we actually did customer acquisitions. So the trends that you\u2019re kind of calling out is virtually 100% covered by the change in customer acquisitions, not even the second derivative. Now in terms of the overall change in terms of volumes in North America that we see, as I said, is that when legal was going through its downward march in growth rate as they were transforming or adding more digital processes to their workflows is we did see similar trends that we\u2019ll see, for instance, in financial services today. Financial services is still one of our higher growing or incoming boxes for financial services, but it\u2019s just at a lower rate than we did previously. So first of all, because we\u2019re talking about the thing that\u2019s impacting our net volume for some of these verticals is rates have changed just by its very kind of mathematical nature. These are muted effects, so they\u2019re secondary effects. And the thing I can\u2019t predict \u2013 the thing I would predict is I think we\u2019re going to be in this territory, but if you think about it over a year kind of 7 million to 8 million negative cube growth just on pure RIM and mainly focused in North America until we get through this transformation. And as I said, when we look at legal, we\u2019ve gotten through that and legal is actually slightly positive in terms of net cube growth whilst it goes through it. But the thing that\u2019s hard to predict is how fast people digitally transform and what growth rate they stabilize to. Operator : We do have a question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Adam Parrington : Hi. This is Adam on for Shlomo. Could you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s weighing on the organic revenue growth guidance for 2020? Just the 0% to 2% organic, just talk about it a little bit more? William Meaney : Yes. Thanks, Adam. It\u2019s linked to the other question, which was how is the revenue management rolling out into emerging markets? So it is a broader range \u2013 and I understand where you\u2019re coming out with the question \u2013 is that right now we\u2019re still seeing most of the growth internationally, which is becoming a bigger percentage of the whole of the company, is coming from volume rather than pricing. So we want to get more visibility in terms of how quickly some of the pricing changes we\u2019re making in international before we could guide higher. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Bill, historically you\u2019ve mentioned that you\u2019ve had some wins with the U.S. government with that specialized account focus group. But you\u2019ve also mentioned it takes a while to get the inventory from them. Just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any progress in terms of them implementing the awards to Iron Mountain? William Meaney : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Sheila. So I would answer it in two different ways. I think the contract you talk about, we had a very large blanket contract with one of the large departments and it\u2019s still exactly \u2013 we still have the frustration that you\u2019re alluding to. Actually we\u2019ve had more wins on the service side, because it has been easier for them to give us business on the service side than it is on the storage, and that\u2019s partly because of the relationships with National Archives. So one thing that we do know both from the National Archives and government leaders is that we do expect over time for that to start coming free, because National Archives has publicly announced that there is only a window, it\u2019s over the next few months or years, where they\u2019re going to continue to accept volume from government agency. So eventually that will come loose, but that one has been slower. On the other side, we had a win I think it was about a year and a half ago where we \u2013 I think it will be two years this summer. We had one win with a large government agency where they were exiting their own warehouse and we moved that. I think we won in the summer and we had it all \u2013 we had 400,000 cubic feet roughly moved by November into our facility near Joint Base Andrews. So when they decide to move, we can onboard it quite quickly. But the contract that you\u2019re talking about, that large government contract, we find that we\u2019re getting more success on the services, the digital services side right now than the storage, because of the stickiness with their relationship with NARA. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Nate Crossett : There has certainly been a lot of chatter in the DC space in terms of M&A. We\u2019ve heard that some of the smaller private players are having a harder time of late. And I\u2019m just wondering if that could maybe create some opportunities for you to acquire, what\u2019s your current appetite for kind of accelerating the DC build out? William Meaney : Good question, Nate. I think you asked it last time as well. So I guess I should expect it. But our stance is still the same is that we feel really good about the acquisitions that we did, if you think about the IO that was really building the platform and Credit Suisse have allowed us to start building out our international management team as well as the EvoSwitch in Europe. I think where we stand right now is that we like development \u2013 development still has the highest returns. Now that being said, we do when we go into a market, for instance, I think I may have used \u2013 referenced this before. We looked at Frankfurt, we looked at either doing an acquisition or buying land. In this case, we bought a piece of land that was already permitted. And for us the better opportunity was buying the piece of land and building it out. But we do look, when we go into these markets, what I would call brownfield where we \u2013 there may be a small player in that market that we want to be in, but it has significant amount of expansion capacity on their land or within their shell. So we do continue and that was what drove us to the EvoSwitch. Amsterdam was another market where we looked at, buy a brownfield opportunity for a greenfield, and in that case it was better to do a brownfield. So we\u2019ll continue to look at it that way, but we don\u2019t feel like we need to go out and buy something to bulk up for the sake of bulking up. We feel we\u2019ve grown a lot and we\u2019re in a pretty good position in terms of being recognized. And I would say that we see most things that are up for grabs in the markets that we\u2019re present in. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up question on volume trends that you\u2019re seeing. You called out legal and financial services as being in transition. Can you discuss how volume trends may be evolving in some of your other larger verticals? William Meaney : Well, I think legal has kind of \u2013 George, has kind of gone through the transition. That\u2019s why it\u2019s now gone back to kind of net positive, flat to net positive. We don\u2019t give it to you vertical by vertical, but I\u2019ll just give you a kind of a flavor. Health sciences is actually one that we\u2019re still seeing significant increase in growth. But most of our verticals are going through different degrees and this is mainly North America, a little bit in Western Europe are going through. We see digital transformation taking hold. So they\u2019re further behind on legal, but they are getting impacted right now. But if you wrap it all up together, George, it\u2019s still \u2013 as I say, it\u2019s the second derivative \u2013 sorry to be a little bit mathematical, it\u2019s the second derivative effect. That\u2019s why we think it\u2019s very much bounded in this kind of 7 million to 8 million negative cubic feet on a 700 million cubic foot base. And I\u2019d say right now, it's really focused mostly in North America and Western Europe is kind of flat, moves up and down a little bit. Operator : Thank you. And the next question also is a follow-up from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Michael Cho : [Technical Difficulty] but in the 2020 organic revenue guidance, what\u2019s the data center revenue growth and the margins that are implied in the 2020 guide? Barry Hytinen : Data center continues to contribute nicely for organic growth, and obviously that can vary some depending upon the level of hyperscale deals that we execute and commence in the year. But you\u2019d be thinking something in the, call it, 10% kind of range on a constant basis. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session and today\u2019s conference call. The digital replay of the conference will be available approximately one hour after the conclusion of this call. You may access the digital replay by dialing 877-344-7529 in the U.S. and +1-412-317-0088 internationally. You\u2019ll be prompted to enter the replay access code which will be 10137643.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Francesca. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides are available on our Investor Relations website along with a link to today\u2019s webcast and earnings materials. On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss Q1 highlights and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Barry Hytinen, our CFO will then cover financial results, our leverage and liquidity position and our expectations for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to slide 2 of the presentation. Today's earnings materials will contain forward looking statements. Most notably, the impact from COVID-19 and our expectations of how that may impact our operations and financial performance in 2020 and expectations from Project Summit. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our annual report on Form 10-K and future SEC filings for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial information, and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that Bill, would you please begin? Bill Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. First and foremost, let me start by saying, I hope you are all healthy and well and our thoughts go out to all those who have been impacted by COVID-19. I also would like to say, thank you to our employees in particular our front line mountaineers, who are on the road and in our facilities every day. As many of our services are considered essential, many of our colleagues have been ensuring our customers' needs are met as seamlessly as possible. Our mountaineers have shown selfless dedication and resilience in these challenging times. As we go through this morning's call, I will focus my remarks on a few key subjects. How we are responding and managing the business in light of COVID-19 pandemic; the new service and storage revenue opportunities we have seized, as we respond in real-time to our customers' changing needs, and the durability and strength of our core storage and data center businesses, which provide valuable recurring revenue during times such as these. First, we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation, which as you are aware continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Our top priority is to ensure the safety and security of our people, their families and our customers. As a global business, we have been assessing the situation and implementing extensive precautionary measures since first learning about the virus in January. We have been constant. First in Asia and now globally in striving to minimize the spread of the virus and its impacts on our people, the communities we operate in and our customers. We have been serving our customers many of which are considered essential businesses in new and innovative ways as they navigate this pandemic. Now let me address the current situation, the impact on our business, and what we are doing to mitigate that impact. As an example, we are reserving storage base for critical assets and unanticipated inventory volumes, including supplies needed by health responders in food and drug retailers. We are also providing outflow storage for businesses now stockpiling inventory due to service or supply chain disruptions. In addition, we are availing our customers of our digital and AI-based services to facilitate remote working on a range of activities, including distribution of mail from corporate mailrooms to providing a digital solution allowing the processing of unemployment benefits remotely. The first quarter introduced unprecedented challenges and required us to closely examine our priorities and focus on what we could do beyond our normal course of business to remain strong, resilient and well positioned to support all of our stakeholders. Fortunately, Iron Mountain is considered an essential service in many locations and sectors where we operate. In our global records and information management business, we have been able to keep more than 96% of our facilities open at varying levels of operations all with heightened safety and cleaning procedures in place. We are seeing a need for new and more creative solutions in our digital solutions and global data center businesses. To help our customers respond to COVID-19, we are providing storage and distribution of PPE and other critical health care supplies and are offering innovative solutions around document scanning and application of artificial intelligence through our Insight platform, which can help enable our customers' home-based workforces. Whilst there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recovery from an economic perspective, I am confident we will get through this and come out an even stronger company. We are already seeing customers seek out new services that have resulted in revenue. So whilst it's possible that customers may not use our services the same way they did historically, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate new revenue streams. Our customer-facing teams have been closely listening to customers, engaging differently in solving problems that didn't even exist a few short months ago. We are deepening relationships with our customers and further differentiating Iron Mountain from our peers, many of which do not have our level of financial strength, breadth of digital and physical offerings and flexibility. We believe this positions Iron Mountain better for the longer term. Liquidity remains the top priority from a financial perspective, and we are operating from a strong liquidity and cash position. Barry will provide more detail on the specific actions we are taking but at a high level we are prioritizing cash generation, and we have taken action to reduce operating expenses in discretionary capital expenditures, including M&A. As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.2 billion in liquidity between cash on hand and availability on our revolving credit facility. This strong balance sheet should provide us with sufficient runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. As you would expect in a crisis such as this, our service levels have experienced significant declines in numerous geographies as many customers have instituted mandatory work from home policies or ban visits to their offices and facilities from external parties. The timing and magnitude of decline in service activity has varied by market and by product line. Whilst we are a global company with operations in over 50 markets, our exposure to countries that saw a peak in Q1, such as China, is limited, so we did not see a significant service activity decline until mid-March for the majority of our business. In our records management and secure shred businesses, which account for approximately 75% of our service revenue. Service activity has declined by 40% to 50% during the times when the respective markets have had restrictions in place as compared to the prior year. As restrictions are lifted, we expect this service activity to gradually pick back up. For instance, in our Chinese markets, we are seeing current service activity at 60% to 70% of normal levels, which has improved from only approximately 20% at the peak of the virus spread in China. While service generally contributes only about 20% of our profit, given the size of the decline as well as some of the fixed costs in the business, the impact is significant. As we have encountered this slowdown, we have made tough decisions that impact our fellow Iron Mountain colleagues. In an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity, we have either furloughed, reduced hours or utilized other temporary reduction measures for approximately 1/3 of our global workforce. We have also managed costs by putting on hold our -- on recruiting activity in terminating most of our temporary and contract workers in our global records and information management business. Decisions that impact our employees are never taken lightly, and we have set up numerous resources to support impacted employees during this unprecedented time. This includes, but is not limited to, continue to provide benefits in sponsoring the employee portion of health care for impacted employees, helping our employees utilize their respective government programs available to those individuals unemployed or furloughed, assisting our colleagues with outplacement support and actively assisting employees through our employee funded relief fund. At the same time, our core storage business remains durable, and we continue to benefit from our deep and long-lasting customer relationships. Whilst we have seen a slowdown in the new boxes that we have been able to inbound, the majority of our storage revenue is from existing boxes that were inbounded in prior months and years, and we continue to earn revenue on that inventory. However, the impact the crisis will have on our future organic storage rental revenue growth and volume remains unknown and is dependent on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, total organic storage revenue grew 3%, supported by strong benefits from revenue management. Global organic volume in Q1 was flat compared to Q4, driven primarily by growth in adjacent businesses and consumer of 8% and 5%, respectively on a sequential basis. Organic global records management volume declined approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the fourth quarter. Due to the impact of COVID 2019, we expect our volume of incoming boxes for the remaining of the year to be lower than we initially expected entering the year, but we will continue to look for ways to mitigate the slowdown. As I mentioned before, we also remain in active dialogue with our customers about leveraging existing and customized Iron Mountain solutions to help them navigate this difficult situation. I want to briefly mention a few key examples. One of our digital services that have benefited our customers during this crisis is Image on Demand. This service provides safe, contact list, digital delivery, which enhances the chain of custody security and provides a quick 24-hour turnaround online delivery. This solution enables customers to be more effective by sharing information with those who need it, whilst ensuring the information security and privacy are maintained, which is even more necessary in today's remote environment. Another example is one where we are helping one of our customers, a national health care provider, which was struggling with a surge in the need for medical supplies and supply chain challenges. This particular customer needed to distribute critical PPE to 32,000 employees at 750 sites in 36 US states and required a secure location to prep PPE kits without taking up valuable space that was being used to care for patients. In order to meet those critical needs, we provided non-records business storage and logistics support. We in-bounded in stored pallets from multiple suppliers, prepared PPE kits made up of 12 to 15 items and distributed the kits to healthcare sites. This is only one example of how we have helped many of our healthcare and medical customers during these trying times. A third relevant example is a government labor department that needed to maintain critical processes whilst enabling home-based workers to process high volumes of unemployment claim records as quickly as possible. The government agency leveraged our InSight Essentials platform, which enabled the government department to receive the scan claims via our InSight application to more than 800 unemployment examiners. We will continue to store the hard copy records for them until they need to be securely destroyed. We are currently speaking to multiple U.S. states about similar solutions to address both elevated volume and unemployment and Medicare claims during this crisis as well as the need for remote working of the teams approving the claims. As you would expect, our global data center business has also been resilient as an unprecedented number of organizations are adjusting to remote working practices, which has driven a substantial increase in traffic and the need for additional bandwidth. Moreover, the current pandemic further underscores the vital and expanding role of multi-tenant data center play in an increasingly digital economy. COVID-19 is causing companies to evaluate and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, especially as it relates to outsourcing their IT infrastructure and fortifying their remote capabilities. In fact, industry experts believe that COVID-19 is serving to fast-track trends that were already evident in the data center industry, which bodes well for this portion of our business moving forward. Looking at recent performance, our global data center business had a strong Q1 with organic revenue growth of almost 10%. We signed 6.4 megawatts of new and expansion leases and our pipeline remains robust. This leasing consisted of a 3-megawatt booking with a new logo, a leading hyperscale enterprise software provider, which also includes a contractually committed reservation for an additional 2-megawatts and our expanded campus in Phoenix. We also continued to maintain good momentum with our enterprise customers. Commercially despite an unprecedented macro backdrop, our data center team continues to receive significant engagement in RFPs for both hyperscale, corporate and government requirements. The team has quickly adjusted to the new normal of remote working and has been innovative and continue to meet our current and prospective customer needs, including hosting virtual data center tours to support demand and the increased need for capacity. We are committed to ensuring uptime and resiliency for our data center customers and we are ready with capacity and our staff to handle support, upgrades and new installations if additional bandwidth is needed whilst remote workforces are supported. One area that we continue to monitor closely is the impact on the pace of construction of our -- for our data centers currently under development. While it's not significant, we do see modest delays across many of our projects, which is also happening across the industry. Given our relatively high capacity utilization of almost 90%, should delays extend or increase in length, this could create a tight supply situation. As I said, we are keeping a close eye on this and are in regular contact with all of our vendors and construction partners. And at this moment, we do not foresee it will materially impact our anticipated bookings and delivery for this year. As we look ahead these are truly unprecedented times and the path to recovery is clouded by uncertainty and will likely be choppy. It is very difficult to predict how long this current environment will go on. And what the new normal will look like on the other side. It will undoubtedly be lasting changes to how we work and how our customers will conduct business. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and the associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe a conservative approach is warranted. As you can see from our Q1 results, Project Summit is off to a strong start. Now that our project teams are up and running, and given the speed with which we implemented Wave One, we have identified additional opportunities to accelerate strategies to streamline our business and operations. We have pulled forward a number of initiatives that were planned for waves two and three of Project Summit and expect to see those benefits materialize at a faster pace in 2020. In addition to finding new ways to work differently with our customers as we roll out Project Summit, COVID-19 has uncovered ways for us to support our customers as they adjust to remote work -- to a remote working environment. Our customers' increased need for digital delivery has allowed us to reassess our service delivery model. Our R&D and growth initiatives have well positioned us with services like Image on Demand to address customers' changing needs as they adapt to new ways of working. Leveraging these new technology capabilities, enables us to adjust our service delivery model and more efficiently utilize our fleet, labor and real estate. The most impactful changes to our service delivery model revolve around new service level agreements or SLAs. These new agreements will allow us to better align our external customer SLAs with our internal record center SLAs as well as leverage more effective use of digital delivery to serve our customers. In addition, we will also utilize third party logistics providers more extensively than we have historically for our pickups and delivery. We have proactively communicated with our customers in some of our largest markets regarding these changes and have begun implementing the SLA changes, which has resulted in some additional reduction in force across the business. This broadened scope of Project Summit should result in even higher levels of adjusted EBITDA benefit and associated charges than we initially expected. Project Summit is now expected to generate $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting 2021. This represents a meaningful increase from the prior expectation of $200 million. The total program is expected to cost approximately $450 million, up from our prior expectation of $240 million. In closing, this additional benefit from Project Summit should only further propel the underlying strength of our business once we emerge from COVID -- from the COVID-19 situation. Our strong performance in Q1, together with the additional promise from an expanded Project Summit makes us confident that we will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as an even stronger company than envisioned before. We continue to demonstrate resilience and determination and show all of our customers and communities that they can count on us in their time of need and that Iron Mountain really is iron. I want to thank all of my fellow mountaineers and their families again for their perseverance in these difficult times and I pray for their safety. I hope all of you and your loved ones are remaining safe and well. With that, I turn the call over to you Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you are all safe and healthy. I would like to say thank you to our Iron Mountain team. I've been truly impressed by the team's commitment, hard work and perseverance during these challenging times. As Bill noted we are confident that we will emerge from this period a stronger company driven by our durable business model and the strength of our balance sheet. I will briefly touch on our first quarter performance before discussing our approach to addressing the pandemic. In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations. And through the first nine weeks of the quarter, we were on track to exceed our targets even more substantially. Though by mid-March, our service activity began to experience declines compared to planned as more customers instituted mandatory work-from-home policies and restricted visits to their facilities. Despite this, we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and AFFO. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 1.4% on a reported basis and 3.2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1% in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by organic, storage, rental revenue growth of 3%, which reflected our successful execution of revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.9% for the first quarter to $363 million despite the negative impact from lower paper prices in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA grew almost 14%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points year-over-year to 34%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27, up significantly from $0.17 in the first quarter 2019. AFFO grew 20% year-over-year to $231 million, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth. This represents a new quarterly high for Iron Mountain, reflecting our team's focus on driving cash generation and increasing levels of AFFO overtime. Turning to segment performance, global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 60 basis points for the quarter, reflecting volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management, partially offset by lower year-over-year paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%, represents an increase of 230 basis points driven by revenue management, benefits from Project Summit and continuous improvement initiatives. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.9%, driven by strong leasing and low churn of 50 basis points. Data centers EBITDA margin of 45.9%, represents an increase of 360 basis points consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion. As a reminder as we move through the balance of the year on a reported basis, the 2019 data center results have some one-time benefits that we called out last year, which make the year-over-year comparisons less meaningful. Turning to Project Summit, as Bill mentioned, we are on track and have accelerated and expanded initiatives in certain areas in response to COVID-19. In the first quarter, we recognized $41 million of restructuring charges to implement the remainder of the first wave plus components of wave two, which contributed to the first quarter benefit of $25 million. With the increased size and scope of the program, we now expect to realize the full $375 million of benefit related to Project Summit exiting 2021 with all actions complete and the associated $450 million of charges incurred by the end of 2021. In 2020, we now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit activities of $150 million compared with our prior expectation of the $80 million in restructuring charges of $240 million, up from $130 million previously. Now, I would like to provide an update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business and what actions we are taking to ensure we are well-positioned. Given the macro uncertainty, we want to be as transparent as possible to help inverters understand what we are seeing. To that end, I'm going to provide Insights that are more granular than we typically provide. But first I want to put into perspective how much of our storage revenue is generated by what is already on the shelf at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, our core storage business accounts for nearly two-thirds of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability. In a typical year, new volume accounts for less than 3% of our annual storage revenue. In other words, nearly all of our annual storage revenue comes from boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. As Bill mentioned, in markets where our ability to service customer facilities is limited, we have naturally seen a decline in the number of boxes that we are able to pickup. Partially as a result of this, we currently expect a net decline in cube volume in 2020, but of course that is subject to change based on the duration of the pandemic. As you would expect, the impact this has on storage revenue is much more muted than the impact it has on our service activity levels. Turning to our service business, which was about 35% of our 2019 revenue. In April, we saw activity declined approximately 40% overall, on the service business. As investors would expect, the impact has not been uniform across our service lines, so let's take a look at how this has trended across our business. I will use North America as an example, as it is both our largest market. And fairly representative of the activity levels, we have seen in other markets with similar closures and restrictions. Records management in North America, for the month of April had a 58% year-over-year reduction in new boxes in bounded and a 49% year-over-year reduction in retrievals and re-files. Data management activity in April declined less approximately 30%. A digital solution has seen a slowdown in activity compared to the first quarter, though April activity levels were flat year-over-year. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 27% in April, which has led to a corresponding decline in our paper tonnage. While we have seen an encouraging rebound in the market for paper prices recently, our average realized price in the first quarter was 44% lower than the prior year, which was a $10 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with the broader industry trends, we saw a sequential improvement in paper price of about 2.5% in the first quarter. And the trend has continued to improve. As investors will recall, in the past we have mentioned that a $10 per tonne change in paper price, represents an approximate $6 million EBITDA impact. Of course, this is clearly influenced by volume, so the EBITDA impact of paper price movement will change proportionately with the change in paper volume. Now, let me make a couple of comments on two of our smaller businesses. The Fine Arts industry has experienced a significant slowdown, during the pandemic. And given the nonessential nature of the business, we have temporarily closed all of our Fine Arts facilities. With a prudent view as to the intermediate term impact, we recorded $23 million non-cash impairment charge on the goodwill associated with that reporting unit. The consumer storage business through our partnership with MakeSpace, has seen an increase in demand. This led to over 5% growth in storage volume in the first quarter. And we have continued to see strong demand in April. Given the nature of the service level decline I just discussed, we have taken actions which we expect to be temporary and are in addition to the actions we had underway, with Project Summit. These actions include furloughs, reduced work hours, a pause in hiring, reductions in certain expenses like travel, and lower variable compensation. With these adjustments, we anticipate we will have removed in excess of $350 million on an annualized basis as compared to our prior plans. You will see these reductions materialize in cost of sales within our service business, as well as in our SG&A expenses. These actions are designed to help align our costs and revenues, as we navigate the uncertain environment. Therefore, we expect these costs to come back as revenue recovers. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are confident, in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the first quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement up eight days year-on-year with benefits coming from both payables days and day's sales outstanding. I view the team's performance is particularly strong, given the COVID-19 backdrop. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long-term. We ended the quarter with $153 million of cash and together with the availability under our revolving credit facility we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. At this point in early May, our liquidity remains unchanged at that level, which we believe provides us ample runway to operate the business, in this uncertain environment. For context, this liquidity represents over three times the 2019, full year adjusted EBITDA of our service business. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share earlier this week to be paid in early July. As the economy recovers in 2022 and 2023 and with a sustainable dividend at this level, we would expect our payout ratio to glide toward the mid-60s to low 70s, as a percent of AFFO. As we noted in our press release, we are no longer providing guidance for 2020, in light of the unknown severity and duration of the impact of the crisis on our markets and customers. However, we don't want to help you understand how we are currently planning for the remainder of 2020. Let me start with the impact of the much stronger U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we currently expect a full year impact on our revenue of about $100 million versus last year. At the time of our last call, FX rates implied an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $5 million. Though with a stronger dollar, current FX rates translate into a full year adjusted EBITDA headwind of $35 million versus last year. Turning to activity levels, we are expecting April to be representative of the trends we experienced for the remainder of the second quarter, which we expect to be the weakest quarter in 2020 for comparative revenue and adjusted EBITDA change. Although recent trends suggest this may prove to be conservative as more and more of our customers around the world are gradually opening back up and we are seeing other positive indicators. I will note we are maintaining flexibility to rebound quickly, if business conditions improve faster than expected. And on the other hand, if conditions worsen we have already identified additional options that can be executed quickly as needed. At this point, we anticipate delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin flat to slightly up compared to last year, reflecting our solid first quarter performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions. This will be partially offset by our conservative posture as to service revenues and fixed cost deleverage. Given the current environment, we have also quickly taken actions to preserve capital. We reduced capital investments both for capital expenditures and M&A by a net total of $110 million relative to our original guidance for 2020. This is made up of approximately $110 million of reduced CapEx and $75 million of reduced investment in M&A and acquisitions of customer relationships. This net total also reflects an increased investment of $75 million, to support the construction of our Frankfurt data center. Additional detail can be seen in the supplemental and is highlighted on slide 14 of our presentation. We continue to expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. As we look at the market for industrial assets, we continue to see attractive valuations and our pipeline has actually increased over the last couple of months. As investors would expect, we have run multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for revenue, margins the duration of the crisis and the speed of recovery. Included in these scenarios are some extreme stress test models, which we develop to understand the possible impact, if conditions worsened materially and persisted for an extended period of time. One of the stress test we ran was based on service activity being down about 65% year-on-year and persisting at that level through 2021. Even in that scenario, we do not foresee an issue with liquidity or leverage through 2021. I'll also note, the severity and duration of our stress tests are much more extreme than both what we have seen thus far and what current trends and macro forecasts indicate we will likely experience. Even still we would have significant cushion in terms of both liquidity and leverage. In closing, we are confident in the durability of our storage business and believe the magnitude of impact on our service business combined with the actions we have taken leave us in a strong financial position. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our second quarter earnings call. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. And with that, operator please open the line for Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Shiela McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Hi. Yes, good morning. That was very positive news on your guidance on the savings from Project Summit. I was just wondering, can you explain in a little bit more detail where that upside is coming from? Where you're finding those savings? Bill Meaney : Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So as we got into COVID-19, as I alluded to is that our customers needed to be served a different way. And we already had a Summit teams spun up to look at our cost of sales. And what we found was, if we look specifically at SLAs for instance returning a box in 24 hours -- returning a box in 24 hours in this environment where people are working remotely wasn't going to help. So what we've done is we've actually in the major markets we've already implemented this. So this is United States, Canada, Ireland, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand. As we said, we're taking that to five business days so once a week we will pick up or deliver physical boxes. If they need something quicker then we will actually digitize it and we'll send it to them in a digital secure link through our InSight platform in Image on Demand. So we're actually giving them a better service and at the same time changing from 24 hours to five business days or once a week. You can imagine how significant that impact is on our logistics operations and allows us to really take out quite a bit of cost. Sheila McGrath : Okay. And then also I was just wondering, if you could comment on the dividend philosophy. As your \u2013 many REITs have chosen to revisit their dividend just as a source of liquidity. And just want to understand how you're thinking about the dividend? Bill Meaney : Well, I think we're blessed by being kind of an industry one. So we're a specialized REIT and our operations are still running strongly. We \u2013 although service has been impacted as Barry said 40% to 50% that's on 20% of our profits or 40% of our sales. So whilst it's impactful it's not a threat to our liquidity. So for our \u2013 from our standpoint, there isn't a liquidity reason that we would have to adjust our dividend. And then, as if you look at 2022, where we think we'll be looking at COVID in the back \u2013 in the rearview mirror by 2022. So we're assuming that it doesn't happen until then. Then we're actually gliding quite nicely into our original goal in our financial models as we get into the 2022 and 2023 period in terms of getting into the mid-60s to low-70s as payout as a percentage of AFFO. So we feel good about where we are. We'd rather not have COVID-19 because we would have gotten there much faster, but we feel good about the position. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hey, good morning. Just a follow-up on Sheila's question about Summit, so how much of that $175 million benefit is coming from that SLA change, and are there any other kind of big drivers in there? Bill Meaney : Yes. So thanks Nate for the question. So it is -- that is actually the major driver. Because if you look at our cost of service, which is a combination of labor, fleet in terms of the trucks that we put on the road and our facilities. It is -- we are one -- it is actually the largest cost as a company. And when you then say okay we're going to a five-day or once a week service cycle which allows us to marshal or consolidate volumes much more. And then for more rapid turnaround to give people digital ways of getting that back it's a major change in terms of cost of sales. We always as part of Project Summit we're going to optimize the cost of sales across those three labor trucking and facilities. But actually changing that from a 24-hour rhythm to a once a week rhythm is super impactful. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Two questions. I didn't understand if this new rhythm for delivery to once a week from once every day was also positioned for the post-COVID environment meaning it would stay? And my second question Barry is with the stepped-up benefits from Project Summit when you reach those benefits what would be the implied EBITDA margin? Bill Meaney : So Andrew on the first one yes this is -- and we communicated that to our customers. This is beyond COVID. And in fact, this probably is something that could have happened before, but it's easier to actually get people to change their mindset in terms of how they want to be served given the current environment. Because if you think about the 24-hour SLAs than something that was historical in the business for decades. And the way people use the information that they retrieve now is very different. And quite frankly, lots of times they'd rather have it electronically. So yes this is -- COVID was -- it allowed us to have the catalyst to have that conversation with the customers, but it's permanent going forward. Barry Hytinen : Hi. Andrew, thanks for the question. Good morning. While we're not giving guidance for even this year's EBITDA, it's a little bit hard to get into projecting how much of that extra $175 million of benefit from Summit going forward is going to be as it relates to the numerator and denominator of EBITDA and sales. But certainly, if you thought about that $175 million incremental in sort of perpetuity and that's the way you should because it's a ongoing benefit. And put that against either our prior guidance or last year's results, for example, it is a very significant increase in the relative level of profitability and will certainly dramatically assist us in our goal of increasing margin and moving that into the very high 30s, if not potentially beyond going forward. But I think what we'll do is take it one quarter at a time this year and provide you updates as how we're doing. But I will tell you as Bill -- I'll reiterate Bill's point, we feel very good about what we've got going on with respect to Summit and the way the teams are performing. And we look forward to reporting the progress against that with you every quarter. Andrew Steinerman : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Marlane Pereiro with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Marlane Pereiro : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one. Just to clarify, under your extreme scenarios, you anticipate not staying within both your maintenance and incurrence covenants, is that correct? Barry Hytinen : Yes. Marlane Pereiro : Okay. I mean, do you have -- would you be able to provide roughly an idea of how much cushion or headroom that you would have under those scenarios? Barry Hytinen : So I mean let me frame it this way for you. As we think about leverage for this year based on the -- our current view of trends and the outline of how Bill and I spoke about it earlier, we would expect leverage to be flattish to maybe slightly up year-on-year at year-end this year. Now I will note that it is a positive development I think speaks to the team's progress and the performance we put up in the first quarter that are actually our leverage ticked down a 10th from year-end. But when we stress test the business, it probably slightly above those levels, but we feel very good about in each scenario. I don't want to give and I think you can appreciate why specific leverage points under various stress tests because there are so many models -- so many elements that go into those models. But as we said on the call, we would have sufficient cushion in both the leverage -- on all the tests that you mentioned as well as liquidity. So we feel very good about where we're positioned. And that is thanks to the incremental Summit benefits, we've pulled forward here at the incremental Summit benefits coming from the SLA changes that Bill mentioned, as well as the cost actions we took to align revenues and costs in this period here during the pandemic. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Franois \u2013 it\u2019s from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Okay, excuse me. The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : One more. Yes just one more question from me Andrew. Organic revenue growth in storage. Is your working assumption that it stays positive throughout the year? Bill Meaney : Yes. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Franois Mambo [ph]. The next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. Maybe just give a little thought as to the impact on kind of both the storage and the data center business longer term given the shift in service, do you expect any impact on the storage business? And then ultimately data center as well as it relates to maybe incoming volumes things like that if you think about potential structural changes as a result of COVID-19? Bill Meaney : On the storage side Kevin post-COVID-19 there \u2013 right now our surveys there's many customers that say that there will be no change as there \u2013 those that say that will be continuing on their current program. So no, we don't expect a major change in the trends that we're seeing on the storage. On data center, as we said is that we've seen actually continued building of our pipeline through COVID-19 and we expect that to continue to be strong on the other side. We can't tell you right now if our strong pipeline is just because of the momentum we were building into the \u2013 in the data center business as we were coming in or specific to COVID-19. But yes, there's nothing that we're hearing from customers that's saying that their demand post COVID-19 is going to be any different on the data center side than what we're seeing in terms of the positive momentum in the basis today.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website. We will also be providing a link to today\u2019s webcast and earnings materials. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we are successfully navigating the COVID-19 environment, how we have continued to see durability in our core Storage business, how we have continued to see strength in our Data Center business, how we are progressing on our Transformation Program with Project Summit, and how we as an organization are reflecting and acting on the recent events, highlighting continued social injustice with regards diversity broadly and of black population specifically. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements. We have noted the impacts of COVID-19 and our expectations of how that may impact our operations and financial performance in 2020. We have also noted our expectations for Project Summit. As you know, all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on the Slide 2 and our annual report on Form 10-K and other periodic SEC filings for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg-G in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you\u2019re all continued to stay safe and healthy in these trying times. Before we get into a discussion of our second quarter performance, I\u2019d like to take some time to touch on 2 topics that are top of mind for many of us in the current environment. First, the killings of George Floyd and countless others have left me and my colleagues upset, angered and heartbroken. I want to reiterate that racism, discrimination and hate have no place at Iron Mountain. Our commitment and stated as one of our core 5 values for many years, to equality, inclusivity and diversity is part of our belief that our people are our greatest assets. Given this fact, we must continually attract, listen to and develop a broad talent pool reflecting our global demographics in order to deliver to our customers and protect our future. These tragic events have sparked difficult but important self-reflection in conversations within our organization about how well we are living up to our stated value and to commit ourselves to do much better. It is up to us to work together, educate ourselves and encourage open dialogue to promote proactive measures to help eliminate incorrect biases and spread awareness, not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because we will only be successful in serving our customers if we attract and retain the best talent. Having the best talent can only happen if we are recruiting and developing people from diverse backgrounds across the broader demographics we operate in. We remain strongly committed toward taking decisive and strategic action to create a truly inclusive Iron Mountain. We\u2019re committed to listening, learning and taking the necessary actions to support long-term positive change for the black community specifically, and people from all backgrounds in general. Whilst we cannot change the past, we have an opportunity as an organization and as individuals to positively impact the future and help fix the racial inequality prevalent in our society. Now, I\u2019d like to update you on the impact we are seeing with respect to COVID-19. As you all know, the virus is unfortunately still spreading across the globe. My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been affected by the virus, including those who have fallen ill as well as their loved ones and their caregivers. As always, our top priority remains the health and safety of our Mountaineers, their families and our customers. I want to acknowledge and thank the mighty Mountaineers around the world, who despite extraordinary challenges have kept their focus on ensuring that Iron Mountain continues to move forward during these uncertain times, and doing so with a view towards safety. This is all [brought home] [ph] to me again last week, during a visit I made to Northern New Jersey, so I could thank our frontline teams personally. One of our couriers relayed how he has been serving a large metro New York health system every day through the crisis and how thankful the customer is for our continued service. This particular customer went so far to send one of their doctors to our facility to assist in the protocols and training to protect our staff. For me, this is what it means to be in a true partnership with our customers. Whilst we continue to serve many customers during this crisis, as you would expect our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to office closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. Fortunately, 100% of our records management facilities are now open and operating across the globe. However, many of our global customers continue to operate at significantly lower capacities due to existing restrictions depending on geography. As a result, global demand for many of our core service offerings declined during the quarter. Looking back, no one could have anticipated the magnitude of the impact from this pandemic on the global economy and our own business. However, our team moved quickly to assess the risks, understand the consequences, and take decisive action to ensure the safety of our employees, customers and communities. As I mentioned, these various decisions have not been made lightly. And we are aware of their consequences, especially for our Mountaineers that have been impacted by furloughs and other temporary, and in some cases, permanent actions. We told you in May that approximately a third of our global workforce has been impacted by these actions in an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity. Fortunately, we have been able to bring a number of our Mountaineers back to work. So at this time, this number has decreased to approximately 20% of our global workforce. Furthermore, the mix has shifted over the past few months, so fewer of the impacted employees are on full furlough, and a higher percentage are working reduced hours, or using vacation or sick times. At this time, we have also reopened all our corporate offices with the exception of London, which we plan to open at the beginning of September. We are practicing strict protocols around social distancing. And as such, the majority of our salaried workforce is continuing to work remotely. We should know we have been strong \u2013 we have seen strong productivity rates with working from home. That being said, given some of the increased stresses of working remotely, we continue to monitor and care for our Mountaineers\u2019 mental health and resiliency as part of our overall focus on wellness. Turning to our financial performance, our continued navigation of this challenging and uncertain environment has delivered a second quarter performance that further demonstrates, improves the durability and resilience of our people, and ultimately, our business model. I\u2019ll touch on a few highlights here. Q2 constant currency revenue declined $58 million or 5.6% year-over-year, driven entirely by a 21% decline in our service revenue. This was partly offset by strong storage revenue growth, which increased 3.7%. The early benefits of Project Summit are evident as we delivered constant currency adjusted EBITDA line, in line with the year-ago level despite the revenue decline, leading to a 200 basis point margin expansion. Barry will review the rest of the Q2 financials in more detail. Looking at our service business, we have seen improvements in activity levels across the various product lines since the end of April as global economies are starting to reopen and customers are increasingly utilizing our core service offerings in many geographies. However, the pace of our recovery still remains uncertain. Whilst the revenue decline wasn\u2019t as steep as we expected when we last spoke in early May, we continue to see some risk around the second half, depending upon what happens with the progression of the virus and possible additional restrictions on a country-by-country and state-by-state basis, as they continue to fight specific localized outbreaks of the virus. Turning now to our core Storage business, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% supported by strong revenue management contribution. Moreover, we saw cash collections improve both in absolute terms year-on-year as well as by 2 days outstanding. This level of organic revenue growth underscores the durability and essential nature of our Storage business and our ability to continue to generate substantial cash flow. Total organic volume declined 1.8 million cubic feet sequentially, contributing to this decrease was in records management volume, partly offset a 2 million cubic foot increase in consumer and others. Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 3.9 million cubic feet compared to the first quarter. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising based on the decline of incoming boxes in April and a decline of 45% for the quarter. We have been asked by many investors as to what we see happening to physical volume post-COVID. So let me take a step back and provide some further context on organic records management volume. We estimate that the impact from COVID in Q2 was somewhere between 4 and 4.5 million cubic feet, net of a slowdown in permanent withdrawals. If we continue to normalize Q2 for similar levels of volume in Q1 combined with our expectation for a pickup in permanent withdrawals, volume would be flat to slightly up on a normalized basis. To get to a total physical volume impact, I will now be factoring consumer performance. In the second quarter, we added 2 million cubic feet, analyzing this would imply we would be net positive 8 million cubic feet or approximately 1% volume growth on a base of total physical volume of more than 720 million cubic feet. However, Q2 is a seasonally highest point for consumer business, so this would be overly optimistic to assume for a full year. When we net all this out in a post-COVID world, we would expect physical storage volume growth to be roughly a 0.5% with volume from records management flat to slightly up with a small net positive growth coming from consumer. It should be noted that this is all before the contribution from our normal price increases, which generally add approximately 2% to 3% to the volume growth, yielding approximately 3% organic storage revenue growth from the physical side of the business. However, when we will see this reversion to post-COVID normalized business environment remains uncertain, and it\u2019s certainly not before the end \u2013 before the second half of 2021. Despite the stress constraints from dealing with COVID\u2019s impact, we have not led up on our investments in innovation. Specifically in the quarter, we had many instances where we were able to serve our customers with a focus on delivering innovative solutions in order to help them navigate their challenges that have arisen from COVID-19. For example, regarding the commercial impact, in April, pipeline of more traditional offerings was down 40% versus the same period last year due to COVID in the resulting lower economic activity. However, we recovered one-third of this loss through new solutions we recently launched that help address our customers\u2019 needs during this time. This is just one demonstration of the resiliency and dedication of our mountaineers as we expect many of these solutions to be additive to our top and bottom lines even after our base activities rebound. Turning now to our Global Data Center segment. This business continues to perform exceptionally well, delivering strong results in the second quarter. In June, we announced a 27-megawatt data center lease with a U.S.-based Fortune 100 customer in Frankfurt, Germany. This customer will occupy the entire Frankfurt facility which should result in stabilization significantly sooner than we originally anticipated when we purchased the land last year. In addition, we signed a 3-megawatt data center lease with a Fortune Global 200 company in Singapore, another signal of strong momentum in that market. These bigger deals have been won alongside a series of smaller but significant agreements including a number of new logos. We welcomed an online gaming platform, a state government and a global logistics supplier provided to the IMDC ecosystem in Q2. All of this is contributed to a strong performance in the first half of the year with nearly 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases signed against our initial guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts for the full year. Given this great success in the first half of the year, we now expect to be able to sign leases for a total of 45 to 50 megawatts this year or an additional 10-plus megawatts of leasing in the back half. I\u2019d like to congratulate the entire data center team for an exceptional first half performance. Thank you. Based on the strength of our pipeline, we will continue to prioritize investment in data center growth. We are actively building our capacity across our global footprint with new development projects started in Amsterdam, Singapore and Phoenix. In early July, we completed the first phase of 4 megawatts and our new building on our Northern Virginia Campus, and customers are already deploying. As I mentioned earlier, Projects Submit is already paying dividends. No one could have predicted the depth or breadth of this pandemic when we first announced Project Summit in October 2019. Thankfully, the decisive actions we took early in the program allowed us to reconfigure our cost structure as well as realigned our organization to be more nimble and customer centric. These changes enabled us to be more responsive in delivering new solutions to our customers\u2019 specific needs during the crisis as well as matching our costs to a changing demand environment. In addition to the cost reduction Project Summit has achieved as demonstrated by our increased margin, we\u2019ve also made progress on the next phase and improving our customer intelligence as well as simplifying our IT systems, one such example being our master data management initiative. Through this initiative, we\u2019re improving the platforms and processes that handle all of our data. This intelligence will allow us to better understand and serve our customers making data and asset for our business. Finally, I\u2019m also very pleased with the initial success we have seen from the recent changes to our service delivery model. The rollout of the SLA changes or service level agreement changes we discussed last quarter had gone smoothly. We have already seen the early benefits of denser routes and less frequent pickups and deliveries. Our Image on Demand service has seen an increase in activity as more customers look for solutions, which include the use of digital solutions, as it helps them integrate more contactless process to reduce infection risk at their businesses. A recent survey indicated that more of our customers are interested in converting to digital versus physical delivery. In particular, our customers tell us they value speed of delivery, ease of use, and security as the most important considerations when evaluating the use of Image on Demand. To summarize, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge provided confirmation that the changes we have made to our organization and the investments we have made in the recent past were the right ones. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends, and we have demonstrated that we can provide the necessary solutions to help our customers adapt to their new unexpected work environment. Despite the unprecedented volatility of COVID-19, we remain focused on long-term growth and doing what\u2019s right for the health of our employees, our customers and our business. Importantly, we have also recommitted ourselves in our fight against racial injustice prevalent in our societies around the globe, and in creating an inclusive and diverse workforce. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a durable business model, which are helping us successfully navigate this challenging period, whilst providing us with the flexibility to continue investing in our long-term growth plans, which go beyond Project Summit. As Barry shared with you last quarter, we are proactively managing expenses and have additional levers to further adjust our cost structure if necessary and appropriate. In closing, whilst the hide degree of uncertainty remains as we look to the back half of the year, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our customers today, and we will continue to provide innovative products and services that address their evolving business needs. Our confidence is further shared by our bondholders as evidenced by our $2.4 billion issuance to refinance some of our notes. Strong investor confidence and demand allowed us to upsize our transaction, as well as extend our maturity profile. On behalf of the leadership team, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our frontline mountaineers, who have kept our operations running seamlessly to serve our customers. Stay safe and well. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. I want to echo Bill\u2019s comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. Before I go into the detail of the \u2013 our results, let me touch on the impact COVID-19 has had on our service trends. As we noted on our last conference call, for the second quarter, we were planning for service declines consistent with what we experienced in April. This proved to be slightly conservative. While May was consistent with April, we saw an improving trend across most of our service lines in June. To provide investors with as much visibility as possible, I want to share more information than we typically do, including the monthly progression of service activity. As compared to last year, our global service activities declined 37% in April, 38% in May, and 21% in June. This resulted in an average decline for the second quarter of 32%. While trends have naturally varied some by market, these are generally representative of what we\u2019ve experienced around the globe. A notable call out is Latin America, where consistent with macro headlines, the business has generally lagged the recovery elsewhere. To put that in context, this region represents approximately 5% of our revenue. In North America, we saw a year-on-year decline of 36% in April, 37% in May, and 22% in June. Our core storage business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability, has demonstrated its durability as we continue to grow organic storage rental revenue during the pandemic. As a reminder, the stability of this business is built on the fact that over 97% of our annual storage revenue is generated by boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. And now turning to enterprise results for the second quarter, revenue of $982 million decreased 7.9% on a reported basis year-on-year, reflecting service declines as well as the stronger dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 5.6%. Total organic revenue declined 7.2%. Organic service revenue declined 23.1% reflecting the COVID impact. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% supported by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.3% to $343 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA was in line with last year, despite a $58 million revenue decline. During the second quarter, we incurred $9 million of costs as a result of COVID-19 for items such as PPE and specialized cleaning of our facilities, which have been excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 34.9%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix. Adjusted EPS was $0.22 compared to $0.23 in the second quarter of 2019. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our commentary last quarter. AFFO was $249 million, up 19% year-over-year. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the increase in AFFO was primarily driven by tax refund. Turning to segment performance, starting with the global RIM organization. In the second quarter records management experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 45% for new boxes inbounded and 43% for retrievals and refiles. Permanent withdrawals declined 34% and destructions were down 1%. Data management saw less of an impact with activity down 10%. Our global digital solutions business has continued to perform well with revenue consistent year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Given the diverse mix of products and services in this business, we use revenue as the best indicator of activity. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 24%, which has also resulted in lower paper tonnage. The industry saw an increase in the price for recycled paper in April and May, which we believe was partially the result of elevated consumer purchases of paper products. For the second quarter, our average realized price was 15% higher than the prior year, which was a $2 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Prices continued to be volatile with sequential declines in June and July. The consumer storage business has seen an increase in demand and performed ahead of our expectations. These service activity levels contributed to a total organic revenue decline of 7.5% in the global RIM business. The decline was partially offset by storage volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management. In the second quarter, we took aggressive actions including furloughs and reduced work hours which helped bring costs more in line with activity levels. Naturally, we also experienced a level of fixed costs deleverage. As these cost actions are temporary in nature and distinct from Project Summit, we continue to expect them to come back as revenue recovers. Our global RIM business delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 240 basis points to 43.8%. This improvement was driven by Project Summit, revenue management and favorable next. Turning to Global Data Center, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 7.6% driven by strong leasing in prior periods and low churn of 80 basis points. This was partially offset by a mark-to-market decline in Phoenix resulting from an early contract renewal of a large legacy I/O customer. Global Data Center\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% represents an increase of 140 basis points consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion as our platform scales. As Bill noted, the data center team delivered very strong bookings in the first half of the year signing almost 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases including pre-leasing 100% of our Frankfurt facility currently under development. As we have said before, we are reviewing potential third-party capital options, particularly related to stabilized assets, and we will keep you updated in the second half. Turning to our adjacent businesses, the fine arts industry has continued to experience the impact of COVID and we have seen activity down approximately 85%. On the other hand, our entertainment services business has shown resilience as activity has remained in line with pre-COVID levels. As to Project Summit, in the second quarter we recognized $39 million of restructuring charges and an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $40 million. Through the first half, we have delivered $65 million of benefit. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit of $150 million and restructuring charges of $240 million in 2020. This keeps us on pace to deliver $375 million of expected total program benefits exiting 2021. And turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the second quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement of nearly 4 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables\u2019 days and days sales outstanding. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term. With the COVID backdrop, I think the team\u2019s performance, particularly on cash collections was very strong. Despite a decline in revenue, our cash collections were up year-on-year in June. I will note that given the pandemics\u2019 impact on the macro-economy, we took a prudent view regarding receivables and increased our bad debt expense in the quarter. I\u2019d like to briefly expand on the recent bond offering that Bill mentioned. We appreciate the investment community\u2019s strong support which resulted in our ability to upsize the transaction in June to $2.4 billion. This leverage neutral offering increased our weighted average maturity by almost 2 years while only modestly increasing our cost of debt. In the second quarter, we recognized debt extinguishment charges of approximately $17 million related to a write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call premiums. Due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes, at quarter end we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet. We paid off that note on July 2, and as a result, we anticipate recording an additional $15 million of debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter. Pro forma for this payoff, we had $1.2 billion of liquidity, which provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. We have been able to maintain liquidity at this level since April even while continuing to fund innovation and growth initiatives as well as supporting our sustainable dividend. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times, which takes into account certain adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.6 times, which would represent a slight decline year-on-year as we make progress toward our long-term leverage range. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. Now, let me provide an update as to our expectations for the remainder of the year. With the impact of COVID, we are planning for reported revenue to be down less than 5% for the full year compared to 2019. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates of approximately $75 million for revenue and almost $25 million for adjusted EBITDA as compared to last year. Turning to our expectations for our Storage and Service businesses, for the full year we currently expect a decline in net organic storage volume of 1% to 1.5%. We expect reported storage rental revenue in the second half to grow on year-on-year at a rate that approaches what we delivered in the second quarter. As to Service, our July activity levels were down 24% globally. We are currently planning for third-quarter activity to be consistent with what we experienced in July. This implies a service revenue decline in high-teens year-on-year in the third quarter. With an expectation for a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter, we are planning for full-year service revenue declines in the mid-teens. We are approaching adjusted EBITDA margins with a level of conservatism and plan for both the third and fourth quarters to be flat to slightly up year-on-year. This would result in us delivering full-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion slightly above 100 basis points relative as to last year, which reflects an improvement as compared to our comments on our last call. This reflects our solid first-half performance benefits from revenue management Project Summit and other cost actions, as well as a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. Turning to capital expenditures, we have increased our full-year expectation to approximately $525 million or an increase of $50 million from the midpoint of our previous outlook. You should expect this increase to be evenly split between recurring CapEx and data center growth investment, given the better-than-expected performance in the core business, as well as our growing data center pipeline. As to AFFO, the team is focused on delivering at a level approaching last year\u2019s results, including the benefit of our second quarter tax refund. As it relates to capital recycling, our outlook has not changed. We continue to expect to generate proceeds of approximately $100 million this year. As we look at the back half, we have a strong pipeline of transactions and continue to see attractive valuations with historically low cap rates in the industrial real estate market. While second quarter was a challenging one for our Service business, we are confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our Storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results they have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our third quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Right. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, you mentioned that you had launched some new solutions for your customers in the quarter that helped recover some of your sales losses. So I\u2019m wondering if you could maybe provide a little more color on what type solutions you\u2019re offering and any impact you think that could have? And then, I guess, just one follow-up, on the data center build out, you have mentioned that you were looking at third-party capital options. I\u2019m wondering if that facility is related to the Frankfurt lease or if there are potentially other assets that you could look to potentially a joint venture. Thanks. William Meaney : Okay. I\u2019ll let Barry answer the last one in more detail. I think the answer to \u2013 the short answer to your question is, yeah, we continue to like the idea of third-party capital for stabilized assets. But I\u2019ll let Barry give you a full answer on that. On the first one, in terms \u2013 so, thanks for the question, Eric, on innovation and the importance of that, not just in a post-COVID world, but absolutely in the current environment. We continue to see traction on some of the things I highlighted last time in terms of what I call remote collaboration and collaborating remotely. Like I gave the example last time I think on unemployment benefits, where we\u2019re actually facilitating folks to be able to be working away from home and both receive the application for unemployment and approve it, and then, also some of the areas around mailroom which, again, I think I highlighted last time. One area I would add in addition to that, so we continue to see more and more traction for those kinds of solutions. One area too that we\u2019ve seen, a good uptick in the recent past is what we call our Clean Start program. And the Clean Start program is something that we launched a year ago, which is really helping people to re-imagine their needs to their office space, and get information flows to be more seamless when they\u2019re at work, and then, also to get things off site for things that they don\u2019t need around the office and it allows them to work in a much more flexible way. When we came into COVID that actually got \u2013 the brakes got put on that, because part of the Clean Start was, we would go into offices and do surveys and help \u2013 working with their real estate people to help them re-imagine and rebuild their work processes. And some of that, the exhaust of that process, obviously, is storage, but also some of the other services that we provide is Iron Mountain. When we got into the crisis, our real estate team product management, sales and marketing team collaborated and they created a Clean Start kit in a box, if you will. So what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve been able to put that together in a kit that allows us to deliver the same type of assessment in survey virtually without actually going into their offices. And we just recently, for instance, had a very large win with a global insurance company that was selling part of its insurance portfolio to a life insurance company, where we not only did facilitated moving sensitive records, many containing PII or Personally Identifiable Information across to that new owner of those policies and that information, but transfer a number of their employees across and at the same time help them repurpose the real estate footprint that they were left with. So it was kind of real estate optimization, helping them transfer a business to another person, transfer of people and then take a step back and say how can we actually improve the information flow in what they have left. So it just gives you another flavor of the types of things that we\u2019re finding out there. Barry Hytinen : And, Eric, hey, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. Just to add a little bit on to Bill\u2019s comments there, earlier in the year, we noted that we were going to pause our third-party capital. Look, as we were working through the pre-leasing activity, we noted that the pipeline was very attractive, specifically on Frankfurt. Obviously, the team did a phenomenal job in the quarter with that and as well as broader data center business. So we are looking at third-party capital, Frankfurt in particular. But I would never say never as it relates to other stabilized assets. We think it\u2019s an attractive way to improve returns for the company and we see a lot of opportunity there. I would say that implied in your question was the comment around JV. We do think that that\u2019s an attractive structure. You\u2019ve seen that done in the industry before I know. And I think at this point, what we\u2019ll say is we will come back to you quarter by quarter and give you an update as how we\u2019re progressing there. Thanks for the question. Operator : And our next question today comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Adam Walsh : Hey, this is Adam on for Shlomo. On the Services business looks like the revenue decline wasn\u2019t near as high as at least we were thinking. One, what percentage of the client facilities are accessible to the company\u2019s services business? And two, how much did the paper price \u2013 increased paper price has offset the volume decline in the shredding business in the quarter? William Meaney : Oh, okay. Hey, Adam. Thanks for the question. A couple of points there, I would say, look, our service business performed better throughout \u2013 in the quarter than we had anticipated. As you know, on the last call, we noted that we thought we\u2019d use April as a proxy going forward for the entire second quarter. April and May, generally speaking, really across the world and across our various service activity lines were very consistent. Shred was down kind of high 20%s in April, about 30% in May. It also recovered just like directionally the rest of the business was down in the vicinity of 10% on activity basis in June and kind of stayed at that level in July. I would say that, that trajectory of improvement in June, as I noted, was really pervasive across all of our activities. As it relates to paper price, in particular, the way I would think about this, Adam, is on our last call, we were \u2013 well, in the first quarter, we had a $10 million hit to EBITDA from paper prices, as you recall. In \u2013 on our last call, we thought that we would have kind of low- to mid-single-digit dollar decline as a result of paper price for each of the next couple of quarters. We actually had a $2 million positive to EBITDA as I mentioned on the call. Now, I will say that paper prices have been very volatile and have been declining quite significantly over the last couple of months, you\u2019ve probably seen that in the industry data, I know you follow that. And so our view for the back half is that it will be basically neutral year-on-year as it relates to EBITDA. So thanks for the question, Adam. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on what percentage of the new data center leasing is from existing Iron Mountain customers? Just more details on synergies there. And if you can comment on how the global sales relationship strategy might be going? Barry Hytinen : Okay. Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, as we look at this quarter is most of the sales were from relative \u2013 either from new logos or hyperscalers that were the first time deploying in a hyperscale way, if you know what I mean. In other words, we \u2013 most of the hyperscalers, we were serving in some aspects, but not necessarily in large hyperscale deployment. I think overall, though, if you look at our pipeline, I would say that whilst it\u2019s right to say on \u2013 in terms of volume, that we would sell this, that one hyperscaler, you can kind of skew what that looks like is we\u2019re still seeing a good mix. So I think last quarter, we were approaching back up to about 50% from kind of existing Iron Mountain or existing data center customers. This quarter, it was a little bit lower, especially if you use the filter I\u2019m saying, breaking the hyperscalers into 2 buckets. But \u2013 overall, I think we still continue to see the pipeline, I think that some of the new logos that I highlighted, that we brought in this time were because of existing Iron Mountain relationships and say our data management business and the type of cross selling that you would see. But if you look at specifically this quarter, what we\u2019re most excited about this quarter is that, we think, we\u2019re beginning to be established in the deal flow, if you will, for hyperscale deployment. In other words, hyperscalers know that we\u2019re out there, and we see \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the RFIs, just like everybody else, so we\u2019re pretty excited. So this quarter was kind of skewed, I would say to kind of newish customers. But overall, the pipeline is still kind of in that 50% level. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hey, good morning, guys. A couple of questions. For the organic storage revenue, it was up 2.3%. Kind of wondering if you could speak to that a bit. How much of that growth is coming from data centers now? How much is coming from the rest? And have you had any pushback on pricing increases during COVID? And then on the DCs, I\u2019m just wondering, do you worry that if you start doing JVs for the DCs that you\u2019re going to get less credit for this growing business? Barry Hytinen : Hey, Nate. This is Barry. Thanks for your both questions. So data center contributed 40 basis points to that number. So it really speaks to the fact that it\u2019s a nice contributor, and we expect obviously that to ramp over time as that is, as you know, a big focus for the company. We see a long-term trajectory for continued growth there. And, as I said earlier, the team is just doing really well. And that also speaks, I think, to the fact that our records management business continues to see nice growth and revenue management really contributing very, very well. As it relates to credit, as it relates to structure, I think it\u2019s a little premature to talk too much about what we do there. As it relates to third-party capital, we know that we\u2019re just evaluating but as it relates to stabilized assets, we do think that where various rates are in terms of certain folks that are willing to invest in this kind of market, it makes for very enhanced returns. And we think it\u2019s also another opportunity to help fuel incremental growth. Bill, did you have anything you want to add? William Meaney : Yeah. The only thing, Nate, I would add on the pricing side, because I think your question, regarding your questions a little bit, in this environment, do you still \u2013 are you still seeing the same stickiness? The thing that \u2013 we knew that we were an essential business based on government authorities. As I said, even at the peak, we were 96% of our facilities were open around the globe. Now it\u2019s 100%. But the one thing that we\u2019ve seen is that we\u2019ve been able to continue to get the price increases that we expected, our customers really see us as essential as well. And that was further reinforced. I think, Barry highlighted in his introductory remarks that in the month of June, not only the DSOs go down year-on-year, but the month of June with lower sales, we collected more cash than we did June last year. So in other words, people really do see that our services are essential to keep their businesses up and running. So we haven\u2019t seen any really noise around the price increases that we were able to achieve last year in the current environment. Barry Hytinen : Thanks for the questions, Nate. Operator : Our next question today comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. I\u2019ve got couple of questions on the data center side, if you could maybe comment on Amsterdam and then Singapore, each of which have seen some non-COVID-related pauses or freezes in terms of new permitting, and may or may not affect you equally in both markets, but just it has had some impact on your competitors. And is there kind of any sort of an update as to the lifting of these pauses in each of those metros. Thanks. William Meaney : Thanks, Jon. It\u2019s good to hear this morning. So I think first of all, the market extreme \u2013 both of those markets extremely well. So first on Singapore, we\u2019re continuing to keep an eye on it, because, as you probably realize, we\u2019re tracking on a track that we\u2019re going to be sold out in Singapore pretty soon. So you\u2019re right that the government has put a pause on it. We have heard the \u2013 it just so happens that our head of Asia data centers is a Singaporean based in Singapore. So he stays pretty close to the government. We are seeing that the government seems to be making noises to relax that a little bit sooner than they initially guided, say, a year ago. So we\u2019re optimistic. And obviously we\u2019re starting to or have been for a number of months now looking at how we could actually expand our footprint in Singapore. As I said the \u2013 we\u2019re well on track to fill out the old Credit Suisse data center fairly soon. On Amsterdam, interesting, we have actually quite a bit of land permitted. So we\u2019ve been less engaged with the government trying to relax that. On the other side, it\u2019s exactly as you said is, we\u2019ve seen even a number of people who have their own data centers in the Amsterdam market, for instance, coming in and starting to look to add capacity in our facilities, because of the permitting issue that you\u2019ve described. And obviously, Amsterdam is a highly connected market in our facility as a high level of connectivity within it. So it\u2019s actually playing through our strength, because we have the capacity in \u2013 but the rest of the market is constrained. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on Project Summit, how it\u2019s going versus your expectations. And for the $65 million benefit realized thus far, where are those savings come from? And what are some of the sources of the future savings? And one last one for Barry. What was the tax refund related to just more detail on that? William Meaney : Okay, Sheila. Good morning and thanks for those questions. First off, we feel great about how Summit is doing. I think, the team is very aligned and they\u2019re very focused on delivering. I think the total company is energized by the fact that this is really an opportunity to transform the company and support our customers that much better. In terms of how it\u2019s stacking up, the second quarter of $40 million benefit year-on-year was right in line, if not a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. So we\u2019re at $65 million year-to-date, obviously, those are elevated levels as compared to what we were expecting earlier as we increase the benefit this year last quarter. So we\u2019re well on track to deliver $150 million of benefit this year. My guess is that next year, we will have another $150 million to $200 million of incremental benefit. And we\u2019ll exit next year at a run rate that has all of the benefits the entire $375 million by 2022. So a little small amount of incremental benefit there in 2022 to plan for your models in terms of where it\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s generally been thus far, probably in the vicinity of 70%, 75% from SG&A and the balance and cost of sales. You\u2019ll notice you\u2019re looking at our performance this quarter, our cost of sales, obviously, down a lot more and that reflects the fact that we made those temporary cost cuts that we talked about in the form of furloughs and et cetera. Going forward, I think, you\u2019ll see even more of Summit coming from a more balanced approach across the income statement. As initially as Bill, as commented before, the first rounds of summit were really in the SG&A area. There will be more going forward. But I think as a relative basis, sort of last quarter, we talked some about the SLA changes, which by the way, are going very, very well. Those will continue to stack incremental benefits going forward. And some of that, obviously, will be in the cost of sales line. As it relates to the tax refund, I think that was the last question. We did have about $27 million of cash refunds in the quarter as compared to prior year. Last year, we actually paid more on a cash basis. So if you\u2019re looking at AFFO, it\u2019s almost a $35 million swing year-on-year. That\u2019s one time. And we \u2013 those are for prior-year refunds that we received during the quarter. So thanks for those questions, Sheila. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Funk with BoA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Funk : Yeah, thank you for the question, guys. Good morning. William Meaney : Good morning. Michael Funk : A couple if I could, can you comment some more on the churn that you\u2019re seeing? Any kind of update on the monthly progression for customer churn? William Meaney : Yeah, I didn\u2019t quite get the question, Michael. It was a customer churn on data center or customer churn in the records business? Michael Funk : Yeah, sorry about that, on the records business, please. William Meaney : On the records business, yeah. So, look, the customer churn is actually we think a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that\u2019s when I made the comment in my introductory remarks that when we kind of normalize in a post-COVID world on one side, we would expect a pause. In other words, we don\u2019t expect the same drag on incoming volume, but on permanent withdrawals is that we saw a downtick in this quarter, because people are not in the office or making active decisions to actually withdraw. So we expected to kind of revert back to the normal levels. But if you kind of look at overall volume, I think the question behind your question is, what do we think is going to happen to volume when we get out of COVID. So on one side we would expect permanent withdrawals to go up, back to normalized levels. But on the other side is we would expect the incoming volume from our customers to come back up. And so that gives you kind of a bit of science around that if it\u2019s helpful. Let\u2019s first of all, kind of anchor on what we see with our customers right now in this environment in terms of activity. So last week when I was in New York, in New Jersey, and had to catch up with one evening with the President and Chief Operating Officer of a large global bank that\u2019s based in New York. And we were comparing notes on how many people come back to the office, et cetera. And what he shared with me is that at the depth of the crisis, say, in April, they had less than 3% of their workforce coming into the office. And whether you\u2019re standing \u2013 when I was meeting with them last week in July, they had invited 20% of the people to come back, and only 6% came back. And you\u2019re probably seeing similar things in BAML. So then, let\u2019s kind of say, how is that translated in the activity we see in terms of incoming boxes; when I say that, where are we going to end when we have COVID in the rearview mirror? So if we look at incoming boxes in April, so if you remember, like in their case, only 3% of their people, less than 3% of their people were coming into the office. We were down 58% in North America. If I\u2019m just taking North America as an example as that is a proxy, we\u2019re down 58% on incoming box volume. If we look at the quarter, as Barry mentioned, we\u2019re down about 47% overall in North America in terms of incoming box. Now, if you looked at July, we\u2019re down about 38%. So basically July is about a 20% improvement from what we saw on average in Q2. So if we were down, say, 4 million, 4.5 million cubic feet, due to \u2013 in Q2 from our records management business, or net, we said minus 3.8 million cubic feet, we were 4.5 million cubic feet worse than normal. But let\u2019s say, we were down negative 3.8 million cubic feet, then we would say that based on a 20% \u2013 the 20% improvement that we\u2019ve seen in July is worst-case scenario. You project that forward is we\u2019re down about 3 million cubic feet a quarter, right? So that\u2019s 12 million cubic feet on an annualized basis. Now, we don\u2019t expect it to plateau at these levels, obviously, because we\u2019re still only running it in financial services, less than 6% of the people that are coming to work. But with \u2013 even if we plateau at the current levels, we\u2019re seeing is you\u2019d be a 12 million annual drag, a negative 12 million annual drag on our records management business in terms of physical storage. And that\u2019s before adding consumer back in. So when you net it all out is that worst case, especially with the offset that we get from consumer, is that we think that adding, our normal price of 2% to 3%, it\u2019s manageable, where the most likely scenario is we\u2019ll continue to see improvement, people will start \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to stay at 6% of the workforce coming to the office, it will go back up. And that\u2019s why we said in our remarks is we expect in a post-COVID world is will be kind of flattish to slightly up in the records management business, and then consumer will drive additional growth on top of that. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session and today\u2019s conference call.

Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website. We will also be providing the links to today\u2019s webcast and our materials. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO, and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO.  Today we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we are continuing to respond and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, continuing to demonstrate top line resilience in our physical storage business, continuing to see strength in our data center business, progressing on our transformation program with Project Summit, and how we are remaining committed to funding innovation and new product development. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements. We have noted the impacts from COVID-19 and our expectations of how that may impact our operations and financial performance in 2020. We have also noted our expectations for Project Summit as well as certain other comments on our expectations for the remainder of the year. As you all know, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K and other periodic SEC filings for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included a reconciliation to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin? William Meaney : Thank you Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. The third quarter provided us with a great opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months in response to the pandemic and set a marker for outperformance through top line resilience in our physical storage and growing data center businesses, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record all while continuing our investment in innovation and new product development. I would like to thank all of our Mountaineers for this remarkable performance and for their steadfast focus on safety and execution. Despite lingering uncertainty related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen improvements, albeit gradual, in key U.S. and international markets as it relates to our service activity levels while showing continued strong performance in both our physical storage business and our global data center business. I continue to be inspired by the tireless efforts of our teams as they support and care for our customers, each other, and our communities whilst accelerating progress on our strategic priorities. From the start, we set our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and take care of the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our customers. In April, we had up to one-third of our workforce out on furlough or other temporary leave. I\u2019m happy to report that we have brought a significant number of these Mountaineers back to work to serve our customers and we now have over 90% of our employees working regularly. Whilst this has been a very difficult time, we have proven to be very resilient. We are financially healthy with strong and reliable cash flow driven in part by our brand and customer loyalty. This was evident in how we\u2019ve managed the heightened uncertainty of the past eight months.  We quickly aligned on the right mix of priorities to maintain strong near term momentum whilst continuing our investments in innovation and new products as we execute our plan for long term value creation. This combined with the benefits from Project Summit has allowed us to continue to invest in transforming and modernizing our company. As demonstrated by our year-on-year constant currency year-to-date adjusted EBITDA in storage revenue growth, we can already see the evidence supporting our belief that we will emerge from this pandemic as a stronger company on all dimensions.  Clearly, there are still many uncertainties around COVID in terms of the development of the pandemic and how the governments worldwide will continue to respond with varying degrees of restrictions as infections rise. However, in the third quarter we saw signs of improvement in customer trends and as a result, the decline of our service revenue moderated.  In addition, there is clear evidence that as and when the restrictions lift, customers do come back to us with needs from both a physical and digital document storage perspective, and while some elements of our business may have changed forever, our positioning with the communities we serve remains strong. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to adapt and transform our business model and solutions to changing customer needs due to challenges created by COVID-19. Our customers are evaluating their real estate needs, business processes, and ways to increase digitization in a remote workplace setting. We have been focused on helping them navigate these challenges and have tasked ourselves with accelerating our response to our customers\u2019 needs. One thing is certain - the pandemic has created opportunities for us to help our customers in new and innovative ways.  The fact is we\u2019re a different company than the one most people know. The strategic journey we have been on has driven this change, and to remind folks, our focus remains on three pillars : first, continue growing physical storage revenue through pricing as well as new volume growth achieved from records growth in emerging markets and art and consumer storage in developed markets; second, utilizing our global scale as well as 70 years of customer trust to deliver a differentiated data center offering; and third, new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management in a more complex regulatory environment and one in which hybrid, physical and digital solutions are the norm. Further expanding on the product and services pillar, most know us for protecting highly regulated records, but over the years our relationships have evolved to help customers manage a broader set of assets and to help them solve a broader range of problems. As customers\u2019 needs evolve, their expectations with us evolve. For this reason, it is important we continue to invest in creating solutions that unlock value for our customers. A great example of this is a solution we just provided for a U.S. credit union who needed a faster, more efficient method for processing their members\u2019 mortgage loans after closing. Their old process was too manual and it could no longer support the volume of work, much less scale to meet the credit union\u2019s 30% year-over-year growth projection, and it didn\u2019t satisfy increased regulations the organization must now meet when selling their loans. We rebuilt the customer\u2019s workflow to better integrate their mix of paper and digital loan materials. This included mailroom services, document scanning, and private vault with fire resistant safeguards in defensible, secure disposition. We also applied machine learning to automate how the credit union accessed data, verified its accuracy, and resolved missing or incorrect items. With these changes, the credit union can now process post-close mortgage loans much faster, more than doubling their capacity whilst reducing their costs by 25%. This example speaks to what we see as our differentiation and why customers ultimately call us when they need help. For some time, we have talked about our opportunity to enable our customers\u2019 digital transformation journeys. Initially, much of this work was going on behind the scenes, especially as Project Summit got underway, putting in place the systems and structures to support this transformation. The benefits of this work are now becoming more evident with notable improvements to our customer experience at a time when demand for our solution has never been greater. This materialized in the third quarter and high single growth in our digital solutions business.  If you look at our physical storage business, this remains a key foundation for Iron Mountain. Customers have long trusted us to secure their information and their assets that matter most to them. They needed us to serve as their lock, if you will. But over time whilst their needs expanded beyond security and compliance, their jobs grew more complex as they now had to store, use and extract value from growing amounts of information that was in both physical and digital form. They hybrid nature of their data was preventing them from achieving speed, compliance, efficiency, and ultimately growth.  A lock was no longer enough. They now needed a key to solve for this hybrid environment. Uniquely, Iron Mountain offers both the lock and the key that organizations need in order to realize competitive advantage from their paper and digital information.  Plenty of companies offer a secure home for valued assets; plenty offer technology services so customers can better use those assets. But this over-specialization falls short of the needs of most customers. We hear from our customers that they want partners who can help them build singular solutions capable of solving for multiple demands of speed, cost savings, revenue opportunities, and security. This is Iron Mountain\u2019s distinctive position. We serve as the lock and the key.  Now let\u2019s take a closer look at business trends during the third quarter. At a high level, we are pleased with the stabilization and early recovery we\u2019re beginning to see across our service business. Service activity levels have shown a gradual improvement from the second quarter; however, similar to what we discussed last quarter, the shape of the recovery will be dependent on macro factors. The recent increases in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world has focused states and countries to implement new restrictions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Whilst these factors will make the recovery uneven, our experienced management team is prepared to competently manage the volatility. Turning now to our physical storage business, total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated modestly from last quarter, up 2.5%. This once again was driven by strong revenue management results as well as growth in our emerging markets and consumer. We continue to be very encouraged with the levels of organic storage revenue growth underscoring the durability of the physical storage business in supporting strong cash generation. Total global organic volume increased 2 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this was a 3 million cubic foot increase in consumer and other and fine art storage, partly offset by a decrease in records management volume.  Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 1.1 million cubic feet compared to the second quarter. Whilst still in decline, this is a significant improvement from the 3.9 million cubic foot decline last quarter, again reflecting the early signs of recovery. We continue to expect the full year organic volume to be down 1% to 1.5% and up 2.5% in terms of organic revenue based on current visibility. Turning now to our global data center segment, we are very encouraged by another strong quarter of bookings. In Q3, we leased 12.3 megawatts, bringing the year-to-date total to just over 51 megawatts. The strong leasing this year, particularly among smaller deployments, has resulted in an increase in our utilization by more than seven points to nearly 92%. Given the need for additional capacity, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately 50 megawatts, consisting of both greenfield development and further build-out of existing facilities. Moreover, in excess of 50% of our development is preleased, resulting in a strong backlog. Let me now provide a brief update on Project Summit. Our transformation program is progressing well and we are on track to realize our permanent structural cost savings of $375 million per year exiting next year. As you saw in our press release this morning, we now expect to be able to generate greater adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 as we have accelerated some initiatives. Most notably, these ongoing initiatives should not only significantly reduce our cost base but also make it easier for our Mountaineers to get work done, enabling them to focus on a more customer-centric approach. Some examples include driving global standardization in IT, replacing cumbersome manual processes with reliable automation, and improving the user experience whilst reducing process cycle time. We are as excited about the systems and process improvements that are Project Summit as we are about the bottom line improvement and believe the end result will be an enhanced value proposition for our customers and communities.  As we shared with you last quarter, we are strongly committed to all of our stakeholders. We are focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to continue on our path and accelerate improving our diversity and inclusion. In order to be a sustainable and successful company, we need to attract the best talent to drive maximum creativity through diverse and innovative thinking. I am proud to say we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s 2020 Corporate Equality Index. This recognition reinforces the important work we are doing and supports our goal of building and promoting an inclusive culture that encourages our employees to bring their whole authentic selves into the workplace. As we look at our business going forward, we see opportunities as well as risks, and we are making every effort to ensure we are well placed to maximize the opportunities. We are cautious about our expectation of the pace of market recovery as we progress through 2021. In our own business, as we have shared with you on previous calls, we expect the gradual recovery in our service business to continue as economic activity recovers, leading 2021 to look similar to 2020, just in reverse in terms of quarterly progression. The work we are doing and have done to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 gives us confidence that we will come out of this positioned to consistently deliver long term, sustainable growth. In summary, we are leveraging the opportunity in this rapidly changing environment to reaffirm our commitment tour strategy of growth through increased product offerings in the physical storage area as well as continued rapid growth in our data center and digitization areas. At the same time, we continue to exercise prudent cost control and drive further efficiency across the organizations through our transformation activities. We are proud of the progress we have made towards our transformative shift during this crisis. We are now even more enthusiastic about the speed of our future transformation given the lessons we have learned during the pandemic. I hope you all remain well, and with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. Revenue of $1.04 billion declined 2.4% on a reported basis year-on-year, which includes a 30 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 13.5%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. While the pace of recovery continues to be dependent on many factors, overall we continue to see service declines moderate, reflecting an improving trajectory since the April-May time frame. For the full quarter, service trends were generally consistent with the July levels we discussed on our last call. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% driven by three points of revenue management and data center growth, partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in global organic volume on a trailing 12-month basis. This is a 30 basis point improvement as compared to the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis.  Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points year-on-year to 35.7%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management, and favorable mix while partially offset by fixed cost deleverage on lower service revenue and higher bonus compensation accrual.  In addition, in the third quarter we incurred incremental cost to keep our team safe, for example specialized cleaning of our facilities as well as purchases of personal protective equipment. We included these expenses in our adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EPS was $0.31, down a penny from last year. AFFO declined 5.4% to $213 million. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the decline in AFFO was primarily driven by timing of cash taxes consistent with our outlook. Turning to segment performance and starting with the global RIM organization, in the third quarter our global RIM business experienced declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year. This was partially offset by storage volume growth in our faster growing markets and revenue management, which led to a total organic revenue decline of 3.9%. That together with better than planned Project Summit benefits resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points. In the service business, we experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 31% for new boxes inbounded and 39% for retrievals and re-files. We also continued to see a slowdown on the outgoing side as permanent withdrawals declined 28% and destructions were down 22%. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 17%.  For the third quarter, our average realized paper price was 20% higher than the prior year, which was more than offset by a decline in paper tonnage, leading to a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. As we projected on our last call, after the temporary spike in recycled paper prices in April and May, prices have taken a step down and by October, paper prices have now returned to the low levels experienced at the end of 2019. Our consumer storage business has maintained momentum and continues to be a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. In the third quarter, we continued cost reduction actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, albeit at much lower levels than earlier in the year. As service revenue expectations improve, we want to ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level so we can always support our customers. As we have discussed before, this does tend to cause incremental cost de-leverage as we bring back employees ahead of demand. We think this is the right investment to service our customers. Turning to global data center, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 12.1% driven by prior period leasing and strong service revenue growth. This was partially offset by moderate churn of 160 basis points, in line with our target of 1% to 2% per quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting slightly elevated levels of churn compared to our normal target range. In the quarter, we booked a non-recurring revenue adjustment of $1.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% was consistent with our first half trend. As Bill noted, our data center team continued to deliver strong bookings momentum, signing over 12 megawatts of new and expansion leases, bringing year-to-date bookings of 51 megawatts. This commercial success resulted in us exceeding our previous full year target through the first nine months. For the full year, we expect to deliver more than 55 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, representing bookings growth of 45%. Of course, that includes the significant hyperscale lease in Frankfurt, and excluding that we would expect bookings growth of about 23%. This compares to our original guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts, or mid-teens booking growth. We believe we are growing considerably faster than the broader market. Going into next year, we feel good about the state of our pipeline both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail co-location business supporting rich ecosystems across our platform. We believe we can lease in excess of 20 megawatts next year, which would result in mid-teens annual bookings growth. In October, we announced the formation of our joint venture with AGC Equity Partners, a great than \u20ac300 million partnership for our fully preleased data center in Frankfurt. This venture represents an important strategic step towards our goal of identifying alternative sources of capital to fund accelerating growth as we expect proceeds will be redeployed into higher return development opportunities. As we have previously disclosed, the venture will be reflected as an unconsolidated joint venture and therefore will not flow through to revenue and EBITDA. Turning to Project Summit, in the third quarter we recognized $48 million of restructuring charges as well as an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $48 million. Through the first nine months, we have delivered $113 million of benefit. This is ahead of our prior expectations as we accelerated certain initiatives in 2020 with a particular focus on the highest return activities in response to COVID-19. As Bill referred to, we now expect the program to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, approximately $150 million more in 2021, with the full program generating $375 million exiting 2021. In terms of costs related to Project Summit, we now expect to spend closer to $200 million in 2020. We continue to expect the cost to implement the full program to be approximately $450 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are operating from a position of significant balance sheet strength. In the third quarter, our team did a nice job delivering further cash cycle improvement with solid performance in both payables days and days sales outstanding. On a sequential basis, cash cycle improved by a full day as a result of continued DSO improvement. In August, the team executed another successful bond refinancing, issuing $1.1 billion to redeem our most restrictive outstanding debt and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. The continued strong support received from the fixed income community provided us the opportunity to upsize our transaction while printing the lowest coupon for 10-year notes in the company\u2019s history. Taken together with our bond offerings in June, we issued $3.5 billion of new debt on a leverage-neutral basis, increased our weighted average maturity by over two years to nearly eight years, while only modestly increasing our weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, these new bonds are more in line with our REIT peers as they include a fixed charge coverage ratio as opposed to a debt to EBITDA covenant. Also, I think it is worth noting that we have eliminated all of our 6.5 times leverage covenant bonds, meaning our most restrictive bond covenant is now 7 times debt to EBITDA.  At quarter end, we had $1.7 billion of liquidity. As a reminder, at the end of the second quarter, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes from the June bond offering. We paid off the notes in early July, leaving us with a cash balance at September 30 of $152 million. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, which takes into account adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.5 times, which would represent an improvement year-on-year as we make progress towards our long term leverage range. With our strong financial position, our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. Turning to capital expenditures, our full year expectation is now approximately $450 million, or a decrease of $75 million, reflecting development capital for our Frankfurt data center that will now be a part of our venture with AGC.  Now let me share a few thoughts as to our capital allocation strategy. First, we are committed to our dividend at this sustainable level and over time, we expect to glide into our targeted AFFO payout ratio of mid-60%. Second, we are committed to our target long term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times on a net lease adjusted basis. This year, the team has made good progress toward our target. As investors know, we have been allocating significant capital to our data center business for several years, and as our pipeline continues to build with high return investment opportunities, our strategic intent is to increase the amount of capital we dedicate to the business. With that, we have considered options to generate incremental funds for investment.  We view capital recycling as a good means to monetize certain assets, particularly industrial real estate to increasingly invest in our development pipeline. Industrial cap rate are at historically low levels, and we have the opportunity to structure long term leases on favorable terms that effectively allow us to have control of the facilities, whether we lease or own. With that, in the third quarter our team accessed the market and monetized two facilities for proceeds of approximately $110 million. This brings our year-to-date proceeds to nearly $120 million, ahead of our full year target of $100 million. With the highly favorable market backdrop together with our development pipeline, we are planning to recycle relatively more going forward, albeit what will amount to a small portion of our total industrial assets. Similarly, we view selling stabilized data center assets into a joint venture as analogous to monetizing industrial real estate assets - it represents another source of capital to redeploy into development projects. The joint venture we just announced in Frankfurt is a good example of this strategy. The JV provides us with an opportunity to boost returns on stabilized assets and provides incremental capital to allocate to projects in the development phase. Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, while we are not issuing official guidance today, I would like to provide an update as to our expectations excluding any material and unforeseen changes With the continued impact of COVID, we are planning for the fourth quarter to be generally in line with the third quarter for revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a dollar basis, therefore for the full year 2020, this would lead to a low single digit revenue decline and flat to slightly positive adjusted EBITDA growth as compared to last year. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates approaching $60 million for revenue and $20 million for adjusted EBITDA. This outlook reflects our solid year-to-date performance, benefits from revenue management, accelerated Project Summit savings, and incorporates a cautious view for the fourth quarter. Given our favorable results, we now expect AFFO growth to be up low single digits for the full year. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our prior commentary. When we look ahead to 2021, as you would expect, until we get COVID-19 behind us, naturally it is difficult to provide guidance, though we are committed to providing the investment community with additional commentary on our trajectory and underlying business trends, just as we\u2019ve been doing throughout this year. While the challenges for our service business persist, we remain confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results we have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much. I just actually wanted to ask a little bit about the Frankfurt JV. Can you talk a little bit about how much do you cash in, how much debt the entity will incur? Just trying to understand how that was structured and whether that--you know, how well you did on that and is this really the kind of structure we can expect in the future for--you know, kind of build and then maybe sale with a joint venture. Barry Hytinen : Sure, hi Shlomo. Good morning and thanks for the question. We really feel very good about the Frankfurt joint venture and what the team has done there with that fully leased up facility. We invested about $100 million at closing essentially with the deal. Over time we\u2019ll cash out nearly all of that, in fact all of it, and nearly of all that at the close. We retained over 20% retained equity interest in the venture. We will earn fees for things like property management, development and construction, and we\u2019ll take those proceeds and redeploy it into development pipeline, which has nice high return opportunities. So essentially, we see it as the opportunity to monetize essentially what is a stabilized asset, boost that return, and then redeploy. You asked about debt - yes, of course the entity would, as you\u2019re expecting, have debt on it. That debt will approximate the incremental development costs, so that might be--over time that could be as much as a couple hundred million euros. We have a very attractive rate on that debt, I might add, and we feel very good about the way the development is proceeding. Bill, anything you\u2019d like to add? William Meaney : Yes, I think we\u2019ve talked about it, Shlomo, a few times that we see that as a path that we would like to continue to follow. If you think about you have a fully stabilized data center asset, there is a lot of pension money or funds that manage pension money that are looking for mid-digit returns on an investment basis because it\u2019s a fully stabilized asset with a very long contract, and we were able to find that both on the debt and the equity side, so it just makes sense to take that money and then plow it back into higher return projects. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Nate Crossett at Berenberg. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hey, good morning guys. Just following up on the JV, I was wondering if this is something that could be opened up to future projects with them, specifically what\u2019s their appetite for further deals and why did you go with them?  My second question is on the organic storage revenue line, growth of 2.5%. How much of that growth can be attributed to data center growth, and then just on price increases, I was wondering if you\u2019re getting any pushback from customers. William Meaney : In terms of AGC, they do have an appetite for these things, and in fact they have a similar structure with a different customer in the United States, and we ran a process so I would expect that they would be interested in any further processes that we run down the path. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all for us--to see us do other things with AGC, but it will depend on the location and the opportunity. I think in terms of your question on storage revenue growth, is that it was about 1.7% if you just look at the physical storage and took out the data center, so it goes from 2.5 to 1.7, but still strong positive growth based on some of the success that we\u2019ve been having on the back of consumer, so really pleased both in terms of record management did better this quarter and also consumer is really starting to show that it\u2019s starting to hit a groove. That being said, we do expect--you know, the quarters are going to kind of go backwards and forwards a little bit because consumer is a seasonal business, but we think the trajectory is moving in the right direction for both businesses.  On the pricing side, you can see actually that we are continuing to get roughly the three points of price that Barry highlighted. We don\u2019t see any slowdown in that at all, and we have more to get in the emerging markets, which are relatively new to the game in terms of our revenue management processes, so good response from the customers. We\u2019re still considered very much an essential business or essential service to our customers, so it\u2019s a great position to be in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thank you. Not to put another question on the data center, but from an accounting perspective, will you recognize that as kind of the revenue--is that below the line or will it be reflected in the revenue and EBITDA, or is that below the line based on just the equity JV? Barry Hytinen : Good morning, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  Yes, the JV will be an unconsolidated joint venture, and so the revenue and EBITDA will not be benefited from it, and you\u2019d see it below the line, to your question. You will see a smaller amount for the management type fees that I mentioned that would flow through revenue and therefore EBITDA - that\u2019s for things like property management, construction development. I think that answers your question, thanks. Operator : The next question today comes from Sheila McGrath at Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good morning. You mentioned capital recycling as a source of capital. I was wondering if you could give us more detail - do you mean selling industrial facilities outright and relocating your boxes or are you doing sale-leaseback, and what are your capital allocation priorities for that capital besides data centers? Barry Hytinen : Hi Sheila, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  For the most part, you\u2019d be thinking about sales-leasebacks in terms of what we\u2019re talking about. The couple of opportunities we monetized in the most recent quarter were also sale-leasebacks. Frankly, we\u2019re seeing very, very strong performance from the team as it relates to cap rates in light of where the market is - think something like sub-5, even 4. Then with relatively long term leases together with options to further renew, we have the ability to effectively control those facilities, we feel like whether we lease or own them. We feel good about that monetization strategy, and then in terms of priorities, it really is into higher return IRR projects that are in the development pipeline. As you know, and you know the business really well, that\u2019s focused principally on data center but not exclusively there, and so you should expect us to continue to recycle and likely step up that activity some going forward. Sheila McGrath : Thank you. Barry Hytinen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question today comes from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Funk : Yes, thanks and good morning, and thank you for the questions. A couple, if I could. Going back to the digital transformation that you were talking about, working with customers there, can you help us think about comparing the revenue contribution from a customer transitioning to more of a digital solution versus a physical solution, and then where you see the growth opportunity there as well? William Meaney : Thanks Michael. I think first of all, it\u2019s that it\u2019s incremental, it\u2019s on top, so we don\u2019t see a lot of people saying, we\u2019re going to go digital and then stop physical. There\u2019s a few cases of that, but usually people want to keep their physical records as well for proof, but where we see the digital transformation is really around the use. So if you think, a couple of examples--or either that, use and/or further downstream processing.  So the example I gave on the call about the mortgage processing is really about downstream processing, but we also have--and we talked about that, I think, a little bit on previous calls when we changed our service level agreements and really made a push on image on demand, we\u2019ve seen one customer, for instance, in the U.K. that has fully embraced that, so they only take their retrievals now through image on demand. Any time they need a retrieval, we image it and we load it up onto the system, and they access it that way, which we--which for us, longer term, it\u2019s a higher margin business for us than having vans on the road, and honestly environmentally it\u2019s better. So really, kind of two bits. One is we\u2019re getting into more processes, quite frankly, where we weren\u2019t exposed before, so we\u2019re helping them with the downstream processes, and then the other case is people are taking advantage of our image on demand, which for us is a more efficient way to get them the information back. Operator : Thank you, and our next question today comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to dive deeper into service activity trends during and exiting the quarter. Can you provide the rate of year-over-year decline in service activity by month during 3Q and how the declines looked in October? Barry Hytinen : Sure George - hi, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  For the--if you recall in July, we mentioned that total service activities were down kind of mid to high 20s for the quarter. If you look at new boxes inbounded, they average about 31%. October is slightly below that level and September was, as you might expect, the best performance of the quarter in light of trajectory we\u2019ve been mentioning, and that really is the case for all of the other service activities - they\u2019re generally following the same trajectory.  I would say that we look at--going forward, we\u2019d use the September-October levels as being indicative of what we\u2019re expecting, and that\u2019s embedded in the forward outlook that we mentioned as it relates to third quarter and fourth quarter looking sort of similar in terms of revenue and EBITDA. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great, two questions, if I could. The first one on the data center business, wondering if you could let us know of what your leasing this quarter--the split was between more hyperscale logos versus enterprise. Typically hyperscale is lower return, so could you update us on whether your approach has changed at all, whether you\u2019re actively looking for more hyperscale business or if that\u2019s just more reflective of the market this year, and then what the targeted deals you\u2019re looking at are in the data center business and how that breaks out between those two customer segments. Then Barry, just quickly on the guidance, I know you said flat revenue and EBITDA for Q4. I\u2019m wondering if that implies--how you split that out between service and storage, should we expect service to maybe be flat to slightly down and storage up, or if there\u2019s anything to call out in Q4. Thank you. William Meaney : Thanks Eric for the question.  I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re going more for hyperscale than we\u2019ve always espoused. I think we\u2019ve always said for large campuses, we\u2019d expect somewhere between 40% and 60% of the campus to be hyperscale and the rest to be co-lo or retail, but this year it may be a little bit more noticeable because the gestation period in terms of that marketing takes a while. Our relationship as we went into data centers for sure was stronger on the enterprise side, setting up project cloud for large enterprise customers than it was on the hyperscale, so this year we\u2019re actually really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in terms of building our reputation and exposure with the hyperscale. If you look at year to date, we\u2019re about 50/50, so about 50% of that 51 megawatts that we\u2019ve signed up here to date is hyperscale, including obviously the Frankfurt site, and about 50% is retail, so we\u2019re really happy with the mix. But for sure you\u2019re right, is that the cash and cash returns on hyperscale deployments are lower, but they\u2019re longer term contracts and it allows you to build out the facilities or the campuses faster, so it still is the right mix, we think in terms of maximizing returns. Barry Hytinen : Eric, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. As it relates to fourth quarter, I would say that we\u2019re working with a modeling of service revenue decline being similar in nature Q3-Q4 versus prior year, and that\u2019s what\u2019s essentially embedded in that outlook. That should work through--you\u2019ll be able to work through the storage number. I would note that that\u2019s aligned with my answer to George earlier about where we see activity levels as being fairly consistent to slightly better. Thanks for the question. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press star then one. Today\u2019s next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much. Can you just comment a little bit about the step-up in fine arts volume? It\u2019s something that we really haven\u2019t seen for a while, and I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s driving that. Barry Hytinen : Thanks Shlomo. It\u2019s actually in our entertainment services, and the real improvement in physical I think, beyond a sustainable basis, is on the consumer side, so that was more of a true-up in terms of some private vaults that we had with our entertainment services. If you look overall, if you think about the overall record management down about 1.1 million cubic feet, consumer was up 2.5, and then I would say it was kind of a one-off true-up of a little over half a million cubes with entertainment services. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session and today\u2019s conference call.

We have included the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information. With that Bill, would you please, begin? Bill Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. As we close out a year, which has been marked by first quarter delivering near record growth to our remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're going. First, I want to pause and acknowledge that we continue to fight COVID-19 and we maintain making the safety of our employees, their families and our customers our first priority. Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the roll out of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macro economic landscape. However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us. We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open. We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020. We accelerated our growth in data center, with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019. We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces. These services led to growth in our digital solutions year-on-year of 8%, excluding FX. And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions. This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers in organizations, in spite of COVID has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of growth in the past decade. This significant investment in innovation, in new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways. Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center. In other words, being both the lock and the key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets. The strategy is underpinned by our high performance, customer obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1000 companies. It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth, but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit. This shift in culture is marked by a singular focus on our customers as our North Star and acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. And an increase in our commitment to carbon neutrality. 2020 saw us continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of a 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings and new facilities operating. Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customer's needs in more creative ways included processing unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mailrooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce. In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most. What that all means to me, is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever. A company with a new sense of momentum that will fuel both our top and bottom-line growth. In the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum. If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021. We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and expect this to continue. As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business, and believe this growth should continue. This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine. One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers. This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new datacenter customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as deriving much more value from data born both physically and digitally. As a result, you can see both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets, but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value, as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey. For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers' value most. We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they don't, and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation. Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us. These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform or CSP. Think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and secure offline storage or a highly secure air gapped data storage for cost effective protection against ransom attacks. Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas. In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across three continents since 2017. And we just announced an agreement which once closed, will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through our investment in Web works. The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion and is growing at over 10% per colocation or retail customers and over 40% for the hyperscale segment. If you look at fine art stories and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together. Just two months ago, the L.A. Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business. They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood. The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage, but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners. In consumer, we've grown the business in one year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so three times as big in just 12 months. The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than 35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year. I note that our segment focus is on Valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us a strong competitive advantage, as well as being a nice submarket which represents a significant opportunity for future growth. Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020. More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator, as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of two large financial institutions. So hopefully this helps you appreciate why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond. Taking together, the seven areas I highlighted earlier, represent a significant market opportunity for us. Let me put some context around that. If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion and on average those markets had low growth rates. Over the last five years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes $80 billion. Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate. So not only has the addressable market for expanded services grown by over eight times, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry. Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020. At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, we were laser focused on execution and controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last three quarters of 2020. This resulted in continued strength and total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis in 2.4% organically. While service revenue declines continue to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for currency. And our margin expanded a 110 basis points in 2020. This all in-spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines. I want to thank our teams across the globe who stayed focused in the phase of so many obvious distractions. Our success is a reflection of our mountaineer's dedication and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home. Turning now to our physical storage business. Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume. For the full year, total global organic volume was flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating. This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up. Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially. For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%. In our Global Digital Solutions business in 2020, we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year-over-year, excluding FX. Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue. This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier. We see a further acceleration in our digital solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed $300 million in revenue for the year. Turning now to our Global Data Center segment, the team had a phenomenal year. Blowing its leasing targets out of the water, quarter after quarter. For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts. Remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts. I want to underscore that that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers. We had a very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail colocation business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt. We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1300 data center customers. This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments. We also had a busy year in terms of development, with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies, increasing our leasable megawatts to a 130. Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts. One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into new fast-growing markets. As I mentioned earlier this morning, we announced entering into an agreement for a strategic JV with Web Werks, which once closed would expand our reach to India including Mumbai, Pune and Delhi. The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world. We are excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low. Turning to Project Summit. We generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of a $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions - activity actions on early initiatives. This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021. As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes. Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier. We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiatives as being aligned with the Paris Climate Accord. Already in 2019, we reported that our goal to cut 25% was more than doubled by delivering a 52% reduction six years sooner than our 2025 commitment. As we did this, whilst growing our global data center business, one of the most energy intensive industries in the world. We continue to flex our innovation muscle around energy consumption as well as having introduced the green power pass to our customers. This is the first solution of its kind and allows us to pass the benefits of a 100% renewable energy data center platform to our customers for them to use to meet their sustainability targets. We're confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve a 100% carbon neutrality well before 2050, in spite of our rapidly growing data center business. To summarize, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth at any other time in our history even with the anticipated continued headwinds due to COVID impacting our traditional service areas. And I'd never been more proud of how we behaved as an organization over the course of 2020 and through the pandemic. We went above and beyond for our customers and our teams and embraced new collaboration tools in change how we work. Our mountaineers truly lived our values day-in and day-out. I'm excited to be on this journey with you all and I can't wait to see the future together. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks Bill. And thank you for joining us to discuss our full year and fourth quarter results. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion declined 2.7% on a reported basis, which includes a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.3%. Organic service revenue declined 12.8% reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.4% driven by more than 2 points of revenue management. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.3% year-on-year to $1.48 billion. Reflecting the team's strong progress with Project Summit and revenue management, EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points or 35.6% representing the best margin performance in the company's history. Importantly, we see opportunity for profitability to continue to expand overtime. AFFO increased 2.4% to $888 million or $3.07 on a per share basis. Before I go into more detail, let me draw your attention to Slide 13 of our earnings presentation. We have made some refinements to our non-GAAP measures spurred by feedback from the investment community that some of our non-GAAP measures are difficult to compare appears. This includes changes to how we account for unconsolidated ventures, stock-based compensation and a portion of growth capital. To ensure comparability and transparency, we have provided our results on both the former and new methodology of course, the prior method will be comparable to current consensus estimates. For example, under our former methodology, full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion which compares to the current consensus of $1.446 billion. More detail is available in our earnings slides and on our Investor Relations website. Now, turning to our results for the quarter which are based on our updated non-GAAP definitions. On reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion declined 1.8% which includes a 40 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined to 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 12.1%. Overall, we continue to see service declines moderate with the fourth quarter reflecting a modest improvement in service trends. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% driven by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million under both our new and former definition, we exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as revenue trends both in storage and service were better than planned. Fourth quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix offset by COVID driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $191 million or $0.66 on a per share basis in line with our prior projections. AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx that had been deferred earlier in the year and higher cash taxes. Turning to segment performance, in the fourth quarter, our global RIM business had strong storage revenue growth driven by volume growth in our fastest growing markets and revenue management. This was offset by declines in service revenue albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year leading to total organic revenue decline of 3.6%. In our shred business, the combination of lower tonnage and an 8% decline in paper price versus last year resulted in a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. While there's been a slight step up in the index prices in January, recycled paper prices have remained low. At recent levels, we anticipate paper prices will result in EBITDA headwind of slightly over $10 million in 2021. We are pleased with the continued momentum in our consumer storage business as it becomes a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points driven by revenue management and Project Summit. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see fixed cost deleverage as we ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level to fully support our customers. We also had a step up in facility expense as we invested in maintenance that we had delayed over the prior two quarters. Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, full year bookings came in at 58.5 megawatts. Excluding the full building lease in Frankfurt, we leased 31.5 megawatts representing bookings growth of 26%. Total revenue grew 9% year-over-year. We are pleased with our data center performance for the year and expect to continue to see and improving trajectory, thanks to the strong commercial success. In 2021, we expect at least 25 to 30 megawatts, which at the midpoint would result in more than 20% annual bookings growth. We feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation. We project full year revenue growth in the range of low double-digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility to revenue. For the first quarter, we expect growth rates similar to the fourth quarter as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. Turning to Project Summit. As a reminder, we expect total program benefits of $375 million, of which we delivered $165 million in 2020. We expect an additional $150 million benefit in 2021 with the balance in 2022. This quarter, the team delivered $52 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit. As to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter we invested $163 million, bringing the full year to $446 million in line with our prior expectations. In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, consisting of approximately $410 million of growth CapEx, of which we plan to allocate approximately $300 million to data center development. We expect $140 million of recurring CapEx. Turning to capital recycling. In the fourth quarter our program generated approximately $451 million of proceeds, which includes the Frankfurt data center joint venture we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, our capital recycling program generated approximately $475 million. I would like to call out the sale leaseback transaction we announced in December, which we sold a portfolio of 13 industrial facilities generating gross proceeds of $358 million. This portfolio was sold at a cap rate slightly below 4.5%. This was a compelling opportunity for us to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial assets, while effectively maintaining the long-term control of the facilities through an initial 10-year lease with multiple renewal options, among other favorable terms. On a leverage neutral basis, this transaction freed up approximately $260 million of investable capital that we intend to redeploy into faster growing areas, including our data center business. We plan to make these investments in 2021 so our year end net debt balance reflects these proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline we are planning to continue to recycle industrial assets. In 2021, we are planning for $125 million of recycling. Turning to the balance sheet, at year end, we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We ended the year with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times down from 5.7 times at year end 2019. Pro forma excluding the investible proceeds from our leaseback, leverage would have been slightly under 5.5 times. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range near the high end. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at the sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid 60s as a percentage of AFFO. Now, to give you more details as to our outlook for 2021, we are pleased to reinstitute financial guidance reflecting the strength of our business, our team's strong execution and improved visibility. For the full year 2021, we currently expect revenue of $4.325 billion to $4.475 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents revenue growth of 6% and EBITDA growth of 8%. At the midpoint, our guidance implies about 75 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year-on-year. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $945 million to $995 million or $3.25 to $3.42 per share. At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global physical volume will be flat to slightly positive. Revenue management will be a significant benefit in 2021. And I will note the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today, and nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are planning for a continuation in the strong trends we are seeing in digital solutions, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth, as well as Project Summit savings. Partially offsetting those benefits is a prudent outlook for inflation, a step up in cost from prior COVID driven discretion, rent from our sale leaseback transactions and innovation spend. While we do not typically guide quarterly with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. On a dollar basis, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be consistent to slightly up from the fourth quarter results. In summary, our team is executing well. Visibility is improving and our pipeline across the business has been strengthening over the last several months. We feel well positioned as we move into 2021. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. And with that operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You highlighted growth opportunities from data centers, fine art, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition and other services. Can you describe your go-to market strategy to penetrate these growth markets and what proportion of revenue you expect this growth portfolio to evolve to over the next three to five years? Bill Meaney : Hi, George. No, thanks for the question. I think this year most of the growth will be around the digital services, which I highlighted. So, I said last year we did 8%, then we see a further acceleration in that growth rate going into this year. And on SITAD, you'll continue to see its relatively small portion of the business. But as I said, to give you some idea of the scale, those two global contracts that we've signed early in this year to serve financial service institutions, those two combined are probably in the order of about 15% year-on-year growth. So, it's pretty high levels of growth on what it traditionally was smaller parts of our business. But over time, over the next year, what you can expect is over the next year or two, we'll start guiding more and more to those individual pieces of business. But if you think about it, what this all means is more on a consolidated basis. It gives us the confidence on guiding say that, we said that 2% to 6% growth in terms of top line range. And if you take the midpoint that's 4%. It just gives us much more confidence as we go forward that we can really start driving bottom line growth, not just through margin expansion, but through top line growth, because of the resiliency and the attractiveness of these new segments. George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you. Hey, Barry, maybe you could help me parse just the 2% to 6% organic revenue growth? When I look at it, the adjacent businesses versus the core business if they're growing roughly 13% in line with the end markets, that seems to be would be a little bit above 3% growth. What is the embedded assumption for the balance, in other words, the core business in the storage? Is that assuming you're going to get consistent 2% to 3% pricing, and is there any FX that's involved in that as well? Barry Hytinen : Sure, Shlomo, thanks for the question. If I take the total revenue guide, which is 4% to 8%, that's a little over $250 million at the midpoint or slightly over 6%. We're expecting data center, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks to be up, kind of double-digits so we're approaching mid-teens. So, let's call it $40 million of pure revenue growth be a small amount of FX on that number, since you asked about that. And then turning to the global RIM business, we're projecting in a 200 plus million of total growth. Now, that's assuming revenue management of the normal levels that we've been experiencing 2% to 3%, maybe even a little bit closer to the high end as we continue to roll that out. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly the vast majority of those actions will be in place by the end of the quarter. We're certainly expecting with COVID for planning to flat to slightly up volume. And Bill mentioned the digital solutions, which would be probably in the vicinity as much as $50 million of year-over-year benefit. And that results in a very slight service activity recovery for the balance of our services. On adjacent businesses, we're continuing to see the business improve. But I'd say we're being a little bit conservative and prudent with respect to the COVID impact as we continue to see those underlying markets recover. I will note that, we did see for the second quarter in a row, very nice volume out of our adjacent businesses. And that's the entertainment services business continuing to see improving trends. Bill, anything you'd like to add there? Bill Meaney : I think, that covered it well. Barry Hytinen : The only other element Shlomo, I would add is from an FX perspective, it'll be about call it 1.5 in total of the 4 to 8, something of that order in light of where FX rates are in terms of forward projection on banks - bank views, so thanks for the question. Operator : The next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hey, good morning. Two quick questions, if I could. I was curious on the specs of the new JV, how much will you guys own? How did it come about and is this the kind of platform where there'll be opportunities over time? And then also just a question on capital recycling? I think you mentioned $125 million. I'm just curious, how much of your industrial portfolio would you be willing to recycle long-term? Bill Meaney : So, thanks for the questions Nate. So, coming on the Web Werks JV that we announced this morning. Great question. So, we're super excited about India. I mean, personally, I've been to India, I don't know how many times over the last three years specifically looking for a data center, the right data center entry, because it's been on our radar screen for quite some time. And with Web Werks, we found a very good partner that already has presence in Mumbai, Pune, and Delhi, which three of the key regions, and they have a roadmap to expand that to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. So, which we really think gives us a very good platform, because Delhi is not a single location. In terms of the way, why we chose Web Werks is that, first of all the team, its entrepreneurial brothers that actually built the company, and they have always had a very strong focus on telecommunications interconnects. In fact, that's how they started their business. So, we think that actually they built a good ecosystem around the locations that they already have. They understand the market and the business extremely well. So, we're also buying into effectively a management team. And as we alluded to, in our press release is that the way the JV is structured is we start in a minority and they have about 4 megawatts that are actually running as we sit here today in those three locations, but they have both Brownfield expansion capacity as well as land for further greenfield expansion. And $150 million that we announced will be put in overtime on a cost basis as we build out that expansion. So, you can think of it as a way that we paid slight premium for our entry, to get the additional 4 megawatts and the management team. And then that $150 million that goes in over the next two or three years will lead to us to have a majority ownership. And that will be on a cost basis, that money put in. So, we'll effectively slide down towards a cost that is approaching, the actual cost to build the facility. So, we're really excited about the market. It is the second largest telecommunications market in the world, it has probably about 10% of the data center running in India and Northern Virginia. So and it's just a very fast-growing market. We've got a great management team that comes along as part of the deal. And we have a clear roadmap to expand and build a truly Indian footprint. Barry Hytinen : And Nate, thanks for the question. This is Barry. On the recycling point, we as you know, see recycling of industrial assets is highly attractive as we see the valuations as really good at these levels. And together with our development pipeline and data center, among others, it's a really good move for us to invest in faster growing opportunities. The way I think about it is industrial assets continue to increase in terms of valuation. So the level of recycling that we've assumed in the plan this year would kind of be a mid-single digit percent of purely the industrial asset base. So, we've got a - and that is obviously a base that continues to expand in terms of value in light of what's going on in asset prices out there. So over time, I think planning for something in this level, annually, is not a bad place to plan if I were you. And I would also note that, if we continue to see opportunities on both sides on the industrial side, as well as incremental opportunities in the development pipeline, we would not be afraid to continue to recycle even at a little bit higher level, but for the year, we're planning 125. Thanks for the question. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Funk : Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. A couple if I could. So, first thinking about the potential impact of wage inflation on the business with the $15 minimum wage, being pushed through. Wondering how that might impact your proposed cost savings? Bill Meaney : Thanks for the question, Michael. I think it's an important topic and wage inflation just across even absent of the $15 minimum wage, in terms of our frontline staff, especially our carriers, right, we've been in that, I would say a highly competitive environment, for the last four or five years at least with a boom of e-commerce. So, for us, the $15 minimum wage is less than an issue. Most if not all of our workers are kind of north of that. The bigger issue for us is, quite frankly, the pressure on e-commerce for similar types of jobs. That being said, we've been able to manage our churn pretty well. And the one thing I've spent personally a fair amount of time traveling around the country as well as in Europe and in Mexico, speaking to our frontline staff, many of whom we had to furlough during the depths of the crisis, just to take the temperature and their connection to the company, their loyalty, the gratitude in terms of the way our leadership teams have managed the crisis and also tried to support them and their families both mentally, health wise and monetarily has been highly appreciated. So, I think, I still remain very confident that mountaineers are really mountaineers, we look after each other. But the inflation that you're referring to is less for us driven by the minimum wage and it's more driven by just the boom in e-commerce, but it's a good point. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Good morning. We do sometimes get questions how Iron Mountain competes in the data center business versus pure play players. I was wondering if you can provide more insights on how you answer that question. Any details behind the benefits of Iron Mountain and cross-selling? And just what makes you more competitive? And was there much competition on that India joint venture? Bill Meaney : Okay, thanks Sheila for both questions. So first, I guess my flippant answer to your first question is, I think 58.5 megawatts this year says that we're pretty competitive. So, I tell my congrats to our team who have really dug in. I think the other thing what I would say is just another proof point. Then I'll say how we're compete, is that if you look at our, especially on the sales side, but also in the operation side of our data centers, most if not all of these folks come from leading what I would call pure play data center companies. And so, you can almost say and to me it's not - you measure the success of your offering in two dimensions. One is, do customers buy it, right, which is the 58.5 megawatts this year of leasing activity our new leases signed, I think is a pretty good proof point. On the other side is, are people willing to bet their career and their livelihood by coming to join you who are specialists in the field and I have to say that market who leads that business has done a remarkable job in terms of attracting really, I would say, top tier focused data center talent. Now, in terms of the synergies between the business, which goes into the secret sauce, which you alluded to, is still about 40% of our whole own leads come from our traditional records management sales force. And that's you're seeing that even more and more now that we set up strategic accounts. So, I don't go to a strategic account meeting where they pulled out a strategic account executive for me along where we're not speaking about data center opportunities. I mean, just last week, Barry and I were with the number two executive of a global bank and he brought up data center even before we could, Barry and I with one of our strategic account executives. So it's a - people definitely see the connection, the decades, this is our 70th year, the decades of trust that we've had with financial service institutions. And it's the reason why the likes of Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have trusted us with their colocation installs. So, definitely the trust is a big factor. And the team seems to be really getting great traction in the market. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks so much. Barry, can you help us just understand how much the EBITDA methodology changes in fact the 2021 EBITDA if at all, just based on the recapture the air back at stock-based comp and growth capital and then the JVs? Barry Hytinen : Sure, thanks, Kevin. There's a lot of material in our slide deck, but let me go through a couple of things. From an EBITDA standpoint, the stock comp, year-to-year is very similar. I will note, like most companies, we have a performance element in our grant. So, it's conceivable that depending upon where performance is those grants could go higher or lower. So, I would be planning for that to be very modestly up year-on-year. On the [Indiscernible] ventures, as it relates to how that impacts EBITDA, there's two things there as you know, our consumer joint venture where we have a higher ownership, but while the business is performing better year-on-year as our plan, it still is in a loss position. So that'll be a little bit more of a headwind. And then we'll add on the Frankfurt joint venture where we own 20%, as you know. And that starts up as we mentioned before, the lease commences at about midyear and ramps over time as the client gets into the lease. So that, I would say the unconsolidated ventures portion is fairly similar year-on-year, slight improvement. So, net-to-EBITDA, very similar to the 2020 level of the add back that you see in the documents. EPS and FFO would flow similarly to EBITDA. And then from an AFFO standpoint, you'll note that there's less impact there than EBITDA since we were already adding back stock comp. So that has no change to AFFO. And the portion of growth capital is essentially at the same level. And I already mentioned the unconsolidated joint venture. So, an add back of kind of a high single digit million-dollar benefit to AFFO year-on-year, not unlike what we had again in 2022. Good question. Thanks for the question. Operator : The next question, comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Bill, I think said that, post COVID you expected organic physical volume storage volume growth would be about 50 basis points or so and seems like you'll be pretty close to that range this year. So, is that still the right way to think about the business once we get beyond COVID? And then related to that, have you seen any impact this year from the decline in incoming boxes that you talked about last year as a result of the pandemic and have those declines kind of more or less normalized to this point? Or is there still some impact to the business? Thanks. Bill Meaney : Yeah, I think to your first question I would say, yes. And in part of that, that recovery is based on the success that we've had in consumer is I mentioned in my remarks is that, we went from 2 million cubic feet to 7 million cubic feet last year, I'd say in 2020. In terms of the incoming volume, we still see the similar trends as we saw pre-COVID. At this point, we haven't seen a - we have and you can almost you can see that no supplemental, we haven't seen an acceleration in that headwind that we're getting. But we're still for sure going through what I think I described on a few calls previously, maybe was a year ago, what I call the second derivative action. In other words, virtually all our customers are continuing to send us new boxes. But some of our historically, fastest growing and largest verticals are sending them in at slower rates. So, we continue to see that what I call the second derivative drag on volume coming in slower than boxes aging out at their normal kind of 15-year lifespan. So, we expect to continue to have what I would call the same pre-COVID headwinds on the traditional document side of the business more than offset by the growth in consumer. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Stephanie Yee : Hi, thank you. I also had a question about incoming boxes, just as people returned to work maybe later in the year, would you expect the incoming boxes to kind of pick up to pre-COVID levels? And kind of along with that, as incoming boxes pick up would constructions also pick up when people are back in the office more? Bill Meaney : Hi, Stephanie, and thanks for the question. That would be our expectation, right. But I think it's - I don't think it's going to be a sharp change, because I think the people's transition back into the office will be more gradual than that. But I would expect that, but again, when you net those two things out, we don't expect a marked change in the trend. I mean, if you think about it, during the course of last year, is I think that our - it is basically a flat storage story. And then you add pricing on top of that is actually not a bad story at all. So, we don't see either an acceleration in either direction of that trend. But I think, what you described is would be, I think, a reasonable expectation, but I think they probably will, fairly closely net each other out. Operator : The next question comes from John Atkins of RBC. Please go ahead. John Atkins : Thanks very much. On the data center side, I guess I just wanted to get a sense on what competition you're seeing when entering new markets versus data center peers, financial sponsors, thoughts on just - a few thoughts on preferred path for joint ventures versus outright acquisitions? And then when it comes to, I guess on a related question, do you have any kind of general thoughts on build to suit versus sale leasebacks? Bill Meaney : Okay, thanks, John, for the question is quite a bit in there. So, let me kind of start about how we think about the JVs or we use India as an example. So, India is a country that we're pretty comfortable in. That's why, specifically, it's actually been more than three years, actually I think, five years. I go to India, at least a couple times a year. But I would say five years ago, I started going there with a focus on finding the right data center entry. Even though we have a little less than 2,000 people working on the records management side in India. So, it's a market we know is for us, it was important to find the right not just physical opportunity for entry, the right footprint, but also the right team that we could build on. And with Web Werks, we found that I think from a Web Werks standpoint, they also appreciate it is that we are not a financial sponsor, or we're not a newbie in the Indian market. So, that they see how we operate in India already today. Culturally, we're tuned to the challenges that they have in a very supportive of their journey. And so that, in this case, Deutsche Bank ran the process. But I think one of the reasons why we won was the relationship we were able to build with the entrepreneurs and the way we the way we operate. So that to me is part of our secret sauce is that, we are a company that is in 56 countries around the world, over 20,000 mountaineers around the world so that we can make those connections. And then also it's not lost on these entrepreneurs in this particular case, that we were actually refusing data center demand. We had a number of customers, they were asking for capacity in India, and quite frankly, we just couldn't deliver for them so that we can bring that network to bear. I think if you kind of think more broadly on build to suit, as we build out our reputation with some of the large hyperscale players, so as we announced the Frankfurt started off, not as a build to suit but ended up being a build to suit effectively, because we had that interesting data center asset, and it was hyperscaler that needed the whole 27 megawatts. So, the design and engineering got modified to satisfy them. And that was one reason why we put it into the type of joint venture structure that we did, because it turned out to be a completely stabilized asset from day one, if you will. That has also led us to have, we haven't done any at this point but there's more and more that are approaching us to look at build to suit opportunities. And quite frankly, we just look at the returns. If the campus supports that, and it allows us to actually further expand or even upgrade the capacity of a campus by bringing in more power on the back of a build to suit opportunity, then we absolutely entertain it. The last thing I would say is that we are starting to see more pipeline. Now, whether or not we execute on that is interesting is that, when I was talking about the Frankfurt situation is that, what the customer there admitted to me that he really does see us as one of those handful of suppliers that he looks to when he's needing third party capacity. So, just naturally we are starting to see those kinds of opportunities, whether or not we actually execute on them really is going to depend on the types of returns in this specific campus opportunity.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, SVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Irene. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including our strong start to 2021, despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic; the continued execution of our strategic plan; solid progress in our key growth areas; continued expansion of our global data center platform; and our strong commitment to corporate social responsibility, including diversity, equity and inclusion. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliation to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill. Bill Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. We are pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year with both revenue and profitability coming in ahead of our expectations for the first quarter, despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and continued lockdowns in many parts of the world. Some of the key accomplishments of the quarter include, we achieved a record level of quarterly revenue, pricing continues to yield strong results as highlighted by our organic storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% year-on-year. Total organic volume grew some 2 million cubic feet versus last quarter and we continue to forecast overall volume growth to be flat to slightly positive for the year. We saw strong performance from our growth areas. For example, digital solutions is showing year-over-year organic growth of 11%, while secure IT asset disposition or SITAD has shown 30% growth. We are in line with delivering over $50 million of revenue growth from these two dynamic areas this year. Our global data center team leased nine megawatts in Q1 versus our guidance of between 25 and 30 megawatts for the full year. We continue to grow our footprint acquiring a new land parcel adjacent to our campus in Northern Virginia, which will increase our total potential capacity in that key market to 145 megawatts bringing our total potential datacenter capacity globally to 445 megawatts. Finally, adjusted EBITDA grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and our margin expanded 100 basis points. It should be noted that Q1 this year is even more impressive given that we are comparing it to a year ago where COVID, for the most part, was affecting very few of our customers. Whilst the impact from COVID during this quarter continues with many of the 56 countries we operate in to be in various stages of lockdown, we are proud of the consistency and stability of our core business and we continue to deliver on our strategic plan. This reflects the diversity and scale of our portfolio, the depth and breadth of our service offerings and the efficiencies that have been created through project summit. To further underline the point, our sales productivity remains strong and our mountaineers persevered, resulting in Q1 overall revenue slightly ahead of last year, whilst our traditional service revenue, which is most closely tied with being in the office was off 7%. We continue to expect to see very modest improvements in core service revenue as we progress through the year and we are not factoring in a full COVID recovery for the traditional side of the business before Q4 and perhaps for some parts of the world, even Q1 next year. In the meantime, we can see in our results and our improved guidance, our growth from new product areas will continue to deliver overall growth in our business in spite of the COVID impacts elsewhere. We remain committed to taking purposeful and bold steps to transform our entire organization, both operationally and culturally. We remain true to our plans to accelerate growth and continue our digital transformation journey, which for us includes both an internal focus as well has expanded product offerings for our customers. We are confident that our continued delivery of overall revenue growth, together with the expansion of margins due to Project Summit will enable us to continue our acceleration and cash generation which will allow us to continue to invest in our future whilst returning more and more cash to our investors. Project Summit is well on track to deliver $375 million of annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting this year, even after investing in new growth areas. In addition to adding $375 million to our EBITDA through margin improvement, Project Summit will continue to enable us to invest in the growth areas we identified and discussed last quarter, further accelerating our growth in revenue as well as profits. Some of these areas you will recall include digital solutions, consumer storage data center and SITAD. Examples to illustrate the impact of our focus on revenue growth can be seen from recent wins in digital services in SITAD. One recent win in digital services was with a global insurance company, which was managing its exposure from a large and complicated liability claim. This customer desired end state was to streamline underwriting and claims management processes by providing digital accessibility to records to quickly identify risk exposure, reduce processing times, improve SLAs, ensure chain of custody and gain scalability for large discovery audits. Our unique solution was to integrate 440,000 of their physical boxes with their digital information to provide a single view to search across and identify relevant and required information on demand. By leveraging our insight platform, we were able to immediately improve their legal discovery efforts and automate their claims processes. Another recent win was with the Government of Canada to leverage our Image on Demand or IOD solution to process applications for immigration, refugee or citizenship status. The government experienced a backlog during COVID, as staff could not access offices and applications kept piling up. This digital solution enabled the government staff to work through the backlog. We are currently imaging more than 4000 applications on a weekly basis, which are then digitally delivered for processing by the Government of Canada's employees. Switching to SITAD, this quarter, we have secured contracts with for large global clients to provide services across the globe. These engagements cover everything from enterprise infrastructure, such as servers, routers, switches, printers, copiers, to small personal devices and specialized equipment such as card readers. Our solutions in SITAD are the only ones on the market built around a secure chain of custody where assets attract at every stage of their journey, and our customers' data is kept secure. Also, our disposition process is built with sustainability in mind. We are a leader in thinking and acting for the environment. Demand for these services is particularly strong as companies look to consolidate and transform their physical footprint to move to new hybrid collaboration models post COVID and we expect to partner with many more of our enterprise and global clients throughout 2021 and beyond. Now, let me switch gears and spend some time discussing our ESG commitments including the sustainability of our products, services and operations, as well as our efforts focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. Our Eighth Annual Corporate Social Responsibility report will be published later today. In that report, we share sustainability goals as part of our ESG commitments to reduce our environmental impact. Whilst we have been extremely successful in achieving targets that were previously said, including exceeding our science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions six years ahead of schedule, we are introducing even stronger commitments to our planet, our customers, our employees and our communities. Some highlights include we are committed to achieving carbon net zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate Accord. We are proud to be ranked number 81 on Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies in 2021. By 2025, we are committed to building all of our newly constructed multi-tenant data centers to be certified to the BREEAM green building standard. In addition to contracting for renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our data center electricity load worldwide and passing through the carbon reduction benefits to our customers who avail themselves of our green power pass, we have announced our first electricity supply contract that matches our load 24/7 with local renewable generation for our facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Additionally, we shared with you our recommitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, not just because it is just but also because it is key to our strategic success and being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. For example, by 2025, we have committed to increasing representation of women in our global leadership team to 40% from 31% today, and people who identify as BIPOC in our US leadership team to 30% from 19%. Thanks to the true commitment of my fellow mountaineers across the globe, and with the guidance and engagement of our employee resource groups, we have made significant progress on our journey, but have a lot more to do. To further us on our journey, I'm pleased to announce that we have recently recruited Charlene Jackson as our Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Charlene brings a strong set of experience and skills as we continue building our global enterprise into an organization which is both diverse and inclusive. Finally, before handing the call over to Barry, I would like to provide a bit more information on the data center performance. As I mentioned earlier, our global data center team is off to a strong start leasing more than nine megawatts in the first quarter. As you likely saw, this included six megawatts with an existing US-based Fortune 100 technology company. We also signed a one-megawatt lease in Singapore with a leading e commerce end gaming company. The remainder of the leasing for the quarter was co-location and we continue to build our pipeline for both hyperscale and retail deployments. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we closed on our joint venture with Web Werks, and have already seen great growth prospects from that partnership. Web Werks recently announced that they have acquired a land parcel to build a standalone purpose-built Greenfield data center in Mumbai. This new data center will be designed to support 12.5 megawatts of IT capacity with a rich, interconnected ecosystem consisting of major telcos, over 150 internet service providers, and three major internet exchanges. The new facility expected to be operational by mid-2022 abuts Web Werks existing data center in Mumbai, which would result in a campus with 15 megawatts of total capacity. We also continue to grow our platform organically with the recent purchase of a land parcel adjacent to our existing Northern Virginia campus. This parcel is expected to support 32 megawatts of IT capacity at full build out. In addition, we redesigned our Manassas Campus master plan and can now support 30 megawatts of IT load at VA-2 compared to 24 megawatts previously, as well as an additional 35 megawatts of capacity at the campus. With these designs and scope changes, our NOVA campus capacity has increased more than 90% to 145 megawatts with 16 megawatts built in 72% of that leased. Our total data center potential capacity globally now is 445 megawatts and/or an increase of more than 18%, giving us a long runway for future development and growth. In closing, let me say thank you to our mountaineers and their families for their continued support and dedication in what has been a difficult and heart wrenching year for many. We and our customers count on our essential workers every day. And I personally always come back inspired after meeting with many of our teams around the globe. Our results demonstrate accelerating earnings growth, the resiliency of our business, revenue growth in new areas and the benefits of our culture. Our culture supports customer first with an innovative mindset. With that inner DNA, we will continue to climb higher together with our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, our team delivered solid performance that exceeded expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Building on the improved performance we delivered in the second half of 2020, revenue trends continue to strengthen in the first quarter. Our core physical storage business is demonstrating its resilience and momentum is building in our growth areas. We are confident in our projections and are pleased to raise our full year financial guidance. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion grew 1.2%. Total organic revenue declined 60 basis points. Organic service revenue declined 4.8%, a marked improvement from prior quarters representing our best performance since the first quarter of 2020. While our service activity is still experiencing an impact from COVID, March was the first month since February 2020 with positive organic service revenue growth. Our team continues to drive improving trends with growth in our global digital solutions business and revenue management notable call outs. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% with continued benefits from pricing, combined with a slight increase in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $381 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call, as the team delivered stronger margin flow through together with the revenue beat. First quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation and revenue management, offset by COVID driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $235 million or $0.81 on a per share basis. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. Turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $967 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue declined 80 basis points. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. While our traditional services have been impacted by the pandemic, trends continue to improve during the first quarter. We are focused on expanding our global digital solutions business and in the first quarter, we experienced strong growth building on the commercial successes we delivered in 2020. We are pleased with the continued performance in our consumer storage business. Even with normal seasonality, the business contributed nicely to our overall physical volume. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $409 million, an increase of $17 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points driven by pricing and Project Summit. Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, we had another strong quarter of bookings with 9 megawatts. We are well on track to deliver our full year target of 25 to 30 megawatts. Total revenue grew 6% year-over-year, in line with our projections. As I mentioned on our prior call, we expect revenue growth in the data center business will be more back half weighted as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. We continue to project all year revenue growth in the range of low-double-digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility. In the second quarter, we anticipate an increase in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA compared to the first quarter. In terms of margin, we expect the second quarter to be down two to three points sequentially as a result of COVID driven construction delays and one-time build out services for a specific customer. We expect margins to remain at that level in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. In late April, we formed a joint venture with Web Werks, a leading co-location data center provider in India. We made an initial investment of approximately $50 million in exchange for a non-controlling interest. As we have previously disclosed, we expect to invest an additional $100 million over the next two years, which we expect will result in a majority ownership position. Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $50 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. As a reminder, we expect Summit to contribute $150 million a year-on-your benefit in 2021, with another $60 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $113 million, with an investment of 85 million of growth CapEx along with 29 million of recurring CapEx. Turning to capital recycling, in the first quarter, our program generated approximately $12 million of proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline, we remain committed to recycling approximately $125 million of industrial assets for the full year. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of just under 5.5 times, slightly better than our projection and down from last year. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we continue to expect to end the year within our target range near the high end, which will be modestly down from year end 2020 on a pro forma basis. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid 60s as a percentage of AFFO. Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase our 2021 financial guidance. There are two factors driving the improved projections. Our outlook for the business continues to improve with first quarter performance better than expected and increased confidence in our key growth drivers and the underlying business trends. Second, we've also factored in the benefit from two small recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. And I would note that we have been able to increase our guidance despite the ongoing impact of COVID on our traditional services business and construction delays in Frankfort. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.365 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.585 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth - of revenue growth of 7% and EBITDA growth of 9%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $955 million to $1,005 million and AFFO per share of $3.28 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 10% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year, our revenue management program will provide a significant benefit in 2021 and I will note that nearly all of the actions driving that benefit were in place by the end of the first quarter. For services, we are prudently assuming some measure of continued COVID impact, albeit the first quarter was another good proof point for the momentum building in our digital solutions business. While we do not typically guide quarterly, with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the second quarter. We expect revenue to approach $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA to approach $400 million. We are confident in our outlook and the strength of our pipeline. We expect to grow revenue sequentially throughout the year. In summary, the year is off to a good start. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. We feel well positioned. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Last quarter, you made a push into various growth markets. At this point, can you summarize how big your growth portfolio is? And how your growth expectations for this growth portfolio have evolved over the past quarter since doubling down into these areas of growth verticals and perhaps how much funding you would need to put into your initiatives in order to accelerate the growth in these in these growth markets? Thank you. Bill Meaney : Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. So taking back, as you referred to, the last meeting, so over the last five years, we've been developing a number of new products and market approaches that really have taken us from a total addressable market where our products and services range from 10 billion to over 80 billion. So the things that we've been doubling down are consistent with that roadmap and picture that we highlighted last year, and that 80 billion, I should highlight, is also growing kind of low teens in terms of organic growth rate. So if you think about highlighted SITAD, for instance, in digital services today, I mean, I wouldn't say that we've just been doubling down on them in the last quarter, this has been a continuous build with I would say acceleration is part of Project Summit. And part of Project Summit, you're seeing the 375 million net EBITDA improvement that we are delivering and committing to. This is net of the investments that take us - that's required to actually invest in our digital services SITAD, our continued investment in data center, further acceleration in consumer, for instance. So the investment is already in there. The 375 million is a net number that's coming out. And I think you can expect, as we said today, if we just looked at SITAD in digital services this year alone that will add roughly $50 million of revenue on a year-over-year basis. So, we feel pretty good. Obviously, we just highlighted those two today, but across the board, and you can see it also in data center with nine megawatts leased in this quarter. So we feel pretty good about now aiming towards an $80 billion market in terms of revenue growth and that was part of Barry upsizing the revenue guidance for the full year. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on the guidance, I'm just wondering if you can parse out the guidance increase what's coming from really operational outperformance versus perhaps some slightly more favorable foreign exchange rates that you experienced in the quarter versus last year? And then, another question on the data center side, just wondering, if you look at future growth areas, are there potentially any new markets either domestically or internationally that can make sense for Iron Mountain to enter either via M&A or through new Greenfield development or do you think you're just going to continue to develop in the markets that you have today? Thank you. Barry Hytinen : Hey, Eric. Good morning. It's Barry. Maybe I'll take the first one and I'll let Bill take the second one. I appreciate the question. As compared to our prior guidance, the increase of $40 million of revenue and 10 million of EBITDA is really driven by two factors as I mentioned on the call. First, it's our outlook on the business which just continues and improve, the first quarter performance I think is a testament of that. The team did very well - executed very well in the first quarter. And we're continuing to increase our confidence in our growth drivers and the underlying business trends. That's about $20 million of revenue in the guide up and probably seven - round numbers 7 million of the EBITDA. The second point is we factored in the benefit from two recently closed acquisitions, as well as the Web Werks investment. That's about combined $20 million of revenue in the year. Note that we acquired those in the second quarter, and then about call it 3 million of EBITDA. I'll remind people that the Web Werks acquisition is not consolidated, so there's no revenue that comes along with that in our financials. I would also just note that there's no change in our assumption as it relates to foreign exchange rates. So the rates that we're using and the impact of that on our growth that we had in our prior guidance is unchanged in the current guidance. So it's the underlying business performance together with the couple of small deals. Thanks for the question, Eric. Bill Meaney : Yeah, the only thing I would add, Eric, in terms of other areas of growth for datasets - so I appreciate the question is, let me kind of parse it out into theaters or parts of the world. So if we look at domestic, as you know that we have a land bank in Chicago, we continue to like the Chicago market. So it's just a matter of where our priorities are in capital allocation. So I think you can expect at some point Chicago will be on the map. Also we continue to like the potential opportunities to repurpose some of our electricity meters, if you will, in California, where we can actually buy wholesale power, which gives us an advantage in terms of power costs, by taking a records management facility and repurposing that into a data center. So, California continues to be an area that we remained focused on as potential market for further development. On Europe, as we highlighted a few calls ago that we started building Frankfurt and then sold the thing out 100% of the 27 megawatts, so Frankfurt is a market that we continue to look at further expansion to it, because it's a key market serving continental Europe. London too, as we noted, is in full development but that's also looking to be pretty buoyant. So we'll continue to look at if we need more capacity in London. And then the last aspect I would say in London is we have had a few of our customers approach us on looking at edge deployments, and where we were considering actually repurposing some of our industrial real estate footprint into data center. So if you think about, we have a land bank for our data center business, which takes us up to 445 megawatts but that's not including the 80 million square feet of industrial warehouses that we have around the world, a number of those are suitable to be repurposed into data centers. So we continue to look at that mainly for as an edge kind of deployment, which can be anywhere from, let's say, from two to six megawatts. On the Asia front, as Barry highlighted and I mentioned in my remarks, we're super excited about the joint venture that we have with Web Werks. India, we think has a lot of potential and we're already seeing pent up demand, partly it's regulatory driven and partly, it's just the growth of the economy. So I think there's a lot more for us to do in India. As you would have noted that we're now 100% sold out in Singapore. So we're working through the permitting process on finding additional capacity in that market. And there were other areas in Southeast Asia, which I think are early days that we're looking at countries that would be interesting to expansion. And I would put Latin America in the same category is that there are a number of areas in Latin America that we're starting to look at, but we're at earlier stages for those areas. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good morning. Bill, the short interest in the stock is down but it still looks elevated to reap. Certainly not something you can control but I was just - the concern has always been storage volume, given paper trends. Can you just give us your updated insights on how Iron Mountain is still growing storage volume, total revenue and effectively shifting to adapt your business to these changing trends? Bill Meaney : Good morning, Sheila and thanks for the question. Yeah, I think also it is people really start understanding the durability of our business and also the ability for us to continue to grow organically, cash generation through top line growth. I think people are starting to realize that they probably overplaying the paper storage aspect of the story. So I mean to your point is that, you saw the records volume was slightly improved from Q4 into Q1. Overall, we reiterate our commitment that we expect physical storage in the business to be flat to up for the full year again on an organic basis, and then you add three points of price to it. So - and given the relatively slow growth of that business, there is not a lot of CapEx is going into it. So we feel really good because this is just effectively generating tons of cash, that we're able to plow over to invest behind some of those growth initiatives that are targeted at the $80 billion total addressable market that I mentioned before, as well as datacenter, which we've been increasing our capital allocation to over the last few years. So, I think over time, I mean, people are going to really understand that the physical volume - physical storage business is alive and well, and we're getting good price increase on top of that. And of course, as you alluded to some of the other new physical storage areas like consumer continue to deliver dividends, and then on the other aspect is the revenue growth is starting to pick up from the investments we've made over the last five years into new business areas, I think is starting to come through. Operator : Next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. I kind of want to piggyback on the last one, just in terms of the organic storage rental, on the one hand, the guidance is going up, you guys did better. The organic storage rental growth range embedded in the guidance, though, didn't change and I'm not sure if it was just kind of it's a rounding item or the growth is really coming outside of that. And I guess related to that is the sequential change in the physical records volume was the slowest decline I've seen over a while and I was wondering, if you could point to what's going on over there? Is there more of an influx of boxes, less of an issue with destructions, just you used to give more detail on a slide that's not in there anymore, maybe you can talk to these items. Bill Meaney : Thanks, Shlomo. I'll talk about the physical volume side and then Barry can give you our thinking around the guidance around storage. So I think on the physical volume, if you've been watching this story for a very long time, I mean first of all, that the record storage is just one aspect of our physical storage business, right. And at the end of the day, it comes down to occupancy and our ability to drive cash returns for that business. So we feel that, I wouldn't say a large diversification, but a purposeful diversification of our physical storage business, I think you can even see that our data is showing the robustness and continuity of that business, which we feel really good about. Specifically to your question on the sequential Q4 to Q1 improvement in the records management side of the business, we're really pleased with it and that's why it continues to give our confidence that overall physical storage will be flat to slightly up for the year. And part of that improvement, which you can say during a COVID timeframe is kind of interesting, is really I give a lot of credit to our global strategic accounts organization, which we set up I guess, about 12 to 18 months ago, is their degree of mining and broadening the conversation with our customers is showing real results, not just in the new areas that I highlighted in my opening remarks around digital services in SITAD, which we've had, obviously, really nice growth in that area, but they actually is part of a broader conversation they're having with our customers, which quite frankly has delivered more box to our facilities as well. So, we feel pretty good across the board. We feel good about the different conversation we're having with our customers due to some of the investments we've made in our commercial operations. And Barry, you might want to talk about that. Barry Hytinen : Hi, Shlomo, it's Barry. Thanks for the question. And I will say that there's an element of rounding and candidly, an element of conservatism certainly the year has started off well and is trending a little bit better than our expectations that I mentioned in the setup. I will note that that those percentages are organic. So while we have a couple of small deals that is a purely organic number. The growth is coming in quite balanced. So we're seeing improving trends on storage and service. So thank you for the question. Operator : Our next question is from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Nate Crossett : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones, if I may. First inflation, how should we think about expense growth for the year? What are you guys seeing in terms of labor costs, input costs? And then two, just your current view on funding the growth areas of the business right now, in the past you've used TV [indiscernible] is equity/using ATM [ph] lever that you would consider using? Barry Hytinen : Hi, Nate. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. So, we certainly did, as I mentioned in last call, include some level of what I would say is kind of normal inflation, the levels that were being talked about at the time. We don't see anything that is outside of our expectations that were embedded in the original guidance and that's part of the reason why we were able to continue to raise the guidance for the beat that we saw in the first quarter. I'll note that with our structure in our relatively high margins on both storage and service, it does result in with inflation, the opportunity to price that much more incremental profitability for us. And as you know we kind of price comparing to other logistics companies. So in some respects, it helps a little bit with our revenue management program. In terms of funding growth, a couple of thoughts. One, obviously, we're continuing to expand EBITDA, thanks to Summit and the team's underlying performance, we will be doing a level of capital recycling this year, call it $125 million is what's embedded in the guidance. I'll note that the market there is very favorable and we continue to like cap rates. And so those would be the principal things I'd mentioned in terms of where the yield is and where the stock is. We feel very good about our ability to fund our operations within our framework and so we'll be funding from things like recycling and the growth in EBITDA. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Atkin of RBC. Jon Atkin : Thanks. So, I guess a commercial question, and then more of an M&A question. I was wondering, as you think about your leasing objectives, where you see the greatest potential in your supplemental, there's obviously a very good layout of your pre-stabilized portfolio, the expansion pool, and new development. I can imagine any one of those three would be potential sources of new pre-leasing or leasing. But within those three categories, is there one or two that kind of standout as - of those categories that stand out as to where you see the most potential for these through the balance of the year? Bill Meaney : Thanks, John. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We think about it kind of two different ways. So, if you look at say, in the US, some of our two really large campuses, which would be obviously Northern Virginia and Phoenix is a lot of our expansion and development in those sites is driven by line of sight to customer conversations that we're having, which you can imagine, because those are large campuses that attract a lot of attention from customers, both on the co-location as well as the hyper-scale side. If we look at some of our European markets, it's more just based on the dynamics and the absorption versus the level of capacity in those markets, like places like Frankfurt, London, etc. So I think it's kind of two different worlds. And then the same thing in New Jersey, it's a high reasonable levels of absorption with the right balance of supply. So I think it's a mix, there are some cases where it's purely on market dynamics. And there are other areas where we really liked the conversations we're having with a number of customers, especially around some of our large campuses. Jon Atkin : Okay. And then if you could maybe just refresh us on going forward interest level in inorganic expansion, and so whether that's sale leaseback private read portfolios, shells that are occupied by cloud players, and so forth. I think there's been a little bit of cap rate compression recently, for instance, in the US, but just interested in any updates or thoughts on types of M&A that you would continue to entertain? Bill Meaney : Okay. Yeah, there's kind of - I think I understand two parts of your question. So first of all, on the M&A, we feel really good about the platform that we have, as it is today, so we don't anticipate any large M&A. I mean, they're obviously - the Web Werks in India is what I would call a more of a brownfield situation where it's a smaller M&A deal that gives us a platform for further Greenfield build out in what we think is a really interesting and high growth market, just like we did EvoSwitch a few years ago in the Amsterdam market, right, which again was kind of a brownfield. So, if we're talking about those kinds of things where we do a make versus buy situation for entering into a market or expanding in a market, we will continue to look at those kinds of what I would call small M&A deals. But, large platform M&A deal, we don't see we really have the need. I think partly, we are already in 56 countries for many decades as an operator, so we feel we have good cultural fit in the countries that we operate in. And we already have a pretty good international spread across our data center business, so we feel really good. On the capital allocation question I would just reiterate with what Barry said before is, we feel that between EBITDA growth and opportunities to recycle capital, like what we're doing in our industrial portfolio where the cap rates are, we think, really low. We like that trade of trading in exposure on industrial right now and putting more capital at work in data center. Operator : Last question is a follow up from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes, two quick questions. Margin improvement of 100 basis points was a positive, how should we think about that, as the year progresses? And is more of the improvement on cost of sales or SGA? And my second question is Bill, you mentioned existing own sites could potentially be repositioned as for data center. Just wondering, have you done that already or is anything underway? Bill Meaney : No, thanks. So, Sheila, I'll answer your question on the edge data center deployments using our existing footprint. At this point, it's only a conversation. So there are a couple specific sites that we're looking at in Europe at the moment with customers but it's still early days, I would say. But I'm encouraged by the conversations we're having there and the flexibility that our industrial real estate footprint potentially gives us down the road. Barry Hytinen : Sheila, thanks for the question. It's Barry. Couple of things. Certainly, as we move into the second quarter, we're looking for EBITDA to be approaching 400 million, which is very nice growth rate and reflects, to some extent, of course, last year's COVID impact. And as you work through the model, you'll find another continued nice growth in EBITDA going forward. I will say, I think a notable call out, frankly, in the first quarter, is the fact that our cost of sales are actually down about $15 million, despite sales being up. And that is a testament to the team's strong progress on Project Summit. As we talked about before, Project Summit in 2021 is vastly going to be benefiting cost of sales as opposed to SG&A, just in light of the sorts of operational improvements that we talked about and highlighted, such as service delivery, changes, etc. And so you really saw that starting to come to fruition in the first quarter with the vast majority of that Summit benefit year-on-year that I called out being in cost of sales. And that's a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year. Appreciate the questions, Sheila. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including our Q2 outperformance, the increased momentum in the business, our updated outlook for 2021 financial guidance, the continued growth in our data center business and the strong performance in our growth areas. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliation to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill. Bill Meaney : Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. This morning we reported record second quarter financial results with revenue of more than $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $406 million. This strong performance in both Q2 in the first half of the year reflects the breadth and depth of our products and solutions and the strength of our deep customer relationships. Our second quarter results especially reflect increased demand for our services across our key markets in is based upon these strong results in the increased momentum in the business that has caused us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance as well has increased the expected bookings in our data center business. As we celebrate and honor Iron Mountain\u2019s 70th anniversary this month, I am extremely proud of what our team has accomplished in growing our relationships with our large and diverse customer base in spite of the continued challenges due to COVID. Our Mountaineers across the globe have conquered every obstacle with tenacity, and an innovative mindset all with a focus on accelerating growth and services to assist our customers. Before we dive into our record results and the positive momentum in our business, I want to take a moment to reflect on the current situation with the pandemic in new variants, still wrecking havoc in many parts of the world. In addition to operational complexities, we\u2019re also dealing with the realities of a workplace and the world changed forever by the COVID-19 pandemic. At Iron Mountain, we\u2019re thinking how we can move forward instead of getting back to normal. All whilst remaining diligent to ensure the physical and mental health as well as the overall safety of our teams, their families, and our customers. As I mentioned earlier, this year we celebrate 70 years of Iron Mountain. It\u2019s a legacy with a rich inspired past, which continues inspiring the future. Since that day on August 24, 1951, we have built, evolved and expanded our trusted relationship with our customers to include not just the leading storage platform of physical assets, but now includes a rapidly increasing range of business services. These new services are centered around data center co-location, information security, data, insights, IT asset disposition in business process management. And today, with this broadened portfolio of services and storage capabilities, we have become an innovative and global leader in our field with more than 225,000 customers including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000, a global footprint of more than 1,450 facilities with a presence in 58 countries and 24,000 dedicated Mountaineers across the globe. And doing all this within an energy sustainable way, with a 100% of our data centers powered by renewable energy. Many of the things about us have changed in 70 years. What hasn\u2019t changed is our core values and commitment to building and delivering on the trust our customers have come to count on. Over the last two quarters we shared with you that we now have an expanded total addressable market or TAM of more than $80 billion. And against that expanded TAM, we\u2019ve identified the building blocks for growth that will enable future growth and success. And in fact, you can already see evidence of this expansion through our year-on-year digital service revenue growth together with secure IT Asset Disposition or ITAD. In this quarter versus a year ago, these business lines have grown over 37% resulting in $25 million of incremental growth. I want to highlight a few examples, which illustrate our progress in helping our customers through utilizing new technologically enabled approaches and products to not only protect, but unlocked value from what matters most to them. The first one I want to highlight is in Singapore with a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We won a $750,000 annual recurring revenue, digital mailroom contract over their current service provider. At first, the bank didn\u2019t believe that Iron Mountain could solve this need for them as they had only known us for support \u2013 to support their storage and scanning requirements. However, the account came pursued the opportunity and highlighted Iron Mountain strengths utilizing a new technologically based approach, which allows us to assist in managing the very start of much of the information entering the bank while securely facilitating a hybrid office and home working model. As we are already this customers partner for business process outsourcing and processing much of the bank\u2019s critical information. The mail room is a key additional service, which will yield further security and simplicity for the bank. Turning to another area representing part of our expanded TAM, I want to touch briefly on secure ITAD. Think of this as an area where we apply our highly secure chain of custody with a service that allows our customers to dispose securely in an environmentally responsible way their IT assets, which are at end of life. We have continued to see good momentum in our secure ITAD solution following a number of big wins last quarter. We won a deal with one of the world\u2019s largest banks to recycle corporate laptops, monitors and outdated IT equipment across over 400 corporate offices, 4,000 conference rooms and 5,000 retail offices, which we expect to generate annual run rate revenues greater than $5 million. This is a valuable offering given our expertise in chain of custody and compliance, helping customers securely dispose of their IT equipment. Turning to our data center business. We want to share not only our continued growth in top and bottom line, but some recent exciting developments in the last month, which has led us to increase our guidance for expected 2021 leasing from 25 to 30 megawatts to over 30 megawatts, not including additional leasing expected from the recent acquisitions in Frankfurt and India. Our increased guidance around leasing activities and based upon the momentum have seen in the business in the first half of the year, as well as the pipeline. Today, we announced not only the 3.6 megawatts of new leases, we signed in the second quarter, but also a 6 megawatt lease with a new logo to our platform that was signed post Q2 in Northern Virginia. Taken together along with our strong results in Q1, we have recorded a total of 19 megawatts of new and expansion leases in the first seven months of the year. This is a great launching off point for the remainder of the year. And we feel confident we will achieve leasing activity above the top end of our original guidance. Turning back to Q2. It should be noted of the 3.6 megawatts we leased in the quarter and majority was in the retail and enterprise segments. This result in an attractive pricing for the quarter, which increased 14% sequentially. Our strongest markets in terms of new and expansion leasing were Phoenix, Singapore and Northern Virginia. Finally, in terms of development, you likely saw from our recent press releases our data center business is expanding rapidly in Europe. We have a new 27 megawatt Greenfield build in London, adjacent to our existing London one facility, as well as the pending acquisition of a multitenant co-location data center in Frankfurt. Taken together, this will increase our total potential capacity in Europe to more than 88 megawatts. And we\u2019ll provide access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for a reliable, flexible and secure data center location. As always sustainability continues to be a top priority. And as part of our commitments, we will power our new buildings in London and Frankfurt with a 100% renewable energy. Before I hand the call over, I also wish to touch upon some new product areas, which are leading to more growth in our traditional storage areas. One of these newer product offerings is clean start, which is a service that helps customers navigate today\u2019s changing workplace requirements from reconfiguring the office the social distancing to office closures, or moving to a more digital way of working. Since inception the clean start product has generated over $19 million in revenue and has uncovered $1.1 million net new cube over a three-year period. In 2020, we decided to expand clean start globally with all regions engaged and growing the program. Since taking the business globally, we have seen an acceleration in bookings specifically in the first half of 2021, clean start has delivered $5 million of new revenue or some 25% of the total revenue from this program since its inception three years ago. A specific customer example in this quarter includes a $1.8 million deal with a leading global hotel chain over the next five years. Due to challenges from the pandemic, the customer needed solutions to help with compliance and storage of materials. This customer has been with Iron Mountain for years at an individual hotel level and its corporate team saw the value in our scale, breadth of offerings, compliance expertise and risk reduction solutions. This prompted the decision to deploy our services across 103 hotels plus an additional 15 one-off sites as required. We were able to manage much more than just the record storage, also meeting the destruction needs and providing Image on Demand services, all of this being done company-wide at a scale unmatched by any other provider. Another example, which showcases our innovative new products, which drive records volume and services growth is Smart Sort. Our customers want to reduce costs and risks by defensively destroying records as they meet retention requirements, which is difficult to do if records are not stored by the destruction eligibility date. For example, many healthcare accounts store records by patient number or last date of visit and not by retention requirement. With Smart Sort, we organize the records by destruction date, so the customer knows what they can destroy and when. Our team understood a pervasive customer problem took a customer centric approach and proactively came up with a solution to solve it with Smart Sort. Just in the last year, we\u2019ve had 10 healthcare vertical wins for Smart Sort with our most recent win with Johns Hopkins Medical Center. The agreement is a five-year term, which includes a $1.2 million Smart Sort move project, bringing in additional 160,000 cubic feet of inventory, representing over 4 million individual patient records. Reflecting some of these successes, total global volume grew to a record 733 million cubic feet this quarter. In spite of organic volume being down 10 basis points in the second quarter versus the first quarter, total global organic volume was up 1.6 million cubic feet in the first half of the year. And we continue to expect organic volume to be flat to slightly up for the full year. This expected organic volume together with continued strong price increases sets us up well for continued strength in organic storage revenue growth from our physical business areas. In closing, I want to say thank you to the 24,000 Mountaineers, who have done an outstanding job navigating through the pandemic. I\u2019m extremely proud of their relentless dedication to each other and our customers. With a resilient business model, ongoing market share growth and strategic investments to transform the company, we are excited about the significant opportunities ahead of us, which continued to exceed even our ambitious targets. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us. The second quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue and activity levels. Our core physical storage business performed well and we are seeing great progress in our growth areas. Reflecting that progress and the outperformance in the first half, we increased the midpoint of our financial guidance. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1, billion grew 14%, total organic revenue increased 10%. Organic service revenue increased $81 million or 26% and was ahead of our expectations. Our team drove strong growth in both our Global Digital Solutions business and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% with continued benefit from pricing together with positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $406 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team delivered better than expected Project Summit savings together with the revenue beat. AFFO was $246 million or $0.85 on a per share basis. If you recall, last year\u2019s the AFFO benefited from a $23 million tax refund, adjusting for this AFFO would have increased 8% year-over-year. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO also reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. Turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $993 million, an increase of $116 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 9.1%. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.9% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven primarily by pricing and volume. We added about 4.5 million cubic feet from our acquisition in Indonesia, which closed during the quarter. Our traditional services business continued to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 24% year-over-year and 4% from the first quarter. Our Global Digital Solutions business continued to display strong momentum, growing 24% year-over-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $430 million, an increase of $47 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 50 basis points year-over-year as a result of mix given the strong service revenue growth. Sequentially, EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points due to Project Summit benefits and the contribution from pricing. Turning to our Global Data Center business, where the team continues to perform exceptionally well. We booked at 3.6 megawatts in the quarter and through the first half, we have booked at 12.6 megawatts. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we signed a 6 megawatt lease in Northern Virginia. Based on the year-to-date performance and the strength of our pipeline, we increased our full year leasing target to more than 30 megawatts, which would represent a 23% increase in bookings. In terms of revenue, as we projected growth accelerated sharply to 15% year-over-year. We continue to plan for full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens. The combination of our strong prior year bookings and the team\u2019s leasing performance year-to-date provides high visibility. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.4% increased 60 basis points from the first quarter and was ahead of our expectations. As compared to our prior outlook, the improvement was driven primarily by timing related to the Frankfurt build-out we discussed last quarter, which has been modestly delayed. As a result, we now expect more of the work associated with that project to occur in the second half, which will result in a temporary impact on segment margins on the order of three points relative to the second quarter level. Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $42 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. With the strength of the team\u2019s performance year-to-date, we now expect year-on-year benefits from Summit to approach $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $136 million, with $100 million was growth and $36 million was recurring. Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive, as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop in the second quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $203 million of proceeds. Year-to-date, we have generated $215 million in proceeds compared to our previous guidance of $125 million. With our strong data center development pipeline, we are now expecting to generate full year proceeds of approximately $250 million. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $2.1 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times slightly better than our projection and down from both last year and last quarter. This marks our lowest leverage level since year-end 2017. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range and estimate we will exit the year at levels similar to the second quarter. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase the midpoint of our 2021 financial guidance. There are three factors driving the improved projections. First, operational performance in the second quarter was better than expected and we have good momentum in our key growth areas. Second, we have identified additional benefits from Project Summit, primarily related to opportunities that our commercial team has been able to uncover. And third, we have acquired a small records management business in Morocco that will add about $5 million in revenue. Conversely, as compared to our prior guidance, there are two headwinds I would call out. First, we divested our Intellectual Property Management business in early June. Compared to our prior guidance, this represents a reduction of approximately $20 million of revenue and $15 million of EBITDA. Second, since May, the stronger U.S. dollar is more of a headwind by nearly $20 million for revenue and $7 million for EBITDA. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.415 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.6 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth of 8% and EBITDA growth of 10%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $970 million to $1.05 billion and AFFO per share of $3.33 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 11% and 10% growth respectively. Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year and with continued benefits and pricing, we anticipate low single digit growth in total organic storage revenue. For services, we expect to maintain positive revenue growth through remainder of the year. With the ongoing pandemic, we believe it is helpful to share our short-term expectations. For the third quarter, we expect revenue and EBITDA to both increase approximately $10 million sequentially from the second quarter levels. We expect AFFO to be slightly in excess of $250 million in the third quarter. In summary, our team is executing well. We have seen positive trends in the macro environment and our pipeline continues to build. The momentum we had entering the year has strengthened, our addressable market continues to expand and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the third quarter. And with that operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes, good morning. The services rebound was very strong in the quarter, and I understand it\u2019s based on some new products, which you called out. Just wondering if there\u2019s more leverage as people returned to the office in some of your services businesses that have been held back from the pandemic or people working from a home. Is there more leverage for those businesses to increase as people return to office? Bill Meaney : Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So first, I appreciate the call out it. We\u2019re really pleased with the organic service revenue approaching 26% in this quarter, which we thought was just a very strong result. And as you pointed out, that was really driven by a lot of our new digital solutions, which was well north of 30% growth if you take ITAD and digital services combined. I think your question on the traditional service side is a good one, because what we\u2019ve seen actually is an increase in the backlog of incoming cube, which quite frankly, we haven\u2019t been able to get at in some countries because of continued rolling lockdowns or intermittent lockdowns. So we do expect has some of the lockdowns get ease that on the traditional service lines that \u2013 we know that there\u2019s a backlog of incoming cube that we haven\u2019t been able to access the offices for. So I think there will be some in the medium term in that area, how big it\u2019s hard to judge right now. Operator : The next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My question is on Project Summit, you mentioned that you\u2019re realizing additional benefits from Project Summit. That\u2019s causing you to raise your guidance and you talked about expectations of $160 million savings with another $50 million next year. So how much of the upside in savings represent the pull forward from future periods? Or would you say, this is like an increase in total savings from Project Summit. And can you just sort of map out the entire timeline of when you would expect to realize the full amount of project savings over the next couple of years. Maybe related to that the Project Summit savings, how does your increased investment into growth initiatives impact the flow-through of Project Summit savings in terms of margin expansion opportunity. Thank you. Barry Hytinen : Okay. Hi, George, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the questions. So we feel really good about the way the team is progressing with respect to Project Summit. The full program we anticipate generating $375 million of benefit. You\u2019ll recall that last year, we generate about $165 million of benefit. And year-to-date, together with last year, so program to-date, we\u2019re at about $257 million of benefit. We will end the year with all of the run rate savings in the numbers. So we expect to be exiting the year at the full program benefit that leaves about $50 million of year-on-year benefit next year. And so you should be penciling something about $70 million of incremental year-on-year benefit in the back half, probably split pretty equally this year with that $50 million remaining. So we feel great about the way the program is progressing. The team is executing well. You asked about investments. What you will see is we certainly did as part of Summit, invest in certain areas like our commercial organization, innovation, our global strategic accounts organization, and you would see that in our SG&A expenses this year, if you look at our SG&A year-on-year, it\u2019s up excluding stock compensation expenses of about $16 million and actually more than all of that is in the commercial organization supporting growth. And so we \u2013 both in the form of increasing that organization, as well as some variable costs that go along with the great sales performance year-on-year, like, variable compensation expense. So you are seeing those expenses in the numbers already, and we expect that you will continue to see very good performance out of the team on Summit. Thanks. Bill Meaney : Yes. And the other thing I would just add to it, Barry, I think, Barry\u2019s last point as important as the $375 million is a net number. So obviously we\u2019re making a lot of investments to transform the business, but the $375 million is net of all the investments we\u2019re making. Operator : The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I just still focus a little more on the services business, obviously that seems to be doing a lot better you have new products and things coming to market. And I was just wondering, is there some impact on the margin from the mix of the newer products? It just seems like the gross margin was down sequentially, despite higher revenue, is they had kind of a ramp thing that\u2019s going on. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on how that\u2019s going through. Barry Hytinen : Sure. Hey, Shlomo. It\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. We feel really good about the way the team\u2019s performing in our services organization, as you know the revenue is up considerable amount both year-on-year and sequentially. While the gross margin is a tick down, call it, 40 basis points, I\u2019ll note that, that is driven by the fact that revenue in that line outstripped our projections. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks and if you look at versus our projections last quarter \u2013 for the quarter, we beat revenue by about $25 million round numbers, the vast majority of that was in services. So we certainly did to maintain customer service and we did have some level of, what I would consider like, surge expenses related to servicing that uptick in demand. And then I think you should expect that that will even out as we move forward. The decline in gross margin is about $1 million. So it\u2019s not a tremendous amount. We feel good about the margins we\u2019re generating off the new product offerings to Bill\u2019s point on our Global Digital Solutions and our Secure IT Asset Disposition. Those are very nice margins. The other thing I\u2019ll note is, our \u2013 if you work through the numbers in our services area on EBITDA, the EBITDA margin in that business was actually up 100 basis points sequentially, and that was up 640 basis point year-on-year. So we feel good about the way our services are performing. Thanks for the question. Operator : The next question is from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hey, good morning. A couple of data center questions, if I may. There\u2019s over $6 million of leasing per megawatt that you did in July. Was that single hyperscale lead, maybe give some detail on that? And then also, if you could talk about your outlook for pricing for the data center business, more specifically on renewals and mark-to-market over the next few years, because I think there\u2019s been some crosscurrents in this space and your data center peers have said different things, when it comes to that. So I\u2019m curious to hear, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the outlook for renewal pricing. Bill Meaney : Good morning, Nate. I appreciate the question. So first on the 6 megawatts, yes, we really pleased to say, it\u2019s a single customer for our Northern Virginia campus hyperscale and it\u2019s a new logo to us. So on \u2013 just a number of fronts, it\u2019s just a great \u2013 it\u2019s a great customer win. And as you can see, our \u2013 we keep expanding capacity in our Northern Virginia campus based on the pipeline that we see even beyond that. So really congratulations to the team. I think in terms of the pricing, you\u2019ve noticed this month, we were up slightly. So we thought that was actually a good trend. I think generally what we\u2019re blessed being in that sense, relatively newcomer to the data center space that we don\u2019t have as many historical customers that were originally sold in at higher than what today market prices are. So most of our customers, because we\u2019ve been growing very quickly over the last few years are relatively new customers that are at, what I would call, new and \u2013 the new pricing level. So we don\u2019t have as much pressure as some of our older peers that have had that. With the exception, we\u2019ve called out in the last few quarters from time to time, when we did acquisitions, we knew we were acquiring some customers that had been with our acquired companies for a long time and that those were rolling off. So generally, we feel pretty good where we are on pricing. You notice that this quarter, we were on the 3.6 megawatts we were up quarter-on-quarter on pricing. And that was really more about mix that we were highly focused on collocation or retail and enterprise customers, which obviously come at higher pricing. So generally, we don\u2019t see a big change in the pricing on customers that we\u2019ve acquired or brought into facilities that we\u2019ve acquired. Operator : The next question is from Michael Funk from BoA. Please go ahead. Michael Funk : Yes, thank you for the questions. Just one of the refocus on the RIM business for a moment, you made a comment saying as a backlog of incoming cubes. I\u2019d love to get more thoughts there on, how that might impact volume moving forward. But then also took out the last quarter, would love any kind of commentary just on the volume trends you\u2019re seeing, whether that\u2019s the growth additions, the churn, and then how acquisitions also impacted the volume in the quarter. Bill Meaney : Thanks. Thanks for the question. Good morning. I think that couple things, I would say. First of all, if we look at on the Records Management business, we see a very \u2013 if you look at quarter-on-quarter over the last, say four or five quarters, we see kind of pretty much the same kind of trends that bumps up and down. So we don\u2019t see a big change in terms of the net volume trends in that part of the business. I do think that, because of the shutdowns that I referred to earlier in a number of our countries, we have seen a significant increase in backlog, waiting for people to be able to get back to office to allow us access to bring that in, so that\u2019s positive. But if you just look overall in terms of our total physical storage business, we\u2019re really pleased with how that\u2019s coming out. Because if you look across the portfolio of our physical storage businesses, the first year \u2013 the first half of the year, where we\u2019re up organically in terms of volume, we expect the second half of the year in terms of our physical storage business to continue that trend. So overall, the year we say flat to slightly up, but, as I say, we\u2019re up slightly in the first half when we expect the second half to look the same. And then we add the normal price increase on top. So we feel really good in terms of where we\u2019re sitting on the general trends and the trends within each of those segments of our physical storage business seem to be relatively consistent. I think, it will be a short-term uptick once we can access some of the boxes that were \u2013 that have been ordered for us to pick up. But I think that\u2019s more to do with a one-off transition as we hopefully get out of COVID. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] Management. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. One of my questions you\u2019ve already answered, but your company obviously has a larger workforce than a typical REIT. So I was wondering and you touched on some of the costs and how it\u2019s expected to even out over the balance of the year. But I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the ease or the lack thereof that you guys were able to source new employees, retain employees. And also to what degree, wages are moving up. And do you expect that to accelerate in the back half? Bill Meaney : I appreciate the question. So maybe what we\u2019ll do is, I\u2019ll answer the first bit, in terms of the acquisition of employees, because it\u2019s a really good point. And then I\u2019ll let Barry comment on the inflation that we see across our business, not just on labor. I will just say, inflation for us generally is our friend, because we have such high 75% \u2013 70% to 75% gross margin business then, obviously, and we\u2019re able to price pretty aggressively against that. So it generally creates a tailwind towards our margins. On accessing talent, look, it is luckily \u2013 we\u2019re blessed with a very strong culture. So if you look at our employees and I\u2019m referring mainly to our frontline employees, who really are the heart and soul of the company, these are the people that you see our trucks out on the road or people see our folks coming into the facilities or the people that keep the lights on in our data centers. They are very long-term employees. Culture is very strong and we have very low churn, for a service company, probably one of the lowest churns in the industry. So we\u2019re blessed that we don\u2019t have a lot of outflow of employees. That being said, the growth that we\u2019re seeing in a number of our service areas, as well as our data center means that we are actively going out there and acquiring talent. And I\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s tough at sometimes, but our biggest reference, our current core employee growth. So we haven\u2019t seen a situation where we haven\u2019t been able to grow with the demand except as a backlog I mentioned, because we just can\u2019t access facilities. And there has been some short-term blips that Barry called out in terms of we had to use some expedited labor in a couple of cases, so that we could meet the demand. But generally, we feel that our culture has been our friend in terms of being able to acquire the necessary talent. Barry Hytinen : Rob, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the recent pickup of coverage. We appreciate that. On your question is related to inflation, I\u2019ll say that, beginning of the year, I would say we were quite prudent with respect to our guidance on inflation, obviously, that\u2019s a topic that\u2019s very much in the popular culture right now. We \u2013 one of the reasons we can be confident in our guidance and increase the midpoint today is that, what we are seeing is not outside the realm of what we baked into our original guidance. And if you look at our cost of service label, for example, you actually see that we\u2019re generating productivity, they\u2019re both sequentially and year-on-year. And so we feel good about where we are and appreciate the interest. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Thanks for the question. Wondering on the capital recycling front, so you guided to $250 million this year, and it seems like cap rates continue to be pretty attractive kind of the low 4% range. So if I recall, I think you have just north of $2 billion of industrial real estate in your portfolio. How much that over time do you think you could potentially sell them, given the attractive valuation environment? I mean, do you think you could do even more in the near-term than you had previously guided? Thanks. Barry Hytinen : $125 million and I\u2019m just increased it to $ 250 million : I think from a standpoint of going forward, you are thinking about it the right way. We\u2019ve got a large portfolio and we see the opportunity \u2013 opportunistically continue to recycle a \u2013 relatively small amount. Without giving forward guidance, we\u2019d historically said, you something on the order of a $100 million a year, maybe even $125 million a year as a planning posture. Obviously, our recycling efforts are back in circumstances we driven both based on what\u2019s out there in terms of cap rates, as well as what we need from a development pipeline. I will say that one of the benefits of our businesses in light of the growth in EBITDA and the cash generation of our core business, which is just tremendous. We see the opportunity to continue to fund our development, both from internal growth of EBITDA and cash generation, as well as this sort of modest recycling. So that\u2019s the way I would think about it. And I appreciate your interest. Operator : Next, we have a follow-up question from Shlomo Rosenbaum. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much for letting me back in here. One of the \u2013 just a question on understanding the volume \u2013 physical volume trends in aggregate. There\u2019s just over $5 million of volume from business acquisitions in the quarter and I was trying to \u2013 is that all in the wind business? And if I kind of assumed that, it looks like the room sequentially went down by $2.8 billion \u2013 $2.8 million. And I\u2019m just trying to understand the last quarter, we kind of leveled out a little bit and it seemed to come down a little bit more this quarter. And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, is there a stabilizing trend, a continued trend with a little bumps here and there. And just to basically try to understand that. And with the understanding that the other businesses seem to be outgrowing it in terms of the adjacent business and consumer other, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of that RIM side. Barry Hytinen : Hi, Shlomo, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. Let me clarify that of the $5 million, about $4.5 million is in the core. That\u2019s from the small deal we did in Asia, which is a $4.5 million acute. The rest is in the adjacent business category. And so when you work that through the model, you should find that the core was down just about 30 basis points, which to your point is \u2013 Bill\u2019s earlier comments, very consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing even a little bit better than where we were, let\u2019s say, a year, year and a half ago, in terms of sequential performance. We continue to feel good about our core business and expected as we guided earlier to be flat to slightly down on an organic basis for the full year. And in light of the dynamics that Bill mentioned in terms of the backlog for incoming cube and likely for the pandemic to continue to ease over time. We expect that that performance will continue to bump along and maybe even slightly improved. So we feel really good about where we are there.

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sarah Berry of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sarah Berry : Thank you, Chris. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO, and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. After prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill Meaney : Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model, and the strength of our team. This can be easily highlighted by our 7.4% total organic revenue growth. This strong overall organic revenue growth has been delivered by continued strength in our storage business, as well as double-digit growth in our new and existing digital offerings, including data center inside our digital transformation services, and IT asset disposition or I-Tech.  Throughout the pandemic, including the most recent challenges of the Delta variant, our Mountaineers around the world have truly stepped up. Each and every day to put our customers first with a focus on growth. I'm both proud and humbled by this incredibly talented and dedicated team and what we've been able to accomplish through such a challenging time. Today's results, including our strong organic revenue growth exceeding 7%, is a direct result of their dedication in serving our customers in ways they need to keep their businesses growing. We have a lot to cover today, so I'll start with a brief overview of our results and key business drivers.  During the third quarter, we reported revenue of over $1.1 billion EBITDA of over -- of EBITDA of $418 million, both of which are new record highs. Our results are fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets and continued positive momentum in the business. Our digital services in iPad business continue to build on its prior performance and deliver almost 20% growth in the quarter. Today, we're proud to say that 95% of the Fortune 1000 are among the 225,000 of our loyal customer base. We have a growing footprint of more than 1,460 facilities and with our recent expansion in the Middle East, we are now present in 63 countries. And we are supported by 25,000 Mountaineers across the globe. As we look ahead to future opportunities, there is no doubt the world has changed. But, we're making the improvements to our business today to serve the changed needs of the world tomorrow. That is why we have built, evolved, and expanded our trusted relationships with our customers as not only the leading storage platform of physical assets, but also the business services partner to support data center co-location, information security, data insights, Secure IT Asset Disposition and business process management.  With this focus, we have expanded our total addressable market to more than $80 billion. Together with our strong customer relationships, focus on innovation, and 70-year heritage, we are operating from a unique position of strength. Now let's turn to some of the exciting events during the quarter. You'll hear us talk a lot about customer - centricity here at Iron Mountain. And when we help our customers not only protect their information, but also unlock new revenue opportunities, as well as cost efficiencies. That's a big win for our customers, and ultimately, for us. We were proud to be featured as one of the winners of Google's first-ever Google Cloud Customer Award for Financial Services for our work with a large financial institution. This is a great follow-on award from a couple of years ago when we won their machine learning artificial intelligence partner of the year. But this award, we leveraged our expertise in mortgage document processing to train machine learning models to automate document classification and data extraction and validation, deliver advanced exception management and unlock value for our customers.  In line with our automation first mindset, we utilize Google's document understanding for AI algorithms in Iron Mountain's insight platform to identify, classify, extract and validate loan data to support authenticity, accuracy, and completeness. As a result of our services, the customer has seen efficiency improvements including a 25% post-closing cost reduction, increased scalability, a shortened cycle time, and increased responsiveness to market demand, among other enhancements. We are not only proud of our work with this financial services customer, but are also dedicated to continuing to enrich our customer's ability to protect and preserve their high-value assets in -- and in turn, a system with gaining market share in their businesses through higher end-customer satisfaction. I'm also pleased to report that Iron Mountain received the JP Morgan Chase Strategic Diverse Gold Supplier Award for our commitment to supplier diversity and the contributions of our very own supplier diversity program. Together with our fellow Gold Suppliers, we have collectively agreed to increase spending with diverse owned businesses and have set ambitious goals over the next three years. As part of this, we are on track to achieve our goal of $63 million in supplier diversity spend by the end of 2021. This is not just about our diversity goals, but it is also about helping our customers like JPMorgan Chase and our fellow Gold Suppliers to drive improvements in supplier diversity, which we recognize is important for all communities in which we operate.  By working together, we're having a far greater impact than any one company can achieve alone. I would now like to highlight our recent win working together with General Dynamics. You will recall we have been speaking for some time about the potential for our services inside the U.S. Federal Government. Whilst the transformation of the federal government has taken some time, we have seen over the past year major growth in our business across a number of governmental agencies. This growth is due not only to the residents that our products are having with the government and assisting them on their own transformation paths, but also to the work our government team has done in partnership with the likes of General Dynamics. This partnership is already resulting in a 3-year Iron Mountain contract worth $23 million to help the Department of Veteran's Affairs with their digital transformation in order to serve better our U.S. soldiers. As part of this initial project, we're helping the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs digitally process an estimated 15 million official military personnel files. Through digital transformation, this agency is taking a proactive approach to provide greater access to personnel files, as well as streamline the overall claims process in order to get veterans the benefits they deserve. In addition to our success with General Dynamics, I would like to highlight another win in our global RIM segment. We've had a long-standing relationship with a major global financial institution for over 20 years, and we have recently expanded our relationship with them, by signing a new 10-year global contract in which they committed to renew and consolidate all global records in data management business with us.  Through this work, along with our global scale, we won an additional two-year contract for data restoration and migration services. We will provide the customer with clear, detailed information from backup tapes spanning 11 years, which will help them make informed decisions around data deletion, retention, and remediation. Ultimately, we will reduce and enhance data management and compliance. Finally, turning to data center, we are well on track to exceeding our bookings target of 30 megawatts this year. In fact, through October, we stand at 24 megawatts in addition to our continued growth in bookings this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of our new data center in Frankfurt. When we purchased the new Frankfurt data center, we inherited over 2 megawatts of existing clients, and we have expansion capacity of 8 megawatts for a total of over 10 megawatts on that site.  Already in this quarter, we have signed 1.6 megawatts of new leases for this site and have a strong pipeline which should absorb the remaining capacity over the next 2 to 3 years. I should also add that our first in purpose-built data center in Frankfurt is up and running and a tenant which leases the entire 27 megawatts is moving in this quarter. With this transaction in Frankfurt, we now have a total potential capacity in Europe of more than a 107 megawatts, which provides access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for reliable, flexible and secure data center locations across the Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and London markets. Even with our rapid growth, sustainability remains at the core of how we offer data center capacity. Iron Mountain continues to source more than a 100% of its energy used for data centers from renewable energy.  Moreover, as we announced in April, we took a significant step forward in the development of enhanced solutions for purchasing renewable energy by entering into an agreement to track the hourly load. I'm proud to announce that this September, we were able to report on our performance for the first half of the year for our datacenters in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey that are benefiting from this agreement. Over the past several months, we have taken definitive steps towards a truly carbon-free energy supply.  Not just by offsetting our carbon footprint by purchasing and reselling renewables, but by matching renewable energy in the very grids in which we operate. We are the first company to join Google to adopt the 24/7 carbon-free energy goal, and we became a founding signatory to the new UN Clean Energy Compact being released at COP26 this week. We can already publish 24/7 carbon-free energy performance at 3 of our campuses, becoming the 1st large co-location data center provider with this capability. We recognize that we are an important component of our clients energy footprint and we will continue to take every opportunity to minimize our environmental impact on their behalf. The awards and successes I outlined today are just a few among the various wins Iron Mountain has achieved this quarter. As we continue to deliver accelerated growth at IRM, in spite of the continued impact of COVID on some of our traditional service areas, I am confident that our resilient business model expanded product portfolio, customer first culture, and strategic transformation will continue to deliver strong sales growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill. And thank you for joining us. The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend, we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue, reflecting accelerating rates of growth driven by the new service offerings Bill discussed. Our core physical storage business performed well, and we are seeing continued strength in our growth areas. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.13 billion grew 9%. Total organic revenue increased 7.4% year-over-year.  As an example of the momentum we are building on a 2-year basis, our organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic service revenue increased $61 million or 18%. Our team drove strong growth in both Global Digital Solutions business and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% with continued benefit from pricing and positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $418 million an increase of $42 million from last year. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team drove improved margin performance, despite the stronger U.S. dollar. AFFO $263 million or $0.90 on a per-share basis, up 47 million dollars and $0.15 respectively from the third quarter of last year. Turning to segment performance. In the third quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $996 million, an increase of 74 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 6% The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 2.7% or 1.8% on an organic basis. This performance reflects an acceleration in growth as compared to the last few quarters. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. With positive volume trends in the Mid East deal that Bill mentioned, total physical volume achieved a new all-time record of 744 million cubic feet. We are pleased with the underlying trends, and continue to expect total volume on an organic basis to be flat to modestly up for the full year.  Our traditional services business continue to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 14% year-over-year, all be at still down 4% from the levels achieved in 2019 reflecting the continued COVID impact. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $443 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points year-over-year as a result of strong operating leverage and improved service margins. Turning to our global datacenter business, our team booked 9 megawatts in the quarter. And through the end of the third quarter, we have booked at 22 megawatts.  With our strong and building pipeline and the additional contracts we've already signed this quarter, we are confident in our ability to exceed our full-year guidance of 30 megawatts. In terms of revenue as we projected, growth accelerated sharply to 22% year-over-year. In light of our strong performance year-to-date and prior-year bookings, we now expect full-year revenue growth of at least mid-teens percent, exceeding our prior projections. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% was consistent with the expectations we shared on our last call and driven by Buildout services at our Frankfurt facility. Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $38 million of the incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. We continue to expect year-on-year benefits from summit of $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $138 million of which $100 million was growth, and $38 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times slightly better than our projection. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4 and 1/2 to 5 and 1/2 times. For 2021, we expect to exit the year at levels at or below the third quarter.  From a cash cycle perspective, I would like to highlight that our team drove a two-day improvement from last year and specifically call out that our Days Sales Outstanding are at the best level they've been at in several years. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. Turning to our outlook. With the ongoing pandemic and where we are in the year, I feel it will be helpful to provide our view explicitly for this quarter. We expect total revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year in the fourth quarter.  For EBITDA, we expect percentage growth to be in the range of low double-digit to low teens year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect year over year AFFO growth in excess of 30% in the fourth quarter. As you may remember, last year we had an elevated level of maintenance capex in the fourth quarter as we caught up from pandemic-driven delays. On a more normalized level of capex spend last year, this implies at least 20% growth in AFFO in the fourth quarter of 2021. In summary, our team is executing well, our pipeline is growing, and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market continues to expand and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well-positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the fourth quarter. And with that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We will limit analysts to one question and you can then rejoin the queue. Our first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore, please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : I guess god morning. Bill and Barry. I've gotten questions from investors. that bottom line, growth, and margin improvement has benefited from Project Summit. And that benefit will be less of a factor going forward. Can you outline what revenue growth opportunities you are positive about for Iron Mountain looking out the next few years? And a related question to that is, can you also outline how you're able to effectively present such a broad offering of products to your customers when it appears there be different context at the -- at the customers for storage versus data centers versus insight. Bill Meaney : Good morning, Sheila. So I'll start with strategically in where the product portfolio is going and then let Barry comment a little bit more on the nuts and bolts in terms of margin. So thanks for the question. I think, first -- I think part of Project Summit, you've seen that show up in the record high EBITDA margin that we have this quarter, so thank you for the call out on that. And I think that that's an ongoing benefit that we'll have. That EBITDA margin may move up and down depending on the product mix and it comes to your product portfolio question. On the product portfolio, a part of Summit that you haven't seen directly, in other words it isn't in the margin, is we've also taken a lot of benefit of Project Summit and reinvested in the business.  So besides actually driving the margin improvement that we printed today, we've also reinvested in the business and that's really what's driven that total addressable market going from $10 billion to $80 billion that we've highlighted the last few quarters. And part of that $80 billion of new total addressable market is the almost 20% growth that we've seen in digital services, which is primarily our insight driven digital platform, together with IT Asset Disposal business.  Those are some of the new areas that I think you're highlighting behind your question. So we actually see -- that business is growing strong double-digits and we can see that continue. You take that on top of the growth and the continued acceleration in growth in our data center businesses so we're well on track to exceed our upgraded guidance last quarter of 30 megawatts of bookings for this year. Then I do -- we do expect to see -- continue with levels of revenue growth like we've seen the last few quarters. Because this growth that we've seen in the topline, whilst we have seen -- luckily, some recovery in terms of our traditional service business. I think it's fair to say that we've seen an acceleration in terms of our revenue growth that's really driven by the new product areas and less from what I would call a rebound from historically low activity due to COVID. I don't know, Barry if you want to comment a little bit around the margin? Barry Hytinen : Hi, Sheila. Good morning and thanks for the question. I would say when we look outlook and you look at where our margin has been recently, where it's going to continue to go, We have very favorable trends in pricing. I think that you will continue to see at least the level of pricing activity going forward as we've seen here over the last year or so. There's some macro trends there that are both positive for us I think on a pricing benefit. If you look at our data center business of the margin, as we talked about has on a transitory basis been a little bit lower than where we expect it to go over time.  That business is obviously dealing with some fit-out on our Frankfurt facility, which is transitory here in the third and the fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we see that margin expanding. So that's obviously a very nice secular tailwind to the business. And then I would say when you look at ongoing productivity, we continue to see that. So while Summit has been incredibly beneficial to the business and we'll have more Summit benefit year-on-year next year, we certainly see the opportunity for additional productivity. The only other thing I'll say is, as you know, since you follow the company well, we've had couple of relatively large sale leaseback transactions over the last 12 months. And while I expect to continue to do a relative amount of capital recycling, that's been a big headwind on a year-over-year basis. So if that comes down to a more -- a little more normalized level going forward, that's also a benefit. Operator : Thank you, sir. The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. As it relates to your overall growth portfolio, can you provide a sense of how quickly it grew and also discuss examples of recent success and traction outside of your Data Centers business? Bill Meaney : Yes. Thanks, George. If you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter, or just under 20% growth, that's all non Data Center. So that is the -- what we call ITAD or IT Asset Disposal business and we've won some recent large global contracts for that. Mainly for corporates that are trying to make sure that they both manage the secured destruction of any information that happens to be on their devices or hardware, as well as making sure that they can be managed in an environmentally friendly way. That's one part of it. And the other part of it is just the rapid growth that we've seen in adoption of our InSight platform and overall digitization of people's information.  So that's everything from people taking advantage to say, okay, when they're retrieving documents on a very simple basis, is we want to actually retrieve them electronically through the InSight platform where they can access those from a secure platform in the cloud, to Digital Mailroom, which is beyond the typical mail-room employee arbitrage model, but again allowing people to have not only access to the information that comes through their mail room, but to be able to operate in a hybrid work fashion. In other words, where people can work from home and the office and always have access to their information.  To even some, what I would call larger, more complex deals, I mean, I just returned from the Middle East about a month ago, where we're working with a government there and their National Archives to help them digitize everything about the way the government works. And that's again using the insight platform. But it's not just the insight platform, but auto classification of the documents to create metadata so that they can actually share the information digitally to the right people with the right security level in a way that can be managed for the long term. So it's multifaceted thing, but those are the areas that are really driving a lot of the top line growth that we see today. And as well as our data center business. I mean, obviously the data center business with the types of bookings that we have, will continue to drive increasing levels of growth. I should -- but I should not miss how it is, the underlying growth of the more traditional side of the business, mostly driven by pricing, continues to the chug along nicely. Operator : Thank you sir. The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mr. Rosenbaum, your line is open. Just check that you're not muted. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Sorry. I was muted. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the storage business and some of the puts and takes that went through it. It seems like there is some other -- with an acquisition something added about 10 million cubic feet. You guys are getting pricing. There's some organic growth. But when I go to the total revenue from adjusted storage when including the terminations and permanent withdrawal fees, it's really flattish sequentially. And so I was just want to ask you, what are some of the puts and takes that you might have seen on a sequential basis because I think you commented last quarter expecting some volumes to come in that will pent up from COVID-19. And was just wondering how this is translating into revenue as you build through the year. Barry Hytinen : Hi Shlomo, it's Barry, thanks for the question. I will try to unpack that for you. So you are right. We did close on the transaction in the Mid East, which we think is a great platform for us to continue to grow in that region together with our existing business. Now I will note that that closed very late in the quarter in the second half of September so really had almost no benefit to the quarter in terms of the financials, albeit it is in our cube as you note. So that didn't really help the sequential. On the pricing, you might recall that the beginning of the year and then again on the quarter call, I mentioned that all of the pricing we had planned for was already set as of March or April.  And so the sequential benefit on pricing was not much and we weren't planning for it. And then the other thing I'll call out, as you think about storage sequentially is we did divest the software escrow business in June, second -- first part of June last quarter. And so the sequential move from the second to the third on storage, that was completely storage business. So it's about $6 or $7 million of sequential decline due to that being in the second quarter, but not in the third quarter. So all in, we feel quite good. In fact, I'll be -- I'll tell you that the storage revenue performed better than we were planning on a sequential basis. And as it relates to the point about pent-up demand, you'll recall last quarter we did note that -- and that was in some of the economies, particularly in Asia and I'd say with the -- some of the COVID and Delta variant and various other elements that occurred in some of those markets, we continue to have a pretty good-sized backlog. Bill, anything you want to add? Bill Meaney : No. I think that's -- covers that. Operator : Thank you, sir. Then the next question is from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch upon fairly topical area in data centers today. A lot of talk in the industry about cost inflation in terms of development costs along with supply chain challenges and getting new equipment. Maybe you could just give us your perspective on what you're seeing in your footprint. Whether that's -- any development cost, inflation, any development delays in terms of timing. And also the impact of higher power cost, particularly in Europe. And then from a broader pricing perspective, do you think that this environment may be supportive of industry pricing moving upwards in the next couple of years as we work through all these challenges? Thanks. Bill Meaney : Thanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. So 2 or 3 points that I'll cover in your question. I think the first bit is that, I would say that for 2022 in terms of supply chain, we're pretty well covered just because of the lead time. But to your point is, we have seen I would say 10 to 12 weeks increase in supply chain or lead time on some of the MEP and related equipment, and even in Including steel in some markets. I think to your point is, we are seeing a lengthening of the supply chain, but I would say for 2022, we're well covered because that's already been in training committed contracts to actually do that build-out.  And we're -- now we're already looking at 2023 and we're factoring in that extended lead time for some of that equipment in our planning. So the good news -- the bad news is that the lead times have increased. The good news is that we're well covered for 2022, so we've got the time to make sure we incorporate that in our planning for 2023. So that's -- I would say one aspect. And in terms of the increase in the prices -- so we're pretty well hedged for the 2022 commitments that we have because those are contracts that we've already lead. So we are seeing an increase in inflation in some of those raw materials. That being said because this is a business where the cost of construction is well known and quite transparent to our customer base, is we see trends and we expect that to continue. Our pricing will go in line with the cost of build. So I think we're kind of naturally hedged given the transparency of these businesses. In terms of the power cost is that the -- again, we're pretty well covered for this year, but we have seen an uptick in pricing in pretty much all the markets as you -- as everyone's noticed. And I would say that -- first part is, I would say about 60% of our portfolio in 2022 will be pretty much straight power pass-through, so we don't have any exposure in terms of the power costs. The remainder, most of that is still on long-term -- we've contracted for the power long-term. So think of our business has north of 70% naturally hedged, and the part that isn't is is up for renewal during the course of 2022, or a big part of it is. So we don't really see power affecting us in any material way. And in fact, we see continued upward progression in terms of our EBITDA margins as we get into 2022. But thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you, sir. Next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan, please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, this is Alex on for Andrew Steinerman. Our question is regarding your guidance. Your guidance for high-single-digit percentage growth in revenue and low double-digit to low teens percentage growth in EBITDA for fourth quarter appears to imply an adjusted EBIDTA margin of about 36.5%. Can you confirm that we're doing the math there right? Maybe speak to some of the drivers behind that? Thank you. Barry Hytinen : Hi, Alex. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. Why don't I help you with both the revenue and the EBITDA the way we are thinking about it. So in the fourth quarter, you right, we said about high single-digit. So let's say that's 8% or 9% on the revenue side just to give you a couple of the puts and takes. We have a -- the dollar is stronger as we have less than a point of FX benefit year-on-year, and a similar amount from M&A less than a point because just as a reminder, as I mentioned to Shlomo, we divested that software Escrow business in the second quarter. And so as a result, it's not much M&A benefit. So that leaves you with about call it 7% of organic constant currency growth. And with the strength of the Data Center business, that'll contribute probably 1.5 points alone because that business is performing very well and so you should be working with your model and think like 20 plus percent growth in the fourth quarter from our Data Center business. The balance would be coming from low-single-digit growth in our storage rental revenue. And that'll be with good pricing contribution. Course the remainder is as Bill 's highlighted on the call, the very nice growth we're seeing out of our Digital Solutions and SITAD business. On the EBITDA stand side, we're looking at low double-digit to low -- sorry, mid-teens growth. So let's say that's 13 or so percent just to keep the midpoint there. For the purpose of this discussion, that's about, call it, $48 million of year-on-year increase. FX is a very small contribution, almost nothing, and M&A would be actually a net negative on a year-over-year basis in light of the escrow business was a very high-margin. And so think about data center as having a modest increase in margin sequentially still affected by the fit-out in Frankfurt. So a few million of benefit to EBITDA from data center. Our Summit is -- our Summit Project is doing phenomenally well and the team is executing very well. You'll probably see $30+ million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter from that. And then of course, pricing will continue to be a very strong contributor. And the services margin, I expect to continue to improve which you've been seeing throughout the year. So naturally, there are some offsets with sale leaseback, as I mentioned earlier, and higher levels of commission in light of the very good trajectory the team is driving on top line. So we're feeling very good about the fourth quarter as we sit here today, and look forward to talking to you about it in 90 days. Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes our question and answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thank you, Emily. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. We are pleased to have delivered record performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. These record results are reflective of our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and our dedicated teams. Despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and most recently with the Omicron variant, our Mountaineers around the world have continued each and every day to put our customers first now with renewed and invigorated focus on growth. And our historically high revenue and profitability are a testament to our Mountaineers' commitment. Speaking about our Mountaineers, I wish to begin my remarks by stating that we are all saddened by the overnight events in the Ukraine. Our thoughts and prayers are with our customers there and our fellow 60 Mountaineers and their families living and working in the Ukraine. I am sure for all of us, given the current events in Europe, it deals in many ways inappropriate discussing our financial results with this backdrop. Yet at the same time, it is in keeping with our Mountaineer spirit. With that, let me begin our discussion of our remarkable and record year. In the fourth quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.16 billion, yielding 8.5% of total organic revenue growth and record EBITDA of $431 million. For the full year, we achieved record revenue of nearly $4.5 billion and EBITDA of $1.6 billion. These results were fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets. For the full year, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, reflecting continued benefit of pricing combined with positive volume trends. We drove double-digit growth in digital offerings, including data center inside our digital transformation services and secure IT disposition, now referred to as ALM, or asset life cycle management. Our digital services and ALM businesses continue to build momentum, growing over 20% in the fourth quarter and capping off an excellent year of growth. Further to our recent success in the ALM area, we are also pleased to report that the acquisition of ITRenew, announced in December, closed in January. This acquisition will accelerate our growth trajectory in this $30 billion market, which is growing over 10% per year. Our newly created ALM division will absorb our historical secure ITAD business line. This enlarged division not only helps us provide chain of custody for our customers' IT assets, but our ALM activities also assure our customers that their IT assets are wiped of any data at the end of their life and destroyed and recycled in a responsible way. On this last point, in terms of recycling, our expanded offerings in this space around a circular economy are important for both IRM's and our customers' ESG goals leading to carbon neutrality. This expanded ALM division also strongly complements our fast-growing data center business, bringing capabilities to serve some of the largest and most innovative companies in the world in a more cradle-to-grave way, consistent with the best security and ESG practices. This expanded ALM platform will directly benefit from Iron Mountain's 225,000 loyal customer base, which includes 95% of the Fortune 1000. This global customer base is supported by 25,000 Mountaineers across 1,450 facilities in 63 countries. Our recent expansions in data center, machine learning-driven data analytics and insights and now ALM are just some of the examples of how we continue to invest in growth to capitalize on our many opportunities ahead, serving a customer base which has been loyal to Iron Mountain for decades. I have shared with you previously how in the last 5 years, these investments have taken the total addressable market, or TAM, of our products and services from $10 billion to some $80 billion. I am happy to report our continued build-out of new products and services in the last year as well as growth in these underlying markets has now taken our TAM to over $120 billion. Our continued drive in building an ever-expanding set of synergistic and customer-centric solutions, together with global reach and scale, is the fuel behind much of the acceleration in our growth. Let me share a few examples of how we've been empowering our customers' success in growth through our diverse solution offerings and unmatched customer service. Our recent customer win with a large aerospace company, where we won a backfile digitization deal of over $20 million, is a superb example of collaboration amongst our entertainment services, technology organization and our global records organization, or GRO. In order to achieve its goal of being a 100% model engineering company and to most effectively use designs and data from historical archives to refine new designs, this aerospace company sought help with the digitization and auto classification of over 50 million digital engineering assets. We were tasked to store, classify and utilize machine learning to identify relevant information whilst maintaining compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations known as ITAR. To this end, we developed and implemented an ITAR-compliant solution using our InSight machine learning platform operating in the AWS government cloud environment. Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to assist our partner with this initiative with our storage capabilities, our understanding of ITAR compliance complexities, our machine learning-trained analytic engines and our technological support to ensure efficiency and success. Moreover, this project enables us to deliver critical insight into engineering data, not just to this company but also to other manufacturing and engineering customers across the globe. Another key win worth highlighting is with a branch of the U.S. federal government. We concluded a Phase 1 contract and have also been awarded a Phase 2 contract for this branch. The agency originally planned to select 3 vendors for the first contract due to the high volume of microfilm reels needing to be processed, but our solution surpassed the customer's expectations, and Iron Mountain was awarded the exclusive contract to process all 177,000 of microfilm reels or over 2 billion records needing analysis. This win was based on our unique splitting technique, proprietary machine learning, automated QA process and processing scalability that helped us to differentiate our offer from the competition. These technology innovations for the customer have enabled future use cases, which rely on advanced pattern recognition at scale, including OCR microfilm processing projects, applying machine learning extraction techniques for digital mailroom, invoice processing and extracting information from claims documents, to name a few. Another example how Iron Mountain is working with customers to support their digital transformation is our recent partnership with a production and development company operating in the U.K.'s North Sea. We've undertaken a significant back scan of their legacy archive records to meet their regulatory obligations to the U.K. oil and gas authority in order to relinquish their license to operate on 230 wells they wish to abandon. They're required to digitally upload all information assets to the National Data Repository. Using the InSight platform, we were able to solve the problem of having enormous amounts of data to sift whilst consolidating physical and digital data in disconnected information silos and resulting in millions of dollars of annual savings. Moving back above ground, recently in our Crozier Fine Arts division, we won a contract to provide comprehensive storage solutions and logistical support for the museum operations of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. We were excited and proud that based upon a foundation of long-term partnership and trust built up through many years of support from Iron Mountain's Entertainment Services division, they came to us to meet their evolving needs where Crozier services were an ideal match. Now turning to wins in our data center business. Recall that our bookings target for the year was 30 megawatts. We are pleased to have finished the year with nearly 49 megawatts of leases signed with over 27 megawatts of leases in the fourth quarter alone. This includes the new 20-megawatt lease in our Manassas, Virginia data center announced in December. This lease is expected to commence in phases from mid-2022 through mid-2023. We continue to see strong demand for comprehensive data center solutions from our existing customer base. This lease is indicative of our ability to meet that demand and reflects our commitment to strategically partnering with our customers to meet their individual requirements. Based on current design plans, we now expect that the VA2 facility to support 36 megawatts, up from 30 megawatts previously. With these changes and other additions to our portfolio, our total capacity is now in excess of 600 megawatts. Finally, we continue to be recognized for our leadership around ESG. This has been an important focus for us for many years, having produced annual sustainability reports outlining our commitments and progress since 2013. Some of our past recognitions have included : 100% of our data center power is generated by renewables; we were the launch provider of Green Power Pass, which allows our customers to report reductions in their carbon footprint when using our data centers; we were a co-signer with Google to expand our commitment to green-powered data centers to 24/7 carbon-free electricity; and we were one of the original signatories of the UN Global Compact on Sustainability back in 2016. More recently, we announced, in addition to their RE100 program, we have joined the Climate Group's EV100 initiative and reached a key milestone in electrifying our global vehicle fleet in line to reach our climate pledge commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. We have made real progress towards our carbon reduction goals. Since establishing our first science-based targets, we have reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions by over 60% from our 2016 baseline whilst growing the business. We believe that our commercial growth and ESG initiatives make us stand out, and we suspect they were a major factor of our being ranked amongst the top 100 on Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies. In summary, our future ahead is bright. We are building on our growth momentum as we expand our portfolio to meet our customers' evolving needs. And with our strong footprint, powerful portfolio and deep customer relationships, we are confident that we can continue this momentum as we ascend our mountain range and provide another set of performance records this year and the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results. In the fourth quarter, our team delivered strong performance, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. Before I dive into our results, I would like to take a moment to thank our dedicated Mountaineers for their outstanding performance and continued commitment to Iron Mountain. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.16 billion grew 9.4% year-on-year with total organic revenue up 8.5%. Revenue was $10 million ahead of the high end of the expectations we shared previously despite the U.S. dollar strengthening and being more of a headwind in the quarter. As an example of the momentum we are building, on a 2-year basis, our total organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic storage revenue grew 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting our strong pricing and data center commencements. Organic service revenue increased $65 million or 17.6% driven by continued strong growth in digital solutions and asset life cycle management. As revenue associated with our traditional transportation services were still down nearly 10% from pre-pandemic levels, we are even more pleased with this performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $431 million, an increase of $56 million from last year. As a result of strong flow-through driven by pricing and productivity, fourth quarter EBITDA exceeded the high end of our expectations by $6 million despite additional FX headwind. AFFO was $267 million or $0.92 on a per share basis, up $76 million and $0.26, respectively, from the fourth quarter of last year. In both cases, we significantly exceeded the high end of our expectations. Now let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $4.5 billion increased 8% on a reported basis and over 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% year-on-year to $1.635 billion, an increase of $159 million year-on-year. We achieved the high end of our full year guidance. AFFO increased 14% to $1.01 billion or $3.48 on a per share basis, in both cases, exceeding our full year guidance ranges. Now let's turn to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.02 billion, an increase of $76 million from last year or 8% on a reported basis from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 7%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 4.2% or 2.5% on an organic basis reflects our focus on revenue management and solid volume trends. With positive volume trends and growth in our adjacent and consumer businesses, total physical volume was in line with our expectations for the quarter and the year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $453 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 160 basis points year-on-year, reflecting continued pricing strength and productivity. Turning to our global data center business. Our team booked 27 megawatts in the quarter. For the full year, bookings came in at 49 megawatts, significantly exceeding our full year guidance of 30 megawatts. We are very pleased with the team's leasing performance. To give some historical context, we leased 10 megawatts in 2018, 17 megawatts in 2019 and excluding our joint venture in Frankfurt, 31 megawatts in 2020. In terms of revenue, as we projected, fourth quarter growth accelerated to 25% year-over-year. Storage revenue grew 18% year-on-year, and service revenue was up sharply and in line with our projections. As a reminder, service revenue in the second half includes fit-out services we are providing to our Frankfurt joint venture. We expect that activity will be completed early in 2022. Even with the large service component, EBITDA margin increased sequentially with strong commencements. We are pleased with our data center performance, and our pipeline has continued to strengthen, both in terms of hyperscale and retail colocation. In 2022, we expect to lease 50 megawatts, which would represent 28% annual bookings growth. We project full year data center revenue growth in a range of high teens percent year-on-year with even higher growth rates on storage. With our strong prior year bookings and recent commencements, we have very good visibility to revenue. With pricing and improved mix, we expect data center margin for the full year to be up modestly compared to 2021. Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $30 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. For the full year, as compared to 2020, Summit delivered $160 million of benefits. We continue to expect another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $219 million, of which $173 million was growth and $46 million was recurring. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $606 million, of which $309 million was growth capital related to data center development. In 2022, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million. We are projecting approximately $700 million of growth CapEx, with data center development representing about 3/4 of that. We expect recurring CapEx to approach $155 million. Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop, in the fourth quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $63 million of proceeds, bringing the full year to $278 million. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3x, in line with our projection and modestly improved compared to last quarter. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. For 2022, with the closing of the ITRenew transaction, we expect leverage to tick up modestly in the first quarter. We expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. In December, thanks to strong support from the fixed income community, our team successfully issued 10-year notes to support the ITRenew transaction. From a cash perspective, I would like to recognize our team for driving strong collections, improving our days sales outstanding and resulting in year-on-year improvement in our cash cycle. The collective performance has resulted in a 5-day improvement from pre-pandemic levels. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. Also, as you may have seen, we are pleased to announce an important strategic milestone related to our unconsolidated joint venture focused on the fast-growing valet consumer storage market. MakeSpace recently completed a merger with Clutter, a similarly sized business also focused on valet storage. We expect the combination will result in considerable benefits, including a focus on a single brand, Clutter, broader reach and natural synergies. Iron Mountain will continue to provide storage services to the business, and our ownership interest will be nearly 25% of the combined entity. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and expect continued benefit to our total physical volume. Now turning to our outlook. For the full year 2022, we currently expect revenue of $5.125 billion to $5.275 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion. At the midpoint, our guidance represents revenue growth of 16% and EBITDA growth of 12%. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $1.085 billion to $1.12 billion, which represents 9% year-on-year growth at the midpoint point. We expect AFFO per share to be in a range of $3.70 to $3.82. Our guidance assumes organic global physical volume will be consistent to slightly positive year-on-year. We expect revenue management will be a significant benefit, and I will note that the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today. And nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are planning for a continuation in the strong trends we are seeing in digital solutions and our organic ALM business, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. Our guidance also assumes the contribution from our acquisition of ITRenew. As we closed the deal at the end of January, we are including 11 months of the results in our guidance. Our guidance includes approximately $450 million of revenue from ITRenew. We estimate the stronger U.S. dollar will result in foreign exchange headwinds to revenue of approximately $60 million year-on-year with the vast majority of that in the first half. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth, the contribution from ITRenew as well as Project Summit benefits. Our EBITDA guidance also assumes a prudent outlook for inflation, rent from our recent sale leaseback transactions, increased innovation spend, the stronger U.S. dollar and the divestiture of the software escrow business, which we sold in late second quarter. With the ongoing volatilities in the market associated with the pandemic as well as the closing of the ITRenew transaction during the quarter, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. We expect total revenue to be in excess of $1.2 billion. We expect EBITDA to be approximately $425 million. We expect AFFO to be in excess of $250 million. In summary, our team is executing well. Our pipeline continues to expand, and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market has grown significantly over the last several years, and we expect this to continue to expand. We feel confident in our ability to deliver higher levels of growth. Thanks to our team's collective efforts, together with our strong customer relationships, brand position and investments in innovation, we feel very well positioned as we enter 2022. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Sheila McGrath : The revenue growth that you're targeting in 2022 is very strong. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on the drivers of that growth. And if it's more momentum in services, how should we think about the EBITDA margin in 2022 as compared to 2021? William Meaney : Thanks for the question. So I think I'll talk about, first of all, where the revenue growth comes. And then I'll let Barry comment a little bit on the EBITDA margin, the impact that has. So I think we continue to see 2022 to have the same kind of momentum that we had in 2021. And the momentum that you saw in 2021 was driven by 2 things. First of all, a very solid foundation from our GRO business across the globe. So that continues to drive low single-digit growth and highly profitable. And then a continued acceleration in terms of our new areas, which are everything that includes data center, the digitization platform, which uses the artificial intelligence, machine learning InSight platform as well as the acceleration in asset life cycle management. So we still see that to be strong double-digit growth in those new service areas. So some of those have a different margin associated with it, but that's where we see the fuel of the revenue growth. And maybe, Barry, you want to comment in terms of what that does in terms of EBITDA progression. Barry Hytinen : Thanks for the question. So we feel great about where we're positioned as it relates to profits and revenue and really see the business building quite well. The things I would call out to add to Bill's comments are you're right, there's a fair bit of services. On a total EBITDA margin, you will see the margin mix down, but that's the contribution of ITRenew. I'd say for planning purposes, if I were you, what we're using in our model is that business, as you would have seen from prior disclosures, is kind of a mid- to high-teens EBITDA margin. But when you get underneath that and back that out, you'd see that our core Iron Mountain margins are actually continuing to improve, and that's driven by the fact that we have very strong pricing contribution this year. From a planning posture, we kind of assumed 2 to 3 points. But as you probably saw in the most recent results, we're seeing the upper ends of that and probably more going forward, so feel very good about our revenue management program. Our data center business is doing phenomenally well, as you've seen, and that is a margin benefit as we move forward. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect our data center profitability to be up modestly year-to-year as a lot of revenue growth coming out of our storage side of the data center business. Of course, our Summit contributions continue to roll in. We'll have $50 million or more from Summit, thanks to the team's very strong contributions. You would have noticed from seeing our most recent results that our services gross margins and EBITDA margins are at very high levels. You can think like up 500, 600 basis points year-on-year in the fourth quarter. I expect that we will continue to see very strong service margin out of the core going forward. So we feel very well positioned, Sheila, and I appreciate the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Barry, maybe I could just piggy back off the last comment on the services business and the services margin. Can you talk about what drove the gross margin improvement? You had very strong services revenue. Maybe you could talk about how much of that was maybe Frankfurt versus some services that might still be coming back versus just new wins that you've got. And then it's a pretty significant margin improvement sequentially as well. If you could talk about where it's coming from and particularly in the face of inflation and wage inflation and how you're managing that. Barry Hytinen : Okay. Thanks, Shlomo. I appreciate that. So first thing I'll tell you is on -- since you mentioned Frankfurt is it's not coming from that because those are really almost -- think of those as sort of pass-through revenues on the services business. In fact, that's a hit to our margins. And that's one of the reasons why our data center margin has been a little bit more muted. But as we move through finishing up those services in early '22, that's one of the reasons we expect the margin to be up year-on-year as you'll see a lot more contribution from our storage and, therefore, likely less service revenue coming out of data center. That said, where it's coming from is the core. And as we've said for quite a few quarters now, Project Summit and just general productivity coming out of our operations has been very beneficial. You saw our gross margin to be up, I think it's 550 basis points year-on-year. It was up 400 basis points sequentially. And that's just very strong operating leverage. I would say there's some incremental mix there. Bill spoke a lot about our digital solutions and our asset life cycle management. That is also contributing very nicely. There's some revenue management on our services line as well. So in terms of -- you mentioned about inflation. As I said, at this time last year, I will reiterate, we've been what I think is prudent with our outlook. We have embedded in our guidance a healthy amount of inflation more than we're currently seeing similar posture to what we took last year. And while there is certainly a level of inflation, as we all know, out in the economy, I would look at our more fixed structure and say that together with our revenue management program, we have the benefit of working to drive productivity and seeing a considerable amount of our pricing fall to the bottom line. So we feel very good about where we are positioned currently, Shlomo, with respect to services and the guide in total. William Meaney : Yes. The only thing I would add, Shlomo, because you know the business really well is the other thing -- the uptick that you see in the services, we're doing, quite frankly, more value-added. I mean, more and more of our digitization services have an ML or machine learning component of it. I mentioned auto classification and some of the work that we're doing. It's not just simple scanning. So there's an analytical piece to that as well, which obviously has a higher margin. And we see almost -- I wouldn't say all, but now it's almost all the new projects we're selling have some component of that, which just naturally attract higher margin. And as Barry said, you've heard us talk about inflation for a long time is that, well, inflation is not good for people on the street, and so I'm not trying to be blase about it for our business because it's such a high-margin business that the pricing action generally is expansion. It has an expansive effect on our margins because our margins were relatively high-margin business. So it's -- yes, we feel good about the progression that we're getting. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Congratulations on ITRenew and our thoughts with your Ukrainian employees as well. Barry, if you said this -- I missed it, but can you help us because obviously a sizable step-up in CapEx, which feels like that's around data center, but how should we think about free cash flow in 2022? Barry Hytinen : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. So first up on CapEx. Our total CapEx guide is $850 million. Growth capital is $700 million of that. And you are right, as you point out that the data center is getting basically all of that increase. So we are planning our data center development CapEx at $550 million. That's up from about $300 million in 2021. The thing about that is, of course, as you've seen from the strong leasing we've had and the very strong pipeline we have continuing to build that -- and it's a necessity in the sense because we are -- the team is continuing to win great deals around the world. So we're very pleased with the way the data center team is planning. From a free cash flow standpoint, while the CapEx will be up, I'll note that all of our Summit costs are behind us now, Kevin. So there's -- if you think about last year, we had over $200 million of costs to achieve Summit, which go away this year. Have a little bit more cash taxes, of course, with the ITRenew services business and having some more services revenue in our business. And -- but as you look at it, as you get through your model, I think you'll find that there's considerable growth in free cash flow before growth in the model. So I appreciate the question. We look forward to showing you the strength in the cash flow as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. George Tong : The secure IT asset disposition industry has typically grown in the strong double digits. Can you elaborate on how quickly you expect your new ALM business to grow and what key drivers you're leaning on to support that growth? William Meaney : So thanks, George, for the question. So as you noticed, we've been getting kind of strong double-digit, roughly, say, 20%. We had a couple of quarters where it was up 30%, kind of in that high teens, kind of low 20s in terms of growth rate going forward, and we continue to see that kind of evolution. We're really impressed by how quickly the book is building, quite frankly, because the ITRenew business had very strong exposure to the hyperscale community, which has direct or synergistic effects with our data center team. So we're finding we're already getting additional traction even beyond what ITRenew is bringing by the discussions that we're having between our data team -- data center team and the ITRenew team that came across talking to the hyperscalers. But then on the other side, to your point, we're -- if you think about our traditional customers, whether it's financial services, insurance or general industry, is those folks that the way they dispose of their IT assets, both from a security standpoint as well as making sure that they disposed in a way that's environmentally sensitive, is becoming more and more important. So we continue to see now with an expanded platform to have similar growth -- organic growth rates that we did this past year, which I said we're, let's say, upper teens to touching into the 20% category. And we'll update you as we go through the progress, but we're really happy in terms of already the synergies that we're getting from that, putting the 2 teams together. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : So I wanted to touch on the data center business. Barry, I think you said that the target leasing outlook is 50 megawatts for this year. So that probably means you had pretty good visibility and some larger hyperscale wins. So maybe you could talk about or maybe disaggregate that outlook into larger hyperscale versus more traditional enterprise sales. And then on the return side, any changes in the return targets on the higher capital spend this year based on any supply chain or inflationary impacts in the data center space? William Meaney : So let me -- I'll start with the leasing activity, and then Barry can comment further. But I think the -- you're right, I mean, that with the hyperscale folks, you do have more visibility. I mean, I think you can expect that the retail side or the colo side would be -- continue to be kind of in the teens of megawatts a year. So we like that business. We continue to see the same kind of deal flow or pipeline coming in on that side. And then the thing we're also very excited about is that a few years ago, we were relatively a new entrant in the hyperscale. And clearly, if you look at the results this past year, almost hitting 50 megawatts, and this year, we're guiding to another 50 megawatts. We're making really, really good progress. So we're starting to look more like, what I would say, a typical industry player in the data center space where you're getting like kind of 60% to 70% of the volume, maybe even a little bit more from hyperscale and the rest from colocation and retail. Barry Hytinen : The only thing I would add is that while we see some level -- as you've heard from other industry participants, some level of inflation in cost, we also see very good pricing. And so we expect mark-to-market to be flat to up, if not better than that. We are seeing good pricing in terms of new deals. And we feel very well positioned. And I'm pleased to be able to say we expect the margin to be rising year-on-year. So thanks for the question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Barry, I was hoping you could give us an organic constant currency revenue growth for the '22 guide. I definitely heard you that ITRenew is $450 million of revs and FX is $60 million headwind. I assume this is still a little bit more revenue from other acquisitions that you did as well. And so if you could just kind of total it out for us and give us organic revenue growth for the '22 guide, that would be helpful. Barry Hytinen : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I'll disaggregate it for you. So you would be working with $450 million for ITRenew. The net of all of our other M&A activity in 2021 is about $25 million of benefit year-on-year. So not a lot. And you might be -- might have been thinking that, that would be higher, and I'll just remind folks that we did sell our software escrow business back in June. So that's a headwind to revenue, and then we bought a small data center in Frankfurt and we also did the small acquisition in the -- relatively small acquisition in the Mid East. So the net of all that is about $25 million year-on-year. And it's kind of first quarter, it's about $5 million, and it's about $5 million in the second quarter and with the balance kind of in the third. From an EBITDA standpoint, because as we talked about before that, that software escrow business was a high profit margin business, you're only looking for about $5 million of EBITDA from all of that incremental revenue. And then the FX is about $60 million of a headwind, that's as of yesterday. So -- and that's about $25 million or so of EBITDA headwind. So if you work through that, that would get you to your organic. It's very strong, by the way. And it's benefited by the fact that we have very strong visibility on pricing.  And the services side that Bill mentioned, we're growing strength to strength with our digital solutions probably being up at least 20% on top of 20% and the data center business and the storage area there being up in the 20s. So we feel very well positioned. Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up question from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Bill, you called out a number of wins in your prepared remarks with government contracts and other customers. I was wondering if you can help us understand if the legacy traditional storage offering was part of the mix with any of those contracts. Or just what were the different components of Iron Mountain's business offering that helped you win that business? William Meaney : Thank you, Sheila, for the question. And actually, I just got back from a trip to D.C. a couple of weeks ago. So the -- I would say it's kind of yes and no. Yes, in terms of the brand, right, because we have been a very trusted partner operating government-approved facilities for their physical storage for many years, as you know. And I think that brand recognition with the U.S. federal government has been extremely strong. That being said, the recent contracts I've been highlighting have been us actually providing digital service, auto classification analytics around some of these documents, also taking documents that are already in digital form that we're not actually storing on behalf of the federal government. So more and more going forward is that we're providing purely digital services. But I wouldn't underestimate the halo effect of the understanding of the brand and the trust and the security associated with working with Iron Mountain. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Bill, I think you've missed it if I didn't ask you a question about the RIM volume changes quarter-to-quarter. So I want to bring that up a little. There's a slight decline, and it looks like there was also 30 basis points of sequential decline in records retention. Were there any strong document destruction projects in the quarter? Or how should I be thinking about that in terms of just the movements quarter between quarter? William Meaney : So first of all, I guess -- I thought you were asleep this morning, so I notice someone had taken your voice. No. So first of all, we're really pleased with the progression in terms of our records management business because if you notice that actually, sequentially, it's actually getting stronger, not weaker. And as I said, the slight negative drag on the records management business is really a second derivative effect. And as that kind of wears through, you start seeing a stabilization. And indeed, we're actually seeing an improvement in the trends in the records management. And in terms of total volume, physical storage volume, is our other areas of storage and adjacent business areas and consumer more than offset those flattening trends. I would say -- the only other thing I would say is that, yes, you're right, and you've been watching this business for a long time. You always see a little bit of an uptick in destructions in the fourth quarter because, generally, it's kind of like people do their spring housecleaning in our business as they kind of do their fall housekeeping. So we do see some -- just generally. But that's like every year. I didn't -- we didn't see more of that or less of that this year. And Barry, you might want to talk more specifically about the trend. Barry Hytinen : Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Shlomo, and thanks again for the question, is I usually look at the records management retention rate on a year-over-year basis as opposed to sequentially because of the points that Bill was just making. And if you look at that versus the year-end 2020 number, it's actually up 40 basis points. So we feel very good about where the record retention rate finished the year. And the only other thing I guess I would add is if you look at the storage rental revenue growth on an organic basis, it was up 3.6% in the quarter. And that is -- 2/3 of that is coming out of our core and 1/3 of that is coming up from data center in terms of that improvement in terms of organic revenue growth. And when you look -- disaggregate the 2/3 coming out of our core, it's actually both pricing as well as improved volume trends because, as you know, the organic volume on a year -- full year basis was actually up. So we feel very good about where things are trending. We expect our volume to be consistent to up again in 2022. Thank you for the question. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : So I just wanted to touch on the capital allocation outlook for this year. So Barry, you said that leverage should be within the range by year-end, but just wanted to know what was embedded in that. Do you expect to do any incremental acquisitions? Should we expect any additional asset sales as a funding mechanism? And then based on the strong AFFO per share outlook, you'll be in the mid-60s from a payout ratio. At what point would you consider starting to grow the dividend again? Barry Hytinen : Okay. Thanks, Eric. A few points in there. Let me answer those. We aren't embedding any additional M&A in our guidance for this year. So we shouldn't be planning for that. As we said before, we're very committed to our leverage range, and we'll get back into that leverage range and the year within it. In terms of additional things to put in the model, I would say I would be planning for something like $150 million of capital recycling. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the cap rates there are phenomenal. We've seen cap rates even sub-4. So it's very, very good environment out there. And as a reminder, we're generally doing sale leaseback transactions that are very favorable, in our opinion, because we essentially have ownership-like interest in the building while monetizing it at these great cap rates. And that enables us to really just be very strategic about the capital allocation plan. In terms of your question about AFFO payout ratio, you're right, in our guidance, we'd be just above the mid-60s by the end of the year. And we've said repeatedly that our target is for that to be kind of the low to mid-60s over the long term. And at that point, we'd be looking at a dividend increase. So in fact, we'd be almost approaching sort of the REIT minimum under certain scenarios under that -- at that level. And therefore, you probably would be expecting dividends through in the future to be rising with the same rate as AFFO per share.

Sir, Tilman, please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thank you, Brenda. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. Our team delivered exceptional results for the first quarter of 2022, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. This record performance is reflective of our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model, and dedicated team. Whilst we are thrilled to report these results, its important to take a moment to acknowledge the events happening in Ukraine and impacting the world at large. As we navigate this devastating conflict, we continue to prioritize our Mountaineers and their families. To that end, I am comforted to share that all 65 of our colleagues from Ukraine continue to check in with our global risk, safety and security team on a daily basis and all are safe. Some families have made the difficult decision to migrate to other countries. And I am proud of how our fellow Mountaineers in the region have offered assistance in providing comfort and resettlement. I continue to be both inspired by and grateful to all the teams in Ukraine and the surrounding countries who have united to support each other in this crisis. I visited the region twice recently and I remain humbled by the strength of our colleagues. And we remain committed to supporting our effective Mountaineers and continue to hope and pray for a rapid resolution of this war. Now if I may, let me begin our discussion of our first quarter results, a record for the company. We achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.25 billion, exceeding our expectations of $1.2 billion, yielding 10% or total organic revenue growth and an all-time record EBITDA of $431 million. We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand of our services across key markets fueling these results. As pricing and positive volume trends continue to benefit us, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 6.8% in the first quarter. We drove double-digit growth in digital offerings, including data center, GDS, digital transformation services, and ALM or asset lifecycle management. As you know, we've been growing quickly and over the past two years, we have been growing faster than even our expectations. I have shared with you previously, how our continued build out of new products and services, as well as growth in these underlying markets has now taken our total addressable market to over $120 billion, accelerating us on our growth trajectory path. Turning to our ALM business, we achieved several solid wins that spanned industries, many of which were made possible through the strong combination of Iron Mountain, and the recently acquired ITRenew, which has been performing even better than we had anticipated. An example of the power of this combination can be seen in our expansion on a customer win with a large financial institution that we were originally awarded in early 2021. With the additional expertise we acquired with ITRenew, we expanded our offerings to include market leading recycling expertise, as the whole world is focused on how to better embrace the concept around a more circular economy and reduce our impact on the environment. Along with this added expertise, we now have a full set of capabilities which are truly differentiating in the eyes of not only this customer, but also most of our global customers. Another ALM win this quarter was for a task order for Iron Mountain to provide on-site media destruction and ALM services to 18 US locations, including data centers and office locations, in which all IT asset types will be included has in scope. Several key factors in awarding us the RFP included secure logistics, global footprint, partner network and existing trusted relationships. For this customer, we expect to expand services to multiple regions, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, India, and Canada. These are just some of the wins this quarter, which demonstrate the strength of our expanded ALM platform, which will directly benefit from IRMs 225,000 loyal customer base, which includes 95% of the Fortune 1000. Our continued drive in building an extraordinary set of synergistic and customer centric solutions, combined with our global reach and footprint propels our growth forward. Now let me share a few examples of how we've been empowering our customer\u2019s success and growth through our diverse digital transformation solutions or GDS offerings, coupled with our customer focus. In the first quarter, we received fully executed service orders for two large deals in the energy vertical for one of the world's largest oil and gas companies. Both projects will allow our customer to identify and access dark data to provide quicker decisions and to better manage their assets. The total value of these two deals represents more than $12 million. We are looking forward to replicating this success with other energy customers. Turning to the Asia Pacific region, I would like to highlight a large win with an Asian full service universal bank that I had the honor to visit in March. Iron Mountain will provide digitization service - services to assist our customer\u2019s local compliance requirements of digital [ph] which are anti-money laundering related requirements for a total contract value of $4 million. We are also thrilled to report a customer win that has resulted in a five year $8 million Digital Mailroom deal leveraging our content services platform or InSight. This Fortune 500 Mutual Insurance customer after handling their own mail in house for more than 100 years came to us with this opportunity which was both complex and emotional for the customer. Our success here is a direct result of our long standing strategic partnership. We also continue to grow our business with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada or IRCC, which facilitates the arrival of immigrants, provides protection to refugees and offers programming to help newcomers settle in Canada. In 2020, Iron Mountain began supporting IRCC with imaging a variety of application forms. There was an immediate need to process a backlog of applications with your staff working from home as a result of the pandemic. Today, we have processed approximately 115,000 applications, representing over 14.7 million images. Building from this initial work in Toronto, we grew the project by securing an additional contract worth $2.9 million. In addition, we recently awarded a 1.3 million RFP to expand this image initiative to Atlantic and Western Canada. This would not have been possible without our work in supporting this customer from day one, positioning Iron Mountain as a critical business partner. In our Crozier business, we are pleased to highlight our installation of a piece of art entitled just what is your position by a distinguished LA artist at the new terminal at LAX. This installation highlights our team's expertise and precision with regard to complicated installation that will now be on display for millions of travelers. Last, but surely not least, turning to our data center business. You will recall that we initially expected to lease 50 megawatts this year. By the end of Q1 however, we had already signed a total of 35 megawatts, including a single tenant of 27 megawatts for our London-2 location. We are excited about the continued demand we see across Europe, as we bring on added capacity to the market in the coming months. Since March, we have sold an additional 72 megawatt lease on our Northern Virginia campus. This is a near build-to-suit type of agreement where we are responsible for leasing on a long term basis the land, the shell and a large portion of the installed MEP or mechanical electrical plant. Iron Mountain's data center solution met the security, scalability and interconnection requirements of the customer in this critical global data center market. The lease is expected to commence and begin ramping mid-year 2024 and it \u2013 and has a term of 15 years. Finally, I would like to share with you a joint ESG and data center win. As we have said before, ESG continues to be an important focus for us, shone through many years of producing annual corporate sustainability reports outlining our commitments and progress for nearly a decade. We recently announced a design certification of our Phoenix Arizona AZP-2 data center, the first data center in North America to receive BREEAM certification. We are taking the lead on demonstrating the steps facility owners can take to ensure that their data centers are both efficient and resilient. Design for the facility has been certified under BREEAMs new construction standard, a global recognized green building certification for new developments and achieved the BREEAM excellent rating. This continued focus on building standards, together with already having long term renewable power purchasing agreements which offset at more than 100% of our data center energy requirements places us firmly on the path to reach our 2040 commitments to use 100% renewable energy, 100% of the time. To conclude, we continue to build on our growth momentum and expand our portfolio to exceed our customers evolving needs, as evidenced by our outstanding results this morning, including our highest ever revenue and all-time record EBITDA. With our strong footprint, powerful portfolio and deep customer relationships, we are confident that we will continue this momentum. The future is bright, and I can't wait to see how we can accomplish. With that. I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill. And thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team delivered strong performance exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. On a reported basis revenue of $1.25 billion grew 15% year-on-year with total organic revenue up 10%. Revenue was over $20 million ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call. To me, a key highlight in the quarter is our - organic storage revenue which grew 6.8% in the quarter, reflecting our strong pricing and data center commencements. Total service revenue increased 33% to $497 million, driven equally by the ITRenew acquisition and our core service offerings. In fact, organic service revenue increased $59 million or 16%, driven by strong growth across our service lines, including digital solutions. As revenue associated with our traditional transportation services was still down 10% from pre-pandemic levels, we are even more pleased with this performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $431 million, up 13% on a reported basis and up 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We have strong contributions from revenue growth, driven by pricing and data center storage, along with ongoing productivity improvements resulting in EBITDA growth of $50 million. The higher level of EBITDA was despite the impact of the stronger US dollar and the disposition of the software escrow business last June. Combined those two items are about $14 million of year-on-year headwind. Partially offsetting those, is the recent ITRenew acquisition. With solid flow through first quarter EBITDA exceeded the expectations we shared on our last call by $6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected. And while it was lower year-on-year driven by the inclusion of ITRenew, our core Iron Mountain business continue to deliver improved profitability year-on-year, even with investments to fund further growth. AFFO was $264 million or $0.91 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.10 respectively, from the first quarter of last year. In both cases, we exceeded our expectations. Now let me spend a moment discussing the impact of the war in Ukraine. In late March, we determined it was appropriate to deconsolidate the majority of the OSG records business, which is principally doing business in Russia. As a result, we wrote down our investments to a fair value of zero and accordingly recognized a charge through the other expense line. Going forward, we will no longer be including these entities in our financial statements. Also in our other expense line this quarter, we have a gain on the MakeSpace Clutter merger as I mentioned on our last call. The deconsolidation does not impact our business in Ukraine, which continues to be included in our results. With reduced revenue and a conservative position on accounts receivable, we recognized a loss in our Ukrainian business during the first quarter. I want to echo Bill's comments. We continue to keep all of our Mountaineers in their families in our thoughts during this ongoing human tragedy. Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.04 billion, an increase of $76 million from last year or 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis revenue increased 10%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 6.4% or 4.6% on an organic basis reflects our focus on revenue management, and solid volume trends which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. I will note, that in our supplemental financial information, we have shared a reconciliation of our volume with and without the deconsolidated entities to allow for comparability going forward. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $451 million, an increase in $43 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 100 basis points year-on-year, reflecting continued pricing strength and productivity. Turning to our global data center business, we are very pleased with our results. On a revenue basis, we delivered 36% year-on-year growth or 33% organic growth. A particular highlight for me is the 26% organic storage revenue growth we delivered in the quarter. As Bill discussed, the team has done exceptionally well with new bookings. And with that we are raising our full year outlook on new and expansion leasing to 130 megawatts, up from our prior expectation of 50 megawatts. Now to provide some historical context to that, we leased 10 megawatts in 2018, 17 megawatts in 2019, 31 megawatts in 2020, excluding our joint venture in Frankfurt and 49 megawatts last year. With the strength of our performance in the first quarter, we now project full year data center revenue growth of at least 20% year-on-year, with even higher rates of growth for storage. With our strong prior year bookings and recent commencement, we have very good visibility to revenue. Turning to our corporate and other business, revenue increased 146% year-on-year driven by the ITRenew acquisition and organic growth in our closure business. For modeling purposes, please note that our legacy IT asset disposal business continues to grow 8% [ph] in the Global RIM segment. Total capital expenditures were $150 million, of which $115 million was growth and $35 million was recurring. In 2022, we now expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $950 million, up $100 million from our prior expectations. This reflects an increase to our data center development CapEx plans, given our strong leasing year-to-date and our very positive outlook. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times. This is an improvement from last year and better than the projection we shared on our last call. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. We continue to expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. As you may have seen in March, aligned with our growth plans, our team successfully refinanced our credit agreement which includes a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan A facility. The amendment provides for nearly $550 million of additional borrowing, includes favorable terms and extends the maturity to March 2027. We want to thank our commercial lending group for their continued support. And with our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend at $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 69%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60%. And now turning to our outlook. We are pleased to reiterate our full year 2022 guidance. I should note that this is despite the impact of the deconsolidation and the stronger US dollar. With the closing of the ITRenew transaction, I thought it would be helpful to share our preliminary view on purchase accounting. We currently anticipate amortization of intangibles to be approximately $60 million annually. And with only two months of results in the first quarter, we amortized $10 million. Naturally these charges are included in our adjusted EPS and FFO. Now let me share our expectations for the second quarter. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion. We estimate organic growth to be high single digits to approaching 10% in the second quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $450 million and we expect AFFO to be approximately $260 million. The war in Ukraine and the deconsolidation is nearly $5 million headwind versus the second quarter of 2021 and sequentially versus the first quarter of 2022. In summary, our investments are accelerating our growth trajectory. Our customer relationships are strong, our core is performing well. And we continue to realize incremental pricing opportunities across our business. Our focus on higher growth segments, including data center, asset lifecycle management, and digital solutions are positioning us for continued success. I would like to thank our entire team for their strong contributions. We look forward to updating you on our progress following the second quarter. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have on the phone lines comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. So please go ahead. I have opened your line. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Good morning. You mentioned the addressable market for Iron Mountain expanding? I just wonder if you continue to look at M&A opportunities like ITRenew? And how would you look at financing those types of acquisitions? Would it be sale leaseback or non-core dispositions? Or would you consider common equity as making sense, given the share price gains? William Meaney : Good morning, Sheila. Thank you for the question. So, I think the first is that we feel really good about the platform, not only the $120 billion total addressable market that we have, but the platform that we have in each of the poor - parts of the portfolio that attack that, if you will, or address that. So we don't see a need to do any, you know, large M&A type deals, like the ITRenew, because I think we now have market leading platforms pretty much in each of those - those areas that we're addressing. So we don't really see that. And we still think that we have a long ways to run in our share price. Sheila McGrath : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks so much. And congratulations on the results. Hey, the storage growth was really, really impressive, the organic, can you maybe unpack that a little bit in terms of what's kind of the pricing, the volume? And then how are you thinking about that, I guess, organically for the balance of the year? Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Kevin. Kevin McVeigh : Hey, Barry. Barry Hytinen : We appreciate the comments. And we feel really - we feel really good about how things have been trending. If you look at our Global RIM storage rental revenue growth of 4.6% organic, the vast majority of that is prices, as you can see our organic volume is right in line with what we've been expecting. And so you know, it's been very good performance on pricing. And importantly, we continue to see more opportunity for pricing and, and that's the - on that expectation, I would advise you to think about pricing continue to be at this level or better for the remainder of the year. The other thing that really helped the total company's storage growth is our data center. You would note that our data center storage revenue was up considerably in the quarter. And they are two in light of both the team's phenomenal performance in terms of historic leasing, as well as recent deals and commencement. We expect to see considerable growth on that data center storage line, the entire year, as we were talking about last quarter. So we feel very well positioned, Kevin and appreciate the question. Kevin McVeigh : Sure. And then just Barry, real quick. It looks like you took up the CapEx guidance. What was the free cash flow in the first quarter and how should we think about that for the full year? Barry Hytinen : Yeah, Kevin, I will tell you that - thanks for the question on the CapEx. I'll draw people's attention to the fact that we did increase the CapEx guidance by about $100 million versus our prior expectation. That reflects the fact that our data center development CapEx is up about $100 million. So I'm currently planning for $625 million or so of data center development CapEx for the full year. And that's reflecting the fact that the new leases that we've signed, together with continuing to be opportunistic about building the platform, you know, as you've seen, we've had phenomenal new leasing. And so it's sort of a great situation to be able to continue to invest in that business where we're seeing very nice returns. When you think about the model, I would say that you should be seeing a very considerable amount of free cash flow before discretionary in - when you work through our CAD, and we feel very good about how the - how the business is performing. Kevin McVeigh : Great. You just Barry, it was 525 before going up to 625 on the data center, right? Barry Hytinen : That's correct, Kevin. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We now have the next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead when you're ready. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Bill, you'd miss me, if I didn't ask you this. But the RIM sequential volumes seem to have gone down about $1.7 million from 4Q to 1Q. I know last quarter, when I asked about it, there seem to be in a certain seasonality in terms of destructions and things like that from 3Q to 4Q. I'm just wondering if you could give us some more color on 4Q to 1Q, I understand that the company's got very strong pricing and being able to offset that in that way. But you know, the expectation was for the year - to end the year, you know, flat to potentially up on the volumes, I want to get some more color on, you know, the reason for kind of sequential decline? And whether you still expect bonds [ph] to be flat? William Meaney : No, thanks. Thanks, Shlomo. Good morning. So at least I know that you're on. No. And well, first of all, the - in terms of physical volume, we said it's flat to slightly up to the year. But that's looking at our - across our portfolio of everything that we put in our warehouses around the globe, right. So in terms of managing the organic utilization of our facilities based on organic visible volume growth, we still expect that to be flat to slightly up and you know, in this quarter it was up as you see. So looking within records management, we always kind of consider that to be more flat to slightly down. And if you look at the trend, even between Q4 and Q1, and as you watch the business for a long time, you know that both Q4 and Q1, usually have a little bit of noise. And then because people tend to do their destruction programs, either at the end of the year, and some of that goes into the beginning of the year. So you'll always see a little bit noise. But I think if you look at the last say, you know, four quarters, you'll see a very consistent trend on what's happening to our physical volume around the records management. So, we feel really good where it's at. You know, it's kind of staying in that kind of flat to slightly down records management. Our other areas, in terms of physical volume storage is growing quite nicely. So overall, you know, we'd still remain kind of flat to up for the year in physical volume. And then of course, pricing takes that up. Barry Hytinen : Really, well. I mean, you know, we do have very strong pricing power. And, as we've always said that, you know, inflation, you know, whilst you know, we feel for folks, I mean, inflation is really hurting all of us in many different ways. For the business, it's actually a net positive because we're able to price ahead of inflation, and we have a high gross margin business, so it naturally expands the margins of the business. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead when you're ready. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Barry, I just want to check on here how you think about the \u2013 of EBITDA divided by the low end of revenues and low end - the high end of EBITDA by the high end to revenues, I get 351 [ph], so above 35%. And then, you know, obviously, we just did 35 - 345, and they implied, you know, same approach for the second quarter to be 346. And so if you're looking for 351 for the year, and of course, I'm going to ask you is that the right way to think about it, you're talking about much higher than 35% EBITDA margins in the second half of the year to make 351, for the full year, and so you can imagine I'm going to ask you, why will the second half margins be notably higher than the first half this year? Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Andrew. You are thinking about that correctly. A couple things to think about. As we move through the year, we have improved mix coming through the business. We do naturally have, as you traditionally have seen in our business, since you followed us for so long, a level of upfront, first kind of quarter costs which ease, we have a level of improved mix going forward. We get more price as we move through the year. We also see very good flow through coming on the data center business. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we expect the data center margin to be slightly up year-on-year, and we see good flow through coming through in the back half there as well. And then, generally speaking, we will continue to comp with positive benefit from Project Summit and other ongoing productivity initiatives. So, you know, I would say first off, I should remind folks that in the first quarter, we did better on a margin basis than we anticipated. That's because the core Iron Mountain business performed very well in terms of productivity and pricing. And we see that trajectory continuing through the year. So sitting here, after one quarter, I feel quite good about where we are in the margin trajectory, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question on the line from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Sir, please go ahead when you're ready. William Meaney : Operator, maybe put up the next question. Operator : The next question we have comes from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead when you're ready. Eric Luebchow : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So I was interested in the 72 megawatt data center, shell and land and MEP lease you mentioned. I imagine that's a pretty capital efficient lease structure, given its size. But maybe you could kind of give us some color on the returns you'd underwrite, to under that type of structure, the capital intensity? And then whether you're seeing more of these shell type deals versus a typical turnkey lease that you could do here in the future? William Meaney : Hi, Nate [ph] So no, thanks for the question. Yeah, as you say, we were very pleased to sign this deal for our data center campus in Northern Virginia. There is a couple bits, we'll go into more detail on the second quarter call, because you can imagine that we just signed this agreement, as we come in. But as I said, it's - it's a near build to suit. I mean, we don't - we're not providing all the MEP. And we'll actually go into a little bit more details in terms of how the pieces come together. But besides the 72 megawatts, the other thing that we were very excited about, it allowed us to build further infrastructure on that side, bringing on a substation onto the campus, which is going to drive benefits, both in terms of upscaling the capacity, but also the cost to deliver on that on that campus. So there's a number of different pieces there that make this deal very attractive. But we'll give you more information on the second quarter call. But you're right to say that it's a very capital efficient structure. And with a great tenant on the backside for 15 years, so it allows us to finance it in a very efficient way. Eric Luebchow : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then one more for me, Barry, you mentioned service revenue associated with kind of the legacy transport business was down about 10% from the pre-pandemic level. So, I mean, have you seen any improvement in that over the last few quarters? And do you expect that to recover back to pre-pandemic levels at some point? And if it does, kind of what will it take to get there, is it more return to office or any other kind of macro related metrics we should be looking at? Barry Hytinen : Thanks for the question, Eric, and appreciate the continued interest. Of course, we have seen that line continuing to perform better over the last several quarters and kind of consistently, that's been trending better. And we do - I will say, you know, if you look at our service activities, since the early days of the pandemic, we obviously were down a lot in the early days and then moved appreciably better sequentially, quarter-by-quarter. We are far in advance of return to office and I would say we continue to outpace return to office. The way I think about it is, it likely has a continued tailwind going forward. I don't think any of us expect office to be at the same level of occupancy going forward, as it was pre-pandemic. But even still, as the levels continue to rise over the coming quarters, I think that becomes a little bit of a tailwind for our service. The other thing I'll just point out is the new service offerings that we've been delivering to our customers like in IT asset disposal and digital solutions. They have been doing phenomenally well, as Bill highlighted in his prepared remarks. And we see that trend continuing. And it's really strength to strength in that line, Eric. And those are very good profitability for us as well. So we feel quite well positioned on the service line. And then you will see additional service obviously coming through with our recent ITRenew acquisition, as that business continues to build. Operator : Thank you. We now have the next question on the line from Shlomo from Stifel. Sir, please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you for putting me back in. Just on the storage business, the storage rental gross profit section has facilities costs going up about you know, $17 million or so sequentially. I don't know if there was a build and put in place that went in over there. Is there - can you give us a little bit more color on that because storage gross rental margin went down 110 basis points and just want to see if that's - what's driving it? Barry Hytinen : Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo. It's a good question. Appreciate that one. So the way to think about it is, we have both for service growth - storage rental gross margin, there's a factor of both sale leaseback, but you are specifically asking about other facility costs. And on that line, that's also where our power for data center pass through goes through, and so that was actually - naturally up both sequentially and year-on-year. Incidentally, just to give you a frame [ph] if you normalize for sale leaseback and excluded the power, we basically have storage rental gross margin up in both sequentially, as well as year-on-year by about 40, 50 basis points. So we feel quite good about the way the business is trending. And the other thing I'll say is, our guidance naturally assumes a healthy, as I mentioned last quarter, a healthy amount of inflation. And we continue to track at levels that are below what we were projecting earlier in the year. And of course, the pricing is doing better. So that's part of the reason why the profitability in the core business continues to outperform. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We now have George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You talked about favorable traction in your ALM business. Can you elaborate on how ITRenew performed in the quarter on revenue and EBITDA relative to your initial expectations? Barry Hytinen : Yeah, thanks. Thanks, George. It's Barry. It performed right in line with our expectations, maybe even a little touch better than the expectations we shared on the last call. Obviously, that's just for the first two months of the acquisition. And as we see it, and that's both on revenue and a EBITDA basis. As we see it playing out for the year, I continue to project in our guidance, the same level call it around $450 million in that same profitability level that I mentioned. And as we see the business being growing considerably over time, I will tell you that one of the nice things that we see in that business is the building level of backlog, as many of our upstream clients are building their backlog for decommissioning, as we move into the later part of the year, in light of the fact that there's been some level of supply chain disruption for a new gear, we do see their backlogs building. So that is, I think, a favorable view for us going forward. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. So please go ahead, I have opened your line. Sheila McGrath : Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about rising interest rates and near term impact to Iron Mountain, where do you think you could raise debt capital for a 10 year bond now versus maybe fourth quarter? Barry Hytinen : You know, Sheila, hi, it's Barry, you know, the good news about our model in light of the fact that as you saw in my guidance, we expect the leverage to be kind of inside our range and essentially flattish to maybe even slightly down by the end of the year from where we are now. We were in the fact that we have no near term maturities. I really don't need any long term at this point. As you know, we did the bond in December for the ITRenew transaction, so I'm pleased with the timing of that in light of where we were able to price it. I feel very good about where we are with respect to the capital markets for you know debt and don't have any need at this point or for the next few years, really Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions raised. [Operator Instructions] We have had no questions registered. So I'd like to hand it back to the management team. William Meaney : Thank you for joining us today and you can all disconnect. Operator : You have been removed from the call. Good bye. This does conclude today's call. Thank you again for joining. You may now disconnect your line. Thank you for attending today's presentation.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thank you, Chad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. Our team delivered another quarter of record results, further demonstrating our resilience in pricing power as the world navigates difficult market conditions and global instability. Our dedicated team continues to develop new and innovative solutions for the ever-evolving needs of our customers. Our durable business model and strong customer relationships consistently drive value for our customers and ultimately, our shareholders. Our record second quarter results delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.29 billion, representing 13% total organic revenue growth and an all-time record for EBITDA of $455 million, in spite of significant FX headwinds. These results are further proof of why we continue to be so encouraged by the increased demand for our services across key markets. Pricing and positive volume trends continue to benefit us in this quarter as we reflected in our organic storage rental revenue growth of 8.2%. As we have been sharing with you over the past few quarters, we have been growing quickly, even faster than our own expectations. A major driver for this growth is a direct benefit from our continued innovation, which has increased the size of the total addressable market for our products and services by 12 times to $120 billion, most of which is in faster-growing sectors. Accordingly, we are forecasting revenue growth to continue to accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by strong revenue management in our Global RIM business unit, growth in our data center business, digital information management solutions and improving trends in downstream demand for our hyperscale asset life cycle management or ALM business, which we acquired through the acquisition of ITRenew in January of this year.  I now would like to take this opportunity to share a few highlights of our customer wins. To begin with, our records management business, we have had a long-standing relationship with a major global accounting organization for more than 20 years. They were in the midst of reviewing their records management program when they learned of our Smart Sort solution. We calculated that Smart Sort could help them classify and destroy co-mingled records that have various retention schedules and a much faster and more cost-efficient way than if they were to do so in-house. This led to a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the power of our tools and techniques, which resulted in a deal that closed month sooner and expanded the records management program we performed for them across not only the outsourced records but their in-house records as well. Moreover, this win has already led to other exciting conversations with the customer about digital transformation opportunities. The deal has also opened more opportunities with the customer in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. On the digital solutions side, we recently won a contract with a large insurance and financial services company in the United States. They had previously only used us for shredding services, aligned with the acceleration of the digitization initiatives, they needed solutions to help them create greater business efficiencies whilst maintaining data security for the sensitive information their company handles every day. We provided a cloud-based solution to further support their work from anywhere initiatives by delivering information to their associates wherever they are in a secure and easy-to-access manner. Our team listened to the customers\u2019 needs and tailored a near-site Digital Mailroom solution to effectively meet their needs by leveraging an Iron Mountain owned and operated record center located near the customers\u2019 headquarters. As a result, we will digitize and distribute 10 million pieces of mail annually. As part of the special handling process, we will also leverage our InSight solution for checks and other items deemed to be sensitive. Over time, we expect to leverage the full suite of InSight solutions to process all of their mail, leveraging workflow automation through the use of our embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. This innovative solution will dramatically improve mail processing times through automated routing as well as classification and governance. These wins demonstrate the merits of strong customer loyalty, coupled with our solution-oriented approach in serving our customers. We are sharply focused on understanding their job to be done in delivering solutions, which are both innovative and impactful. Now to switch gears, I\u2019d like to share a recent data restoration and migration win that led to an ALM win, thanks to a deep and trusted relationship with one of our customers, a large Australian bank. They have been growing through acquisition and as part of their integration plans have been decommissioning their data centers to move to a large cloud provider. To help enable this transition, we recognize that they would benefit from better access to their data on tapes, leading to one of our biggest data restoration and migration services contracts. This is in and of itself a great win, but it led us to an even larger opportunity to assist this long-standing customer. Based on our strong partnership, we were able to help the customer manage their decommissioned data center assets by offering an introduction to our ALM services. This win is an important entry point and shows our ability to help our customers solve multiple business challenges. It also reinforces the cross-sell opportunity in ALM. In our ALM segment, in addition to the Australian bank, this quarter, we closed a deal with another large global bank, whereby Iron Mountain will provide on-site media destruction and data center equipment recycling to 42 data centers, campus locations and branch offices. The program will also expand to corporate and user assets in multiple global locations. This customer contacted Iron Mountain in January of 2022 to inquire about our secure IT asset disposition services due to poor performance from their incumbent vendor. Our team engaged with the bank\u2019s key stakeholders to discuss their service requirements, data security policy and pain points in order to best position our solution. Our best-in-class logistics, asset processing capabilities, data security practices, transparent reporting, and strong client relationships were critical to securing the win. Moreover, our acquisition earlier this year of ITRenew and the resulting ability to in-source all asset processing capabilities in the U.S. convince this customer that we have the strongest capability set to service them. We are also pleased to report another ALM win with a large cloud customer wherein we were awarded part of a $60 million global RFP. The customer currently uses a multi-vendor approach with a vendor assigned per region. ITRenew was the largest provider to them in North America for value recovery and on-site drive destruction. Now that Iron Mountain has completed the acquisition, the customer has additionally awarded us their Irish business, along with expansion of the North American business to include shredding and recycling hard disk drives. We won this business in part due to our track record of achieving the highest value for the resale of decommissioned components, our global footprint and our excellence in asset tracking. We are very encouraged by the continued growth of IT assets contracted to us for disposal as well as the wins with new and existing clients. However, like all global businesses exposed to computing equipment, the latest COVID-19 shutdowns in China have had a negative short-term impact. This impact has been most particularly pronounced in May and June. There is a higher-than-normal backlog of material, which we hold on consignment that cannot be sold until we can deliver it to the manufacturers in China who are using the recycled components in their goods. Whilst China\u2019s zero-COVID policy makes it hard to predict when manufacturing rhythms will return to normal, we do expect to see an acceleration of our sell-through once the situation does indeed normalize. In summary, the continued growth we have seen in the upstream supply of IT equipment needing to be securely and safely recycled further increases our excitement about this sector once downstream demand for recycled IT components reverts back to its usual levels. Finally, our data center business has been extremely active this quarter, and we successfully completed 83 megawatts of leasing. This included a 72-megawatt lease for two buildings on our Northern Virginia campus. Both of these facilities are effectively stabilized as we have pre-leased 100% of the capacity to a Fortune 100 company. Today, we are happy to announce a joint venture for these assets with a subsidiary of Hana Financial, a global real estate firm. Full build-out of these two sites is expected in the third quarter of 2025, and Iron Mountain will be responsible for managing the design and development of the data center shell as well as administrating the leases. Also in this quarter, we signed a hyperscale tenant on our Phoenix, Arizona campus. With this new lease, the customer has existing capacity in three of our locations. This win increases their geographic presence with us as well as introducing the client to the Phoenix market for the first time. We\u2019ve also been active on colocation this quarter in our data center business. We had a new customer win with one of the largest managed service providers, which has existing data centers in North America and Europe, and we\u2019re looking to gain entry into strategic emerging markets such as India. To that end, we were able to accommodate this customer through our Web Werks, JV, in Mumbai for data center capacity. When we originally entered India through this JV, we operated in three markets. We have spent much of the last year focused on securing land to expand our footprint in our existing markets as well as two additional new markets now. We believe as we work through planning and permissioning on these parcels, we will have over 100 megawatts of sellable capacity in the Indian market over the next couple of years. Having personally visited India already twice this year. I and we remain very excited about \u2013 about the opportunities we are seeing in this exciting market, both for data center as well as our business more broadly. These wins show how our focus towards building an extraordinary set of synergistic and customer-centric solutions, combined with our global reach and footprint both differentiates and propels our growth forward. As we have discussed before, we are focused on driving commercial activity, including cross-selling our solutions to our customers, and this quarter, nearly all of our data center bookings were signed with existing customers of Iron Mountain. To conclude, I am incredibly proud our team has continued to build on our growth momentum, expand our portfolio and not only meet but exceed our customers\u2019 evolving needs. This is evidenced by our outstanding and record results this morning, including our highest ever revenue and all-time record EBITDA as well as the highest rate of organic revenue growth in the last 25 years. We expect to continue to build on these results as we further the growth of our business based upon a strong global footprint, a powerful portfolio of products and services and our deep customer relationships. We have a very exciting future, and I can\u2019t wait to see all we continue to accomplish together. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the second quarter, our team delivered strong performance across all metrics, meeting top-line projections while exceeding projections on EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.29 billion, grew 15% year-on-year or 18% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Incidentally, the dollar strengthened significantly since the time of our call in April and resulted in about $15 million of incremental revenue headwind versus our prior projections for the second quarter. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 8.2%, reflecting strong revenue management and data center commencements. Total service revenue increased 34% to $536 million with 21% organic growth. In total, this was driven by strength in our core service offerings, including digital solutions and our acquisition of ITRenew. Adjusted EBITDA was $455 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We had strong contributions from revenue growth driven by pricing and data center storage along with ongoing productivity improvements. The higher level of EBITDA was despite the significant impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and the disposition of our software escrow business last June. Combined, those two items are about $17 million of year-on-year headwind. The deconsolidation last quarter of the former OSG records business in Russia offset the benefit from ITRenew. With solid flow-through, second quarter EBITDA exceeded the expectations we shared on our last call by $5 million on a reported basis and by $10 million using the same FX rates included in our April projections. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected and improved 80 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2022, driven by price and mix. AFFO was $271 million or $0.93 on a per share basis, up $25 million and $0.08, respectively, from the second quarter of last year. In both cases, we exceeded our expectations. Now turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $74 million from last year or 7% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 11%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 6.4% exceeded our expectations for the quarter. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their focus on selling the full suite of products across our portfolio. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $469 million, an increase of $45 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points year-on-year, reflecting pricing strength and productivity.  Turning to our global data center business. Our team delivered another successful quarter of executing our strategy. On a revenue basis, we delivered 30% year-on-year growth, and a particular highlight for me is the 24% organic storage revenue growth. As we noted on our last call, we signed a 72-megawatt lease on our Virginia campus with a long-standing hyperscale customer for a near build-to-suit. As Bill noted, we have recently established a joint venture for this asset, whereby we will retain a 55% interest and generate a strong return. We completed an additional 11 megawatts of leasing in the quarter for a total of 83 megawatts. We are confident in our 130-megawatt projection for new and expansion leasing this year, thanks to the momentum from the first half of the year, combined with our strong bookings pipeline. Turning to our corporate and other business. Revenue increased 156% year-on-year, driven by our ALM business, including the ITRenew acquisition and organic growth in our Fine Arts business. For modeling purposes, let me call out a couple of minor changes we\u2019ve made to our reporting to be consistent with how we are managing the company. First, all of our ALM business is now included in corporate and other, whereas previously, our legacy IT asset disposal business was in Global RIM. Secondly, our Entertainment Services business and certain costs that support our commercial organization have been moved from corporate into Global RIM. We have updated our historical financials to allow for comparability and those will be made available on our investor relations website later today. In our asset life cycle management business, as Bill mentioned, we are very optimistic with regard to the underlying trends in this category. And importantly, our committed backlog remains strong and growing and currently sits at a record level as we speak to you today. Turning to capital recycling. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $91 million. Total capital expenditures were $188 million, of which $156 million was growth and $32 million was recurring. We continue to expect total capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $950 million, which includes $625 million for data center development and $155 million for recurring CapEx. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, which reflects a sequential improvement from the first quarter. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 times to 5.5 times. We continue to expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. And with our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 68%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid-60s. Now turning to our outlook. For the full year, reflecting our performance in the first half and strong outlook, we expect to deliver revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range despite an additional $60 million of foreign exchange headwind in the second half. And for EBITDA and AFFO, with continued pricing and productivity, we expect to achieve the midpoint or beyond of our full year guidance ranges. Now, let me share our expectations for the third quarter. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion, which represents 15% growth year-on-year. I would like to note that we have considerable FX headwinds, both year-on-year and sequentially. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $465 million in the third quarter, which represents 11% year-on-year growth. And we expect AFFO to be approximately $280 million. To conclude, the performance of our business is strong. Our team continues to drive higher levels of growth, and we thank them for their collective efforts and dedication. Our tour is strong with margin is increasing, thanks to pricing and productivity and our investments are driving considerable growth across our business. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming investor event on September 20, at which time we will have the opportunity to discuss our strategy to drive considerable future growth. The event will take place in Northern Virginia and include a tour of our data-centric campus. For those of you who cannot join in person, a live webcast of the presentation will be available. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And the first question will be from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Your revenue management strategy continues to be tracking well in the storage business. Can you provide an update on how much in pricing increases are flowing through in response to the current inflationary environment and how much flexibility you have to reflect up change revenue management conditions as the year progresses? Barry Hytinen : Hi, George, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. The team is doing very, very well with respect to revenue management. You would have seen that our organic storage rental revenue growth on an organic basis was up over 8% in the quarter. That marked a nice acceleration even from the higher levels in the first quarter. And in our Global RIM business that was over 6% on that metric. So volume, as you would have seen on an organic basis \u2013 in total is up about 2%, but on an organic basis is very consistent with our expectations of being just slightly up, so about 50 basis points. So what you\u2019re seeing is a very strong contribution from revenue management coming through. And I\u2019ll just add on to the second part of your question and note that we are continuing to see incremental opportunities for pricing. And in fact, we will be seeing us move forward with additional pricing actions later in the third quarter that will fully benefit us as we move through the year and then give us a little bit of an incremental lift next year. So those are just in light of what\u2019s going on in the economic activity and the fact that our existing revenue management program has been so well received, we see the opportunity to continue to move higher. So you will see that going forward. Thanks for the question. Operator : And the next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Barry, can you talk a little bit more just about the ITRenew revenue contribution to the quarter you noted it was light. Can you give us the exact amount? It seems \u2013 at least my calculation is somewhere around $65 million. And then maybe Bill, you can talk a little bit as you talk about ITRenew in terms of what were you expecting in the quarter initially in when you had earnings in the first quarter? And how is that different? And how do you expect that to play out over the course of this year? In other words, what\u2019s your target for ITRenew, given what we\u2019re seeing from China, are you expecting to catch up? Or are you expecting some of this to kind of flow into 2023? Bill Meaney : Thanks. I\u2019ll start, Shlomo and then I think Barry will give you a little bit more specifics in terms of how to think about it from a modeling standpoint. So I appreciate the question. similar to what \u2013 when you and I were chatting at your conference here, I guess, a couple of months \u2013 almost two months back, summer is almost gone, is that it\u2019s pretty much \u2013 as we were speaking about is that it\u2019s really a tale of two cities. So as I said in my kind of remarks talking about a number of the customer wins that we\u2019ve had around IT asset destruction and asset life cycle management, it\u2019s been a really strong quarter. And that\u2019s really where we\u2019re getting the volume of material that we then sell that gets recycled into new equipment going forward. So the \u2013 what I would call the upstream in terms of the amount that\u2019s coming to us because of our customer reach, the logistics that we have our know-how to be able to do that in a safe and secure way is that we\u2019re sitting on very strong inventories that\u2019s on consignment to us. So this is stuff that we hold on consignment and then sell on behalf of our customers and ourselves or the suppliers of the components and ourselves, to the downstream manufacturers that reuse that in new component. So the upstream bit is really performing to our expectations, and we feel really good about that. The downstream bit right now is primarily in China. And as we\u2019ve seen the lockdowns even more stronger in May and June than we expected, and they continue with the rolling lockdowns because of their zero COVID policy. So we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s hard to predict exactly when that will open. The good news is we have the inventory to sell. The minute it does open and every indication is that it will normalize in the foreseeable future. But the timing of that is difficult to predict. So a long way of saying is we\u2019re really pleased with the performance on how it\u2019s resonated with our customers to actually even exceed our expectations and how many customers have come to us to give us their volume of components to be disposed of either to be destroyed completely or recycled downstream. In terms of selling those components downstream, which is where we recognize most of the revenue, it\u2019s been hung up mainly because of the \u2013 well, entirely because of the COVID, zero COVID policy in China and the rolling shutdowns. And, Barry, maybe you want to talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year shaping up. Barry Hytinen : Yes, sure. Thanks, Shlomo, for the question. You \u2013 a couple of things you asked. On the actual contribution, you\u2019ve calculated it correct; it was about $65 million. So that was just a touch up from the first quarter. And as we \u2013 as Bill referenced, as we said in early June in light of what we were seeing in the second half of May as well as the continued to see in June in light of the COVID shutdowns that Bill referenced. We certainly, that was below our expectations. That said, in terms of going forward, two things. One is we are planning and in the guidance that I gave you for the third quarter and the target for the full year. We have just assumed that our ITRenew contribution would be consistent going forward at that level or even maybe even a touch below that. And I think that\u2019s a conservative way to position it because as Bill mentioned, we and so many other technology-oriented companies don\u2019t know when China will reopen. But I think once it does, to his point, we have a very strong committed backlog and we have a good amount of consigned inventory that can sell through. I just didn\u2019t want to plan for it to get better. So I view that as \u2013 that\u2019s why I described that as I think, conservative because as it opens up, we will be selling through. So we feel very good about the committed backlog and the level of activity we\u2019re seeing from our upstream clients. And as that market reopens, I think we will see a very good sell-through. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes. Good morning. Service revenue growth was up meaningfully. I was wondering if you could help us drill down on that. What were the major drivers of the growth? Is it new businesses or a rebound of some business that had slowed down with COVID? Bill Meaney : Good morning, Sheila. I appreciate the question. So it\u2019s really mainly new businesses, right? I mean, the business has rebounded from COVID, but we kind of saw most of that rebound, to be honest with you, towards the tail end of last year. And there are still certain countries that are kind of going through periodic shutdowns, we talked about China \u2013 we were talking about China in terms of ALM, but we see the same thing on the records management side in terms of the rolling COVID shutdowns in China. So the growth that we printed in terms of services is mainly the new areas. And I highlighted some of the wins that we\u2019re driving that on our digital transformation services. So this is really a direct result of taking ourselves from a $10 billion total addressable market for our products and services to the $120 billion [ph]. So that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing the growth is in those new products and services that are part of that 12 times expansion of our total addressable market. Barry Hytinen : Sheila, its Barry. The only thing I would add on to that is specifically to build on Bill\u2019s point around digital solutions; we grew high teens in the quarter, which was the best comp we\u2019ve had on that specific line in several quarters. And in fact, it\u2019s against our hardest comp last year. So it really speaks to the fact that our digital business is taking hold and going from strength-to-strength. I\u2019ll note that we had a very strong contribution from our legacy ITAD business as well. That\u2019s in the asset life cycle management business, as you know and that business is growing at the very rates and we see considerable incremental opportunity for that to grow, in fact, just to be clear, it\u2019s accelerating in terms of its level of growth, so we feel great about that business. And then it\u2019s notable to say that our pricing continues to be up across the business that includes services. So thanks for the question, Sheila. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Brendan Lynch from Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just touch on Hana Financial and the JV for some of your assets. Obviously, you\u2019ve been trying to grow data center revenue for past couple of years. So it was a little bit surprising to see a joint venture structure. Maybe you could just comment on what your considerations were there? Bill Meaney : Good morning, Brendan. It\u2019s great to have you on the call. Let me talk about the strategic rationale of why we decided to put that into a joint venture. And then \u2013 or to do that deal that way? And then I\u2019ll ask Barry, he can give you a little bit more of the financial details. So first of all, we don\u2019t do \u2013 first, we don\u2019t do a lot of build-to-suit or powered shell. And this was for a customer that is one of our largest customers globally in a number of our sites, and they had a specific requirement for Northern Virginia. The other aspect about this particular client is it allowed us to materially expand almost 100 megawatts \u2013 roughly around 130 megawatts, 135 megawatts of IT load that we can actually support on that Northern Virginia campus by doing this partnership with this client because we were able to use that to bring in a substation on to our site and we\u2019ve completely secured the power now for the entire Northern Virginia campus. So even net of the 72 megawatts that we are actually leasing as a powered shell is that we\u2019ve actually increased the capacity of that site by another 70-megawatt is another 70 megawatts. So that was really, really important to us. And so the \u2013 and it\u2019s a great return on the powered shell. So that\u2019s really our motivation first of all for doing that kind of contract. In terms of why we joint ventured it, it really was very compelling from a financial standpoint. I\u2019ll let Barry talk a little bit about the financial aspects of the deal of bringing in a joint venture partner because I should also add, this is a 100% stabilized asset, right? So we always look at fully stabilized assets and say is that something \u2013 we\u2019re focusing most of our capital on development opportunities, not stabilized assets. So we saw that as an opportunity. But then especially when we looked at the opportunity, the financial aspects were just very compelling. Barry Hytinen : Yes. Hi, Brendan, thanks for joining the call. In terms of the JV, just to be clear, we\u2019ll operate it will, of course, be respond for the construction, the management et cetera. We saw it as an opportunity to leverage third party capital, which allows us to essentially use someone else\u2019s balance sheet and then use ours to go further our development pipeline. As you know, we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity to continue to build out. And as Bill mentioned, this is effectively a fully stabilized asset before we even break ground. And in light of the still very significant investor interest in data center assets, we saw it as a compelling incremental opportunity to even further improve the return that much more as the pre-lease is very attractive to the capital markets. So we\u2019ll maintain a 55% interest in it. We have traditional benefits from the joint venture structure that you\u2019d appreciate as a data center analyst, and I\u2019ll just note that we were able to sell that at a sub four and a half cap. And again, it\u2019s fully stabilized. So we view it as a compelling capital allocation opportunity. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hi. Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll stick with the data center topic. So kind of interested in how your sales funnel looks after such a strong start to the year, particularly with hyperscale but also on enterprise? And then \u2013 on the pricing side, it seems like data center pricing has been lifting even for the larger hyperscale deals. So I\u2019m wondering where you\u2019re seeing pricing today, particularly as supply appears to be getting tighter and tighter in a lot of markets. And then Bill, interested on \u2013 in terms of like where \u2013 which markets you might need additional land capacity or are there opportunities to do some select tuck-in M&A for no select assets to maybe get some capacity in new markets? Thank you. Bill Meaney : Thanks, Eric. I\u2019ll start. The \u2013 I think first of all, yes, it\u2019s a great problem to have. We\u2019ve been so successful this year in terms of leasing. You\u2019re right to point out that we are making sure that we have capacity to continue to grow at these kind of rates. So the funnel that we have in front of us right now, if you think about we have 118 megawatts leased to date this year with \u2013 and we said \u2013 we gave you guidance that we\u2019ll do at least 130 megawatts this year. So we feel obviously very comfortable about that. And going into next year, we don\u2019t see any slowdown in terms of the rate of growth. I mean the 72 megawatts that we did in Northern Virginia, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s a one-off because we continue to see in the pipeline similar types of opportunities, whether or not we\u2019ll pursue all those is we\u2019re constantly make decisions based on the specifics around that requirement. But we are lucky that we\u2019re in a situation where, yes, as I said, we don\u2019t necessarily bid it everything that comes by, so we can actually be a bit more selective. And we feel really good about the funnel. We\u2019ll give you, obviously guidance for next year as we get closer to the end of this year. But the \u2013 we feel really good in terms of having similar kinds of growth rates going into next year and beyond. In terms of where we need more capacity, obviously in Arizona, we need more capacity, and we\u2019re well on track to be able to do that. We talked about expanding our footprint in India. We just think that\u2019s a really high growth and interesting market. You can imagine that we\u2019re actually \u2013 we still have a little bit more capacity left in Frankfurt too, but Frankfurt is another market that we\u2019re regularly looking at we\u2019re well situated in expanding our campus in Amsterdam. So that\u2019s good. London, believe it or not, we\u2019re probably going to be back into the market in London again. So there\u2019s a number of markets, but as you can imagine, is that we\u2019re constantly out to expand it. But right now, I would say that our real estate plan and what we have currently under our control is we feel really good to be able to maintain these growth rates. I mean never say never in terms of acquisitions. We don\u2019t see anything on the horizon, but do we look at kind of what I call brownfield opportunities like we did with Frankfurt too or even when we entered the Amsterdam market. We constantly look at whether it\u2019s better to buy a piece of greenfield land or a brownfield asset that can be rapidly expanded. But I think you can probably think in your mind that mostly what we\u2019re looking at is expanding our land bank in terms of greenfield. Barry Hytinen : Eric, just to add on, this is Barry. I would say as it relates to pricing, it\u2019s been quite good, and we see that continuing to lift across our data center portfolio. You would see that in our mark-to-market has been improving. And continuing to run a little bit ahead of our expectations, and that\u2019s a little bit of a lagging indicator. So you\u2019ll see more lift there. You\u2019ve seen our new and expansion leases signing at higher levels on a per kilowatt basis, both in the quarter and versus last year, and our renewed leases are coming in better. So that, together with the fact that, churn is running kind of at or below expectations, we feel very good about what the team is doing in our data center business. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up question from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Please go ahead. Sheila McGrath : Yes. It looks like you may have done some sale leaseback in the quarter, I thought let fewer buildings. Just wondering how much proceeds did you raise and if pricing has changed dramatically in the light of interest rates? Barry Hytinen : Hi, Sheila, it\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. You\u2019re right. We did do a few transactions. We had about $91 million of proceeds in the quarter. Year-to-date, that\u2019s about $96 million. I continue to expect we\u2019ll probably do for the full year, something like $150 million, maybe a touch more than that in terms of total proceeds. And notwithstanding your point about the market, we continue to find there is a tremendous appetite for industrial assets out there. And we are able to transact in \u2013 both in terms of on cap rates as well as on lease terms that are very favorable to us. And as you know, that\u2019s been part of our capital allocation strategy for some time. So we\u2019ll continue to do that is my expectation. Thanks for the question, Sheila. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect. Take care.",

In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill Meany : Thank you Gillian, and we appreciate everyone taking the time to join us for our third quarter results.  We are pleased to share with you another outstanding quarter, representing the durability and growth of our business model as we continue to navigate successfully through significant headwinds, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, COVID shutdowns in China, and ongoing global tensions. Our team of 25,000 dedicated Mountaineers continues to empower our customers with solutions to enable them to transform their businesses. In the third quarter on a reported basis, we delivered revenue of $1.29 billion, representing 14% total organic revenue growth. We are pleased to have achieved all time record adjusted EBITDA of $469 million. Since last year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly, and excluding its impact on a like-for-like basis, this quarter our revenue was approximately $1.33 billion and EBITDA was $484 million, representing growth of 18% and 16% respectively. These results demonstrate the inherent growth and strength of our business and are further proof of why we continue to be so encouraged by the increased demand for our services across the markets in which we operate. Positive volume and revenue management trends continued to benefit us this quarter, as reflected in our organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.7%.  As we shared with you in September at our investor event, we are executing well on our new Project Matterhorn operating model, the next transformational phase of Iron Mountain\u2019s growth journey. Building off an already solid foundation, we believe Matterhorn is a cornerstone initiative that will allow us to maintain and capitalize on the positive momentum we have seen over the last several quarters.  Through our fully funded plan\u2019s ability to invest 16% of revenue over the next four years, we believe we will further strengthen Iron Mountain as a market leader across our expanded total addressable market, our diversified global footprint, and our enhanced suite of innovative solutions. Our strong double-digit organic growth is evidence of the early progress we are making on our initiatives, which gives us the momentum and confidence in our ability to deliver higher levels of profitable growth over the next several years. Now I\u2019d like to share a few highlights of some recent customer wins while lie beneath the top and bottom line growth. Turning to our digital solutions business, we helped a global European bank evolve to a paperless branch experience to drive enhanced customer service with 360-degree customer data, traceable and audible digital records, and reduced manual efforts for their tellers. The customer has a footprint of more than 400 branches in the U.S. with each branch storing decades\u2019 worth of customer records on premises. We are partnering with the bank to digitize all customer records across their U.S. branches in under a year.  The files will be securing transferred and imaged at Iron Mountain digital supercenters indexing and tagged with critical metadata using machine learning and then placed into Insight, Iron Mountain\u2019s digital repository. Insight will be provided to over 3,500 tellers across the bank to access these digitized customer records quickly and securely. This win is just one example of how we are helping our customers evolve their businesses through digitization, resulting in quicker, easier and more secure access to their most important information for years to come. Also in digital solutions, we won a contract with a state court in Brazil from an incumbent provider. To comply with the Brazilian National Council of Justice\u2019s 100% Digital initiative, all state courts are required to convert active lawsuit documents from physical to digital by 2023. As such, they turned to Iron Mountain for help to implement and complete the conversion process within the mandated time frame whilst adhering to specific quality requirements. Whilst this is in and of itself a terrific win, we are currently exploring further opportunities with this customer. Moving to our asset life cycle management segment, I\u2019d like to share an innovative win this quarter. Our strong existing relationships and coordinated efforts led to a large asset life cycle management win to serve 700 locations in the United States and Canada for a large healthcare company. Prior to the deal, the customer had primarily engaged with us through our records business. The first phase of the partnership included retrieval of IT equipment and plans for a forthcoming data center refresh. We expect to process more than 13,000 assets in the first year. Moving onto the impact of COVID shutdowns in China on the ITRenew business, we see continued constraints in the downstream demand for recycled IT components. As a result, we expect to see similar levels of ITRenew sell-through in Q4 as in Q3. With the continued increase of the backlog of components, we remain bullish on the prospects for the business once the situation normalizes.  In our fine arts business, we are pleased to highlight a win with an internationally renowned art museum. The customer turned to our team to assist them with multiple onsite projects related to renovations the museum will undergo throughout a three-year period. Lacking the internal resources to staff these projects, they were seeking a trusted partner to support them providing additional art handling services. By leveraging our experience and successful track record of prior engagements with the customer, we were able to offer a compelling proposal that secured this very exciting initiative. In the quarter, this business grew by 17% year-over-year, which is a reflection of the strong underlying business.  Shifting to the data center business, we are pleased to have booked 7 megawatts of leasing in this quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 125 megawatts. As a result, we expect to exceed our previous projection of 130 megawatts for new leases for the year.  One of the wins this quarter included a cross-sell deal with a large non-profit community health provider that needed to close down their internal data center and establish a disaster recovery site. As a long-term taped backup and records management customer of Iron Mountain, they reached out to their account team, who engaged with our data center team. As a result, the customer signed a co-location contract which included internet services and multiple cross-connects within 45 days. The convenience of having a single provider for all their physical and digital storage needs was a critical selling point in addition to Iron Mountain\u2019s rigorous data center compliance program, which is essential for the customer given the highly regulated market in which they operate. Our team\u2019s flexibility and willingness to collaborate across divisions to customize solutions for our customer provides a superior experience and ultimately is what made us stand out as their partner of choice. From a development perspective, as discussed in September at our investor event, we have continued to build our land bank in key strategic markets to support future growth with several notable expansion deals. As previously announced, we have added buildable capacity in the Phoenix, Arizona market with the purchase of adjacent land to our existing campus. Based on current design plans, the parcel can support 36 megawatts and includes a 56 MVA substation on site. This is an important expansion in this dynamic market as our current campus at 89 megawatts is nearly fully leased and/or committed. We also expanded our footprint in India with the securing of land and power for 20 megawatts of additional capacity in Mumbai. We remain excited about the growth potential in this strategic emerging market both for our data center business, as well for the enterprise as a whole. In total, we currently have 52 megawatts of buildable capacity across five markets in India. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired a data center campus in Madrid, Spain, marking our entry into the Iberian market. The asset is a uniquely scaled data center campus with an existing 3 megawatt building and fully permitted expansion potential of 79 megawatts. We view Madrid as a very important European market as it is poised to capture significant growth from supply-constrained markets. With these additions to our portfolio, our total capacity is now nearly 670 megawatts.  The wins I\u2019ve shared with you today demonstrate the breadth and depth of our business, our focus on customer centricity and providing innovative, transformation solutions, and the strength of our global commercial platform driven by our Matterhorn initiative. I am very proud of our outstanding team who are the bedrock of our company and the way in which we come together to drive and deliver our growth journey. Our business model is highly profitable, our pipeline is strong, our vision is clear, and we continue to climb on. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks Bill, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our results. In the third quarter, our team delivered solid performance, meeting top line projections while exceeding expectations for both EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.29 billion grew 14% year-on-year, or 18% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 9.7% and represents a sequential improvement of 150 basis points. Total service revenue increased 28% to $527 million, driven by organic growth of 22%. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their laser focus on selling the full suite of products and solutions across our portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA was $469 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up over 16% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As the dollar strengthened significantly since the time of our last call, I think it will be helpful to provide a bit more context. As compared to the rates we were using in August, the stronger dollar resulted in an incremental headwind in the third quarter of approximately $10 million to revenue and $3 million to EBITDA. Under the same FX rates we were using in our August projection, third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $472 million respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected and improved 120 basis points sequentially, driven by revenue management and mix. AFFO was $288 million or $0.98 on a per-share basis, up $25 million and $0.08 respectively from the third quarter of last year. Due to the strengthening dollar, there was an approximate $3 million impact to AFFO versus the rates we used in our August projection. Now turning to segment performance, in the third quarter our global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $93 million from last year or 9% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 14%. In the third quarter, our team continued to drive accelerating organic growth both in storage and services. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $484 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business, we are pleased to report another successful quarter. Our data center storage revenue grew 33% year-on-year. On a total revenue basis, we delivered 13% year-on-year growth. Now as a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we provided unique fit-out services for our Frankfurt joint venture. In the third quarter of 2021, those services resulted in approximately $14 million of revenue. Excluding those fit-out services, on a like-for-like basis our total data center revenue grew in excess of 30%.  We completed 7 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, and with the strength of our expanding pipeline, we now expect to exceed our leasing projection of 130 megawatts for the full year. As Bill detailed earlier, we are continuing to expand our data center platform into new markets. We closed the Madrid data center transaction early in the fourth quarter for an initial purchase price of $78 million, which is subject to an additional $10 million earn-out. Turning to corporate and other, revenue increased 22% on an organic basis and nearly 120% in total, driven by our ALM business and continued strength in fine arts. Within ALM, our organic IT asset disposition business continued on its strong trajectory, growing in excess of 20% year-on-year. Turning to ITRenew, revenue was down sequentially, as we projected on our last call. The business was $5 million below that projection as the lockdowns in China persisted throughout the quarter. We are projecting revenue levels for our total ALM business in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter. Turning to capital, total expenditures were $309 billion in the third quarter. We deployed $270 million of growth capex and $39 million of recurring.  Turning to the balance sheet, with strong EBITDA performance we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.2 times, an improvement versus last quarter, and I think it is worth noting this marked our lowest leverage level since 2017. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 to 5.5 times, and we now expect to exit the year at 5.2 times.  Our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 66%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60s percent. Now let me share our projections for the fourth quarter, which incorporate recent FX rates.  We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion, which represents 12% growth year-on-year. This would be a high teens growth rate on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $470 million in the fourth quarter, which represents 9% year-on-year growth, including the negative impact of FX. We expect AFFO to be approximately $280 million, which is $0.94 on a per-share basis. As FX rates have moved significantly both this year and in the most recent quarter, we feel it would be helpful to provide a bit more context. With the FX rates that we used at the time of our August earnings release, our projections for the fourth quarter would be revenue in excess of $1.32 billion, EBITDA of approximately $480 million, AFFO of approximately $290 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.97. As compared to our full year guidance ranges, with our year-to-date performance and our fourth quarter projection, revenue is at the low end and adjusted EBITDA is at the midpoint. I would like to highlight that on the same FX rates we were using at the start of the year, we estimate our full-year revenue would be in excess of the midpoint of our range and adjusted EBITDA would be beyond the high end of our range. To conclude, our results reflect the strength of our business model and our teams\u2019 collective execution and focus on growth and operating leverage. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their strong performance and our drive to achieve our ambitions. With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you for taking my question.  You mentioned last quarter that you were talking about doing a third quarter pricing increase, and it\u2019s usually something that happens, I think, more at the end of the year. Could you give us a little bit more color around the success of your ability to put through some more pricing and its implications for 2023? Barry Hytinen : Okay, thanks Shlomo - this is Barry. Appreciate the question. We did put in place those revenue management actions we talked about on the last call, so those went into effect in September and you see that beginning in the quarter to take hold in the results. As you would have noted, the implied growth from revenue management, it accelerated in the quarter and that\u2019s been ramping through the year, so think on our global RIM business, it was probably in the 6.5 range - that\u2019s up from about 5 earlier in the year and making steady progress. I would expect in light of the macro environment and the reception that we\u2019ve been seeing with respect to revenue management activities, that that would--we would continue naturally to be at this level as we move into 2023, so we are preparing similar revenue management actions going forward and the reception has been consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over many years. I think it demonstrates the value that we\u2019re driving for our customers. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks so much. Barry, can you just--I just want to make sure I have the numbers on ITRenew. How much is in the full year guidance versus where you initially guided, and was the offset the data center deal or--because obviously you\u2019re maintaining despite, it sounds like, a little bit of run-off in IT and FX. Where\u2019s the offset on the guidance? Barry Hytinen : Okay, thanks Kevin, good morning. Thanks for the questions. On ITRenew, we certainly, as we\u2019ve said throughout the year, been experiencing challenges, like so many other companies that sell into China. With the COVID lockdowns that have persisted and then at one level or another throughout the second half and really throughout the year, that has been a challenge as it relates to our revenue, as Bill and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve assumed that ITRenew will be and total ALM business will be pretty consistent third quarter and fourth quarter at this level. In total, ITRenew was of the order of about $45 million of revenue in the third quarter, and that was, as I said in the prepared remarks, down about $5 million, $6 million from the projection we were using at that time. Thanks for the call-out as it relates to the total business continuing to perform well. You mentioned the data center deal - just to be clear, that business is only 3 megawatts today, so that is not a driver of revenue performance in the fourth quarter at all, although we are really bullish on that opportunity because Madrid is a market that we\u2019ve wanted to play in for some time and it\u2019s a unique market, as I\u2019m sure you know, from the standpoint of where it is with the energy grid. It\u2019s not constrained like so many other markets in Europe, and we think it is, as a market, one that has considerable opportunity. Our pipeline there is quite good, so we\u2019ll be developing that site and we feel really good about the asset. In terms of the fourth quarter and our ability to continue to deliver strong growth, that\u2019s a testament to our teams\u2019 strong performance across our operations, so in our global records business we\u2019ll continue to see benefit from revenue management, as I mentioned. We\u2019ve had very strong services performance, and we continue to see a ramping business in our data center. Thanks so much for the question, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to drill into the services revenue performance. The growth was very strong in the quarter, up 22% organically. I wanted to see what the sustainability of the drivers are, if you could talk a little bit about contributions from the growth portfolio, particularly digital services, overall services revenue growth, and any other factors such as paper prices or traditional service trends that might impact the outlook for services revenue performance. Thank you. Bill Meany : Thanks George for the question. We feel really good, as you would have noted, that over the last number of quarters, we\u2019ve been consistently showing north of 20% growth both on our IT disposal business - you know, the traditional part or the organic portion of our asset life cycle management business has consistently been 20% or better, and our digital service business continues to go from strength to strength again, north of 20%. Those are really two of the key drivers driving that overall level of service growth. If anything, we see in both of those areas, the interest in customers, whether it\u2019s helping them at the end-of-life in some of their assets, make sure that it is destroyed in a way that\u2019s secure, or in the digital service business, we see more and more customer interest and actually customer contracting on us helping them with their digital transformation. I think the current environment, we see more rather than less of both of those things, so we feel really good about being able to maintain that kind of level of growth, which is all part of the Matterhorn project that we outlined at our investor event a few weeks ago, that when you put it all together, it drives what we see over the next coming years - you know, consistent growth rates that turn into a CAGR of 10% or better. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could, and probably both for Barry. Just wanted to return to your investor day from September. Maybe you could give us a little color - the $450 million of cash costs you expect to incur over three years as part of Matterhorn, a little more insight into what those costs are, where they\u2019ll be spent to help drive some of the growth rates you laid out longer term. Then secondly, just as you think about capital allocation, if you could talk about you funding plans to achieve the longer term capex guide. I know your long-term debt yields are above 7% today, and obviously the forward curve on short term rates continues to march higher, so just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about managing fixed to floating mix as you fund your elevated data center capex pipeline. Thank you. Barry Hytinen : Okay, thank you Eric for the questions. A couple of ones in there. On Matterhorn, the costs that we spoke about, as you know, we\u2019re moving to a new operating model that Bill just touched on briefly, that being with a global commercial organization, also a global operations function. In those cases, that is a pretty substantial change for us in terms of the way we go to market. On the commercial side, it\u2019s really putting together an organization that is singularly focused on serving our customers on a solution basis and really developing a tremendous amount of excellence around all things commercial.  Then, we are also constructing a global operations function which is meant to serve our customers effectively and drive significant customer satisfaction and high quality service, while also creating and furthering the shared services backbone that we have to support the entire organization. As well, we are moving to a business unit function, that being, as we discussed at the investor day event, storage and asset life cycle management and data center, as you know, so those are pretty substantial changes. We think of it, as Bill mentioned, as a transformation, and with that, probably about one-third of those costs, Eric, will be maybe slightly less, will be specific to enablement to align and transform into that commercial operating function. Then the bulk of the cost will be around in fact transforming the broader operating model, which would include costs that you would expect with respect to that kind of transformation, including activities such as restructuring and furthering our transformation. Thanks for that question. I guess I\u2019ll just note, as I said at the investor event, we would expect to be approaching the run rate of that level in the fourth quarter as we continue to move into the Matterhorn model, as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks. In terms of the funding plan, I appreciate that question as well. Just as a highlight for those that weren\u2019t able to join the investor meeting, we noted that we expect a five-year revenue CAGR of 10% and a five-year EBITDA CAGR of 10%, AFFO of 8%, and that equates to AFFO per share of, let\u2019s say, 7%, as we said in our slides this morning. With that, it\u2019s a fully funded capital plan through EBITDA expansion and leverage within our target range. You note that rates have moved up recently, and I\u2019ll just note that with--we consider ourselves in a very good position. We have $1.5 billion of liquidity and we\u2019re about 80% fixed, as you know, Eric, and so from time to time, we will continue to term out debt but in light of the very good position we\u2019re in with respect to availability on our revolver and the lowest levels of leverage we\u2019ve experienced since 2017, we can really pick our timing as it relates to that over time, so we will be funding through expansion of EBITDA and leverage within our target range.  I appreciate the questions, Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from Wendy Ma with Evercore. Please go ahead. Wendy Ma : Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. For 3Q, the leasing of data centers seemed a little bit softer compared to historical levels. Could you please talk about the demand trends in your key markets given the current slowing down economic environment, and also, how should we think about the leasing activity maybe heading into 2023? Thanks. Bill Meany : Good morning Wendy, thanks for the question. We remain really excited and very bullish about our data center businesses. As we said, if you look at--you know, we\u2019ll exceed the 130 megawatts that we had laid out or forecasted on our last call, so we continue to build past that and we see similar momentum as we go into next year, so we don\u2019t see any change in terms of our pipeline that turns into leasing activity as we start approaching 2023.  We continue--there\u2019s always a little bit of lumpiness because these are fairly large contracts when you look at quarter to quarter, but we see continued strength and momentum as we go into next year. I think we are also in key markets - that\u2019s why we\u2019ve expanded in Phoenix, where I mentioned that we\u2019re pretty much fully leased or committed on our current campus in Phoenix, and we\u2019ve expanded there. As Barry mentioned, whilst there is 3 megawatts that comes with the north of 70 megawatts of capacity that we\u2019ve purchased in the Iberian Peninsula, specifically in Madrid, is that comes with a pipeline of activity because we\u2019ve been clearly speaking to our customers and anticipating that move. We continue to see that we\u2019re going from strength to strength in that business and building really strong momentum as we go into 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Barry, when talking about the fourth quarter revenue guide of $1.3 billion, could you tell us how that shakes out in terms of organic constant currency revenue growth, and if you could make a comment between storage and service? Barry Hytinen : Sure. Hi Andrew, good morning, and thanks for the questions. When we look at the fourth quarter revenue rate, that being of the order of high teens growth on a constant currency basis, and something of the order of 17%, 18%, so very strong continuation of trend. I\u2019ll note that that\u2019s basically the rate we\u2019ve been running at through the year, so it\u2019s a very good continuation of trend. From the standpoint of storage and services, as Bill mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions, our services business continues to go from strength to strength. That\u2019s thanks to things like our digital solutions and our historic IT asset disposition business, which is growing in excess of 20% - I think 25% in the most recent quarter, very strong performance. We view many of our businesses as playing in markets that are quite large, growing secularly at double-digit rates, and that we expect to continue to take market share in, so for the fourth quarter, you should expect continued strong performance from both storage and services throughout the business. The only thing I would further underline is that for ITRenew and ALM in general, we\u2019ve assumed it would be consistent on a sequential basis, so you can work into the organic if you\u2019d like from that.  Thank you for the question. Operator : Again, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press star then one. Our next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Good morning, thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to just dig in a little bit on your power cost exposure for the DC business. I believe you\u2019re largely hedged, but maybe you could just give us a bit of color on how you hedged for this exposure and what the order of magnitude is that you expect for costs to go up for your customers specifically. Thank you. Barry Hytinen : Okay, maybe I\u2019ll take the first part of that, and if Bill wants to add, he can. Thank you Brendan for the question, and appreciate those points that you\u2019re asking about. I think our team has done quite an effective job with respect to hedging and getting us into a place where we\u2019re in a very good position as we work into 2023 as it relates to power. To give you a sense, Brendan, obviously this is a little bit based on forecast of next year, but we estimate that we were in excess of 95% locked in terms of pricing at this point for power; in fact, it\u2019s probably closer to 99%.  I would say the other important point is when you look at our customer base, we have the ability to directly pass power pricing onto roughly 90% of the customers, and that\u2019s either through pass-through or surcharge, for example to retail customers, and in many cases that\u2019s month to month as we\u2019ve highlighted before. For those that we don\u2019t have that direct ability, of course we have the ability to adjust pricing on renewals, and that\u2019s principally in the retail portion of our business. As you know, those are relatively shorter contracts, so we have the ability to price quite frequently or consistently with power, so it\u2019s not a huge headwind. I think the fact that the team has continued to drive gross margins to being consistent, in fact in the most recent quarter up several hundred basis points in our data center business, is a very good testament to the fact that we\u2019re managing the impact of power, which as you know is a margin drag as its increasing, so we feel very good about where we are going into next year as it relates to power. As it relates to pricing more broadly, the thing I would point you to is if you look at our mark-to-market, it has continued to improve throughout the year, and as you know, that\u2019s a lagging indicator in light of when the contracts for renewals were signed, so we continue to see a very healthy environment for pricing within data center, at least within the markets that we operate in there, generally speaking. I would say there\u2019s more demand than supply. We feel very well positioned as it relates to the assets we have and our ability to continue to price. I\u2019ll also note, of course, that construction costs are up and so when you look across the platform of our data center business, we feel very good about how the team is performing. Bill Meany : The only thing I would add, you were asking about how we manage with the customers, because this has been a pain point for our customers. As Barry said, you can see our margins continue to improve, so as we\u2019re building out operational leverage in the business, which is first and foremost, but we\u2019ve been able to manage the price increases in line with energy costs, so it hasn\u2019t been a drag for us. But for our customers, it\u2019s been a pretty big pain point. Recently, I can say speaking to a customer--a large ecommerce customer in Asia, we actually serve them around the globe but based in Asia, and a large global financial institution, even though we have the-and they do pass the power costs to them, is having the uncertainty in the budgets is difficult with them, so we have been working with a number of those customers to actually buy power in advance, or contract forward for some power that we could give them certainty in terms of what their energy bill is going to be on a rolling 12-month basis. We have been working with our customers to try to minimize the volatility and the pain that they are experiencing, so so far, so good. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session and our Iron Mountain third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thanks Sarah. Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meany, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today\u2019s earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. William Meany : Thank you, Julian. And thank you all for taking the time to join us today. We are pleased to have delivered record performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. These exceptional results are reflective of our broad product portfolio, synergistic business model, deep customer relationships, and committed team. Before I dive into the drivers of our strong performance, I would like to take a few moments to relay how deeply saddened we are all feeling by the devastating and recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow mountaineers, customers and all of their families living and working in the region. The safety and security of our employees is our number one priority. And we are committed to supporting our colleagues in the region as they navigate this challenging time. Now let me begin our discussion of our recent performance. I am proud to report that Iron Mountain has had another outstanding year. In the fourth quarter we achieved quarterly revenue of $1.28 billion yielding 11.3% total organic revenue growth and record adjusted EBITDA $472 million up 10%. For the full year, we delivered record results across the board. Revenue of $5.1 billion adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion, and AFFO of $1.1 billion, representing growth of 14% 12% and 10%, respectively. This performance is a direct result of our close relationships with our customers and our commitment to innovation so we can provide them with expanded products and services to meet their needs. For the full year, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 9%, reflecting continued benefit of pricing combined with positive volume trends. We drove double digit organic growth in our data center business, as well as our digital services and asset lifecycle management business areas capping off another excellent year. Our continued drive to build an ever-expanding suite of synergistic and customer centric solutions, together with global reach and scale fuels our accelerated growth consistent with the Matterhorn Excellence model we unveiled last autumn. Let me share a few examples of how we've been enabling our customer\u2019s success and growth through the diverse solutions and unmatched customer service we offer. Beginning with our records management business report, we reported a substantial cross sell win with a large non-profit healthcare provider, which has been an Iron Mountain customer for more than 20 years. The win resulted in a new 10-year contract covering records management, ALM, data management, secure storage of non-records and document digitization services taking this customer from $2.5 million per year to $5 million annually. Just a few years ago, we would have been able unable to provide such a broad range of services and solutions to this long tenured customer. Today, with our broad offerings we not only cross sold the new services and solutions, but we increased our share of wallet for our records management services and solidified our position as a trusted and strategic partner. We also provided a solution for a large U.S. Bank to develop a simple and cost effective process to manage its vast inventory of over 24 million mortgage files. This partnership involves meeting stringent compliance obligations, mitigating risk and reducing cost. Also in the quarter we want new business serving the Australian Government. Through this work, we will drive considerable cost savings to one of Australia's largest government agencies. Iron Mountain will have a dedicated team to pack, enter data and transport 375,000 cartons to our new facility in Melbourne. In Digital Solutions, a key win I would like to highlight is with a branch of the U.S. federal government. As a result of the enormous success of our original project with the customer to digitize 177,000 reels of microfilm in less than the prescribed year, we have executed a sole source follow on contract to digitize another 133,000 reels of microfilm. This win is the result of the strategic development of a best-in-breed AI machine learning solution to auto classify and automate data capture. In addition, we worked with a large global medical equipment and electronics manufacturer to navigate an extensive global medical product recall. The customer needed an efficient partner to assist with the recall in order to meet regulatory requirements and avoid further legal ramifications. The customer also required rapid response and tight turnaround times and was seeking a single partner. The win includes several service offerings delivered by a single point of contact and illustrates the early success of our new commercial operating model that we introduced with Project Matterhorn. Turning to ALM, another noteworthy win this quarter was with a health insurance provider, which selected Iron Mountain as its dedicated asset lifecycle management partner. Due to the unique nature of their business, the customer has constant attrition throughout the course of the year, and consequently, they were seeking a dedicated ALM partner to provide collection, wiping, imaging, secure storage and redeployment of technology assets. The customers previous positive experience with Iron Mountain and our team, combined with our strong solutions led to mutual success. Our services resolve the challenges around collection, ease of use, and reporting and tracking. This illustrates our commercial team strength and ability to cross sell our set of solutions across the mountain range. And is another example of our increased focus and success in driving commercial engagement is part of our Matterhorn Klein. Moreover, we are especially proud to say that we renewed our largest ALM contract this quarter. This is the fourth contract renewal with this client, one of the largest technology companies in the world. We have worked with them for the past 12 years and are proud of this relationship, the continuation of which demonstrates the potential for longevity in this area of our business. We continue to be excited and encouraged by the total addressable market in the asset lifecycle management category. Despite the headwinds we have faced this year as a result of enduring COVID-19 lockdowns in China. In spite of this, our legacy ITAD business continues to perform well and as we gain momentum on our Matterhorn Klein, we continue to focus on moves to accelerate this growth. Finally, turning to our data center business, we are pleased to have finished the year with 139 megawatts of new leases signed exceeding our original booking guidance of 50 megawatts and our most recent target expressed in the third quarter of 130 megawatts. In the fourth quarter, we successfully completed 14 megawatts of leasing. This area of our business has gone from strength to strength over the past several years, and we continue to see tremendous opportunity in serving both hyperscale and colocation customers, and significant growth potential for our data center footprint. With 37% year-on-year bookings growth, excluding our large lease in Virginia 4, 5 we will continue to prioritize data centers with our capital program, more details of which Barry will provide in his remarks. One customer win in our data center business that I would like to share is a six megawatt expansion lease at our Phoenix campus with an existing Global Fortune 100 customer. The customer which has a long-term strategic relationship with Iron Mountain across service lines, and has existing capacity in several of our other locations needed space to expand in Arizona. Our customer was able to leverage our Phoenix data center for their expansion, and we look forward to supporting them in their future growth. Also in the quarter, our team announced a win for our joint venture at the Mumbai-2 data center, which is connected to our Mumbai-1 data center one of the most robust carrier hotels in the country, providing superb connectivity and flexibility for our customers. We partnered with a global content delivery network company to expand their presence in Mumbai. They required a robust network ecosystem backed by reliable power infrastructure, which we were able to provide. Another win to highlight our ability to cross sell across business segments involves our existing relationship with one of the largest German banks. This resulted in a new partnership with our data center team who leveraged their excellent network within the German Financial Network market and demonstrated proficiency and its high regulatory standards, customer buying team structures and the data center competition in Frankfurt. The customers felt confident in our team's expertise in our ability to support a highly regulated environment to meet their needs. This is yet another excellent example of our ability to listen to our customers and find ways to meet their needs. To conclude, I am incredibly proud of our dedicated team, our unmatched customer dedication and relationships and our solutions, which continue to drive our transformation and excellence. The reorganization we completed in 2022 through the initiation of Matterhorn has established a strong foundation, which is already delivering double-digit growth. It is this foundation built by Matterhorn, which will continue to fuel our growth trajectory and to realize our greatest ambitions. Turning toward 2023, this momentum will continue to drive the opportunities ahead with another year double-digit top line growth expected. Barry will speak in detail about our guidance for the year ahead. Our goals are well within sight as we climb on with Project Matterhorn and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks Bill. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our results. Before I begin, I would like to echo Bill sentiments with regard to the tragedy of the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Turning to our financials in the fourth quarter, our team continued the trend of delivering strong performance exceeding expectations for both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.28 billion grew 10.3% year-on-year or 14.2% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Total organic revenue grew 11.3%. Revenue was in line with the expectations we shared when we reported the third quarter in November. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 11% and represents a sequential improvement of 130 basis points. Total service revenue increased 17% to $510 million driven by organic growth of 12%. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their focus on selling the entire mountain range of products and solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $472 million in new record up 10% on a reported basis and up 13% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As compared to the rates we were using at the time of our last guidance, the dollar strengthened in November, which resulted in an incremental headwind in the fourth quarter of several million dollars to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected at 36.9% and improved 40 basis points sequentially driven by revenue management and mix. AFFO was $287 million, or $0.98 on a per share basis of $20 million and $0.06 respectively from the fourth quarter of last year. This was well ahead of our projections, partially due to the timing of a nearly $10 million cash tax item, which is now incorporated into our 2023 guidance. Now, let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $5.1 billion increased 14% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% year-on-year to $1.827 billion, an increase of $192 million year-on-year, exceeding the projections given on our last call. AFFO increased 10% to $1.11 billion, or $3.80 on a per share basis. I would like to briefly compare our results to our financial guidance. As we have noted throughout the year, FX rates have been more of a headwind than we had initially planned. In fact, using the same FX rates we had in our projections in February of 2022, we would have exceeded the high end of our guidance for EBITDA AFFO and AFFO per share. Now turning to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.08 billion, an increase of $61 million from last year or 6% on a reported basis. This equates to a 10% increase excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 11%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $486 million, an increase of $39 million year-on-year driven by revenue management. Turning to our global data center business, we are pleased to report another successful quarter. From the total revenue perspective we delivered 15% year-on-year growth on a reported basis and 19% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder in the second half of 2021, we provided unique fit out services for our Frankfort joint venture. In the fourth quarter of 2021 those services resulted in approximately $9 million of revenue. Excluding those fit out services on a like-for-like basis, our total data center revenue grew in excess of 27%. And we are now back to a more normalized service revenue run rate. Our data center storage revenue grew 25% year-on-year or 28% on a constant currency basis. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we completed 14 megawatts in the fourth quarter, and 139 for the full year. This is well ahead of our updated leasing projection of 130 for the full year. Excluding our large bill to suit lease in Virginia, we leased 67 megawatts for the full year. With our increasing pipeline and the depth of our customer relationships for 2023, we project leasing 80 megawatts or more for the full year. This represents 20% bookings growth. We are continuing to expand our data center platform into new markets. And as we discussed in November, we closed the Madrid data center transaction early in the fourth quarter. Turning to our asset lifecycle management business, we continue to be pleased with the results of our legacy ITAD business which grew approximately 30% for the full year. And we are happy to report that we have seen strong growth in our pipeline. For the hyperscale decommission portion of the business, we are conservatively planning the year with an expectation for continued impact from COVID-19 in China. For example, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we have assumed revenue from our total ALM business is consistent year-on-year. As a reminder, the decommissioning market was performing better through the first half of 2022 and slowed down sharply following more intense lock downs in China. And as we are planning for ramping performance through the year, we anticipate the first quarter of 2023 revenue in our ALM business to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2022. With that, we will naturally have some impact on our organic growth rate in the first two quarters of the year as we anniversary the IT renew transaction in January. Turning to capital, for the full year 2022 we invested $820 million of growth capital and $142 million of recurring. For 2023 we project capital expenditure to be approximately $850 million of growth, with the vast majority of that dedicated to datacenter development and $145 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong adjusted EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times better than our projections and an improvement versus last quarter. I think it is worth noting this marks our lowest leverage levels since 2017. As we have said before, we expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 times to 5.5 times. For 2023 we expect to exit the year at similar levels to year end 2022. Our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. On a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 65% approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60s percent. Now let me share our projections for the full year of 2023. We expect total revenue to be within the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which represents between 8% and 10% growth year-on-year. On consistent FX rates this implies growth of 9% to 11%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $1.94 billion to $1.975 billion, which represents 7% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. On consistent FX rates, this implies growth of 8% at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.15 billion to $1.175 billion, which represents 5% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. On consistent FX rates, this would be 6% growth at the midpoint. We expect AFFO per share to be $3.91 to $4. This represents growth of 4% at the midpoint, and on consistent FX rates this would be 6% growth at the midpoint. Our guidance for both AFFO and AFFO per share includes the timing of the approximate $10 million cash tax item I previously mentioned from the fourth quarter of 2022 into the first quarter of 2023. This represents approximately two points of growth on both metrics. I would like to share some commentary to help investors better understand our guidance. In terms of FX we are using current rates in our projections for 2023. While the U.S. dollar has weakened some recently, we currently expect FX to be nearly a $40 million headwind to revenue for the full year. I would like to further note that at these levels FX will be a more pronounced headwind in the first half of the year. We expect revenue management will continue to be a significant benefit. And I will note the vast majority of the actions we have planned for in 2023 have already been implemented at this point. And turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue in excess of $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $460 million, AFFO of approximately $270 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.92. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered a strong year in 2022 and are realizing our growth ambitions that we outlined at our recent investor day. I'd like to take this opportunity to once again express my thanks to our entire team for their continued dedication, serving our customers and delivering on our collective commitments. And with that operator, will you please open the line for Q&A? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks, good morning. Services organic revenue growth remained in the double digits at 12% year-over-year in 4Q, but decelerated from 22% growth in 3Q. Can you discuss the puts and takes you're seeing with respect to services, organic revenue growth trends? William Meaney : Yes. No, thanks, George. So first of all, we're very pleased with the continued growth, especially where we just started Matterhorn last year. So if you look at overall in terms of the organic growth through the year and an increase in terms of total revenue growth, as we progress. So we're very pleased. To your specific question on service is one of the biggest factors in terms of when you're looking at the year-over-year comparison, if you recall, a year ago, we had the big fit-out for data center in Frankfurt. So that's the biggest factor in terms of that slight drop or that noticeable drop when you look at the year-over-year, still double-digit growth but that was the biggest factor. I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything. Barry Hytinen : Yes George, the only other thing I'd add, I suppose, is that it was right in line with our expectations when we set the projections because, of course, as we signaled last quarter, we obviously knew that we had to anniversary over the fit-out services. So we're very pleased with the way services performed. And I will just tell you that as we look forward, we've got very good pipeline on things like digital solutions, our legacy IT asset disposition business is ramping, and we have as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, very nice pipeline there. And we will see some incremental benefit from revenue management. So we feel very well positioned, George. Thanks for the question. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. So it seems like FX was an incremental headwind as was ITRenew. I don't know if this is for Barry, where were the offsets? Because obviously, the revenue looked pretty good in EBITDA, but just were the offsets on the revenue management or anything else? Barry Hytinen : Thanks for the question, Kevin. I would say ITRenew actually performed consistent with our expectations, and I'll just provide a little more color there. As we've said before, with the lockdowns that we were experiencing or everyone is experiencing in China, we had been seeing ITRenew declining through last year. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, it stabilized was actually slightly up on a sequential basis, which we view as a positive. Now we are, I think, being prudent with our expectations for ITRenew going forward because as you've probably seen in the press, China continues to -- while the restrictions are off, they continue to have a lot of challenges with COVID there. And so we haven't seen the market develop meaningfully yet, but we are cautiously optimistic. So we are planning for the first quarter expectations for our ALM business to be consistent with the fourth quarter revenue levels and then ramping over the course of the year. As it relates to the rest of the business that you were pointing out, we had very strong contribution from revenue management, as you would have seen in the supplemental report. In fact, that ramped nicely on a sequential basis. And we feel very well positioned as it relates to revenue management as we move here through 2023 because as I mentioned in the remarks, all of our revenue management actions are essentially already in market. So we feel very, very good about how things are trending. The other thing I'd call out, which was a really nice performance was in our data center business. You saw the growth rate continue to be very strong on the storage side, high 20s and from a standpoint of bookings also ahead of our expectation. So that gives us very strong visibility into 2023 in terms of revenue generation. And I'll tell you the pipeline continues to build. So appreciate the question. Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hey Barry. Just for the sake of precision, could you just indicate what the organic constant currency revenue growth is at the midpoint of your first quarter and 2023 guide. And it definitely seems like you're expecting faster growth for the full year kind of after first quarter or maybe compared to first quarter and just maybe go over that dynamic more unless you feel like you've already addressed that. Barry Hytinen : Okay. So a couple of points there for you, Andrew, as it relates to how to think about the first quarter. When I mentioned that we probably have something approaching $40 million of FX challenge for the full year, the vast majority of that is going to be in the first quarter. So I think we'll probably have something like $30-plus million, maybe even more than that of a revenue headwind from FX in the first quarter just based on where rates are now versus last year. The other thing to be thinking about is that from a standpoint of ITRenew, that will go into our organic growth rate this quarter. In fact, as you know, we closed that transaction at the end of last January. And so it's organic for February and March. And last year, I don't mind giving you this number for your modeling purposes, I may have mentioned it last year. ITRenew was about $60 million in the quarter, and then it was $65 million in the second quarter. And since I'm planning it to be essentially consistent on a sequential basis, that's about, call it, $45 million that vicinity. So I think that will have about round numbers, a couple of point impact to organic growth. But from there, if you work through the model, you're going to see organic continue to improve through the year. And really, at that point, you don't have any additional acquisition revenue of any substance in the numbers. So you're essentially very close to the constant currency growth. And I think that at that out of pencil for you on the model. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Adam Parrington : Hi, it's Adam Parrington for Shlomo. What was the pricing lift in the quarter? And what should investors expect for 2023? Barry Hytinen : Thank you for the question. It was very strong, as you probably noticed. Organic revenue growth on storage was 11%. And overall, it was 11.3%. And so with volume being as we planned just slightly down on a sequential basis, by the way, up better than our projection for the full year. It was a very nice contribution, and we had 8.9% on that metric for the full year. So it shows you the ramp that we've been seeing through the year. In terms of -- for 2023, we continue to expect revenue management to be a very nice contributor and be thinking probably in at least the mid-single digit range for the whole year, if not a little bit higher in light of what we've got in market. And we feel quite good about where things are. And I guess I'll also add that from a volume perspective, since it goes a little bit to the question you were asking, from a volume perspective, we are continuing to see good trends there, and we would expect for the full year 2023 very similar projection to what we did last year. So something like consistent to slightly up. Thank you for the question. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and in our annual report -- on our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.  In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Our team delivered another quarter of record results for the first quarter of 2023, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the resonance of our expanded product portfolio, our unmatched customer relationships and the strength of our dedicated team.  On a reported basis, in the first quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.31 billion, yielding 7.5% total organic revenue growth and EBITDA of $461 million. We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand for our services across key markets fueling these results as well as the success of Project Matterhorn, enabling our commercial teams to offer our customers access to the widest range of solutions in our company's history. We delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 11% in the first quarter, and we drove high-teens organic growth in both our data center and digital services businesses.  As we introduced last year with Project Matterhorn, our steady build-out of new products and services as well as growth in these underlying markets continues to accelerate us on our growth trajectory path. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight how we have been serving our customers with our solutions-based approach and our offerings across the Mountain range. Beginning with records management, we won significant new business in the United Kingdom with a major global industrial and aerospace company signing a contract valued at GBP 40 million. Following more than a year of conversations, the team entered into a bespoke 10-year agreement, providing the customer with several hundred thousand cubic feet of secure physical data storage, document digitization and management across multiple secure locations, radio frequency identification tagging for additional security and a dedicated on-site team of experts working to Iron Mountain's industry-leading standards.  I am pleased we could offer such a comprehensive solution that allows the customer to both digitize their data and protect their business. We are now discussing additional opportunities with the same customer in other European countries, North America and Asia. In total, the potential contract value over 10 years is approximated to be GBP 90 million.  Another win that highlights our ability to sell the entire Mountain range involves a state historical society, which turned to both Iron Mountain and our Fine Art Storage Business Crozier for help in preserving the history of its cultural heritage center, which is home to its underground archives in museum. With budget as a key consideration for this customer, our unique solution was focused on reducing costs, whilst leveraging our expertise and innovation to challenge the customer to think differently.  Our combined art, library, archives and logistics expertise enabled our team to deliver a solution that met the state's needs. Also in the quarter, a financial services company based in Australia, a long-standing customer of Iron Mountain turned to us for help with their compliance issues after being impressed by the information we presented at a Policy Center webinar back in 2021.  Our suite of digital enablement solutions and software, including the InSight platform will provide the customer with increased visibility into its archives, digital copy as selected records, auto generation of metadata and auto reduction of personal identifiable information. Success stories such as this highlight the value we provide customers and not only moving data from physical to digital storage, but also improving the methods and capability to utilize the data. Another digital win was with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The U.S. Congress has requested that the VA advanced the production of complete and accurate veteran records in a timely fashion, driving the need for digitization of historical veteran documents, which are often dispersed across multiple storage locations. The customer required an experienced digital partner to increase their scanning capacity and also provide facility oversight, chain of custody logistics and secure storage. The unique aspects provided by our high security Boyers, Pennsylvania facility, combined with the skill of our staff were key contributing factors to winning the deal. This is just the beginning of our work to aid in the delivery of medical records to enhance patient care of veterans.  Also in Digital Solutions, we had a key win with an existing customer His Majesty's Courts and tribunal service on a digital mailroom solution to automate the indexing and classification elements of the mail room function. The service, which will reduce the cost and time of processing court applications will be delivered from our location where we have a well-established digitization and BPO facility.  Turning to asset lifecycle management, or ALM, we divide this business into 3 verticals. The first of these is the hyperscale decommissioning business that we acquired from ITRenew. Our volumes grew in excess of 30% in this vertical year-over-year, reflecting our market-leading platform, the strength of our existing customer relationships and our ability to win more new logos. Revenue is down, however, reflecting the record-low pricing the market has seen since the end of 2022 on both new and used components.  In our enterprise ITAD vertical, we've been gratified to see more synergies with our existing customers. Since we have relationships with over 225,000 customers across our wider business, the opportunity to cross-sell our enterprise ITAD services has never been greater. The last of these verticals is the technology manufacturers. Here, we are winning business, both in terms of servers as well as end-user devices. We have invested in our sales force and obtained specific expertise in the OEM space setting us up for success. This indirect relationship to decommission end-user product is a huge market opportunity. Examples of recent wins in the ALM business include a contract with an existing global asset management company to perform on-site hard disk and solid state disk ratio and destruction whilst maximizing value from data center and corporate end-user assets. Continuing with ALM, a large global risk management company sought services to decommission to complete in 2 partial data centers. A combination of our strong existing relationship and performance, including guidance from a dedicated program manager, our remarketing solutions and capabilities and the ease of the use of our ALM portal contributed to the win.  Finally, let's turn to our Data Center business. We are pleased to have finished the first quarter of 2023 with 52 megawatts of new leases signed with a single hyperscale customer signing 2 deals for a total of 44 megawatts. You will recall that our guidance for the year is 80-plus megawatts. So to have least over half of our target in the first quarter alone is a triumph of our team.  In terms of the co-location wins this past quarter, one win I would like to highlight is with an existing U.S. federal home loan customer who sought to expand into a new data center market for disaster recovery options and selected our VA2 data center in Manassas, Virginia. The customer was impressed with the tour of our Virginia campus and the custom solution we developed to meet their needs. With their positive past experience with our data center services, we've bundled this expanded solution with a renewal at another of our data center sites. Also in the quarter, our team announced the win with a fleet management company, which for years has explored moving their internal on-site data center infrastructure to co-location. Our ability to provide a custom solution in our VA2 data center, including direct internet access, smart hands and cross connects resulted in a powerful solution for them and the continuation of an important relationship that has the potential to expand to a disaster recovery solution at our New Jersey data center.  Also noteworthy is a substantial win with an existing major semiconductor chip manufacturer who's taking advantage of all the Mountain range has to offer. The customer was seeking a data center partner to host their internal development cloud environment, and our data center and commercial sales teams work closely to deliver a solution at our Arizona site, leveraging the customer's existing relationship.  All 3 of these wins that I have noted are with long-standing customers, demonstrating our ability to source premium co-location deals with customers with whom we have had trusted relationships for decades. To conclude, we are more enthusiastic than ever about the growth in our business and our ability to offer our customers expanded and innovative solutions to meet their ever-evolving needs. Project Matterhorn is bearing fruit, and we continue to make great strides as our team climbs towards the highest peaks of our journey.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team continued to deliver strong performance, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. We achieved an all-time record quarterly revenue of $1.31 billion, representing 5% growth on a reported basis. Organically, revenue grew 7.5%. Revenue was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call as Global RIM and our data center businesses both outperformed. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue growth of 11%. This marks an acceleration both sequentially and year-on-year. This reflects strong contributions from revenue management, data center commencements and positive volume trends. Total service revenue increased 2% to $504 million or 4% on a constant currency basis. Consistent with the commentary we shared on our last call, the year-on-year impact from the start of the more intense lockdowns in China impacted our ITRenew business.  Excluding ITRenew, service revenue was up 11% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $461 million, a new first quarter record. This represents growth of 7% year-on-year and 9% on a constant currency basis driven by revenue management and strong contributions from data center. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.1%, an improvement of 60 basis points year-on-year with revenue management and mix being the key drivers.  AFFO was $284 million or $0.97 on a per share basis, up $20 million and $0.06, respectively from the first quarter of last year. This was well ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call, partially the result of the timing of some maintenance CapEx items between the first and second quarters.  Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.13 billion, an increase of $78 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 11%. Organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.4% reflects our focus on revenue management and solid volume trends. We reported organic service revenue growth of 13.6%, with that performance driven by digital solutions and core offerings.  Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $478 million, an increase of $29 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. We achieved revenue of $112 million, an increase of $15 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we delivered 17% growth on an organic basis. Organic storage revenue growth was particularly strong at 24%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. As we projected, data center services were down year-on-year given the fit-out work we were performing in the first half of last year. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $51 million, representing 21% growth.  Turning to new and expansion leasing. We had a very strong quarter with the team signing 52 megawatts. We expanded our relationship with a long-standing customer with a 40-megawatt contract. Later in the quarter, we extended this relationship further with another 4 megawatts. Both of these have an initial term of 7 years with multiple renewal options. We signed new deals across our portfolio with key wins in Scottsdale, Phoenix, Frankfurt and London. In total, we signed 22 new logos within our data center business with strong cross-selling activity.  Turning to asset lifecycle management. In the first quarter, ALM volume was ahead of our expectations, while component pricing was down significantly year-on-year. Importantly, we are now seeing pricing for components stabilizing. Given the current environment that Bill described, we are planning for ALM revenue to be consistent in the second quarter with the first quarter. And with the pipeline activity we are seeing, we are well positioned for improving trends in the back half of the year, driven by volume and new bookings.  In particular, our OEM business is developing well with the team growing our pipeline and delivering key new wins. For example, we recently signed a deal with one of the largest technology end-user device manufacturers to partner with them in the decommissioning needs of their customers. Turning to capital. In the first quarter, we invested $302 million, of which $274 million was growth and $28 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1x, reflecting a significant improvement from last year, this marks our lowest leverage level since 2017. We expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 to 5.5x. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 64%, settling into our long-term target range of low to mid-60s percent. Now turning to our outlook.  With strong performance in the quarter, we are well on track for the year, and we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.35 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $475 million, AFFO of approximately $270 million and AFFO per share of approximately $0.92. In summary, our team is executing well on our Matterhorn growth initiatives. We are investing in our business. We remain focused on driving increased levels of cross-selling and exceeding the expectations of our customers.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their continued dedication and commitment to Iron Mountain and our customers.  With that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Organic revenue growth for the services businesses decelerated to 2% in the quarter. Can you elaborate on the factors behind the deceleration in services organic revenue growth? And discuss initiatives or factors that could drive a re-acceleration in growth in the coming quarters? William Meaney : George, thanks for the question. So yes, I think overall, if you think about it in the traditional areas, our service revenue growth was quite strong. If you look at just in the RIM business is our Global Organic RIM services grew at 14%, again on an organic and constant currency basis. So very, very strong growth. If you look it on the ALM side, which is where you see the downdraft is, as I've said in my comments, is volume in this quarter was up some 30% year-over-year. So we're actually seeing the synergies -- the commercial synergies that we have as a company and as Barry mentioned, we just signed a new OEM customer as well.  So we see really good traction on the volume side. But on the pricing side, if you probably have seen in the electronics industry, some of the components are down 70%. So whilst we still have positive gross margins on that business, is the revenue is heavily impacted by what we've been seeing across the semiconductor industry in terms of record-low pricing.  So I think that it's really a two world. So as I say, from a -- even ALM business on a volume basis has shown traction, but it is a downdraft in terms of the overall service revenue. But the traditional areas, I would say, in terms of RIM, also, if we look at our digital services, we're also up year-over-year in the high teens, really good progression. Barry Hytinen : Yes, George, it's Barry. Thanks again for the question. The only thing I would -- only a couple of things I would add is I think the team, to Bill's point on our Global RIM is doing phenomenally well. And I think that's the way I would point you to look at the services because, of course, the ALM business is masking our total growth there in terms of what's happening with respect to the core. And at that 14% growth rate that Bill spoke about, that is up against some really big comps. So it's -- I mean, it's a very strong performance, and it is driven by the point that he made, the digital solutions as well as other core offerings, which are all growing for us.  The other thing I'd kind of call out is it's a small factor, but as you know, we were doing fit-out services in data center in the first half of last year. We completed that in the second quarter. And so that makes the year-on-year comp hard just as we explained it would be. So that is another factor that's weighing on that services total growth rate that you were pointing to. I think as you move through and get into the -- see us getting into the back half, you'll see that growth rate accelerating meaningfully as we get beyond the challenges with respect to ALM and the pipeline that Bill was speaking about really comes to fruition and then we also get beyond that data center services comp in the first two quarters. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Congratulations on the momentum. Barry, it looks like typically, and I'm just going off the last 2 years, so maybe it's not fair, you can help me with this. But the sequential EBITDA lift in the last 2 years have been $24 million to $25 million, it looks like the Q2 is going to be about $14 million. So when we think about puts and takes in the back half of the year, is that more project benefit from Matterhorn that allows you to reaffirm the EBITDA guidance? Is it better pricing? Maybe just help us understand the seasonality a little bit if I'm thinking about that right. Barry Hytinen : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. We feel very good about where we're trending. In fact, the first quarter came in right in line, if not a little bit better than what we were expecting in our guidance for the second quarter is similarly and that is despite the fact that we've adjusted our expectations for ALM down some in the second quarter. And the reason we're able to achieve the numbers that we're putting up in the second -- that we're projecting for the second quarter and our confidence in the back half is because of a couple of things you just pointed out.  We are seeing even better revenue management projections in the business. We have, as you've seen in our Global RIM business, we have very strong storage rental growth on an organic basis, almost 9.5%, which marked an acceleration sequentially and year-on-year. Our total organic storage rental growth was over 11%, which was also very strong.  And I will tell you that in light of the fact that we are going to see more revenue management activities we've recently passed some here even in the second quarter, and we'll be passing more as we move through the year, together with the fact that data center pricing continues to improve, and that's an industry phenomenon. You will see, together with that, our commencements are very strong in the back half. So data center will be accelerating as we get into the back half. And as you know, there's very strong visibility on that business. So it's a high confidence point that I'm making there.  So we feel very good about where we are. In terms of -- you mentioned the specifics around second versus the -- quarter versus second half. I'll just note that in light of the timing of the U.S. dollar strength, we still have an FX headwind in the second quarter. In the first quarter, that was almost $30 million of topline. But as we said on the last call, and I'll reiterate, that becomes much more muted, in fact, may even be a slight tailwind in the back half.  We also get through a few items that are in the first half from an EBITDA standpoint. As you know, we did some sale leasebacks last year and we comp over those as we move into the back half and with our productivity initiatives and additional commercial investments we've made, we get to a more favorable comp in the back half from those as well.  So I'll tell you, Kevin, we feel very well positioned about accelerating business even with more muted expectations around ALM. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin : Towards the beginning, you pointed out a number of wins with government agencies and large enterprises and so forth. And I was curious to maybe get a little bit more color on what's kind of the tone of discussion around sales cycle compared to what you're accustomed to? And then the competitive set that you faced with those deals to the extent that you faced with these bake-offs or just kind of the decision to go with you is really more of a bilateral discussion, but maybe a little bit about the competitive dynamics and sales cycle would be helpful for both government and enterprise? William Meaney : Okay. Well, thanks, Jon, for the question. So the -- and I was actually involved in a couple of these, so I could probably give you more color on them. The sales cycles, for instance, the aerospace company that we talked about was like over a year, but this is a company that we've been doing bits of work for decades, right? So it's a natural conversation that they start talking about, well, they want to actually do something different. And this speaks of case, they actually had an in-house vendor for part of it but that company wasn't able to do the full range of services. As I said, they were looking for someone to really takeover of full outsourcing and they're very sensitive, right? Because if one of these things goes missing, aircraft around the world get grounded. So they were very, very sensitive about the security and the reliability of their vendor.  And then the other side of it, obviously, they've known us for decades in different areas that are very sensitive to them. And we were able to bring a full range of services that we're able to do, not just the storage, not just the digitization, but also to give them the tools that they could visualize what was both stored physically and what was digitized and they could do that in a consolidated basis. In other words, they could do that and see that anywhere in the world.  So that was a huge win for them. Now you can say the sales cycle was like over a year. I think I've been visiting with the sales team at customer for over a year but it's been part of an ongoing conversation, and that's the power of having the 225,000 customers that we've had decades and decades of relationship. The government one, which I mentioned, which -- 2 of them, one was in the U.K. and one was in the -- with the United States government. For the folks that have been following the company for quite some time, we've been talking about the government sector as being our huge potential for Iron Mountain. And it was slow-going at the beginning because government contracts, as I'm sure you're aware, have very long lead times. But both of those have been customers that we've actually been working for the last 2 or 3 years with -- so again, we were -- there was a big investment, I would say, starting 5, 6 years ago with both the VA and with the British government in certain segments. But that's again now starting to become more of a normal course.  So one level is the conversation started 5 years ago, but now it's just a regular course of business that some of these things are as short as 3 or 4 months' lead time where they come up with a statement of work and because we already have a track record, and we're able to do that. Operator : Next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Barry, you alluded a few times on the call to good revenue management and improving revenue management. Can you talk a little bit about what the pricing lift in the quarter was and what investors should expect for 2023? And you guys had very good revenue management last year. Is the revenue management straight out being able to raise prices now? Or is there some kind of favorable mix going on? Maybe you could just give a little more color there. Barry Hytinen : Okay. So thanks for that question. I think our team is doing a phenomenal job with revenue management. It's been a real standout. When you look at Global RIM in terms of its storage rental organic growth that was almost 9.5%. And as you know, we saw good solid volume trends. It was up about $2.5 million on a cube on a trailing 12-month basis.  So as you can gather from that, the vast majority of the growth was driven by revenue management. And importantly, we feel very well positioned in terms of the whole year. And I'll tell you that in terms of the total storage rental growth rate that we put up 11%, which is, of course, benefited by data center commencements with what we see on data center commencements through the remainder of the year.  Together with the revenue management activities we've already put in place and additional that we have going into market over the next few months, I feel very confident that we are going to continue to see total company organic storage rental growth of this order, I think, 9%, 10%, 11%.  And that the environment for revenue management continues to be strong. We will have relatively more revenue management this year, Shlomo, than we did last year. And that is a factor of both what we're wrapping from last year as well as the activities we've had in this year. Importantly, we continue to see excellent customer retention, and I think that just demonstrates that we are bringing forward very significant value for our clients in these areas. In terms of mix, I would say we continue, as we talked about before, to expand the revenue management program beyond just storage. So you are seeing improving revenue management trends in our services, and that's generally across all line service in our core offerings and so we feel like it's on the right trajectory, Shlomo. Operator : Our next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP Paribas. Unidentified Analyst : This is . Maybe you can just remind us on the funding plan for development this year? What does the pricing look like for any debt needed? Would you do asset or company level financing? And then I also wanted your updated thoughts on the dividend here with the payout, the lowest it's been in a while. William Meaney : I appreciate the question. Let me take your last question on the dividend, and then I'll let Barry comment on the funding plan. And as you know, our plan from -- when we talked about Investor Day, it's a fully funded plan, but I'll let Barry comment on that more.  On the dividend, you're right to point out is we are now in that zone when we said kind of low to mid 60% payout ratio, which becomes a natural forcing function for increasing our dividend. So that's something that we're now starting to settle into that range. So you can expect that it will just become a natural course of events as we get to that payout range, which on the REIT guidance rules just force as a natural increase in the dividend. So I think we're now in that area. So I think when we start getting into the back half of the year, and we start drifting down to the low 60s, then I think you can expect just a natural progression in the dividend. Barry Hytinen : Thanks for the question. When you work through our guidance, as Bill mentioned, as we discussed at the Investor Day, we have a fully funded plan for this year and going forward. And as you know, we will be a routine debt issuer, and while the market has clearly been moved up in terms of rate over the last couple of years with the Fed moves, I would say it's become much more -- it's an improved market as compared to where it was over the last couple of quarters, and we see generally a favorable outlook from a standpoint of issuance. And I think from a standpoint of where we could issue today, that's improved some versus the last couple of quarters.  And to your point, there's a lot of interest in asset-level financing, whether it be for construction or otherwise. And so we're looking at all those options and making sure that we have the best plan for our shareholders. But it's not something that we have to do, as you see, we have plenty of liquidity, but you should expect us to be an issuer on a routine basis. I want to just kind of continue to see what's out there from a market perspective. Clearly, rates are a little bit higher than where they were a couple of years ago, but we still see them being very attractive and partly because pricing in data center has continued to lift and we see continued improvements.  In fact, year-on-year, net new retail-type data center deals we're seeing up like 20%, pretty much consistently across our entire portfolio, and that's trending more toward, I think, by the end of the year, early next year going to be about like 30%. And so that is a pretty significant move. And then importantly, on hyperscale side, I think the whole industry is generally seeing cash-on-cash unlevered returns moving up, I think something like where a lot of folks were writing in the high 7s or mid-7s, I'm seeing a lot of stuff that's in the 8s, if not even higher. And so I think that's a good trajectory for the industry. It's healthy and it supports the point that I was making earlier. So we feel really good. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Alex Hess : This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I wanted to ask briefly about the ITRenew callout. You highlighted that services revenue growth would have been 11% organic, excluding ITRenew, which implies a pretty sharp deterioration quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year in that business, if my math is right. Could you maybe break that out into what degree that was driven by pricing versus ability to sell through into end markets? And any other dynamics that sort of give you confidence that, that will eventually recover? William Meaney : Thanks Hess for the question. I'll start, and then I'll ask Barry to comment and really kind of talk about how we see that trending as we go forward into the year. So as I said in my comments, actually, if we just looked at volume holding pricing constant, is, quite frankly, Q1 would have been a great year for the ITRenew asset that we acquired because the ITRenew, as you know, was really focused at hyperscale. And if we look at that segment alone, I mean, we made very good progress in terms of expanding across our customer portfolio on the enterprise.  But if we just look at hyperscale, which is the ITRenew asset is volume was up 30-plus percent year-over-year. So the volume growth was really good. However -- and I'm sure you're probably seeing this in some of the other companies that you follow, anything that touches the electronics industry when you start seeing what's happened to the chip manufacturers, the memory manufacturers, et cetera, is the pricing has gone down substantially in that area. So we're talking about for a number of components down over 70%.  So you're right to point out, if we look at sequentially Q4 to Q1 is we have seen a drop of revenue on the ITRenew portion of the business or the hyperscale portion of the business even absent -- even -- in spite of the fact that volumes are up 30% year-over-year. So now the good news is that we do see stabilization on those prices, and we see a number of the memory manufacturers and the chip manufacturers, CPU manufacturers, we see them taking capacity out of the market, which gives us further confidence that we've seen kind of a stabilization of prices, which we've seen, I would say, starting towards the end of February going into March.  So we don't see right now that the prices are going to go down further. So that's the good news. But we don't expect that the -- I would say, the chip/memory CPU market is really going to start firming up until we get into the early parts of next year. But Barry? Barry Hytinen : Alex, I appreciate the question. I'll give you a little bit more of the detail, which you could find in our filings. So in the fourth quarter of last year, our total ALM business was about $56 million. And in the first quarter, it was $41 million. And so -- and that compares against $70 million last year. Now as I talked about previously, the second quarter of last year was in light of the timing of lockdowns and the pricing trends by the end of the year, second quarter was the peak for our ALM business at $83 million of revenue. We've assumed in our guidance for the second quarter that revenue is consistent with the first quarter this year. So that is a drag on, of course, the services growth rate in the first quarter, and it will be again in the second quarter.  At the -- if you wanted to sort of sensitize our guidance, I would tell you at the low end of our range, which I did not anticipate this is what's going to happen, but just at the low end, we would assume that it just is flat at this level of revenue for the whole year. I really don't see that happening in light of the very strong pipeline opportunities we have in the trends we're seeing in the business. But that's conservative posture for the low end.  What we think is probably going to happen is we will be slight to -- slightly up sequentially. We're running a little bit ahead here already in the second quarter of the projection I'm giving you. And then in the second half, the way we're planning is for the third quarter to be essentially flat year-on-year. So that implies a little bit of a lift and another lift in the fourth quarter. But I will tell you that we have pretty strong confidence in our ability to do that. And I called out 1 deal on -- in the prepared remarks around OEM, and maybe I'll give you a little bit more color. This is a situation where we're dealing with one of the largest manufacturers of devices in the world.  There are several of those, as you know, and we're approaching all of them because what we're finding with large multinationals is very similar to our core enterprise clients. These companies are looking for a partner who can work with them everywhere they do business all around the world. They're currently using a lot of point players in very specific markets on a local basis, and they'd like to have more uniform standards and consistency, and we can provide them with the sorts of services they're looking for things like data [indiscernible], recycling, remarketing. Ultimately, we'll be working with them on things like asset tracking and storage, IT asset management, things of that nature.  So it's -- another example of how our team is continuing to diversify and grow our ALM business and it bolsters our confidence. And just to reiterate, this is a huge market ALM. We really like the space. It's very fragmented, and we think we're in a very good position to take a tremendous amount of share over time. We're working through what everyone in the industry is working through right now, which is pretty low component pricing. We feel good about the opportunity. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : So I wanted to touch on the data center demand. So you're more than 60% towards your leasing goal for the full year, so a really strong start to the year. And if you look -- it looks like your in-place and development portfolios are pretty highly leased up. So maybe you could talk about your ability to accommodate additional demand, whether through future development of your land holdings, additional expansions? And then if leasing continues to trend at a high level, could you accelerate some of your data center CapEx this year beyond what you initially guided to? William Meaney : Thanks, Eric. And I'll ask Barry to talk about how we think about being flexible or responsive on the CapEx side. But I think generally, yes, we've had a really good start, as you point out the year. We reiterated the 80 megawatts plus for the full year, even though that we've achieved more than half of that in the first quarter because I think as you can appreciate, especially with hyperscale, there's a little bit -- the timing is never fully under your control.  So I would say that we -- some of that -- the new leases that we signed in Q1 were things that we expected in Q2. So I kind of think of it as 2 halves of the year rather than quarter by quarter, just especially when you're talking about hyperscale clients and we had 1 hyperscale client in Q1 that signed up in 2 different contracts for 44 megawatts. In terms of having enough capacity for further expansion, you see we're holding like up to 747 megawatts of land, which is a big uptick from where we were a year ago, but we are making really good progress. So we're constantly -- we're not standing still in that regard.  I mean just in the last couple of months, I visited both our Northern Virginia campus with a potential customer and now done 2 trips with our Indian team since the beginning of the year. So both of those markets continue to develop. And we're not standing still in making sure that we have more land and more capacity to meet our growth. But if you think about just year-on-year, the uptick that we have in terms of the land bank that we have and sitting on 747 megawatts is that we feel good for the next number of quarters that we can accommodate the demand. But Barry, you might want to talk about how we think about the flexibility around CapEx. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Eric. It's good to talk to you this morning. I appreciate those kind words. We -- obviously, the team is doing really well and continuing strength and strength in terms of new signings and also margin performance in our data center business. So hats off to our team there. In terms of data center capital, as you know, this year, we had penciled to deploy about $850 million of growth CapEx and with the vast majority of that going to data center. Year-on-year, we put a considerable incremental amount of CapEx into data center in the first quarter. I think we do have the benefit of so much being pre-leased and the team continue to sell that, yes, it is conceivable to me that we will be, over time, ramping our CapEx for data center and it's sort of a bit of a high-class problem, so to speak, as the team continues to sell through our pipeline plans. So we have ample capacity to do so in terms of deploying additional capital. We were always planning to spend from a timing standpoint, more CapEx, relatively speaking, in the first half this year than we did last year. As you recall, last year, it was a little bit more shaped towards the back half in terms of data center deployment where deploying a considerable amount here in the first half, we'll continue that trend in the second quarter. And after we get through midyear and see how the additional pipeline looks, which is quite strong, I'll note, at this time.  As we see how that is at midyear, we may talk to you about a little bit more, but that would be a very positive development in terms of continuing to see really high levels of organic growth rates driven by commencements. As you know, we're very pre-leased in terms of our underdevelopment. I think we're now pressing over 90% in terms of pre-leased in terms of what's under construction. So it's a good place to be.  The only other thing I guess I'll call out is that churn has been relatively low, and we continue to expect it to be relatively low for the full year. So thank you, Eric, for your questions. Operator : Next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Brendan Lynch : I wanted to discuss a little bit about Project Matterhorn. I understand it's still very early days, but you called out some large multiple vertical wins. I'm wondering how you expect that type of contract to trend in your revenue mix over the long term as Project Matterhorn gains more momentum. Do you expect to see a lot more of these large multi-vertical wins relative to kind of the legacy revenue mix, which might have been more of a fragmented customer base? William Meaney : No. Thanks, Brendan. It really is -- first and foremost, Project Matterhorn has being customer-centric. So what we try to do is make sure we bring full range of Mountain range of services that we have to, to our customers. And if you probably got picked up on a sense is there is a big service component in some of these wins, especially around the digital side. But it's also a big co-location and physical storage. So it's almost -- if you think about even the aerospace company that I've referenced a couple of times in the Q&A and also in my remarks, is there is everything from physical storage to digitization to visualization of their assets. So there is a -- it's a full breadth of the different types of storage solutions we have.  But I think you can expect like and even if you look at our physical -- our organic storage rental revenue growth of 11%, a part of that is, as we said, 9.5% of that growth rate came from our traditionalized physical storage business a bit, but a big part of that came from our data center growth as well. So we see kind of a -- we still see storage. It's one of the most profitable part of our business. We still see that whether it's data center storage or physical document storage and other types of physical storage driving a big part of the growth of the business. But when we actually go talk to a customer, and it's really about helping the customers solve their problem, then it's usually a hybrid set of solutions, which quite frankly, differentiates us when -- even on a data center deal or a physical storage deal.  They really see Iron Mountain as someone that can be a one-stop shopper relatively few stops to actually solve the problem that they're trying to solve rather than what we're trying to sell. Barry Hytinen : Brendan, I'll just add, as we talked about before, one of our key initiatives within Matterhorn is cross-selling. And if you go back to what I mentioned in the prepared remarks and our data center team signed 22 new logos within data center in the quarter and when we segment that on a megawatt basis, 75% of that was cross-sell from our existing client base, those 225,000 clients. So I think that's a good indicator of what we are trying to drive with our Matterhorn initiatives around cross-selling. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Bill, I thought you had missed it if I don't ask you about the underlying volumes in RIM. So I'm going to ask you now if you can provide a little bit of more color on the breakout like RIM adjacent businesses, consumer and other, just how are the underlying factors playing out and maybe talk a little bit about developed markets versus emerging markets as well? William Meaney : Thanks, I appreciate you coming back on. So no, so it's pretty much the same trend that we've seen. So if you think about on the record business on that side is in places like North America that are mature, I would say, it's flat to slightly down in terms of volume. Eastern Europe and some of the emerging markets, it's continued positive volume trend. And as you and I've talked about, it's really about the maturing of the markets. But at the same time, every single customer around the world is continuing to send us new, what I would call, document storage as we come into our facilities. But the growth areas, our combination is, as we've discussed before, is whether it's kind of in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific as well as some of the new storage areas that we're doing for our customers. So expanding what their needs are around physical storage.  So the business, as you noticed, is that -- continue to build positive volume. We continue to have very high utilization across our industrial real estate footprint. So really hats off to the team as they're continuing to provide what is a key platform or a key need for our customers around the whole physical storage pain point that our customers have across the industry. Even the aerospace company that I keep referring to is a big part of that, was providing secure physical storage, which before we weren't doing for them, but because we bundled it with a solution of really end-to-end solution around their information management and digitization of some of those assets, and we can do that seamlessly by storing those documents in our facilities for them. Even in a mature market like the United Kingdom had unlocked new storage opportunities.  So it's really part of now a broader conversation of the Mountain range that we have with our customers. And you can see the numbers, it continues to kind of move forward. So thanks for the question.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We're joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today for our discussion of our record second quarter results. Our team has once again exceeded expectations with performance reflective of our strong legacy of customer service, our laser focus on execution, and our dedication to finding innovative solutions to serve our customers as they evolve their businesses. I'm excited to share that in the second quarter we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.36 billion and record EBITDA of $476 million. This performance is ahead of the expectations we provided last quarter. The enhanced operation model we created through Project Matterhorn has continued to prove successful as our commercial team is empowered to sell the entire Mountain range of products and solutions across our portfolio. We are pleased with the high quality and wide range of our offerings today which positions us to be a nimble partner to serve our customers' needs. To highlight some of our results in the second quarter, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 11% and drove high-teens organic growth in both our data center and digital services businesses. We are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has increased our quarterly dividend per share to $0.65 or $2.60 per share annualized, commencing with our third quarter dividend to be paid in October. As we have said before, when our AFFO payout ratio reached the mid to low 60s as a percentage, we would increase the dividend. Our payout ratio at the end of the second quarter was just under 64%. I would like to begin our broader discussion of some of the customer wins, which led to our record second quarter results. Let me start with records management, where our success was derived from both new and existing customers. One significant win we would like to highlight this quarter was with a large not-for-profit hospital system, faced with rising lease costs, despite a shrinking storage footprint, the customer turned to us for an alternative to storing in their own space. Our Smart Sort solution will address their needs over the next three years. It will deliver cost efficiency and optimize storage space for the customer before they transfer their records to an Iron Mountain facility for secure future management. This win exemplifies our commitment to solving our customers' problems and providing them with tailored solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has led organizations around the world to reassess their current real estate portfolios in order to accommodate remote and hybrid work. Our customers are optimizing their real estate to accommodate changing working practices, we are able to offer solutions that demonstrate the breadth of our portfolio and the value of partnering with Iron Mountain across our products and services. One example is a customer who chose our Clean Start solution to remove and relocate records, office equipment, and IT assets from more than 60 offices across North America that are being closed or decommissioned over the next two years. Thanks to our Asset Lifecycle Management solutions, we are also helping this customer to decommission IT assets from these offices securely and sustainably. We continue to see growing momentum for our digital business with customers turning to us for solutions in areas such as public sector, industry focused solutions, and end-to-end business process management. For example, we are proud to be supporting the digitization of real estate mortgage records held by the Helinick Land Registry in Greece under a two year contract worth $35 million. We demonstrated our understanding of the public sector in Greece and of the European Commission's recovery and resilience facility, which is funding this project through the Greek government to support European economies as they transform the way they support their citizens. This is a breakthrough deal that will provide further opportunities to support similar digitization projects elsewhere in Europe. Another example of how our digital business is enabling us to develop and deliver transformational solutions for our largest customers is with one of the biggest financial service companies in the United States. This customer is outsourcing its noncore services and has selected Iron Mountain to manage all of its records. Our end-to-end solution ensures a secure chain of custody regardless of media format for this customer, leveraging our image on demand service and InSight platform to integrate seamlessly with their customer success management system. This game changing deal demonstrates the power of partnering with Iron Mountain to accelerate our customer's digital transformation. Staying with our Digital Solutions business, our 25 year relationship with a Fortune 500 gas and electric utility company continues to be a powerful example of how our customers turn to Iron Mountain because of the range of solutions we can provide. To ensure our customer is compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements we are digitizing around 20 million images from 8,000 boxes stored with Iron Mountain over the next three years. Having provided records management and data management services since 1998, our customer was confident in our Digital Solutions secure chain of custody, information governance expertise, and ability to scale up quickly to deliver this project. To conclude with records management, on 29th June we acquired the controlling interest in Clutter, a tech enabled on demand consumer storage company. We were previously a minority investor in Clutter and provided storage and operational services through a commercial partnership. This acquisition makes us the industry leader in valet self-storage services in North America. Turning to asset lifecycle management, we continue to see muted pricing for the largest part of this business, which relies on reselling used memory, hard drives and CPUs we receive from hyperscalers. That being said, pricing is stabilized, and we do expect to see an improvement as we head into next year. Moreover, you will recall that our ALM business has three components : hyperscale decommissioning, which is highly dependent on component pricing; enterprise ITAD or IT asset disposition; and original equipment manufacturers or OEMs. In these later categories, we are seeing marked growth and traction. For example, in the enterprise segment, our focus on cross selling the Mountain range of products has driven bookings up a 175% versus second quarter last year. For the OEM segment, you will recall that we signed our first MSA or Master Services Agreement in this area last quarter and we have added another MSA with a second OEM this quarter. Turning to specific wins in the ALM area, a good example of our cross selling appeal comes from the health care industry. A customer which has benefited from Iron Mountain's records management solutions for many years has asked us to manage the recovery, decommissioning, disposal and/or recycling of IT assets at over 2,000 locations in the United States. The strength of our relationship and our customers inherent trust in Iron Mountain has resulted in an ALM contract and renewal of our existing services for the next five years. Also in ALM, our team secured a contract with a leading software and technology company to help them decommission racks of servers and nonessential IT equipment from their data center. Opportunities like this where we are able to extend the value we provide to customs has been significantly enhanced, thanks to the industry knowledge and expertise we have gained through our acquisition and integration of IT renew. We remain very excited about ALM, whilst component pricing remains a drag for part of the business, the growth we are achieving in the services side of the business shows how Iron Mountain's brand strength around security, and reliability are a differentiator in this fast growing area. Moving to our data center business, through the first half of the year we leased 55 megawatts, which includes 2.7 megawatts this quarter. As we said in May the first quarter was particularly strong as we signed some deals earlier than expected. Due to our strong pipeline we now feel confident we will exceed our original projection of 80 megawatts in 2023. This confidence is thanks to our teams delivering record new sales in the first half as well as the size of our late-stage pipeline from some of our largest customers as they add new capacity with the growth of AI. For example, we are well positioned with nearly 120 megawatts of unleased capacity on our Nova campus with our fully secured. In this very important market, we are pleased to note that pricing is moving up appreciably. Staying with our business, I would like to highlight a win that demonstrates the exciting opportunities to expand our solutions and services for customers with a footprint in India and the value of our joint venture with Web Werks in the country. As we've discussed before, India is a key focus for our company's growth and our progress there is a major win for our business. In the second quarter, we closed a deal with a multinational media processing company to provide almost 1 megawatt of storage capacity at our Mumbai data center with the potential to add a further 5 megawatts at this facility and extra capacity at other locations in India. Our data centers team's experience of handling high-density racks, Iron Mountain's wider understanding of the media industry and our expansion plans in Mumbai helped us to convince our customer that we are their best long-term partner as their capacity needs grow. Finally, I would like to mention an example of the success we are enjoying in our Crozier Fine Arts business as we build out one of the few globally integrated logistics, storage, and top-quality services businesses in the art world. Recently, we partnered with a major art gallery in the United Kingdom to support an exhibition by well-known artists. This involves detailed planning and preparations to pack and transports 61 fragile sculptures from the US, Mexico, and Continental Europe. We are proud of the unique expertise that our Crozier teams provide for our customers and to be associated with important exhibitions like this one. To conclude, we are proud of the record results we delivered this quarter as this is evidence that our strategy is working. As we continue to leverage the potential of our entire Mountain range, expand our footprint of storage and services, and deliver tailored innovative solutions for each of our customers, I could not be more grateful for the hard work of our mountaineers. Our Matterhorn program is showing the way and delivering consistently strong sales growth, whilst fueling AFFO growth and our dividend. We are more energized than ever to continue reaching new peaks. And I\u2019m excited for the bright future ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the second quarter, our team achieved solid performance across all metrics, exceeding the projections we shared in May. Revenue grew to a record $1.36 billion, up 5% year-on-year on a reported basis and 6% on an organic and constant currency basis. Revenue was above the expectations we provided on our last call driven by outperformance in both our Global RIM and data center businesses. For me, a key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage rental revenue, which grew 11%. I'll note, this performance was on top of a stronger year-on-year comp and represents an acceleration in rate of growth. This reflects strong contributions from revenue management, data center commences, and positive volume trends. Total service revenue was $527 million, down 1% on a constant currency basis. This was consistent with our projections, which factored in the previously discussed year-on-year component price declines. Importantly, component pricing was consistent in the second quarter on a sequential basis. While this represents a significant headwind year-on-year, we are pleased that pricing has stabilized. As a reminder, that affects our IT renew business most prominently. Excluding our ALM business, service revenue was up 8% on a constant currency basis. This would have resulted in total company revenue growth of 9%. Adjusted EBITDA was $476 million, a new record, up 5% year-on-year with revenue management and strong data center commencements being the key drivers. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, in line with our expectations, driven by revenue management and mix. AFFO was $277 million or $0.94 on per share basis, up $6 million and $0.01 respectively from the second quarter of last year. This was well ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call. Now turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business achieved revenue of $1.16 billion, an increase of $89 million year-on-year, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9%. Revenue management and positive volume trends contribute to strong organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.2%. We delivered organic service revenue growth of 9.3%, driven by Digital Solutions, which were up 20% year-on-year and continued strength in core offerings. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $499 million, an increase of $30 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business, the team deliver [Technical Difficulty] From a total revenue perspective we achieved 17% growth on an organic basis. Organic storage rental revenue growth was particularly strong at 22%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. As we projected, data center services were down year-on-year, given the fit out work we were performing in the first half of last year. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2022 represented the last quarter of these specific fit out services. We will have a more normalized comp on this line going forward. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $54 million, representing 27% growth. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we signed 2.7 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 55 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, we are well on track to achieve our leasing projection for the full year of 80 megawatts. And in fact, with the strength of our building pipeline, we have line of sight to exceed this projection. Turning to asset life cycle management, in the second quarter, revenue grew 4% on a sequential basis, slightly ahead of the projections we gave on our last call. We are seeing positive momentum across all three verticals of our ALM business, which include : hyperscale decommissioning; enterprise ITAD, and OEM. You will recall that China was mostly free of restrictions in the first half of last year, but it returned to tight lockdowns in the second half. As a result, as we anniversary the second quarter comparisons going forward will be much more favorable. While we are diversifying away from China, it is the largest market into which we sell components today. At the beginning of this year, as lockdowns eased, while component volumes increased, pricing declined to record low levels. Industry analysts project March improvement in pricing by the fourth quarter and even more significantly in 2024. To be prudent we have not factored any pricing improvement into our outlook for 2023. Turning to capital. In the second quarter we invested $320 million, of which $287 million was growth and $33 million was recurring. In 2023, we now expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion, up $200 million from our prior expectations. This reflects an increase to our data center development plans given our strong leasing year-to-date and building pipeline that I mentioned. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times, reflecting a meaningful improvement from last year. We have remained at this leverage level for the past three quarters and at March our lowest leverage level since 2017. Importantly, we expect to exit 2023 at this level even with our increased investment in data center. Turning to our dividend. On a trailing four quarter basis our payout ratio was now 63.9% and approximately 400 basis point improvement from this time last year. As you saw earlier today, we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 5%, bringing it to $0.65 per share to be paid in early October. This is consistent with our long term commentary that as our payout ratio settles into the mid to low 60s as a percentage of AFFO, you should expect the dividend to rise. We remain dedicated to our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we are funding our growth objectives, while continuing to drive meaningful shareholder returns. And now, turning to our projections. For the full year, reflecting our performance in the first half and strong outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in excess of $1.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approaching $500 million, AFFO of approximately $290 million and AFFO per share of approximately $0.99. I would like to provide a bit more context for our guidance. In terms of revenue, our third quarter projection equates to growth of 9% as compared to prior year. To frame that, I would recommend investors consider the following points. First, the prior year comparable in our ALM business is much easier in the third and fourth quarters of this year as compared to the first half. Second, we have incremental revenue management actions, which will go into effect in the third and fourth quarters, and will provide a nice tailwind. Lastly, if you consider the underlying trends in the rest of the business, growth has been accelerating for several quarters now our Matterhorn efforts are driving performance. For example, excluding our ALM business, the rest of the business's growth rate was 8% in the first quarter, 9% in the second quarter and our projection is for 10% in the third quarter. And just as a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2022 is our easiest growth comparable this year. To conclude, our team continues to execute well and remains focused on driving our growth agenda. We have a growing and well diversified pipeline and we are positioned to achieve our objectives. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their efforts and contributions. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. Operator : We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the ALM business, performance was impacted by component price declines. And you noted that you saw signs of stabilization in component prices. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that? What trend specifically did you see on component prices, and how would you deconstruct ALM growth between pricing and volumes? Barry Hytinen : Okay. Hi, George. This is Barry. Thank you for the question. Yes, let me help you with that. From a standpoint of the way the decommissioning and component price business has been unfolding this year. As you know, early this year, late last year and into early this year, component pricing was dropping quite appreciably. And by about the February time frame, it had reached over essentially all time record lows. And that's really across the gambit of component pricing from memory to CPUs, all the various components that we're selling. And, that has obviously been a significant impact for both Iron Mountain, but also for many other players in the technology industry. I think importantly what you've seen, and I'm sure you would have been following this, many of the OEMs have significantly reduced their production of new components, which is now limiting supply in the marketplace. And of course, used component pricing tends to directly correlate and follow with new. And so, what we've seen here since the component pricing hit the lows in the kind of February timeframe is, importantly, pricing has been very consistent. In fact, some components have been ticking up. We've seen that in certain elements of memory among other component pricing. So, what we've worked into our outlook though, George, is that, we are keeping component pricing in our outlook for this year at this record level low levels. And our thought process is, that's a prudent way to plan. When you look at industry analysts, then there's -- this is publicly available data, there are many estimates that project for component pricing to begin to lift as we move through the remainder of 2023 and in fact have very, very sharp increases in most component pricing next year in light of supply and demand expectations. As I said, we're not baking that into our 2023 outlook for prudent reasons. We are anticipating that our total ALM business will be up just a few million dollars on a sequential basis in the third quarter. And then will be up again in the fourth quarter, but that speaks to the points that Bill made in his prepared remarks that, for example, in our enterprise ITAD business, bookings are up a tremendous amount in the second quarter year-on-year. We are winning more decommissioning business across that decommissioning vertical. And of course, our OEM teams have been winning very important wins for us, which I think set us up very well for the intermediate and longer term in the broader asset lifecycle management space. Volume on a sequential basis was essentially equivalent, George, which we felt good about. And I would say the forward pipeline as it relates to volume in light of what I've just mentioned is favorable for us. So we feel that we are now getting through the hardest comps of the year. As you know, last year, we were $72 million, -- $71 million, $72 million of revenue in the first quarter with ALM, we were $83 million in the second quarter. That dropped quite appreciably to $60 million in the third and $55 million or so in the fourth. So that goes to my point about the comps get easier with pricing being flat to up, we feel well positioned. Thanks, George. Operator : The next question comes from Nate Crossett of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Thank you. So is it fair to say, I guess, that the service revenue growth year-over-year, like, this is the low quarter in 2Q? And that we should expect maybe it to trend out from here? And then maybe just comment on storage rental growth that still remains very strong. Can you maybe just speak to recent customer conversations and your ability to push price? Barry Hytinen : Okay. Thanks, Nate. This is Barry. Couple things there. So, on services, yes, you are thinking about that right, because really when you look at the total company's service revenue growth, it was completely impacted by the fact that the ALM business was essentially half that which it was in the prior year. And at that some $40 million of revenue, that's a big drag on the service in total because, as you know, all of the ALM revenue essentially is on the service line. And I'll give you a point that if you look at Global RIM, for example, our service revenue there was up over 9%. And so, the total company's service revenue will be improving. It should be positive in the third quarter, of course, and furthermore in the fourth quarter because, frankly, by then ALM no longer is a drag on our service revenue. In fact, I think it may even -- there's a chance it may be accretive to growth rate in service by the fourth quarter. In terms of storage rental revenue growth, we have had -- as your question alludes to, strong performance there and our revenue management actions have been very well received. We are, of course, very focused on driving value for our customers and making sure that they understand the significant value that Iron Mountain provides, both in terms of our core offerings of records and -- but also all the other offerings that we can cross sell around things such as enterprise IT asset disposition, data center services, among other. And so, in terms of where you should expect storage rental revenue growth, volume has been trending very consistent with our expectations. It's been modestly positive and we continue to expect that positive outlook. And from a revenue standpoint, total revenue standpoint, you should expect it to continue to be comping quite well. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have some incremental revenue management actions in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And that helps the growth rate, particularly in the fourth quarter, Nate, because as you may remember, last year more of our revenue management actions were shifted into the third quarter just from a timing of what we were doing last year. And this year, it's a little bit spread out. So these new revenue management actions that I alluded to today on the call, that's incremental to our prior plans and will be, as I said, a nice tailwind to growth rate. So thank you for the question, Nate. William Meaney : Yes. And just one thing I would add for Nate on the storage trend sort of volume, you probably picked up from some of the wins we highlighted is that, as companies are shifting their use of space as the workforce is more remote or hybrid. That's yielding both increased volume for our storage facilities as they clean out or decide that they want to have it depoed rather than in an office that people don't visit as much or at all anymore. As well as, as Barry pointed out, [indiscernible] behind this 175% year-over-year increase in ITAD bookings, both because as companies are kind of cleaning out, it's a tailwind both on the storage in the ITAD business. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Alex Hess : Yes. Hi. This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. Maybe just to dig in on Global RIM for a second. Can you remind us what percent of storage revenues are in some manner CPI linked with -- maybe what the price floor and lease terms look like nowadays? And then just quickly on Clutter, how does that factor into your outlook and maybe some thoughts around that business, which we understand had some cash flow issues as a standalone company on its own. Thanks guys. Barry Hytinen : Okay. Hi, Alex. It's Barry. Thanks for those questions. For proprietary and confidential reasons, we don't generally characterize our contracts too specifically. But what I'll say is, certainly as you know, you follow the company for such a long time, we have a very large number of customers, 200 -- call it, 200,000 plus client relationships. The vast majority of those are on our standard, if you will, paper that allows us to affect revenue management actions. And as I said before, we are very aligned with driving value.at times of essentially our choosing and is not, if you will, linked to any sort of indices. There are some, what I would describe as more bespoke contracts with some of our largest clients, which may have specific agreements around escalators and the like, but that is the -- that is a small number of total contracts. With respect to Clutter, appreciate that question. As just to help others who may not be as familiar with Clutter. Clutter is a business that we have had a minority stake in for a while now and it was a form of a joint venture. We own about 25% of the company prior to the transaction that we mentioned this morning. And that's on the valet self-storage. So it is a business that we have been providing, if you will, back end services too for some time in storing a fair bit of the volume that Clutter had been bringing in from consumers. And what Clutter's focus had been on is building a brand and aggregating consumer demand, principally in, as Bill mentioned, tech enabled manner. On a net basis, when all is said and done, we'll pay a little over some $20 million to buy the business will also contribute various of our assets. So you'll see that through our other expense and income line on the P&L. And from a standpoint, for your modeling purposes, revenue on a quarterly basis, this being the incremental revenue that Iron Mountain will recognize now because, of course, we were recognizing revenue from what we were doing for services to Clutter previously. We'll recognize maybe a bit over $10 million. It'll be an excess of $10 million on a quarterly basis, likely to be growing as we move into the New Year. And from an EBITDA standpoint and you would have seen this from our prior filings because, of course, we were absorbing our minority interest in Clutter through our P&L. As I said, they've been building their brand for some time. So it is -- Clutter has been absorbing a modest EBITDA loss on a quarterly basis, thinks something in the vicinity of a couple of $1 million a quarter over time and perhaps by, let's say, 2024, we expect to be able to drive that to breakeven and ultimately to generating positive EBITDA out of the Clutter Enterprise itself as we drive operating synergies by combining the two businesses together. I'll just note, of course, Iron Mountain had been generating positive EBITDA on the relationship previously. So the incremental negative drag that I just referenced is purely off of the brand building elements of the clutter enterprise itself. The last thing I'll note is -- Alex is, of course, we reiterated our guidance and feel very good about it, despite absorbing that little drag there from Clutter that we will absorb here in the second half. So appreciate the questions. Operator : The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about the gross margin trends? They were --look like they were down particularly in the services, down like 200 basis points year-over-year. Does that have to do with something from ALM or something else? I saw the labor costs were up almost 10% year-over-year. And, also, I thought maybe you could just comment. Bill, I always add you about talking about the underlying trends in the volumes in the wind business. If you could just comment on that, are you getting more positive trends in the historical mature markets than what we've seen before. You mentions, like, that hospital contract. Is that something that was going to lead to more positive volume trends in an area that historically been a little bit more of a weaker trends. William Meaney : Okay. Let me start with the labor costs and the trends in terms of the volume. So I think, first, starting off on the volume trends is, as I was saying to Nate -- to Nate's question is that, overall, the volume, as you can see, is flat, slightly up. So it's trending in the right direction. And I wouldn't say this is a -- it's going to be a massive change. But what we see, if you think about 730 million cubic feet, so it's a very large base that we're operating on, is the trends that we see both in some of the new storage areas, but as well as what we see in people going into a hybrid or remote working aspect. It really is getting a lot more traction for our Smart Sort and Clean Start type solutions, which uncover more storage, also the services that we can provide being depoed. In other words, we can serve their employees anywhere they are. They don't have to come to the office to actually get information back, whether we give it back to them physically or image on demand. And then it's also uncovering, as we say, is driving a lot of the increased bookings that we see in the enterprise ALM side of the business and fueling that 175% growth that we see. So overall, we feel really good about where the trends are, but you can imagine, on 730 million cubic feet around the world, is that -- even what I call quite macro trends that I described are --don't change the overall trajectory like massively, but it is definitely a tailwind for that business. And on labor costs, before I hand it back to Barry is, you're right, labor costs is up. Some of it is as we go into new areas in terms -- as we ramp, or some of the projects that we ramp on, then obviously we're bringing labor in ahead of time. And the other part is making sure that our mountaineers around the world are well looked after, because we really do see the -- it's the core to us. We're a business services company. And the first impression that our customers have is our mountaineers, and we want to make sure that they and their families are well looked after. And the inflation environment globally has been challenging for a number of our colleagues. Barry Hytinen : Yeah. Shlomo, this is Barry. Maybe I'll just pick up there on [Technical Difficulty] you would have seen a similar increase in the first quarter when we made the actions as it relates to improved wages that Bill was just referring to. And then, I would point out on a sequential basis, labor was up about 2%, while service revenue was up 5% on a sequential basis, reflecting the [Technical Difficulty] down year-on-year. As your question alluded to, that has all to do with our component pricing, IT renew, because when you think about it, we are still processing a considerable amount of volume, yet we are recognizing a much lower price. And so, if you excluded the impact of component pricing, actually service gross margins were up quite nicely, which speaks to the ongoing trend in the rest of the core and frankly to the productivity that the team is driving in asset lifecycle management. So when you think about what could happen with our gross margins as pricing recovers, we've got a lot of operating leverage in that business. So I feel good about the forward look if the industry projections are anywhere close to accurate for where pricing will be next year, I think we're going to see a really nice lift there. So thanks, Shlomo. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. Couple of questions. First, just interested in how to kind of frame the exposure in your data center business to [indiscernible] where there's a lease in in Phoenix. And then, interested in just the data center development pipeline and kind of the opportunities ahead and your thoughts about bringing in third-party capital to maybe co-invest. There was obviously a recent transaction in India and in other countries where third-party capital is [indiscernible] in the development projects of some of the established players and your thoughts on pursuing that route from a capital standpoint? Thanks. William Meaney : Okay. Thanks, Jon. I'll start with the -- what we see on the data center horizon and the I\u2019ll turn it over to Barry. I think first of all, we're really pleased with how our data center business continues to grow. And also, as you know, I know you cover the industry extremely closely is that, pricing is up markedly, like as we look in markets like Northern Virginia on a triple net basis as we see around the hyperscale segment, pricing up some 40% so the returns continue to grow and keep pace. I think in terms of -- looking at the size of our pipeline, Barry mentioned [Technical Difficulty] million on top of the $1 billion that we already had for investment capital in 2023. Based on the strength of that pipeline and the success that we're having, pretty much across the globe is that -- I mean, you're right that we're always kind of conscious of in terms of how we fund our projects. That being said, we're actually fortunate that we have the records management business and our other services business, which is like a financial beast. I mean, it just generates a tremendous amount of cash that not only fuels the dividend, but it also fuels a lot of the development capital into our data centers. So I wouldn't say that we're in a situation where kind of a company that is solely in the date center space that has only to itself to look for in terms of how it funds itself going forward to drive a lot of the development. We actually have a growing, but some people will consider a mature business in terms of the amount of capital we have to put into that because it\u2019s a very scaled high operating leverage business and we are able to use funds and profitability from that to fund a big part of our development. That being said, as you know, that we've done -- we have taken third-party capital a couple of times already, and we typically do that on stabilized or near stabilized assets and tap into funds that where people are looking for relatively low yielding, but long maturity or duration type assets. And we'll continue to do that as some of our portfolio stabilizes. I can imagine that we would recycle capital when the opportunity presents itself. But overall, if you look at the plan that we laid out last September in terms of our Investor Day, we're probably a little bit ahead of that in data center just because of the growth that we've been seeing in the first half of this year and what we see in the pipeline. But we feel pretty good about that we have a fully funded plan in terms of the way we're doing it now. But if there's opportunities, as I say, to take third-party capital, especially around stabilized assets, generally that boost our returns long term and we will do that. Barry Hytinen : Hey, Jon. It\u2019s Barry. Thanks for the question. We for natural and perhaps obvious reasons we don't tend to comment on individual clients. But as you noted, there are some things out there in the public domain as well as in their filings that would confirm that they are client of ours in Arizona. That's obviously a very long-standing relationship that goes back to prior to our ownership of one of the data centers that we purchased there. I mentioned that intently because, of course, it's a long standing contract with pricing that goes back quite a ways and, frankly, is sort of a -- almost a build to suit type of situation for them where it would not be [Technical Difficulty] let me put it this way. In Arizona, we are essentially a 100% [Technical Difficulty] we are 100% lease now in Scottsdale on what we're under construction for in our second facility, phase 5 and 6, were 100% -- 5 and 8, we're 100% leased as well in terms of prelease. So it's not a particularly large revenue client, Jon. And beyond that, I wouldn't want to comment, but you would see in the filings the relative amount of, let's say, credit that we have between the two entities. And I feel very confident that in light of where we see pricing, and I'll just -- maybe I should just add this. That in general, on hyperscale pricing today, we're seeing on a triple net basis pricing up about 40%. And so, we feel very good about where data center is trending on a macro basis and where we are. And one last point, just build on thing Bill was mentioning. And when you look at our, I think there's a unique part of our data center story is, we're operating about 220 megawatts. We're nearly fully leased on that. And we're under construction on about another 200 megawatts. And the thing to think about that is, we're not building to [Technical Difficulty] anything, and we're 91% prelease on everything that we have [Technical Difficulty] doing a phenomenal job, and we're working hard to figure out which other facilities to start construction on as the pipeline continues to build quite appreciably. So we feel really good about where our data center business is trending, Jon. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much, and thanks for the disclosures. Hey, Barry, can we unpack the guidance a little bit? I just want to make sure understand, because it seems like you reiterated the full year. But if I think about the puts and takes, it sounds like the pricing is a lot better. The CapEx is going up a lot. And, again, that may not be revenue that comes in. It looks like the Q2 is a little better. It looks like the Clutter is going to have some incremental revenue modestly. Is that offset the ALM business, or is it just a little bit of conservatism? And just, as you put that all together, how should we think about cash flow for the full year, not operating, but just what the use of cash should be, particularly given the step-up in the CapEx. Barry Hytinen : Okay. Thanks Kevin. Appreciate that. You're right that our revenue management program is doing very, very well. And obviously, our storage rental revenue growth has been growing. And as I mentioned, some of our growth rates are actually accelerating that being one of those. And that's thanks to both our Global RIM teams, as well as our data center teams, because commencements has been very strong. You referenced that CapEx is up, as I mentioned, that's going to build out our data center portfolio that's already preleased. So we are endeavoring to meet all customer demand, which continues to ramp. In terms of -- you are right, Clutter adds a relatively small amount of revenue. We probably are a touch more conservative with ALM in the back half, Kevin, than where we were at the beginning of the year because, of course, at the beginning of the year component pricing was still -- was still coming down. And now it's stabilized we've recognized that those stable levels of pricing. As I said, that may prove to be conservative as we move through the year, but we are only halfway through. So we tend to try to not get ahead of ourselves, Kevin. In terms of cash generation and the compilation of the incremental CapEx. Here\u2019s what I'd underscore. We have reiterated our leverage expectations that we will be at 5.1 times at year end, which is consistent with where we are today, and at a multiyear level low. So we feel really good about the cash generation of the business. We're generating incrementally higher returns in data center on that CapEx investment. Returns on hyperscale have moved from kind of the seven, eight level to more like eight, nine, and retail cash on levered returns are also quite firm. And so, we're blending into that low double digit vicinity on a combined basis. We feel really good about where things are trending, Kevin, so appreciate your questions. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hi. Thanks for the questions. Two, if I could. So, just wanted to touch again on the data center pipeline. Any requirements you see that you think are tied to this wave of generative AI demand we're hearing about in the industry? And does that change at all how you design your data center for some of the higher densities that are required for these types of deployments? And then secondly, on the hyperscale ALM business. I know you talked about China COVID shutdowns impacting that business. Has there been any move to kind of diversify your end markets to resale beyond China to help reduce the concentration there? Thank you. William Meaney : Thanks, Eric. So, yes, on the trends that we're seeing, I mean, and you've been following this industry for [EON's] (ph). I think you see the same thing I did -- we have, right? I mean, maybe a year ago we saw -- still very high growth in high scale, but they're probably a little bit more conservative. And now there's another wave of really accelerated growth because they're trying to keep pace with the amount of compute power is required to really run a lot of these large language models associated with the AI programs. And so, we have seen a -- it's not just type, but we actually see virtually all of our largest hyperscale customers coming to us looking for more capacity. And that's why we were speaking with such confidence that we'll exceed our original full year guidance in terms of the amount of leasing activity we expect. It's just -- it is very, very strong. Now in terms of the type of deployment, you're also right that the density that they're looking for is much higher. And I think I'm right to say probably year, year and a half ago we didn't have any customers coming to us and asking us to water cool in racks to actually support some of these higher densities. And now we are seeing a number of deployments that are requiring that kind of design. Luckily, I mean, we built our designs to be flexible. And of course, for these large deployments, we're actually doing the design to meet the customer, very specific customer requirements. So we're able to accommodate the higher density quite easily. But you're right. I mean, with the density that some folks are looking at and the amount of power they want to put in a rack, we are cooling using different methods and specifically some water cooling in rack to support the requirements. Barry Hytinen : And Eric, it's, Barry. As it relates to diversifying away from China, as we've talked about before, that certainly is a focus of the team. We have added to our organization in ALM and specifically around diversifying the downstream channels, we are making steady progress, but it is slow because, of course, as we've said before, China is the main market for us in that regard. But we are looking at and branching into throughout Southeast Asia there are opportunities we think over the intermediate term in India. We certainly have been selling more components into the U.S. and Europe as well, and that's a key focus, as well as the Mid-East. So there is -- there are opportunities there, and we are building that -- those channels The other thing I'll just build on and link the two questions is, when you think about hyperscale decommissioning, we generally are decommissioning data centers that were put into service, let's say, five years prior. And so -- on average. And the thing about AI in this very significant ramp in terms of hyperscale data center development right now is, it will provide even another leg to our hyperscale decommissioning growth five years on. Historically I've had some questions about like, well, how does the decommissioning business continue to ramp over time? And of course, the things that we'll be decommissioning this year are components that were put in place about five years ago. And next year, we'll be decommissioning things that were put in place four years ago. And as those data center platforms have grown, it provides that much larger of a platform for us to decommission in the future. And I think it shouldn't be lost on us that of this AI growth is going to drive another substantial leg up in the opportunity for hyperscale decommissioning in the future. And as the leader in that space, we feel quite good about the future. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on the storage -- excuse me, the retention rate in the Global RIM business, it looks like you contracted about 100 basis points year-over-year and it's at, probably the lowest level in the past few years. I understand that the storage business has generated really strong growth, driven by price, but maybe you could kind of square some of those dynamics there as well. Barry Hytinen : Okay. Hi, Brendan. It\u2019s a -- thanks for the question. When you look at that metric, I'll just remind you that it is on a trailing four quarter basis. So what you've got going on there is -- what you've got going on there is an element of COVID still because we were naturally seeing client fell little bit less activity of switching and/or disruption, what have you, during the COVID period and even in the period after we all felt like COVID was over, if you will. And so, that's a little bit of catching up. But if you look back on that metric over, let\u2019s say, the last 15 years and that data is available in our historic disclosure, you'd find that we're in a very tight band and not outside our normal levels from a pre COVID standpoint. I appreciate the question. I will tell you that we feel we feel -- we are -- our customer relationships are very good. We can -- as you linked it to revenue management, I would say our focus on revenue management is continuing to educate our customers on the very significant value we drive for them day in and day out. And the fact that our volume continues to trend positively, I think, should give you a very good indicator there of how we're doing with our customers.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 of our presentation and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and we've included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today to discuss another record quarterly results. Once again, our Mountaineers have gone above and beyond in their efforts to serve our customers with innovative solutions that support their businesses, putting our customers first runs deep in all we do and sits at the core of Iron Mountain. This legacy, combined with our dedication to not only protect but to elevate the power of our customers' assets and work continues to drive our execution and growth. Turning to our results. We delivered record third quarter performance once again achieving our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.4 billion which to put that in context, is an increase of over $100 million year-over-year and record EBITDA of $500 million. The strength in these results is a direct result of the positive momentum we are building from Project Matterhorn. We are more than a year into our growth journey and are pleased with our enhanced operating model, which is empowering our commercial organization to cross-sell our products and services. In the third quarter, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 10% as a result of continued revenue management success and improved volume trends and drove over 20% organic growth in our data center business. Let's begin by turning to some of our customer wins, which played a significant role in our ability to achieve these record results. In our records management business, we had a public sector win this quarter in the U.K. with a new contract worth nearly $2 million. This new project is with an important government agency and has been an Iron Mountain customer for 18 years. In that time, our relationship has expanded from an off-site records management provider to an integral partner at our customers highly secure site, which indicates the trust and confidence our customers have in us. By relocating and digitizing important records securely, our customer can make faster and more informed decisions that are critical due to the sensitive nature of its work, whilst also freeing up on-site space. As a public sector organization, the value for each dollar they spend is a key concern for this customer, and we continue to demonstrate that Iron Mountain is the partner of choice for their digital transformation journey. In Digital Solutions, this business continues to gain momentum, especially with our ability to provide higher value, technology-enabled solutions to new and existing Iron Mountain customers. Customer wins for our digital solutions are underpinned by three key differentiators. First, our unique ability to provide a unified end-to-end solution for our customers across their physical and digital assets. Second, our proven capabilities to operate at scale in complex regulated environments and industries. Last, but importantly, our ability to drive business outcomes for our customers, leveraging our artificial intelligence platform, which translates unstructured data into actionable insights. For example, we have been awarded a contract by the TV and film production distribution division of a major technology company, with a story history dating back almost 100 years, we are leveraging our InSight platform to digitize, archive and preserve over 200,000 legal records containing the media rights for distribution and licensing of thousands of film in titles and TV episodes. With all this data available through one cloud-based digital platform, we can help our customers identify and develop new business opportunities by leveraging its rich intellectual property. This latest deal builds on a growing portfolio of solutions we are providing for this global customers' different business units, including records management and IT asset disposition. The multifaceted long-standing relationship we have with this customer truly highlights the success of Project Matterhorn and our cross-selling efforts. Now let's turn to our continued success in winning government business around the world. We are supporting government agencies in Europe to digitize public services as part of an initiative to make their economies and societies more sustainable and resilient following the COVID-19 pandemic. This quarter, we won a two-year deal to digitize around 10 million files to accelerate a backlog of pension payments for one national government Social Security Administration agency. In awarding Iron Mountain this contract, the customer recognized the specialist nature of our solution, including our AI and human in the loop capabilities and our ability to quickly scale operationally to deliver this project within the required time frame. Also in the public sector, we are pleased to be working with the U.S. citizen and Immigration Services to help drive efficiency and reduce the backlog of applicants awaiting adjudication decisions to become U.S. citizens. Over the last 10 years, we have been a proud partner with this important government agency. Having been entrusted with over 500,000 cubic feet of files in high-density tapes, our digitization solutions will enable remote adjudicators to have faster access to vital data, helping them make overall immigration decisions. Turning to our asset life cycle management business. Consistent with the projections we shared last quarter, pricing has been stable, having hit a low level last February. Whilst industry projections are for significant price improvements in late 2023 and throughout 2024, we have continued to take a prudent perspective and are only assuming marginal incremental pricing improvement for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline is robust, and we have delivered solid results this quarter that were in line with our expectations. Also, we are excited to share that we have signed an agreement to acquire Regency Technologies subject to customary closing conditions as we continue our roll-up of the ALM market. Regency is a little over $100 million annual revenue business in the ALM space based in Ohio. The long-term customer relationships that Regency brings to Iron Mountain are an excellent strategic fit to our ALM business. Regency will add operational scale as we continue our growth journey in this fast-growing sector. As the world's need for both secure and more circular solutions for end-of-life IT assets becomes more vital, we are pleased to add to our capability in this category. With that, let us turn our discussion to some individual wins within the ALM space this quarter. I am pleased to share a particularly exciting win for our ALM business with a large global technology company. The deep relationship and trust we have built with this customer over many years was instrumental in Iron Mountain securing the significant deal serving multiple business lines and geographies for the customer. These geographies include India, where our presence and ability to service the customer was a decisive differentiator alongside our global footprint, the expertise and responsiveness of our ALM team and our reputation for data security and chain of custody. Also in ALM, we have signed a long-term contract with a private U.S. insurance company that has been a long-time customer of our U.S. Secure Shredding and Destruction services. Last year, we began supporting this customer with one-off IT asset destruction projects, which demonstrated the value of remarketing thousands of these assets. The agreement we have now reached positions us as our customers strategic partner for its future end-to-end IT asset management needs. By supporting the requirements of an organization with over 37,000 leased IT assets that need returning from remote employees, we are extending the value of the solutions we bring and have changed our customers' perception of what Iron Mountain can offer. Finally, we have a particularly exciting win to share. We have secured a significant five-year ALM contract to support a leading pharmaceutical retailer in the U.S. to advance its commitment to zero waste by 2030. Iron Mountain will provide a circular economy solution by removing and recycling thousands of tons of pharmaceutical stock bottles and pill bottles from thousands of its retail outlets across the U.S. We are providing this leading retailer with an advanced recycling solution turning plastic into raw materials. This will enable the creation of new virgin plastic, helping this retailer meet their environmental goals. This is made possible by the scale of our physical presence, our highly experienced ALM team and a reporting platform for all of the confidential weights that we have managed for this customer since 2014. We are pleased to be able to extend the value of our partnership with this new contract. Moving on to our data center business. Our pipeline continues to expand with positive pricing trends. The continuing strong demand for data center capacity, continues to be driven by digital transformation and most recently, the explosive demand for AI. Supporting the growth and expansion needs of our customers is paramount to our collaborative partnerships, and we are pleased to provide this required capacity to our customers in the markets in which they are keen to operate. From a leasing perspective, in the third quarter, we signed 65 megawatts. This means that through the end of the third quarter, we have already signed 120 megawatts far beyond our original projection, for the year of 80 megawatts. In the quarter, 60 megawatts were signed across two leases to a single Fortune 500 technology company at our campus in Northern Virginia. The deal provides this hyperscale customer with capacity across two buildings on our 142-acre, 276-megawatt campus and represents, the largest revenue deal in Iron Mountain data center's history. We have also won a deal to provide nearly three megawatts of capacity at our Frankfurt data center for an existing North American cloud services customer looking to expand their European footprint. Our sales teams work closely with the customers' technical team to agree on a strategic solution that meets the customers' unique infrastructure needs. Given the strong customer demand in our data center business, we are continuing to expand the reach of our platform. To that end, I am pleased to announce a couple of capacity additions. First, we are repurposing a previous records management facility in Miami to data center use. Miami is a key market, where a number of our customers, are looking for edge deployments and this newly repurposed facility will add 16 megawatts to our data center portfolio. Furthermore, we have acquired additional land and power this quarter, growing our total data center capacity to 860 megawatts, up 80 megawatts from last quarter. In summary, the hard work dedication and execution of our Mountaineers continues to deliver strong results for our loyal customers and ultimately, our company shareholders. Through our Matterhorn initiative fueled by our enhanced operating model, our team continues to achieve record sales growth by selling our entire mountain range of products and services to our long-standing 225,000 customers. Even in a tumultuous geopolitical climate, the resilience and strength of our business model, combined with the dedication and customer-first passion of our mountaineers continues to drive us ever higher. I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to our team for their hard work and continued focus as we continue our growth journey. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results today. In the third quarter, our team achieved strong performance across all metrics, including another record for revenue and EBITDA. Revenue grew to $1.4 billion, up 8% year-on-year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis, in line with our projection. Our key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage rental revenue, which grew 10%. This reflects continued strong contributions from revenue management, data center commencements and positive volume trends. Total service revenue was $530 million, consistent year-over-year on a constant currency basis and slightly improved on a sequential basis. As we discussed last quarter, service revenue includes the impact of component price declines versus the prior year. Excluding our ALM business, total company constant currency revenue growth would have been 9%. Our team delivered a new record for adjusted EBITDA at $500 million, up 7% year-on-year. This was modestly ahead of our guidance for the quarter despite the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly. On the same foreign exchange rates we used in August, we would have achieved $504 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter ahead of our projection. EBITDA growth was driven by continued strength in revenue management and strong data center commencements. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, up 100 basis points sequentially and ahead of our projections by 50 basis points. Upside was driven by productivity across our operations, including improving trends in our ALM business. AFFO was $290 million or $0.99 on a per share basis, up $2 million and $0.01 on a per share basis from the third quarter of last year. Both of these were in line with the projections we shared on our last call. On the same foreign exchange rates, we were using in August, AFFO would have been $294 million, or $1 on a per share basis, both ahead of our projections. And now turning to segment performance. In the third quarter, our global RIM business achieved revenue of $1.18 billion, an increase of $92 million year-on-year or 8%. Revenue management and positive volume trends, contribute to strong organic storage rental revenue growth of 8%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA, was $517 million, an increase of $33 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. The team delivered revenue of $128 million, an increase of over $27 million year-on-year. Organic storage rental revenue growth was strong at 22%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $53 million, up over $10 million or 25% year-on-year. Turning to new and expansion leasing. We signed 65 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 120 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, we signed two leases with a client for a total of 60 megawatts. The leases are expected to commence in phases from late 2024 through mid-2025 and have a 15-year term. With the strength of our leasing, I'll note that our weighted average lease expiration is now 8.1 years, which is up a full three years from the third quarter of 2022. As we've talked about before, one of the key elements of our Matterhorn growth plan is to expand cross-selling. Our team is doing a great job in this regard. For example, 95% of the megawatts booked in the quarter, were a result of cross-selling activity. Market-to-market was up over 11% in the quarter, reflecting the continuing trend of strong and improving pricing, while churn was only 1%. Turning to asset life cycle management. In the third quarter, revenue was consistent on a sequential basis, in line with the projections we gave on our last call. We are seeing positive momentum across all three verticals of our ALM business, hyperscale, enterprise and OEM. ALM bookings have been running ahead of our projections.  And similar to data center, our commercial teams are doing a great job with our cross-selling initiative. For example, of the new ALM deals we signed in the quarter, nearly all of them were cross-sell wins. I think this is an early validation of our strategy and supports our long-term view that we can gain considerable market share by leveraging our deep customer relationships and expanding ALM capabilities. Now, I would like to spend a moment addressing component pricing. As expected, pricing was consistent with the second quarter on a sequential basis. At this point, in the fourth quarter, there are indications that component pricing is beginning to recover. For example, since the end of the third quarter, we have seen the pricing for memory rising week over week with it now up nearly 15% on a sequential basis. As we've mentioned on our last call, industry analysts have been forecasting rising prices by late this year, with continued recovery in 2024. Turning to our pending acquisition of Regency Technologies. As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have signed this deal. We've known Regency for years and have always been impressed with the strength of their team, range of capabilities and focus on sustainability, productivity and customer service. We see this acquisition as an excellent strategic fit furthering our ability to serve our expanding ALM customer base. The purchase price is $200 million with $125 million to be paid at close and the remainder due in 2025. Subject to performance, there is also an earn-out, which could be payable in 2027. On a trailing four-quarter basis, Regency has revenue in excess of $100 million. We are acquiring the business at an approximate 7.5 times EBITDA multiple. We expect the deal to close late this year or early in 2024. We expect this will be immediately accretive to AFFO and have no impact on our leverage calculation. Turning to capital. In the third quarter, we invested $322 million, of which $287 million was growth and $35 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times. We expect to exit 2023 at this level. I think it is worth noting that this marks our lowest leverage level in a decade. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share, to be paid in early January. We remain dedicated to our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we are funding our growth objectives while continuing to drive meaningful shareholder returns. And now turning to our projections. For the full year, reflecting our year-to-date performance and strong outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.44 billion, which represents 12.5% growth year-over-year as revenue management actions and improving trends in ALM accelerate our growth. I would like to call out using the same foreign exchange rates we had in August, fourth quarter revenue would have been $25 million higher in this projection. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $520 million or 10% growth. AFFO of approximately $310 million, which is 8% growth and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05, which is 7% growth from the prior year. With the same FX rates we were using in August, this projection would be approximately adjusted EBITDA of $528 million, AFFO of $318 million and AFFO per share of $1.07. In conclusion, we are pleased to report another record quarter of results. Our team is executing well, driving considerable growth of revenue and EBITDA aligned with our Matterhorn plans. I would like to take the opportunity to thank our entire team for their efforts to support our customers and drive our growth. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Revenue management is continuing to drive healthy price realization in storage and services. Can you elaborate on, how you expect price actions to trend as inflation normalizes and discuss client sensitivity to pricing increases in the services business, compared to the storage business? William Meaney : Yes. Thanks, George and good morning. So, I think that you can expect and you can see that through the course of the year, even as inflation has come off, is that we're continuing to be able to use revenue management across the board in our - especially in our records management business, and that's really based on how our customers value the services. So, we don't see any change in that trend. And in fact, in terms of customer retention, you've seen even a slight improvement in that during that period of time. So, just as the customers really understand the value that we're applying, and we're actually using revenue management to tap into that. So, we don't see any change in that trend. Barry Hytinen : And George, it's Barry. Just to add on to that, I would say, as you think about the fourth quarter, we have revenue management actions that have been put in place in the third quarter that, will power another $20 million or $25 million of sequential growth even going forward here, in the fourth quarter. So that's part of the model, as you think about third quarter and fourth quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Nate Crossett of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hi. Good morning. Just a question on organic service revenue growth. Commentary sounded pretty positive on component pricing. So do you expect that, that metric will be positive in 4Q? And then just on Regency. Maybe you can talk about how the organic growth has been for that business year-to-date? And then lastly, just your expectation of RIM volumes heading into 4Q and next year? Thank you. William Meaney : Thanks, Nate. Let me answer the question on Regency and then Barry will take your other two points. So on Regency, you can imagine they went through probably a similar growth profile that we saw in ALM. And they also have kind of, I would say, hit the low point probably about four months ago. And since then, they're actually growing kind of mid-single digits over the last, say, two, three, four months. And that's - they probably recovered a little bit faster than our business, but that's where the complementary mix of the two businesses is there, both in terms of the customers that they serve, and they do a lot more on the downstream processing, than the business that we have at Iron Mountain that we've acquired through IT renews. So, it's a good complementary fit. But we also see that they've actually, over the last few months, been growing single digits. Obviously, the business will continue to ramp, hence the pricing across the board starts improving. Barry Hytinen : Nate, hi it's Barry. Thanks for those questions. On volume, as you saw in the quarter, we continue to grow volume, both in global records as well as in the corporate and other. And as you know, because you cover the company for so long, our expectation over the horizon is for volume to continue to be consistent to slightly up year in and year out. So, we are pleased with the volume continuing to trend at or even a little bit, better actually than our projections. And we continue to see that, both in the quarter coming as well as into the New Year. So very good and positive trends on the volume side. As it relates to service revenue, yes, we do expect service revenue to be up year-on-year, as I've talked about before, the second quarter was the hardest comp for our ALM business, because in light of what was going on in the prior year, that's when revenue for ALM was about $83 million in total. In the third quarter of last year, it was $60 million. And it was $56 million in the fourth quarter. And this year, it's $42 million in the second quarter and in the third quarter. And as Bill and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we expect our ALM business to be in the, let's say, low 50s. So that helps - with the standpoint of turning around the comp that, you'll see for the total company. The other thing is, just in light of project revenue. For example, in our digital and our global records services, we have incremental project revenue in the fourth quarter and some commencements, on some longer-term digital contracts occurring here in the fourth quarter, which will help our additional service revenue, and is favorable as it relates to the third quarter. As you know, some of that project revenue can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And that's one of the reasons, why we are bullish on the sequential improvement in total revenue in the fourth quarter. So you'll see a little bit of an acceleration, thanks to ALM getting better and easier comp as well as the trending. We - as Bill mentioned last thing, since you asked about component pricing, we've only factored in what I would call a marginal modest improvement in pricing. And certainly, we are pleased to see pricing on memory rising, as much as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, but it's - we and the whole industry have been through a lot there. So we'll kind of be prudent and watch it before baking in too much into our numbers. Thanks, Nate. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. I was wondering if you could maybe put a finer point on helping us think about the impact of pricing actions in the room segment versus volume, kind of what the relative impacts were. And then for the ALM segment, I think you I talked about trying to get to $900 million in 2026. Is that still a number to think about? Or given the M&A that you've done with Regency and just the organic growth, any different way to think about that target? William Meaney : No. Thanks, Jon. So I'll - let me take the ALM and then I'll let Barry talk a little bit more about pricing and volume trends. So on the ALM side, yes, we haven't backed off from our multiyear target that we shared at Investor Day, a little over a year ago. We still see the $900 million as a reasonable target in terms of the business trends, because one thing that we have continued to see is incoming volume. So if you look both year-over-year and year-to-date and sequentially is we do see volume continuing to grow and to ramp. And as Barry said, that we've seen now pricing starting to come back, whilst it's early green shoots, but 15% improvement in memory pricing, which you probably recall from our call last time is the bulk of the components that we sell on is - it shows that we're moving in the right direction to get back towards the type of pricing that we saw couple of years ago. So, if you put that all together and now with the additional capabilities that we're getting from the Regency acquisition is that both - they do a lot more on the downstream processing, which quite frankly, will not only allow us to harvest more value from the products that we're recycling from our customers, but it will also allow us to kind of expand, improve or accelerate our expansion into the OEM channels that we mentioned before. So I think you put that all together is that we feel very good about the targets that we laid out at our Investor Day. Barry Hytinen : And John, it's Barry. Thanks for the question on revenue management in the quarter within our global RIM business. I would tell you if you look at the storage rental revenue growth there on an organic constant currency basis was 8%, so it was quite strong. And volume was modestly positive as you would see in our disclosures. So the vast majority of that was revenue management, although as we've talked about the last few quarters, we are seeing some positive mix in terms of driving top line revenue growth as well. So majority of its revenue management, a little - some mix and some improving volume trends. And going forward, as I mentioned in one of the earlier comments, we will see relatively speaking, incremental revenue management actions driving the business fourth quarter versus third. Operator : The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I really want to focus just a little bit more on the ALM business trajectory. Just - what are you seeing in terms of like volumes coming in? I understand that the pricing is still low, but recovering. But just absolute volumes, how is that doing? And then also just understanding the Regency acquisition, like you said that it's $100 million of TTM revenue, but obviously, it was in a downward slope similar to what you guys were seeing. Is there a run rate that you can provide to us that we can think about that in terms of how to model that thing? And then maybe just keep focusing on a little bit more, what they add to Iron Mountain? What do you mean in terms of the downstream processing? What exactly is it that they do that you do not do? William Meaney : Okay. So, Shlomo, let me talk a little bit about the - what we see on the volume trends, and then I'll let Barry put it together in terms of how you should think about modeling that going forward in terms of the business. I'll also come and pick up your point about what exactly Regency ads. So in terms of the volume trends, if you look at the enterprise side of our business, is there, the synergies, and as Barry said in his remarks, almost 100% cross-selling in terms of our ALM business. Is there you see almost triple-digit year-on-year increases in terms of volume that we're getting from our enterprise customers. So in the enterprise segment, we're seeing a really, really good volume. If you look at the hyperscale, which is the part of the business, that we acquired through IT renewal is the one that's most been impacted by what we see on the pricing of the components, which, as we said, is now just starting to move back north in the right direction. Is there, we actually see year-on - if you put year-to-date volume trends of incoming equipment, is we actually see double-digit - strong double-digit growth year-on-year, year-to-date incoming volume. And so the thing that's been muting that incoming volume, quite frankly, has been the pricing, but the good news is the pricing has started to improve. And Barry can help you think through how do you think about putting those two together as we project going forward. The last thing coming to Regency. So I'm glad you picked up on that because I probably should be more explicit on that. So Regency, first of all, they are adding a couple of customers into the portfolio that, quite frankly, we didn't have both in government sector and retail, which I think is really interesting in terms - because a lot of the equipment gets recycled by people dropping off at their retailers. So I think that's a really good capability there. But more importantly, is they actually are able to recycle a lot of what I would call the things that can't be reused directly into IT equipment. So things like we mentioned the plastics for pharmaceutical retailer. They do a lot more of that than we have historically. And the other thing, the other aspect is over the last couple of calls, we mentioned how we had signed up OEM relationships where these are laptop tablet manufacturers that are looking for people when their equipment comes off lease and needs to be recycled is they come to us and other people to actually resell - to refurbish and resell those products. And Regency has much more capability than we do in that area. They built up not only more expertise in refurbishing tablets and laptops than we have, but they also have a very nice e-commerce platform and where they can actually resell those. So they will really accelerate those - accelerate the sales for those channels that we mentioned on the last couple of calls, signing up the OEM manufacturers. So I think their capability will be a nice complementary fit to the contracts that we had already signed. Barry Hytinen : So Shlomo, it's Barry. I appreciate the question. Specifically, on how to model Regency, just as a reminder, we are expecting it to close kind of around year-end or early next year for when you want to add it to your model. We noted that it's in excess of $100 million of revenue, Shlomo, and I expect them to exit the year at that level in excess of $100 million, and we see the opportunity for it to be growing into the new year. But of course, we'll give guidance for next year on our next call. But we feel very good about the stability of the business that it's been generating revenue and EBITDA at the levels it's been for some time. And as Bill alluded to, it did not see the sort of trough that our ALM business did on the hyperscale side. It's much more of an enterprise IT asset disposition sort of player. And in that enterprise and government services that it does its - didn't see the level of trough that we did, and it's come back nicely. And so we feel very good about the stability of the business at this point and feel like we're getting a very good, very synergistic deal as Bill mentioned, they have a fair bit of incremental capacity. And so we can get synergy off of bringing Iron Mountain Enterprise clients to Regency for service going forward. I would say - I'll just note that you can work through the math on this that it's sort of in the low mid-20s of an EBITDA margin business. We think that, that has opportunity to expand as relative pricing in the broader market expands and through incremental capacity utilization of the footprint of what they have there. We've been very impressed with the team at Regency for a long time. They've built a very good business with critically important relationships to clients. And we've got a very strong focus on sustainability. So we feel very good about Regency. And as I zoom out to broader ALM, Shlomo, I would say, just to reiterate a point Bill made, the volume is clearly kind of doing well. We are seeing incremental bookings, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, particularly on the enterprise side, on teams having good wins on the hyperscale side as well. And our OEM relationships continue to extend. That's an area that was a focus - has been a focus for us this year. We signed some very important relationships in that area of the market. Of course, it has - the nature of those relationships is that they take a little longer to get to revenue generating, but we are well on our way in the OEM vertical as well. So I appreciate the comment, Shlomo. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So Barry, I just wanted to touch on the balance sheet, obviously, a big move in interest rates recently. So I just wanted to touch on your deployment of CapEx and the sources and uses of capital. It does look like data center CapEx, as you've mentioned before, maybe you could touch on the trajectory there, that's probably going to continue to lift higher based on the leasing you've done year-to-date. And then maybe you could talk about your kind of achieve development yields on data center deals. It looks like those continue to move higher and how comfortable you are in terms of the excess returns you're getting over your current cost of capital for what's in your data center pipeline? Thank you. William Meaney : So Eric, I'll take the - I'll talk about the yields that we're getting it. And then Barry can talk about the balance sheet impact and how we're thinking about financing it going forward. So I think on the yields, as you probably - were kind of foreshadowing in the nature of your question. We have seen yields moved up and in Barry's prepared remarks and I think also in mind. I talked about the price improvement or the strength of pricing around data center as demand continues to ramp. So historically, if you think about the journey that you've watched us on, Eric, is a few years ago, we would have said, hyperscale or kind of 7 to 8. I think on the most recent calls, we said hyperscale. These are cash-on-cash returns have been 8 to 9. And now you can expect that they are 9 plus. So we're - and these are all pre-leverage, cash-on-cash returns. So the returns are even with the ramp in the cost to build - well, the cost of build is obviously built in, but in terms of the cost of financing is well ahead after you put the data center together and lease it up is well ahead of our cost of capital. So we feel really good about the returns we're getting even in the higher interest rate environment. Barry Hytinen : Hey, Eric, it's Barry. A couple of things there. We would expect CapEx for the whole company to be probably right around $1.3 billion for the year. That's up some from our prior view because, as you point out, the team continues to do very, very well on data center, and we have a lot of construction to do to service the contracts that the team has signed. It's an interesting point about our business within data center, and we're operating now 225 megawatts, which is nearly all leased. And then we're under construction on another 260 megawatts, of which again, like 90% plus, 93% of it is pre-leased. So we are really constructing to contract as opposed to spec. And so it is a situation where you will see us continue to be gradually rising the data center CapEx as we work to build into the contracts that we've signed. And I think it's - read it to the team and the customer wins that we've been having that we've been able to extend our lease expirations to eight plus years on the backs of higher pricing and those returns improving. So it's - we are feeling very good about where we're positioned with data center and the growth thereof, Eric. You're going to see a lot of growth going forward as we build into those leases. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig in on the opportunity in Miami to convert storage facility to a data center. One, are you fully scrapping the existing facility and just using the land? Or are you actually using the existing infrastructure? And what do you see as the other opportunities throughout your portfolio to convert other facilities for data center purposes? William Meaney : Good morning, Brendan. Thanks for the question. So the - yes, so in Miami, you probably can imagine, yes, we are actually scrapping the building. So we're reusing the land in that particular case because it's the way that we could get the most data center capacity into that facility, otherwise we would have been leaving much opportunity on the table. So it's a better use or a better way of actually tapping into that market. But it still gives us kind of - if you look at an all-in basis, probably a 15% reduction in cost to build. And obviously, the speed at which we can enter the market is much faster because trying to find the right location of land in Miami and secure the power can be challenging. So we think both in terms of speed and then 15% cost improvement, which is significant, is really important. And if you look more broadly of the 90 million square feet of industrial real estate that we have around the globe that's associated with our records management business is - think about that's probably in the order of 15% to 20% of the properties are under evaluation on any given day as we look at it. So we're constantly screening about 15% to 20% of our locations and looking at what customers' requirements are and in some cases, having discussions with customers and thinking about which of those sites might be next. And these are generally fit in very nicely for what I call these kind of edge deployments or secondary cities like Miami, right? So this won't be the last one that we - the first and the last. This will be the first of many, we feel as we continue to go forward. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2023 earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thanks, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor Language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian. And thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report another outstanding year for Iron Mountain. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our record results are a testament to the devotion and hard work of our team and our resilient and growing business model. In the fourth quarter we achieved revenue of 1.4 -- $1.42 billion, yielding 8.7% total organic revenue growth and record adjusted EBITDA of $525 million up 11%. For the full year we delivered record results across the board, revenue of $5.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion, and AFFO of $1.2 billion. I'll now discuss some ways in which we have been working with our customers, which has led to this growth. Let's begin with our records management business. A win of note was with one of the largest health systems in the US awarding Iron Mountain a contract to significantly enhance its management of records across 140 hospitals and 2,600 care sites. Building on a strong long-term relationship with the customer, we are now implementing a rigorous compliance program that will reduce the cost and meet records retention requirements leading to a more efficient service. This win is particularly representative of our focus on cross-selling through Matterhorn as this customer is utilizing a variety of our products and services across our business lines, including digital services along with traditional records management and shredding. Another win showing Iron Mountain's cross-selling power occurred with a Hungarian industrial gas supplier. We are helping this customer to create space at its facilities by storing and then digitizing its records. We are also exploring opportunities to deploy our digital mailroom solution as our partnerships develop, thereby expanding this relationship across our product suite. The last win to highlight in our records management business is a new contract with the Swiss Division of a British multinational asset management company to relocate its physical records to one site and digitize them over time. In addition to freeing up physical space, our solution will ensure our customers' records are stored safely and compliantly, and enables more efficient access to the digitized information. Moving now to some wins in our digital solutions business, we won a contract from a large aerospace customer to deploy our InSight platform to manage and translate invoices from 22 languages into English. The customer chose our solution ahead of competing proposals, thanks to InSight's embedded AI engine, which gives it the ability to not only store, but to automatically classify a range of documents in a highly secure manner. Another win this quarter was with a Canadian government agency. This agency, which manages workplace compensation claims has been a customer of our records management services for more than 15 years. Our successful delivery of digital mailroom and imaging on demand solutions during the COVID pandemic has led to a new Master Services Agreement for digitizing services worth more than $10 million over the contract length. We will preserve, scan around 47,000 rolls of microfilm to produce 240 million images on our InSight platform, helping the agency to process compensation claims faster than ever and delivering a solid recurring revenue stream to drive our growth. In Brazil, a major television network that has been a records management customer for almost 25 years has asked us to manage the indexing and digitization of 50,000 boxes of records stored at its locations in Iron Mountain's facilities in the country. Our InSight platform is at the heart of our solution, enabling the customer to manage requests to digitize from all parts of the business in one place effectively and efficiently. Finally, the Hong Kong division of a major multinational bank has chosen Iron Mountain to be its partner in a major transformation of its finance operations. This customer manages a large volume of finance documents and has outsourced this work to Iron Mountain with a goal of streamlining the process of checking and scanning these files. We see the potential to scale the solution for the bank in other locations including Singapore, India, the US, United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates. Now let's turn to our data center business. We continue to be pleased with the growth trajectory of our data center business, which has only accelerated with the rapid adoption of AI-enabled services. We are pleased to have signed 124 megawatts well ahead of our initial plan for the year. We continue to see tremendous opportunity in serving both hyperscale and co-location customers and significant growth potential for our footprint. An example in the quarter, we signed a seven-year agreement to provide capacity at our New Jersey data center for an automated trading technology company that is expanding in the US. Our reputation for compliance and sustainability were key to winning this business and it was important for our customer to receive 100% traceable and verifiable energy and carbon records in support of its sustainability goals. Also in the U.S., we were pleased to win a data center deal with a secure cloud storage company that is growing rapidly across North America. Our reliability and close relationships since first doing business with this customer a year ago helped to seal this new deal as did the strategic location of our facility in Northern Virginia. Moving to India, we continue to see strong demand for capacity. We closed a data center contract with a major bank in the country in the fourth quarter. This customer chose our Mumbai facility specifically and Iron Mountain more broadly for our ability to provide a secure data center for its large domestic branch platform close to its headquarters. Turning to our Asset Lifecycle Management business, or ALM, we secured a significant contract with a global financial services company. Our ability to integrate our secure ALM services with the customer\u2019s existing business management platform was critical and has enabled them to streamline how they order, complete and report on their IT asset disposition activities. Our solution was an excellent demonstration of how deeply we understand the needs of our customers, especially in the highly regulated world of financial services. Staying with ALM business, in the quarter we won a contract with a U.S. vehicle insurance company that has been an existing customer of ours for many years. Having shifted its employees to a remote working model, our customer needed to partner with the capacity to retrieve over 37,000 devices from more than 240 locations nationwide, then process, refurbish, and return them for distribution. Our solution provides our customer with better visibility of its IT assets and enables them to manage this activity more efficiently. I should also highlight the synergy between our ALM and data center business when it comes to data center renewal and decommissioning. We are now in a position to not only provide co-location and cloud migration services, but we can also securely and responsibly dispose of obsolete IT equipment. An example of such an opportunity in this quarter was a major win with one of the world's leading producers of business process management software. We managed the secure decommissioning of over 40 data centers globally, sanitized the IT assets and remarketed them to deliver a significant return in value. Also in the quarter, we were awarded a contract by one of the oldest financial institutions in the US for a similar data center decommissioning project. Both wins demonstrate that Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to minimize risk and maximize savings as a single source partner for these activities. Finally, let me take a moment to highlight our acquisition of Regency Technologies. Regency's team makes a great addition to the leadership of our rapidly growing ALM business and gives us additional capabilities to serve this fast growing sector at the heart of the circular economy. Furthermore, this acquisition together with the momentum we have been building in ALM through the strengthening of component pricing and cross selling sets us up well for continued success. To conclude, I would like to thank our team for their resilience, hard work and dedication as we continue our Matterhorn clime and continue to serve over 225,000 customers. We are thrilled to progress ahead of expectations and it is due to the commitment of our Mountaineers. As we look to 2024 and beyond, the momentum we have built will continue to drive the opportunities ahead with another year of double digit top line growth expected. Barry will speak in detail about our financial guidance for the year ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. Turning to our financials, in the fourth quarter our team continued the trend of delivering record performance on all of our key financial metrics. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.42 billion grew 11% year-on-year or 10% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a new quarterly record. On an organic basis, total organic revenue grew 8.7%. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 10.4% as a result of strong performance in both our records management and our data center businesses. Total service revenue increased 8% to $549 million. This was driven by Global RIM at 10% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic basis. Project Matterhorn's focus on selling our entire range of products and services has driven these strong results and are a testament to our commercial team's efforts. Adjusted EBITDA was $525 million, a new record, up 11% on a reported basis and 10% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected at 37% and improved 100 basis points sequentially, driven by strong mix and cost productivity across all of our businesses. As we've stated in our earnings press release, effective in the fourth quarter of 2023, our AFFO definition has been updated to exclude amortization of capitalized commissions. In light of the growth of our data center business, we conducted a benchmarking analysis of other companies in the industry and as such, have aligned our AFFO reporting accordingly, which provides investors better insight into the funds available to support the growth of our business. AFFO was $328 million or $1.11 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.09 respectively from the fourth quarter of last year. To allow for comparison to our guidance and consensus, we are reporting our prior methodology as well. On our previous calculation, AFFO was $317 million or $1.07 on a per share basis. This was $7 million better than our AFFO guidance and $0.02 better than our guidance on a per share basis. Now, let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $5.5 billion increased 7% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% year-on-year to $1.96 billion, an increase of $135 million. AFFO increased over 5% to $1.2 billion or $4.12 on a per share basis. On our previous calculation, AFFO was $1.168 billion or $3.97 on a per share basis. And now turning to segment performance for the quarter. Our global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.19 billion, an increase of $108 million from last year or 10% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 8.5%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $534 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.7%, up 100 basis points sequentially, driven by strong services mix and productivity. Our data center business continues to grow and deliver strong performance. From a total revenue perspective, we delivered 32% year-on-year growth on a reported basis and 30% year-on-year growth on a constant currency basis. Our data center storage revenue grew 34% year-on-year or 32% on a constant currency basis, driven by new development coming online. Data center EBITDA was up approximately $10 million year-on-year and EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points sequentially. Moreover, pricing trends have continued to be strong and we have seen returns expanding 100 basis points to 150 basis points in advance of higher interest rates. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we completed 4 megawatts in the Q4. For the full year, we leased 124 megawatts, exceeding the projection we provided on our last call. Nearly 100% of those leases resulted from cross selling, which you know is a key initiative in our Project Matterhorn plan. Our pipeline is at record levels. We are expanding our relationships with key hyperscale clients and our team is executing well. So we are pleased to project new and expansion leasing of 100 megawatts for 2024. Incidentally, that represents a 25% increase from our initial 2023 projection at this time last year. Turning to our Asset Lifecycle Management business. In the fourth quarter, we delivered improved performance for both revenue and EBITDA, achieving the expectations we set on our last call. Our team drove strong operating productivity and we saw component pricing beginning to trend up modestly on a sequential basis. Similar to data center, cross selling activity has been particularly strong in our ALM business with nearly all deals coming in as a result of it. We completed our acquisition of Regency Technologies early in January. This acquisition strengthens our ability to serve an expanding ALM customer base and broadens our capability in the category, especially in the enterprise segment. Regency brings robust remarketing and recycling capabilities to better serve our customers and help them achieve their environmental and data security goals. We have long admired the leadership at Regency and are thrilled to welcome their entire organization to our team. Turning to capital, for the full year 2023, we invested $1.2 billion of growth $140 million of recurring, consistent with the expectation we shared on our last call. For 2024, we are planning for capital expenditure to be approximately $1.35 billion of growth and approaching $150 billion of recurring. Given our strong pre lease activity, the vast majority of our growth capital will be dedicated to data center development. Turning to the balance sheet, with strong adjusted EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times and our leverage remains at its lowest level in a decade. For 2024, we expect to exit the year at similar levels to year end 2023. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share to be paid in early April. And on a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 62%, in line with our long term target range of low to mid-60s percent. Now, let me provide an update on our progress as to the Project Matterhorn growth objectives we shared at our Investor Day in September of 2022. You will recall that we introduced [tighter] (ph) targets for growth between the period of 2021 through 2026 of approximately 10% for revenue, approximately 10% for adjusted EBITDA and approximately 8% for AFFO. Two years into our Matterhorn journey, we are well on track, even ahead of those commitments, having achieved 13% annual revenue growth from 2021 to the end of 2023 on a constant currency basis. We have achieved 11% annual adjusted EBITDA growth and in excess of 10% annual AFFO growth. The dollar has been particularly strong over this period and despite this, we have been delivering on our commitments on a reported basis as well. Now let me share our projections for the full year 2024. We expect total revenue to be within the range of $6 billion to $6.15 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 11% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $2.175 billion to $2.225 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.3 billion to $1.335 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 9% at the midpoint. And we expect AFFO per share for the full year to be $4.39 to $4.51 and this represents year-on-year growth of 8% at the midpoint. In terms of foreign exchange, we are using a forecast based on those of several major financial institutions. Compared to 2023, this results in a full year FX headwind of $25 million to revenue and approximately $10 billion to EBITDA and AFFO. Turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.45 billion, adjusted EBITDA in excess of $510 billion and AFFO of approximately $310 billion and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered a strong year in 2023. I am confident that we will build on our momentum and continue to drive strong growth in 2024. We are well on track to achieve our Project Matterhorn goals. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to our entire team for delivering a successful year and their continued dedication to serving our clients. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for Q&A? Operator : Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the ALM business, you mentioned component prices trended up quarter-over-quarter. Can you elaborate on how ALM volumes and component prices performed on a year-over-year basis in the quarter? And what assumptions for component prices you're factoring into your 2024 guidance? William Meaney : Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. So let me kind of answer the kind of the higher level on the strategic where we see the trends going and then Barry can go to the next level and give you a little bit more specifics in terms of the numbers. But on the -- to your macro point in terms of the trends on the component prices, it's very much in line what you see in terms of the analyst reports right now and you can see that coming through in the Q4 and building into Q1. So we expect the component prices to continue to strengthen during the course of the year. And you can see that broadly in the semiconductor and memory business for the original manufacturers as well. So we're very much benefiting from the same trends you're seeing in the industry for the OEMs, as well as for the reused or the recycled market. In terms of volume, actually throughout the year as we've been reporting on the last few quarters is we continue to see increase in volume, although when that turned into revenue, it was muted because of the low component prices that we started off the year and kind of worked through the rest of the year. But the trends that we saw in Q4 -- that showed up in Q4 continue -- we continue to see building in Q1 and we're very much tracking what you're seeing in the broader OEM market for memory, disks and CPUs, GPUs. Barry? Barry Hytinen : Yes. Hey, George. Good morning. Thank you for that question. I'll give you a little bit more detail on how we're thinking about ALM in total. So in 2023, in light of those trends that Bill was mentioning, we delivered $177 million revenue from ALM. Now for our guidance at the midpoint, we're assuming about $355 million of total revenue for ALM. I'll note that Regency brings in $115 million right there. So it's sort of $240 million against the $177 million. I think if you look at what we did in the fourth quarter, what you'll find is just at the fourth quarter run rate, we'd be in excess of $200 million, $205 million, $206 million and that's assuming no improvement from all the enterprise bookings we've been doing over the last half as Bill was referring to, as well as and what will likely be a continued improving environment on component pricing. So whereas last year, we were faced with really significant challenges of component pricing continuing to decline earlier in the year and then staying at those trough levels, we have assumed a modest amount of pricing benefit on component pricing as we move through the year. Really, we didn't assume much of any change from the fourth quarter to the first quarter that may prove conservative. And then we assumed a fairly slow ramp, slower than what all the industry prognostications are for component pricing. So when I look at the incremental increase we have in the guidance for our organic ALM business, George, it's about $35 million, which -- we'll see how the year goes, but I feel very good about where we're positioned. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about the pricing environment and how that contributed to revenue growth in the quarter and how much you're expecting that to be a contribution to guidance in 2024? We're seeing kind of an uptake in some of the RIM organic revenue growth and I was wondering how much of that might be directly pricing versus anything else? Barry Hytinen : Hi, Shlomo, this is Barry. Thank you for that question. So what you would see in our results and as you're pointing to and thank you for that is that, our global RIM storage rental revenue was up 8% -- over 8% in the quarter on an organic basis and for the full year it was about 8.5%. So we have very strong storage rental revenue growth in 2023 and that's with positive volume trends and good mix and revenue management. And the way we think about revenue management of course as we talked about before is about value. Our ability to provide our customers with value added services, such as our ability to provide digitization on demand rapidly whenever they need it, Smart Sort and a host of other value added services. So -- and then incidentally, our service revenue also stepped up nicely in the Q4 on Global RIM as well. And so, our expectation for the new year embedded in the guidance, Shlomo, is about -- round numbers, call it 6-ish percent growth for Global RIM at the midpoint, which in light of the revenue management actions we have as a anniversary from last year as well as additional revenue management actions this year, very good trajectory we think on services, inclusive of digital services continue to ramp through the year. We feel very good about that projection and I think it does imply an opportunity for us to certainly achieve the midpoint on the Global RIM number at 6%. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hey, good morning. Maybe one related to that previous question is, I know you don't give a formal guide, but what are you expecting in terms of overall RIM volumes for Q1 and the remainder of this year? And then if I could just ask one on data center pricing and leasing. How much of that 100 megawatt guide is kind of already in the pipeline? And I think cash mark to market was 5% for 2023. How do you see that playing out this year? Thank you. William Meaney : So Nate, I'll take the pipeline question on the data center and then Barry -- I'll let Barry take your question on the pricing. So on the pipeline as you would expect, especially with the hyperscale, you know the market extremely well is that, we have a very strong pipeline going into the year. So yes, when we set our targets, yes, I mean, you can assume that we have a pretty big pipeline that stands behind that. And if you look at the way we set our targets, it's very consistent with what we laid out on Investor Day. It's where -- you think about couple of years ago, we were in the 60s. So you see that our targets are continuing to show that we are growing the business north of 20% a year. And obviously some of these big contracts can either put you well ahead or at the targets that we set. But we're very comfortable that we're continuing to build momentum in the business and we're maintaining these 20% plus growth rates on a very quickly or very rapidly growing base. So I think you can assume that like anything else is that, we have a pretty good pipeline. In fact, across most of our businesses, we maintain a pretty strong pipeline behind our targets. Barry Hytinen : Nate, thanks for the question. It's Barry. A couple of responses on the physical volume, much as we have forecasted the last few years, we're planning this year the same way, which is for our physical volume to be slightly up for the year and also for the Q1 [indiscernible] about that. And so, the vast majority of the growth that I mentioned for Global RIM will be driven off of services as well as revenue management of course. As it relates to your question about mark to market on data center, clearly trends have been good with respect to mark to market over the last really five, six quarters. And from what we're seeing, we continue to expect that to be trending upward, and we have high visibility on that. And frankly, in the co-lo space, it's trending up even higher. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe on Matterhorn, you highlighted some recent wins there, but I'd imagine it's a very long sales cycle for a lot of the engagements that you have. Maybe you could talk a little bit about where you see yourselves in the overall process with individual customers and, how much additional benefit you expect to see stemming from the Matterhorn initiatives over the next four to five years? William Meaney : Thanks, Brendon. You're right. I mean they're typically longer than our traditional sales cycles. If you think about the services that we were selling five, six years ago when our service revenue was down in the 40s, right, and so obviously 10 times that today just on digital and when I'm talking about digital services now that portion of the service business. Now it's more than 10 times that size. It is definitely because it's much more of a solution orientation. That being said, so we maintain much bigger pipelines to back up that growth. But as you can see, we're continuing to grow that business in double digit territory. So the -- but the -- on the other side, the flip side is more and more of these services are recurring or multiyear projects. So has that built even though the sales cycle is longer, is the -- also the revenue that comes in is around longer, if you will. So it's -- if we look at it right now, it's approaching 30%, 40% of the revenue that were coming in is truly recurring and/or very long multiyear projects. So at one level, yes, it's a longer sales cycle. Another level, it allows us to continue to build momentum and drive growth in that business because each year we're replacing less than we were before. Barry Hytinen : The only thing I'd add, Brendan, it's Barry, is that, our cross selling opportunity is very large at this business, right? We have well over 200,000 clients, most of them are measured in decades of duration and we are seeing our cross selling efforts continue to expand. We increased significantly year-on-year, but there's a lot more opportunity. And when I think about the services that Bill just mentioned as well as things like Asset Lifecycle Management, really those are services that we can be offering and nearly all of our customers need. And so we think it -- Matterhorn, we are -- as you heard me say, we reiterated our targets today and we're in fact running ahead. So we feel very good about where we're at. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, it looks like the total volumes increased in time to the storage, but the retention slipped a little bit. What drove that kind of acceleration there, because it looks like a nice outcome? William Meaney : Yes. So Kevin, I would say, if you look at our retention rates over the last 15 or so years, you would see, because that data is available, that it's very much in line and it can wobble few basis points here or there quarter-to-quarter. But we are very pleased with our retention and our customer satisfaction scores. And thank you for the point, volume has been quite good and that speaks to our commercial team's ability to continue to win new business. And, frankly, if you look at the storage revenue growth that the team is putting up, it's I think quite impressive, including the acceleration. So thank you for the question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to touch on data centers and capital allocation. So, you talked about pricing continuing to ramp in the data center ecosystem and we've seen demand outstripping supply. So maybe you could touch on where your targeted development yields are for the $1.3 billion of CapEx, the majority of which is data centers. And if you [indiscernible] opportunities to accelerate that 100 megawatts of leasing even further, maybe touch on some other funding sources like joint ventures, that could maybe give you additional capital to attack the hyperscale opportunity? Thank you. William Meaney : Thanks Eric for the question. So in terms of the returns that we're getting and Barry touched upon in his script is, you should think about interest rates or the cost of capital have moved up, but our pricing has moved up about 100 basis points, 150 basis points ahead of that. So we're actually getting higher returns, even in a higher interest rate environment than we were before. So the pricing has moved up quite nicely, even more if you look at the non-hyperscale portion, but I'm talking more about the hyperscale customers in and of themselves. And that's partly driven by the traction we're getting in the market. And then the other part of it is the scarcity. I mean, especially with the growth in AI, as you know, AI actually absorbs a lot of power and that's what we're selling effectively is capacity or access to power. So I think we're really happy with the way that the pricing is evolving in the business. In terms of your other question, in other words, yes, and it kind of goes to the pipeline. Yes, we feel very comfortable about the target for this year, which is more than 20% ahead, close to 25% ahead than what we targeted last year. So the continued momentum and growth in the business and the -- could we do more than that? Yes. We have a fully funded plan, so we don't see any shortage of capital. And remember, the one of the advantages that we have, not just because of the cross selling of Matterhorn that having the full information services suite. But the other part of it is that, our records management business is a 70% plus gross margin business that generates a lot of cash and that gives us deeper pockets than some of the pure play data center places -- players in terms of being able to both deliver our dividend and -- growth and dividend to our shareholders as well as putting capital to work in data center as I said. And it just so happens that 225,000 plus customer base is a cross selling opportunity for us. Barry Hytinen : Eric, the only thing I guess I would add there is that, just building on Bill's point there is, in terms of the growth in the EBITDA that we're generating, and so over $230 million at the midpoint nearly $240 million with our leverage target range, we have a lot of capacity and that together with the cash flow of the business puts us in a position where we can issue the strong guidance that we did, invest heavily in our data center development and, of course, that's the nature of having prelease so much of our business. If you look at the amount of construction we have underway versus the prelease, it's very high, think high 95% or so. And so we'll continue to ramp our development in data center to keep up with the contracts that we've signed and all the while maintaining our leverage year-on-year at the same level. So we feel very good about where we're at. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. I'm just interested in Regency, any kind of early learnings now that you're a little bit into having acquired it, thoughts about how to achieve top line synergies and other growth paths that you could see in that segment more generally? William Meaney : Thanks Jon for the question. As I said in my script and also Barry is that, we're really excited about the Regency acquisition, not just because of the footprint that it gives us, it gives us stronger even scale within the United States, but also the leadership team. So very strong leaders that we're really happy to kind of continue to build out the organizational structure under Mark Kidd. So we're -- so first of all, the leaders that we got with that business, we're very excited about. The second thing is they have a lot of customers that both overlap, but they also have a lot of customers that don't. So for instance, they have a very good both federal and local government portfolio businesses and that's a business that we're already in deep collaboration in terms of how we can expand that using Iron Mountain's muscle with our 26,000 Mountaineers around the globe on how they can actually tap into that. And then they also have some expertise, especially around the end user devices, which already we're doing a lot in end user devices that highlighted some of the wins on my -- in my opening remarks. But the -- they have even further capabilities, which I think is going to give us a lot more to do on the back end in terms of the way we serve customers and the efficiency that we could process their equipment. Barry Hytinen : Yes. Jon, the only thing I guess I would add is that, when we knew this as part of the deal, but just to underscore it, there's considerable capacity for processing at Regency. And as Bill mentioned, they add to our capabilities, they have got eight facilities around the U.S, which really broadens our reach and ability to serve clients quickly. And this is a team there that has been building a business very profitably, I might add, for decades. And so they -- to underscore Bill's point, they really know what they're doing, and I think the combination is an excellent one. So thanks for that question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. If you don't mind, I'm going to get a little more into the weeds. Barry, just on -- we saw some interesting gross margin changes like just on a sequential basis. We saw the services margin go up from 260 basis points. It seems like the costs were contained while the revenue increased. But on the storage side, you have all other storage costs going up by $11.5 million, pushed the gross margin down by about 80 basis points sequentially. I know these things move around quarter-to-quarter, but maybe you can give us a little bit of insight as to what's in that all other storage costs that moved up $11.5 million this quarter. Barry Hytinen : Yes, sure thing, Shlomo. I'll take the services point first. As I alluded to in the prepared remarks, we had very good mix within our services. And as you know, when we're doing services especially as we're continuing to see larger and larger deals, the mix of those can move around and the timing of them. And so we had anticipated a little lower margin mix in the services portfolio. Some of those deals pushed into the first quarter here in terms of when we win them and into the New Year. But we then won some deals and we're able to provide service on some higher margins. So that's part of it. And together with the fact that candidly our team here does a great job driving productivity across our services organization. As it relates to the storage gross margin, I'm glad you asked that question, because there's an item that I want to make sure we all understand. That storage gross margin, of course, is the combination of all of our storage businesses. So when you think about the Records Management Physical Storage Business, that's a very high gross margin business and continued to perform very well. We're very pleased with the margins in that business in light of revenue management, et cetera and the volume trends over the last several years. It's been trending really well. The factor that can affect the actual rate though and also affects your all other storage costs, which I'll come to, is data center. As you know, as you'd see from our peer companies that are public as well as some of the other companies in the data center space, the gross margins on data center generally as an industry are lower than our records management business. And so while our data center gross margin actually expanded both sequentially and year-on-year, the mix in fact because data center grew, I think the storage revenue was up 35% or so year-on-year in the quarter that has a mix element. And so, you can have a situation where our gross margins are improving on both businesses, yet the contribution creates the rate going down slightly. As it relates to all other storage costs, that's -- one of the big drivers there, of course, is and it goes to data center is the power. And so, as we're having more and more client commencements, they start drawing more power in there that also has an effect on gross margin, but doesn't change our EBITDA dollars. So good questions and I hope that clears that up. We feel very, very good about the gross margins in the company. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. A quick follow-up. It looks like your dividend payout ratio has dipped below the 65% LTM target, which is where you raised the dividend earlier. Can you talk about your thoughts on raising the dividend again now that the payout ratio is below the threshold? William Meaney : Yes. No, thanks George. And you're right. We're maintaining as a Board and as a company that our target payout ratio is kind of in the low 60s, 60% to 65% and we are kind of trending [indiscernible] we are in that range now. So this is, obviously, a decision for the Board, but I think you could expect the way we're trending in the guidance we've given you for the year, it's a natural forcing function that the board will be considering and. I think it's -- as you can just kind of see the mathematics of it, it looks like we're running into another increase in the near future and not too distant future, I should say. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A.  Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. We are pleased to report that our team has delivered outstanding results for the first quarter of 2024, achieving another set of all-time highs for revenue and profitability. Our continued progress is evidence of the success of Project Matterhorn and our team's commitment to delivering best-in-class solutions.  On a reported basis, in the first quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.48 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth and a new first quarter adjusted EBITDA record of $519 million, delivering 13% year-over-year growth. Project Matterhorn has successfully transformed Iron Mountain into a solutions-based business with a commercial organization that offers a broad range of products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers. This integrated product portfolio drives strong growth across all business areas through our integrated solutions, combining storage with truly differentiated services. Now I'd like to take you through some pivotal wins this quarter. Let's begin with records and information management.  The strength and longevity of the relationships we have built with our 240,000 customers is leading to further opportunities to offer more solutions from our portfolio to meet our customers' needs. An excellent example of this cross-selling is in the oil and energy sector where a U.S.-headquartered customer with a presence in 75 countries initially selected Iron Mountain to securely manage its data containing geological information. Thanks to our expanded range of solutions and a deep understanding of the customers' needs, we are now also providing a secure IT asset disposition solution.  Another example of our strength and ability to cross-sell and provide more solutions for our customers is in the United Arab Emirates. For the past 2 years, we have been partnering with a prominent bank to provide records management services for a growing volume of documents. With this customer's need to comply with regulations from the UAE Central Bank, we secured an agreement to extend our solutions. These now include document capture and asset life cycle management or ALM services. We continue to see opportunities to support government and public sector organizations with their transformations, helping them to increase efficiency and demonstrate value for money for the sources they provide to their citizens. A recent example of this is in the U.K., where we have a long-term relationship with a government agency that trust us to store approximately 18 million records. This customer awarded Iron Mountain a contract to manage documents that must be retained whilst legal proceedings are ongoing.  Our proven ability to manage records effectively to this customer and a number of other government organizations in the U.K. demonstrates we have the skills, capabilities and experience to successfully manage sensitive projects like this. Turning to our digital business, a global customer that provides automation solutions has asked us to digitize its physical records in Morocco. Our InSight platform, which as you will recall, fully integrates both artificial intelligence and machine learning will enable this customer to simplify their current use of multiple information systems and content formats.  InSight will enable them to derive greater value from their information whilst improving their compliance and driving greater operational efficiencies. The customer's confidence in our solution is a testament to our team's clear understanding of our customers' needs as well as our proven track record of success as a digital transformation partner.  Staying with digital solutions, an Australian government agency asked Iron Mountain to digitize approximately 250,000 land registry files dating back to the 1850s for government-owned real estate in the state of Victoria. Our solution will ensure that these vital historical records are preserved both physically and digitally, enabling efficient access for land managers, potential developers and government departments.  Our infrastructure, reputation and expertise, including our ability to meet a requirement to manage the entire project within the state of Victoria were key differentiators that enabled us to secure this deal.  Moving next to our data center business. We continue to be pleased by the strength and rapid growth of this business and how we can support more customers with the capacity we are creating at our facilities around the world. Today, I want to highlight 3 examples of leases we signed this quarter. First, we have signed a 24-megawatt 12-year contract with a global technology company for data center space at our Manassas, Virginia campus. This is an existing North American records customer that required space in Virginia to support their high-performance computing needs and to expand their footprint. Also this quarter, we leased 4 megawatts with an existing global cloud storage customer. The customer relate to us that our excellent customer service was a key determinant in their decision to expand their footprint with us.  Additionally, in our data center business, we are pleased to welcome a global IT consulting firm as a new customer. They chose us in order to be in close proximity to their clients as well as to meet their demanding connectivity requirements.  Turning to asset life cycle management. We are pleased to share that this quarter, we closed the acquisition of Regency Technologies. The Regency leadership team have already made strong contributions to our ALM efforts, both commercially and operationally and have integrated well into our company. Moreover, Regency adds 8 complementary locations to our U.S. network.  Moving to ALM more broadly. We are pleased with strong organic growth in the business, driven by a combination of increased volume and component price recovery leading to a strong quarter. As we continue to build our ALM capabilities, I wish to share several examples of how ALM enables us to offer more solutions to new and existing customers.  A well-known food service brand has signed an agreement with Iron Mountain in the Netherlands to recycle their decommissioned IT assets. Data security was paramount in their decision to partner with Iron Mountain as well as our ability to be at any of their in-country locations within 48 hours. Also in this quarter, an existing Iron Mountain global financial institution customer signed a program deal to manage their secure ITAD, recycling and remarketing requirements, including their remote workplace inventory for over 400 sites nationwide.  The customer wanted a single vendor approach to streamline their asset life cycle management. We worked with them on a unique solution that created process and workflow enhancements, integrated with their existing asset management systems and lowered their overall cost through the remarketing initiatives. The program supports all of their corporate locations with both on and off-site ALM services. Finally, a multinational conglomerate company has signed a deal with us to manage its ALM needs for data center decommissioning as well as their end user devices. Due to the customers' significant growth through acquisition, they had accumulated a significant amount of legacy data center and end-user device equipment that needed to be securely decommissioned. We were pleased to be able to provide a holistic global solution backed by our secure chain of custody in order to meet their needs.  To conclude, I am very proud of the strong results our Mountaineers continue to deliver. Our consistently strong performance, including our ability to achieve our highest quarterly revenue to date is evidence of the increasing heights we are achieving as part of our Matterhorn climb. At the core of this continued strong performance is our customers. All of us at Iron Mountain are humbled by the trust which more than 240,000 organizations around the world including 95% of the Fortune 1000 have in us in our increased portfolio of services. We look forward to continuing our growth journey as we deliver our best-in-class and integrated solutions to our clients and create value for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team continued our track record of strong performance, exceeding the expectations we've provided on our last call.  We achieved record quarterly revenue of $1.48 billion, up 12% on a reported basis, driven by 9% storage growth and 17% service growth. On an organic basis, revenue grew 8%. Revenue was nearly $30 million ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call, driven by stronger performance in both our Global RIM and our asset life cycle management businesses.  Total storage revenue of $885 million, up $75 million year-on-year was driven by solid performance from both Global RIM and data center. Total service revenue of $592 million was up $88 million from last year, reflecting strength in Global RIM and digital as well as strong contribution from our recently closed acquisition of Regency Technologies.  For me, 2 key highlights in the quarter are : first, data center storage revenue exceeded 30% growth year-on-year. And second, our organic service revenue growth accelerated to 10% year-on-year, primarily driven by improved performance in our asset life cycle management business. Adjusted EBITDA was $519 million, an increase of $58 million from last year. This constitutes growth of 13%, both on a reported and constant currency basis year-on-year, driven by strong contributions across all business units. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.1%, consistent year-on-year driven by revenue management and cost productivity, offset by mix. AFFO was $324 million or $1.10 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.09, respectively, from the first quarter of last year. This was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call as a result of the upside in adjusted EBITDA as well as phasing of both recurring capital investments and cash taxes, which is incorporated into our guidance for the second quarter.  Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.21 billion, an increase of $84 million from last year. On a reported and organic basis, revenue grew 7%. Storage rental revenue growth of 6% reflects our focus on revenue management and consistent volume trends. We delivered service revenue growth of 10%, driven by traditional services and digital solutions.  Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $526 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. We achieved revenue of $144 million, an increase of $32 million and 28% year-on-year. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $62 million or 22% growth from the first quarter of 2023.  Turning to new and expansion leasing. We had a successful quarter with the team signing 30 megawatts with strong cross-selling activity. Our data center pipeline is robust across the markets we serve. In Phoenix, where we are fully leased in our first 2 sites, we have now commenced construction on our third site and have a considerable pipeline of opportunities to fill it.  In support of our data center strategy and consistent with our sustainability commitments, we were pleased to execute our first green loan in April. This $300 million financing was well received and considerably oversubscribed. Proceeds will be used to support the construction of energy-efficient data centers in Northern Virginia.  Turning to asset life cycle management. In the first quarter, we delivered improved performance for both revenue and EBITDA. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $84 million, an increase of 103% year-on-year. Regency Technologies performed ahead of our expectations in the quarter with revenue of $32 million.  While we are only 1 quarter into the integration, we are very pleased with the acquisition and are already seeing more benefit than planned in terms of cross-selling, increased capabilities and improved operational efficiencies. On an organic basis, ALM revenue increased 25% year-on-year, driven by both improved component pricing and increased volume from our strong cross-selling activity. Turning to capital. In the first quarter, we invested $366 million, of which $337 million was growth and $29 million was recurring. Our full year capital expenditure target remains $1.35 billion of growth and $150 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1x. As a reminder, this remains at the lowest level in the past decade. We expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 to 5.5x. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 61% at the lower end of our long-term target range of low to mid-60s percent.  And now turning to our forecast. With our positive outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance despite the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our forecast today includes current FX rates, which results in an incremental headwind of approximately $25 million to revenue and approximately $10 million to adjusted EBITDA through the remainder of the year as compared to our initial guidance.  For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $535 million, AFFO of approximately $310 million and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05. In summary, we are pleased to have delivered strong first quarter results, and we expect continued growth in 2024 as a result of our focus on Project Matterhorn objectives. I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank our entire team for their continued dedication and commitment to Iron Mountain and our clients. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Keen Fai Tong : Within the storage business, organic revenue growth step to 7.5% in the quarter compared to about 10.5% in 4Q. Presumably, most of that was driven by changes in price realization since volumes are generally stable in storage. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing with your revenue management strategy and your latest traction with price realization in the quarter and expectations for the remainder of the year? William Meaney : Thanks, George. It's Bill, and I appreciate you joining the call. The -- so let me start with kind of the macro view. So we're really very pleased with our storage, both in terms of the records management as well as in the data center side because you can see we're continuing to grow. We've never stored on the traditional side or the records management side, we've never stored more documents than we do today. So we're really pleased with the continued strength of the volume and the growth and the volume on the data center side. In terms of pricing, you can appreciate that we -- as we go through the year, that ramp. So you should think about that as being kind of the low point. But I don't know, Barry, you might want to add a little bit more color to it? Barry Hytinen : George, thanks for that question. Bill's got it right there on the revenue management within Global Rim. The timing of revenue management actions year-on-year is such that there was a bit of a shift in the first quarter. Last year, we had more of the revenue management actions in place right at the beginning of the year. And this year, we're back to our more normal cadence of kind of the Mark's time frame, generally speaking, in terms of getting them all into the market and realized.  As it relates to how it performed, though in Global RIM for storage rental revenue growth is actually, to be clear, ahead of our expectations on the lines you're asking about. And in total, we delivered 7.5% total revenue growth in Global RIM. You'll recall last quarter, we mentioned that our guide for the whole year, assuming Global RIM at about 6%. So we're starting very well. There was upside in Global RIM principally driven off of services, but a little bit ahead, as I mentioned, on storage rental and of course, data centers off to a really strong start.  So we feel very well positioned with respect to where we started the year, George, on both revenue management, total storage revenue as well as the full enterprise results. Operator : And our next question today comes from Nate Crossett with BMP. Nathan Daniel Crossett : Maybe just a follow-up to that. What is your expectation for RIM volumes for 2Q and the balance of the year? And then data center leasing guidance, is it still 100-megawatt? And maybe you could just talk about the pipeline for data center. William Meaney : Okay. Thanks, Nate. I'll give you the -- in terms of volume, we continue -- it's a rock-solid business in terms of RIM volume, and we continue to see that to flat, slightly up. So we don't see any change, and you can see that in our supplemental, we don't see any change in that trend, and we continue to feel really good about that.  And in terms of the pipeline on data center, it's extremely strong. You see we're off to a good start. We guided 100 megawatts for the full year. We're 30 megawatts in the first quarter, and we have a very strong pipeline as Barry alluded to in terms of Arizona, for instance, in terms of building out the third site in Phoenix. But across the globe, we have a very, very strong pipeline. So we're expecting another very strong year, benefiting from the strong macro environment around data centers, especially with the growth around AI applications. Barry Hytinen : And Nate, the only -- this is Barry. The only thing I would add is -- building on to Bill's point there at the beginning on volume. We are forecasting for volume to be up second quarter versus the first quarter. And consistent to slightly up for the full year as we've been saying for some time we're well on track with that forecast. And just as a reminder, we have never stored more physical volume than we are storing today. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Brendan Lynch : Maybe we could start just by disaggregating the ALM components between increased volume and improvement pricing? Barry Hytinen : Brendan, it's Barry. Thanks for that question. If we look at total ALM, we had $84 million of revenue. Now Regency, which, as you know, we just recently acquired was just over $32 million of revenue, as I mentioned on the prepared remarks. So that -- and by the way, that was very good performance. So that's on a run rate of nearly, let's call it, 130, you'll recall last quarter, I mentioned that embedded in the midpoint of our guidance, it was for Regency to be about 115. And so we are well on track with respect to that line. In terms of enterprise and hyperscale rest of our ALM business is performing quite well. As I mentioned, on an organic basis, ALM was up 25%, which was stronger than we expected. And I should note that ALM in total was about $10 million ahead of the expectations we have baked into our first quarter guidance. So it was a meaningful portion of the upside for the total.  In enterprise and hyperscale, getting directly to your question now, volume and price were both up and we saw component pricing rising through the quarter with more of the increase late in the quarter. So as we sit here today in April, component prices have continued to rise as compared to where they were in the first quarter.  And in our outlook, we continue to be, I think, prudent with our expectations that, that is likely to continue to rise, although we haven't baked in the kind of some of the levels of increase that you've seen from some of the industry analysts, which are very robust increases as we move through the remainder of the year.  Volume is being driven by our strong cross-selling activity and increased penetration with hyperscale clients as it relates to decommissioning. In both cases, we see that continuing to trend up over time. So we're feeling really good about the way ALM is starting to track with it. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Jonathan Atkin : So a question on data centers and a question on, I guess, ALM. So on data centers for some of your newer expansions where you might end up doing build-to-suits or single tenant. What are the unlevered yields now that you are kind of underwriting to what would be kind of a minimum level that you think the market will bear? And then for ALM, I just wondered which regions do you think you could see outsized growth in? William Meaney : Okay. So maybe I'll start, John, and then Barry can give you some more color on ALM. On the data center side, I think we covered pretty much what we said in the last quarter, we see those trends continuing. So think of it as a couple of hundred basis points above the historical cash-on-cash return.  So you're kind of looking at the 9 to 10 on hyperscale and then your -- I guess your question was more around hyperscale. So if you think about in terms of cost of capital, then we've -- basically, it's slightly ahead of what we've seen in the cost of capital with the run-up in interest rates. So the spreads are still positive in terms of the cost of finance, in terms of what we've gotten for cash-on-cash returns on the new leasing that we're doing. I mean that's due to the macro environment, as you know very well, in terms of -- it's a very, very strong market for data center, and we see that in our results. Barry Hytinen : Jon, it's Barry. On the ALM question as it relates to where we might see continued outsized performance, I don't want to come across promotional, but it's basically all regions because we are seeing ALM component pricing rise on a global basis, and we're seeing continued volume growth around the world, particularly in the U.S., thanks to our continued cross-selling to our some of our largest Fortune 1000 type clients as well as partnering together with the great team at Regency Technologies, we're seeing strong growth there.  And I think that will continue for some time. As you know, the ALM market is very large, it's highly fragmented, and we think we have a huge opportunity in that space. And I just want to underscore that we're really, really pleased with the way the Regency combination is already unfolding even in this early stage of the integration. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Alexander EM Hess : This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. Maybe 2 quick questions if you allow. On the ALM side, it appears that sort of -- if my math is right, that quarter-on-quarter, so 4Q '23 to 1Q '24 sort of the organic growth was about flat. Is that right? Maybe 25 million -- 25% growth times a year ago growth rate, a year ago revenue number for ALM? And then if I think about -- and maybe I'll let you answer that and then hopefully, you don't mind if I ask a maybe more longer-term-oriented question. Barry Hytinen : Go ahead with the longer term, and so we'll have them both. Alexander EM Hess : All right. Sounds good. So on the more longer-term-oriented question. I just wanted to know like how do you think about your ability to sort of deliver on time, on budget within your data center business and maybe how that's benchmarked against your peer group? William Meaney : Okay. Well, I'll deal with the longer term, and then I'll let Barry talk to you about the sequential quarter-over-quarter -- quarter-to-quarter on the ALM side. So on the -- I mean, the data center business, I think you can see that we're continuing to drive strong deployments across all of our campuses.  So we don't see any change in terms of our ability to both plan and execute that, that's -- and you can see that in our leasing activity because as you can imagine, especially with the hyperscale clients and most of our leasing over the last 12 months has been -- the vast majority has been with hyperscale. You can imagine that's a key component for them to decide who they're going to go to, is our ability to actually execute on time, on budget, which is managing also the supply chain. So if anything, we see -- even though the demand is really, really strong right now in data center, we see that the planning has gotten a little bit simpler as supply chain is more normalized, albeit though this very, very strong demand. So we're blessed with a very good construction team. And our customers' trust is in a big part, exactly what you're talking about? Barry Hytinen : And Alex, it's Barry. Thanks for that question. You're doing the math right. It was up slightly on a dollar basis Q-to-Q. And I'll just note that as we said last quarter, on the decommissioning side, we had some clients last quarter that wanted to move some of their volume that they had been sitting on for some time. So there was a little bit of timing there.  And frankly, I think we also saw in light of the way pricing was moving both from the end of the fourth quarter through the first quarter that some of our hyperscale clients were actually deferring some of the remarketing until later in the quarter in light of the fact that they wanted to like we did as well capture the better pricing that we've been seeing. As I mentioned earlier, the pricing really did ramp later in the quarter and continues. So the trends in that business are quite good. And what that results in is we had a little bit of mix in legacy IT renew business. I will note, however, that the enterprise business was up nicely on a sequential basis. And of course, in light of the cross-selling activity and the bookings that we've been talking about in that business and knowing that it's not the kind of remarketing. It's just a very straight service oriented. I am expecting the enterprise business to continue to grow quarter-to-quarter and, frankly, the hyperscale as well. So thanks for that, Alex. Operator : And our next question today comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Just to follow back on the data center business. Obviously, you have a high-class problem with most of your footprint pretty leased up. So how should we think about future data center CapEx given the strong leasing in the quarter? And how are you thinking about either additional markets or areas where you might need to add land capacity so that you have a further runway to grow the business beyond this year? William Meaney : Thanks, Eric, for the question. Yes. So I think let me kind of break out your question in 2 parts. From a capital standpoint, we're very much within our multiyear plan that we laid out at the Investor Day. So in terms of our ability to fund it, as I said, earlier is that we have a fully funded plan and that we don't see any issues between the strength that we have in our traditional records management business that generates as you know, tons of cash that we then -- after paying the dividend, we actually flow into data center and growth areas. And then, of course, the strong growth we're getting in EBITDA gives us plenty of debt capacity to continue to fund that growth. So in terms of the funding side of it, as you say, it's a high-class problem. But you can imagine even when we were putting the plans together and we do our budgets is we look at upside and downside in terms of demand. So we're pretty comfortable that we can continue to fund the growth that we're seeing.  In terms of the footprint, you're right to point out that we're going to be full and for instance, in our Manassas campus fairly soon. And we've talked about that we're already starting construction on our third campus or our third data center in Phoenix. And we're building out the Madrid campus. We're adding to the Amsterdam campus London 3. We started off with 1 data center. Now we're in 3. We have 2 data centers in Frankfurt.  So you're right to point that out. But I think you can imagine that we, right now, we feel very confident that we have in our pipeline to acquire more land that's in excess of the 100 megawatts for instance, that we guided this year. So we feel really good about the land bank strategy that we have in terms of what we have in the acquisition pipeline for land over the next -- for the rest of the year that will be ahead of our leasing activity. Barry Hytinen : Yes, Eric, I would just add on and thank you for the compliment, by the way, on how the data center business is continuing to progress. The team is doing a phenomenal job. But I would just add on that we have multiple land parcels that we are in active negotiations with. We were looking at multiple sites.  And importantly, that is embedded in our capital spending that we've been planning, as Bill alluded to, to continue to add to the land bank kind of continuously year in and year out. So that's embedded in the capital. Operator : And our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Jonathan Atkin : Just a follow-up on, I guess, 2 follow-ups for your time. So you mentioned a lot of sovereign requirements, and I'm just interested in how competitive you find that space in terms of the RFP activity. And again, similar to my other question with earlier, is there particular region where you see more of those sorts of things, perhaps presenting opportunities? And then beyond the question would be the... Barry Hytinen : Jon, just before you go into the next question, we had a little interference with the signal. Can you repeat the first part of the question or maybe just give us the first question again? Jonathan Atkin : Yes. How competitive are you finding the sovereign requirements? I don't know if these are formal RFPs in each case, but if you can talk a little bit about the competitive environment and then future opportunities, are there particular regions where you see more growth ahead in kind of the public sector? And then the second question was more around ITAD and you mentioned the integration of Regency. How complex are those integrations? And is it too soon to think about doing more of those types of tuck-ins for ALM? William Meaney : Okay. Thanks, Jon. I'll take the question in terms of government contracting. And Barry, as you know, runs our M&A shopping. So I'll let him talk about both the integration with Regency as well as the pipeline in terms of further roll-ups.  I think in terms of the sovereign contracting or government side of the business, is that we work for -- we work with a number. As you noticed that I highlighted a couple this time with United Kingdom, we do quite a bit in the United States, we also do quite a bit in other parts of Germany, including France and in -- yes, in other parts of France and Germany.  And you're right, the relationships -- first of all, it's like anything else, it's a relationship building to make sure that you get into the queue. And you're right to point out that many times, these things lapse 12 months. In other words, they start talking to you before they get into the budgets and the budgets for the following year and you go through a tender process.  But we feel pretty good about -- I mean, we've got teams that are very experienced at that. I think it's actually an opportunity for us because you can imagine we pick our places that we decide to play because you do have to have a 24-month horizon when you're going after that kind of business. So we typically go to the -- both the parts of government and the governments or states where we think that there's enough of a volume to do. So I think there's more for us to do and we're continuing to add to our teams in that area. And of course, you have to put very strong compliance around it, right? So -- but it is a strong part of our business, and it continues to grow. And it's a strong part -- and of all of our businesses. It's not just on the records management or the digital side, it includes data center. Barry Hytinen : Jon, it's Barry. Thanks for that question on the integration and tuck-ins. First thing I'd say is the integration is going very well. No integration, I would ever say, is easy because, of course, combinations of companies are -- it is complex. However, I think our team is doing a very, very good job, and I alluded to in the script, that we are ahead of plan, and we are seeing more benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, driving better margins, improved capabilities.  And that's credit to the team we picked up at Regency Technologies because they have a best-in-class capability as it relates to processing and recycling. And Bill and I were recently in our largest facility in Ohio with the team of Regency Technologies. We saw a lot of great processing going on, a really dedicated team.  I was in our Atlanta Regency facility last week, and saw the integration underway and we continue to see a lot of incremental capacity to utilize as we build out our ALM customer base. And as it relates to additional tuck-ins, I would say now that we've built the platform of both hyperscale, decommissioning as well as combining with Regency, tuck-ins are definitely something we are continuing to look at.  It is to use your phrase, it is not too early to be considering them. We have a list. But of course, everything is fact and circumstances driven. We like to make sure we're getting things at a very appropriate multiple and that we can see clear growth aligned with our business and that it will be incremental to our franchise. And -- but I think that there are opportunities booked in the U.S. and throughout the world actually as we build out our ALM capability to be a global partner to our large client base.

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gillian Tiltman : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry Hytinen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor Language on Slide 2, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today for our discussion of our second quarter results. As you saw in this morning's announcement, this quarter delivered another record financial performance and exceeded our expectations. Reflecting on these results, I am incredibly proud of how our team consistently executes at a high level, putting our customers at the center of everything we do. With our proven growth strategy, we are entering the back half of the year with strong momentum. We continue to see firsthand the power of Project Matterhorn from our commercial teams, who are successfully leveraging our full suite of products and solutions to help position Iron Mountain as an ideal partner to our customers. This customer centricity continues to power our results forward for both customers and our shareholders. Building on our track record of value creation for our shareholders and our strong positive outlook, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.715 in-line with our AFFO per share growth. I'll now turn to key developments during the quarter and how we executed on our growth strategy, which is aligned to our business segments. As a reminder, our strategic priorities are the following. Driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business, providing digitally enabled solutions for our 240,000 customers, which allows them to get true competitive advantage out of their physical and digital information, delivering differentiated data center offerings and offering top-tier growth through our global scale and customer trust, and advancing our asset lifecycle management services which provide security, maximum efficiency, and an environmentally sound lifecycle management approach for our customers' IT assets. To give you some examples of how we have recently applied our services on behalf of our customers, let's begin with our records management business. The first win I wish to highlight shows how our scalable solutions can solve for complex regulatory requirements and address changing customer needs. A European-based pharmaceutical company came to us in need of a global record retention schedule, as the company was struggling to manage costs and meet regulatory requirements. As part of our expanding partnership, we are providing a fully managed suite of solutions, including policy center [upkeep] (ph), advisory services, and a dedicated help desk for queries in a scalable and flexible way that can seamlessly adapt over time as their needs evolve. Continuing with wins in our records management business, I am particularly excited to discuss a couple of digital wins. The first example to highlight is a major contract signed with a large financial institution. The foundation of this win was based upon multiple decades of a trusted relationship with the bank's understanding of our truly differentiated approach to digitally managing and automating workflow. As a result, they selected Iron Mountain to serve as its partner for a long-term transformation of its management of digital and physical documents. On the bank's behalf, Iron Mountain is transforming how it captures both digital and physical documents and their associated metadata across all lines of business, including non-banking internal documents like finance and HR. Our unique offering revolutionizes document processing services for both physical and digital documents. We have achieved this by employing our proprietary leading edge, AI powered intelligent document processing built into our InSight platform. Continuing with our digital business in Australia we have secured a large deal with one of the country's biggest banks to provide our Digital Mailroom solution, which brings together our operational scale and digital capabilities. Iron Mountain has been a trusted records management partner for over 20 years, and we built on that relationship to develop a comprehensive service offering that will see us manage their physical Mailroom sites across Australia and scan around 32 million images a year, as we process mortgage documents, checks, vouchers, and other banking documents. Our proven implementation methodology reassured the customer that we could execute a seamless transition of services and the innovative technology we are deploying will help them to realize significant efficiencies in the years ahead. Moving to our data center business, through the first half of the year, we leased 97 megawatts, which includes 66 megawatts this quarter. Due to our strong pipeline, we feel confident we will exceed our original projection and now expect to lease 130 megawatts for the year. The speed of leasing in the first half of the year is thanks to the momentum that our team has built in our leasing pipeline. We are an attractive partner to customers looking for infrastructure, which can support their very dense IT workloads and associated with their AI enabled services. Here are some examples of wins during the quarter from our US and UK markets. At our Western Pennsylvania location, we welcomed a new hyperscale customer with a seven-year contract. Since signing the contract, the customer is already in discussions about potential expansion to some of our other campuses. A good example of our continued and growing partnerships with some of the largest hyperscalers, our recent wins this quarter with a single customer in both the US and UK markets. This customer has placed a 10-year contract for us with us for almost 25 megawatts of capacity at our London data center campus and a 15-year contract for 36 megawatts at our data center campus in Phoenix, Arizona. Also at our Phoenix campus, we have won a 10-year co-location contract with one of Japan's largest banks. We will be providing 800 kilowatts of capacity to support the complete transformation of this customer's North American IT platform. Turning to our asset lifecycle management business, we continue to see established Iron Mountain customers seek new solutions from our ever-expanding portfolio. A perfect example of this is how we expanded a relationship with an insurance company that has been an Iron Mountain customer since the late 1950s. Having secured a small ALM project with them last year, our customers confidence in our capabilities and our delivery record has led them to make us their sole ALM provider. Finally, I'd like to share a last example of a customer that has added our ALM services to the Iron Mountain Solutions from which they already benefit. This global cloud-based software company has asked us to manage an ALM program to securely destroy, remarket or recycle data center assets at more than 30 locations in North America, EMEA, Latin America, and the Asian Pacific regions. Demonstrating we can provide a full service global ALM offering is no small task, but our skilled and dedicated teams successfully met the challenge. We are now a proud ALM partner for this customer, alongside the records management and digital solutions that we already provide. To conclude, we have thoughtfully and strategically curated a mountain range of best-in-class solutions and an effective operating model under Project Matterhorn. This quarter's successes are a brief testament to the value our strategy is already delivering and a window into the future we are building at Iron Mountain. As we continue to expand our footprint of storage and services and deliver tailored, innovative solutions for each of our customers, I could not be more grateful for the hard work of our Mountaineers. Our strategy and execution is showing the way in delivering consistently strong revenue growth in the resulting financial model that delivers top tier growth in both our AFFO and our dividend. We have an energized team of experienced, proven operators who are committed to excellence, and that gives us great confidence in our future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. I'll begin by providing an overview of our second quarter results, and then go into more detail on each of our business segments before turning to our outlook for the third quarter, the full year. In the second quarter, our team achieved strong performance across all of our key financial metrics. We achieved record revenue of $1.534 billion, up 13% on a recorded basis driven by 11% storage growth and 17% service growth. We delivered 10% organic revenue growth. Revenue was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call by more than $30 million. Total storage revenue was $920 million up $89 million year-on-year. Storage growth was driven by revenue management and continued strong commencements in our data center business. Total service revenue was $615 million up $87 million from last year, driven by strength in our asset lifecycle management and global RIM businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $544 million a new record, up 14% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in global RIM, as well as data center and asset lifecycle management. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.5% up 50 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across our business. AFFO was $321 million or $1.08 on a per share basis, up $34 million and $0.10 respectively from the second quarter of last year. This represents growth of 12% for AFFO and 10% for AFFO per share. This is ahead of the guidance we provided for the second quarter, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower than expected cash taxes, which is included in our guidance for the third quarter. The strength of the US dollar continued to be a headwind in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 14% and AFFO was up 13%. Now turning to segment performance. I'll start with our global RIM business, which achieved revenue of $1.25 billion, an increase of $91 million year-on-year with strong organic revenue growth of 7.9%. Revenue management and positive volume trends drove organic storage rental growth of 7.7%. Our team delivered organic service revenue up 8.3%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, an increase of $50 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was up 40 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points from last year driven by storage growth and continued productivity across our operations. Turning to Global Data Center, the team delivered revenue of $153 million, an increase of $35 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we achieved 24% organic growth. Organic Storage Rental revenue growth was particularly strong at 27% driven by commencements and improved pricing. GAAP mark-to-market in the second quarter was 12.3% and was benefited by a single relatively large renewal. We continue to expect mark-to-market to be up mid-to-high single digit in the second half. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $66 million representing 23% growth. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we signed 66 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings for the first half to 97 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, with our strong leasing and favorable outlook, we are increasing our full-year projection to 130 megawatts. The data center market continues to develop rapidly, and with our strong and expanding hyperscale relationships, our pipeline continues to grow. I am pleased to report that we have increased our land bank by 57 megawatts. With those additions, our total data center capacity can now be built out to 918 megawatts over time with 347 megawatts held for development. Turning to Asset Lifecycle Management. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $90 million, an increase of 111% year-on-year and 30% on an organic basis driven by both improved volume and pricing. ALM continues to be a key beneficiary of cross-selling with over 95% of our bookings this quarter happening as a result of that initiative. The team at Regency Technologies continues to deliver results ahead of our plan with revenue of $35 million in the quarter. We have seen our combination with Regency result in expanded client relationships and improved profitability. Turning to capital allocation, we remain focused on a disciplined approach to fund our growth initiatives and drive meaningful shareholder returns, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $399 million with $360 million of growth and $37 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, which is the lowest level we have achieved since prior to the company's REIT conversion in 2014. Turning to our dividend. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 60%. Consistent with our target payout range and reflecting our positive outlook, we have increased our dividend 10%. Now turning to our projections. For the full year, we now expect to deliver results towards the high end of our guidance range on all metrics. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.55 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $560 million, AFFO of approximately $325 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $1.10. In conclusion, our team delivered record results in the first half. We continue to perform ahead of our long-term growth objectives, and our outlook is strong. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Mountaineers for their continued efforts to deliver on behalf of our customers. And with that operator, would you please open the line for Q&A? Operator : Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : All right, thanks. Good morning. Your ALM business saw 30% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Can you discuss how much of the growth came from volumes versus pricing and what assumptions for component prices you're baking into your guidance. William Meaney : Thanks, George, and good morning. Let me handle the first part, and then I'll let Barry talk a little bit more about the pricing trends that we're seeing. So first, we're really pleased with the growth, in the organic growth that you highlighted in our ALM business this quarter. And you think about that, about two-thirds of that is driven by just pure volume. And the other third is the price improvement that we've seen from the record lows that were 12 months, 18 months ago. So we're really pleased with the progress. But I'd say most of the growth is from volume. Barry Hytinen : And, George, from a standpoint of what we're seeing in our view for pricing going forward is, as you'd know pricing continues to be expected to trend higher. We've been somewhat conservative with respect to our outlook for pricing because we've seen some variation between the spreads between new gear and secondary gear, particularly so on memory. It's widened some, but frankly, it's narrowed those spreads on other gear like drives. So, you know, look it's a very positive outlook for our ALM business because the team continues to win a lot of business. The cross-selling activity we have is immense. And we are expecting, if you work through the guidance we just gave for the third quarter and implied for the fourth, you should be expecting our ALM business to be comping organically in the 40s in the back half, if not higher. So we're feeling really good and I guess I should just call out, since you asked about ALM, our Regency business is doing phenomenal. The team there continues to execute very, very well. We are seeing very strong productivity as a result of leveraging Regency\u2019s capabilities and their utilization is going up, thanks to historic Iron Mountain business that's being processed by regency. So thank you, George. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh, UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Congratulations on the record results. Yes. I don't know if it is for Barry or -- can you reconcile kind of the two quarters of beat relative to the reaffirmed guidance and just the optimism that it seems like it is scaling on the ALM side. Just puts and takes around that. Barry Hytinen : Yes. Kevin. Good morning. We continue to feel very good, as we just noted about our guidance, and as you know, we beat in the first quarter, and we beat again here in the second quarter, actually a wider beat than the first. And our thought process is that things continue to trend very much in the right direction. That's why we pointed to the higher end of our guidance range for the year. I will note FX continues to be a headwind, so you will see the stronger dollar be an impact to our reported results in the third quarter probably of the order of the same magnitude as the second quarter, if not a little bit more. But what you are seeing is, improving trends as compared to our initial outlook this year across the business. Global RIM continues to perform really well in the organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated in the quarter, as we expected it to and as we forecasted last quarter, and we continue to expect that to be in the 7% to 8% range in the back half. And then in terms of data center, as we talked about before, that's a business that has a tremendous amount of visibility in the near-term. And as we talked about the outlook for the long term, there is very robust in light of the leasing activity we've had. And I just mentioned ALM with George. So I appreciate the question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nate Crossett of BNP. Please go ahead. Nate Crossett : Hi, good morning. Just wondering what you are expecting in terms of overall RIM volumes for 3Q in the balance of the year? And then can you -- I guess, you already talked about your expectations for pricing growth. So should we assume that the organic revenue growth is 7% to 8% in the back half? Barry Hytinen : Hi, Nate, it's Barry. Consistent with our outlook for the last many quarters, we continue to expect our physical volume to be flattish to slightly up. And it continued that trend obviously, in the second quarter, and we have a favorable outlook for it again to be in that vicinity in the third and in the fourth quarter. So we expect our volumes to be continuing to rise. I'll just note we have never stored more physical volumes than we are storing today. And so that is, I think, a testament to the team's diligence, as it relates to serving our customers. And frankly, the value we are driving for customers, as they continue to trust us with their important assets. In terms of organic growth in RIM on the storage side, you\u2019ve got it right. So the volume would be a relatively small component of the growth and then the rest would be driven principally by revenue management. And I\u2019ll note that our services business in Global RIM continues to be benefited both on the traditional side, but also and going forward likely to be ramping some on the digital side, because the team in our Digital Solutions Group just delivered the best bookings quarter we\u2019ve ever had in digital. So that is a really nice performance by our commercial and digital teams. Thanks, Nate. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alexander Hess : This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I hope you are all well today. A quick question on data center CapEx. And then maybe a quick follow-up. On data center CapEx, do the assumptions that you guys made at Investor Day -- your investor event in 2022 still hold. Obviously, we're seeing notable pickup in the guided CapEx numbers from the hyperscalers. And then maybe a structural question. Has the pool of hyperscalers, are those still say, the same firms for you guys as three years or four years ago? Or is there opportunity for some of these infrastructure software and AI start-ups to also be hyperscalers in your book as well? Thank you. William Meaney : Good morning. I'll start with your second question and then Barry will follow up on the CapEx relative to our Investor Day. So I think what you see for us, hyperscalers are always kind of not just the largest cloud providers, but the largest SaaS providers as well. So people who need very, very large deployments in terms of megawatts of data center capacity. And usually, these are global firms. So I'm not saying that we won't see some of those firms -- some of the more newer firms that you are highlighting come into that fold, but I\u2019d say, that the barriers to entry for these really very large hyperscalers just given the cost of leasing and building data centers. It is a fairly consolidated in tight group. I'm not saying that there couldn't be people that break into it, but I think for the moment, it's a pretty stable group, slightly increasing as some of the SaaS players get bigger in their own right. Barry Hytinen : Alex, it is Barry. I\u2019d say, a couple of thoughts about your question on the CapEx use. We are continuing to see our data center business and actually the whole business run ahead of the expectations we shared at that Investor Day. As we talked about last quarter, for the first couple of years, we were well ahead. And if you look at what we are doing here this year, we are actually accelerating that level of beat. So we are generating more revenue, more EBITDA and more cash generation. And certainly, we continue to lease more and faster than we were indicating at the time of the Investor Day. So over time, I think it\u2019s possible that we may see a continued ramp in capital for data center. But I'll just note, we are constructing to leases with some of the best quality tenants you could imagine in the hyperscalers. And I mean a couple of statistics, we are 96% leased in our operating portfolio and in our under development construction portfolio which is about 10% bigger than what we are operating, maybe even 15% bigger than we're operating, we're 96% leased on that as well on a pre-lease basis. So I will just underscore that when we are putting capital to work to build out our data center platform, it is because we have already signed contracts with clients, and we\u2019re very pleased with the level of returns that we have been generating on those deals. Operator : Thank you. And our next question from comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Thanks. Appreciate it. Just a follow-up on the data center conversation. I mean just based on all the opportunity you've had, the outperformance on leasing year-to-date. Maybe you could just talk about funding sources going forward. And given the fact that your stock has been so strong this year, your equity cost of capital is significantly lower than it has been in years past. Does this issuing equity enter the conversation going forward, as you look at funding the data center business? Thank you. William Meaney : Thanks, Eric. Let me start and then Barry may want to chime in as well. So first, we feel really good about, as you are highlighting, the growth and momentum that we are building in the data center business. And just in the colo, but more and more in the hyperscale and the majority is coming from hyperscale. But as Barry said, it is -- well over 90% like around 96% is all pre-leased and it is a fully funded plan as we highlighted in Investor Day. So we don't see any -- we feel really good in terms of the way that we are able to fund the growth. And so we are happy in terms of the trajectory that we have without going out and raising equity. I think we have a plan that works. Barry Hytinen : Eric, I\u2019d just add that if you look going forward, likely rates are probably coming down over time. So that makes it that much easier for us. And the business is so cash generative from the core. And as you see, the [covering] (ph) business continues to deliver outstanding results. So I think from a standpoint of your point about the equity has risen a bit, that is true. But I think that's more a function of where it was. And if you look at us on a multiple versus the growth we're putting up I think that bolsters the point Bill was just making as it relates to equity. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to touch on two items, if I may. One, just on ALM, are you seeing the hyperscalers starting to really open up the inventory of gear that they had and really starting to sell it? Or are you still starting -- seeing the hesitation in case prices rise more. What I'm trying to understand is, are they starting to actually dump the stuff that they've been holding on to? And then just second, just if you can comment, Barry, on the storage gross margin had increased by 20 basis points sequentially, but the moving parts are very interesting, where you had like all other storage costs up like $10 million, but you had a rent to actually go down $2 million sequentially. Maybe you could talk about what the movements over there, how did rent go down? And what are those other storage costs that are going up? William Meaney : Good morning. Shlomo. So I will take the question on the ALM and then Barry can talk to you a little bit about the takes in terms of storage costs. So on the ALM side, is the hyperscale is the reticence that you might have seen last year that I think we commented from the hyperscalers was less to do with the pricing on the components. It was more the availability of new kit that they had to actually refresh their data centers. And I think you've seen all the reporting from some of the largest hyperscalers in the last couple of weeks that you are all ramping up their refresh of their data centers to bring in the most capable GPUs, so that they are AI ready, and they can build up some of their AI Services. So we do see an uptick, to your point in the volume that we're getting from the hyperscalers, but it's driven more because they are refreshing their data centers to be more AI enabled and they're able to get the latest GPUs from the supplier, so they are able to accelerate some of that. So we do see a building volume from the hyperscalers right now in terms of decommissioning, which leads to more ALM volume in our business. Barry Hytinen : Shlomo, it is Barry. A couple of thoughts about the storage rental gross margin. First of all, we were really pleased with that at 70% and that being because really, if you look at our global RIM business, it was up very nicely year-on-year. Of course part of that revenue management, part of that is the continued productivity that our operations teams are driving. And so the reason it was slightly down year-on-year is related to, as I talked about hour, as well as data center. As we've talked about sometimes before, data center is a lower gross margin, but it is, of course accretive to our EBITDA margin. And so as data center continues to ramp at a very fast rate, it has a little bit of a level of mix. But obviously, it is very incremental. And on a sequential basis, you would expect on that all other storage costs, there to be some power inflation as commencements begin to ramp and folks start to drop out, if you know that -- that's a direct pass-through. So it can actually also affect rate. So to have the storage gross margin up sequentially in light of that headwind is we thought very favorable about that. On the storage rent expense it was down some sequentially, and that's thanks to our team's continued productivity around warehouse efficiencies. We have -- as you would have seen over the last few quarters, reduced some of our warehouses and thereby gotten to a better expense position. And the only other thing I'll mention is taking it up a level. Our gross margin in the quarter for the whole company was almost just under 56%. Now that's slightly down from last year. But two things to think about. One, we are absorbing the mix issues, including the power that I mentioned in that number. And two, we've added Regency Technologies, which is, again, a mixed headwind on gross margin, but by the way Regency performed extraordinarily well on EBITDA in the quarter. And so we feel really good about where the gross margin is trending and it\u2019s been ahead of our expectations. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. It came up a little bit already. But on the pricing front, your organic constant currency growth was 7.7% for storage rentals, up quarter-to-quarter, but down relative to the 2023 pace. I think you guys have one suggested mid-single digit pricing growth which is possible over the next couple of years. But you've been at high single digits for a few years now. Is it transition to mid-single digits occurring now? And how should we think about you guys pushing price as inflation wanes? Barry Hytinen : Brendan, we were very pleased with the 7.7%. And I think at that level, you can see the amount of EBITDA the business generates since it is a highly productive portion of our company. And as it relates to trending, we have indicated we feel like mid-to-upper single is the right kind of level over the longer term. And so I\u2019d say, it trending in this vicinity is -- would be very positive to the business model going forward. William Meaney : Yes. And the only thing I would add is that it isn't so much inflation-based anymore. It's really about the value that we are adding to our customers. So if you look at our traditional records management business, is we've over the last few years have added a portfolio of services such as Smart Sort, Smart Reveal, and I highlighted on the call some of the governance and compliance consulting and systems that we are able to install around their hard records management. And so we are really driving more value for our customers and the customers see value in that. So I think you can continue to expect that our pricing will remain some 300 basis points to 400 basis points ahead of what you would think is normal inflation, but it is really driven by the value that our customers see from our services. Barry Hytinen : Brendan, the only other thing I'll add is that at the start of the year, we had suggested Global RIM might be in the vicinity of 6%, total growth for the year. And so year-to-date, we are running 7.5% on that business. So we continue to see outperformance in Global RIM. Some of that is driven off of revenue management, also incremental service uptake of the sort that Bill just mentioned. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Jon Atkin : Thanks. A couple of questions. Can you talk a little bit about ALM and to what extent Regency is sort of fully occupied? Or do you have the opportunity within that set of assets to see more productivity. And then secondly, on data centers, if there is anything to call out in terms of lead times around construction and delivery and the conversion of book-to-bill. Thank you. William Meaney : Good morning Jon. Let me start with the data center piece and then Barry can talk about Regency and more broadly, the ALM business and operating leverage. So on the data center side, is you are right to highlight the lead times for a lot of the build components, including the concrete panels or the actual physical construction of the shelf. The good news is that we've been able to manage that and keep the lead times similar to historical norms and what our customers are expecting because as we're building scale in our data center business, we're standardizing across a lot of those components in market, right? So across some of the like Europe versus the United States, you can't standardize as much. But within Europe, you can standardize a lot. Within the United States, you can standardize a lot. India, you can standardize a lot, et cetera. So we are doing that. And what that allows us to do is as we get scale is to be much more flexible in terms of having the right equipment for the right customer in the right location. So we feel pretty good in terms of our ability to manage the supply chain and keep our timing intact? Barry Hytinen : Jon, this is Barry. As it relates to Regency and the opportunity to continue to utilize and optimize further, it\u2019s definitely there. There is a lot of opportunity. We have considerable capacity to expand the business, both in terms of what is already in place, as well as the opportunity to expand the footprint at relatively low CapEx, I might add. So it's a very positive situation to be having Regency get further utilized which I expected to over time. And I\u2019ll say, we have a very highly capable team at Regency that there is no doubt, can manage a much larger business and drive a tremendous amount of value for our shareholders. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thanks for squeeze me in for one more. This is a little bit more of a technical one also. It looks like the real estate depreciation went up sequentially by like $14 million. Was there a major site that team on Board during the quarter? Barry Hytinen : Shlomo, you should expect the depreciation, of course to continue to ramp with all of the CapEx we've been doing on data center as well as some of our incremental new warehouses that we put in as well as some of the digital innovation that we\u2019ve been driving internally for some time now. So that is the primary driver, and it is in those that order. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Gillian Tiltman : Thank you, Chuck. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We're joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today to discuss our third quarter results. We delivered another excellent quarter, with record results across all financial metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. This is a direct result of the portfolio based momentum we have built, which will continue to deliver sustained double-digit growth. During the quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.6 billion, up 12% from the prior year. We also set a new adjusted EBITDA record of $568 million, up 14%. In addition, AFFO per share on a normalized basis was $1.12, up 10% compared to the prior year. Given our strong performance year-to-date, we are now on track to achieve the high end of our full year 2024 guidance range. I'll now turn to an update of our key achievements during the quarter, which are grounded in the following strategic priorities : driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business; delivering differentiated digital solutions, which give truly transformative results to our customers in terms of revenue, cost and cybersecurity; providing asset life cycle management capabilities, which are both economic and environmentally sustainable; and supplying differentiated data center offerings through our global scale and customer trust. Now let me highlight some important wins from the quarter that showcase how we demonstrate the power of our platform. Let's begin with our Records and Information Management business. In Australia, a large government department was looking for a partner that could provide a number of services. We earned their trust and signed a seven year contract delivering storage, digital solutions and asset life cycle management services. Turning to our digital solutions business. This quarter, we launched our InSight Digital Experience, or DXP, a SaaS based platform. DXP allows customers to automate the generation of metadata as well as having the ability to access, manage, govern and monetize physical and digital information. We launched this enhanced platform on August 1, and we have already booked 24 recurring revenue deals. I'll speak to two existing customer wins where we cross sold our DXP offering. Let's start with the customer in Mexico. Due to new requirements in the country for all pension information to be digitized, a longstanding customer turned to Iron Mountain to swiftly gain compliance. We have secured a DXP contract with this large financial services company to sort, digitize and manage their pension records over the next 12 months, comprising more than 50 million images. Secondly, in the U.S., a large healthcare company that has an existing records management and ALM customer will leverage our DXP platform to manage a complex set of multi-format records. By digitizing and migrating this data into our DXP platform, our customer will be able to manage their records more effectively, including the elimination of ineligible claims. This is an example, how the power of our DXP platform drives value for our customers and our unique ability to support their physical and digital information management needs. Turning to our asset life cycle management business. We are pleased with the progress we are making to expand our capabilities and geographic footprint. In Australia, a telecommunications provider needed services for the secured destruction and disposal of e-waste and IT assets. Given our nationwide scale, this customer determined that we are the right partner by handling a high volume of IT hardware efficiently. As a result, Iron Mountain was awarded a recurring contract for these services. In the U.S., our expanded footprint and capabilities following our acquisition of Regency Technologies has resulted in a significant ALM contract with a global technology company. Under this agreement, we will be managing all IT asset disposition services for our customers' U.S. operations, in addition to the records management services that we already provide. The strength of our logistics capabilities was a major factor in winning this contract. Consistent with our strategy to significantly grow our presence in the large and fragmented enterprise asset life cycle management space, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of Wisetek, an end-to-end IT asset disposition company, which will provide us with an expanded footprint across Europe and the United States. We also completed the acquisition of APCD, a leading Australian IT asset disposition specialist. These acquisitions will enable us to continue to expand our reach across a number of categories. Turning to our data center business. I would like to share two examples that demonstrate the continued demand for capacity at our campuses across the world. In Virginia, our team won a second 2 megawatt deal with a global technology company, building on a similar deal with this customer at our data center in Pennsylvania earlier this year. In Arizona, we are supporting a global fintech provider to migrate from an internal data center in a 1.5 megawatt deal with scope for further expansion. Our compliance program was a deciding factor for this highly regulated customer. The leasing achieved in the first three quarters brings us to 106 megawatts compared to the increased guidance for the year of 130 megawatts. To conclude, I'll leave you with three key takeaways. Our strategy is built on the strength of our portfolio of growth businesses, including digital solutions, data center and asset life cycle management, each growing at a CAGR of 20% plus. This coupled with the mid to high-single digit growth of our records management business will continue to deliver consolidated growth in excess of 10% for years to come. This growth is sustained and resilient given it is based upon a portfolio of products and services that meet the current and future needs of our customer base of nearly 250,000 customers, including 95% of the Fortune 1000. And the cornerstone of this strategy is our company's DNA of placing our customers' needs and well-being at the heart of how we serve them. This is all thanks to our dedicated team of Mountaineers. With that, I'll turn it over to Barry to provide more details on our financial results and outlook. Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the third quarter, our team delivered strong performance across all of our key financial metrics, including revenue, EBITDA and AFFO. Results for each of those were ahead of the projections we provided on our last call. Our team drove solid performance across all of our business segments, each of which I will discuss in more detail before turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. During the third quarter, we achieved record revenue of $1.56 billion, up 12% on a reported basis, driven by 9% storage growth and 17% service growth. We delivered strong organic growth in the quarter, up 10%. Total storage revenue in the quarter was $936 million, up $77 million year-on-year. We drove 9% organic storage growth, two-thirds of which was driven by revenue management trends in our global RIM business and one-third from our data center business. Total service revenue was $622 million, up $92 million from last year. Organic service revenue growth accelerated to 10% year-on-year. I will note, this represents our best quarterly growth rate for organic service revenue in the last two years. Revenue was driven by strong performance in our ALM and global RIM businesses. Reported service revenue growth at 17.4% reflects the inclusion of our Regency Technologies acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was $568 million, a new record, up 14% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in our Global RIM, ALM and data center businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5%, up 50 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across all of our businesses. AFFO was $332 million, up $31 million, which represents growth in excess of 10% for the third quarter of last year -- from the third quarter of last year. Reported AFFO on a per share basis was $1.13, up $0.11 from last year. AFFO per share included a $0.01 benefit due to our GAAP share count in the quarter. Normalizing for that, AFFO per share was up 10% to $1.12, which is comparable to the projection we provided on our last call of $1.10. The outperformance to our guidance was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. As expected, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to be a headwind, increasingly so toward the end of the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 13% and AFFO was up 11%. Now turning to segment performance. I'll start with our global RIM business, which achieved revenue of $1.26 billion, an increase of $78 million year-on-year. Organic storage was up in excess of 7%, driven by revenue management and consistent volume. Organic service revenue was also up 7%, with contributions from digital and core services. A key highlight is the performance of our digital business. The team launched the digital experience platform that Bill mentioned, while also delivering their best bookings quarter yet. Consistent with our Matterhorn plan, the vast majority of the digital wins were the result of cross selling. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $569 million, an increase of $52 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points sequentially and 140 basis points from last year. Margin expansion was driven by operating leverage and revenue management. Turning to our global data center business. The team delivered revenue of $153 million, an increase of $26 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we achieved 20% organic growth. We delivered storage rental revenue growth of 22% from the third quarter of last year. As expected, service revenue was down slightly this quarter due to the customer specific installation work we had last year. As a reminder, installation revenue tends to be at low to breakeven margins. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, representing strong growth of 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.6%, an increase of 190 basis points from the third quarter of last year and up 40 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by pricing, recent commencements and operating leverage. Turning to new and expansion leasing. We signed 9 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 106 megawatts, and we expect to finish the year with 130 megawatts of new leases signed in 2024. Consistent with the strength and expanding nature of our hyperscale customer relationships, together with the outlook for long-term secular growth in the data center industry, we are pleased to announce that we have acquired a development site in Richmond, Virginia. When fully built out, the campus will operate with greater than 200 megawatts of capacity. As this transaction closed in the fourth quarter, it is not included in our supplemental. With this new market, our total data center capacity rises to in excess of 1.1 gigawatts, an increase of over 20%. Turning to asset life cycle management. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $102 million, an increase of $61 million or 145% year-on-year. On an organic basis, our ALM team delivered strong double-digit growth, which was driven by data center decommissioning and expansion in our enterprise business. Regency Technologies performed very well this quarter with revenue of $36 million. Leveraging Regency's capabilities, capturing synergies related to the deal and improved efficiencies in our data center decommissioning resulted in considerable improvement in ALM profitability. Our focus on cross selling is delivering great results. For example, over 95% of our ALM bookings this quarter were cross sell wins. Regarding the ALM acquisitions that Bill referenced, we closed APCD in August, and it contributed $3 million to revenue. We closed Wisetek in late September, so we had no income statement contribution in the quarter from that acquisition. Turning to capital allocation. We remain committed to our strategy, that is balanced between funding our growth initiatives, while delivering meaningful returns to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $415 million, with $373 million of growth and $41 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, which is again the lowest level we have achieved since prior to the company's REIT conversion in 2014. For me, a highlight in the quarter was the significant improvement in our cash cycle, with the third quarter having the best performance in that metric in over a decade. Our team drove days sales outstanding down by over five days from the third quarter of last year. Also, we improved days payable by two days. Turning to our dividend. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.715 per share to be paid in early January. And now turning to our projections. For the full year, we are on track to achieve the high end of our guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $595 million, AFFO of approximately $358 million and AFFO per share of approximately $1.21. In conclusion, our third quarter results represent another milestone on our growth plan. We operate in very large categories, with a total addressable market in excess of $150 billion annually and growing. Iron Mountain has long-standing relationships with nearly 250,000 clients, many measured in decades of duration. And in the vast majority of those relationships, we are only penetrated with a small fraction of our total product offering. We are driving value for our customers, and we are highly focused on cross selling and expanding market share across our businesses. I would like to thank all of my fellow Mountaineers for their efforts to serve our clients and grow our company. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In your ALM business, can you talk a little bit more about trends that you're seeing in the data center and enterprise side of the business, including how much contribution you're seeing from volumes and pricing? William Meaney : Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Let me talk about the overall trends. And Barry, I'll ask to comment a little bit on the pricing trends. So as you, I think, alluded to, is that we see good growth or very strong growth coming out of the data center decommissioning (ph), especially where a lot of the hyperscalers are renewing their equipment to take advantage of the latest GPU. So we continue to see strength in that trend. But that's not to ignore the strength in the growth, the volumetric trends that we see also in the enterprise side. But you're right to assume that we see good growth in the hyperscale segment due to the refresh of some of their equipment to take advantage of AI. Barry Hytinen : And George, it's Barry. I would say from a pricing standpoint, we continue to see -- expect it to trend as I've been discussing throughout the year. It was up some on a year-year basis and trending. However, the spreads between new and second hand of the year have been a little bit variable based on the specific component. So with memory, for example, being a little wider than normal and some of those others being a little tighter. As I've said before, we're not really predicating our guidance on a really meaningful increase in component pricing. And just to give you a perspective on this, our total ALM business was $102 million of revenue, almost $103 million actually in the quarter. As I mentioned, Regency was $36 million, and then we had about $3 million from APCD, which means our organic revenue in the quarter on ALM was about $64 million, and that compares to last year at $42 million. So we are -- to Bill's point, the volume is driving a lot of increase. And with that volume, together with the synergies from our Regency deal, we're seeing the ALM profitability to be up a lot. So we're very pleased with the way our ALM business is trending, George. George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. I wanted to ask about CapEx requirements to kind of fuel the growth going forward. Give us a sense as to how to maybe frame that for the next year? I assume a lot of that would be data centers, but any color on that would be helpful. Thank you. Barry Hytinen : Hi, Jon. It's Barry. You are correct that in light of the strong growth we continue to see in leasing, we will be continuing to invest significantly in data center growth capital. And in fact, we'll probably be somewhere in the vicinity of a couple of hundred million dollars more growth capital than we were previously expecting earlier in the year in light of the signings. And as you probably saw in our supplemental, we are advancing pretty heavily in some of the construction of all the pre-leased assets. As I've said before, important note is nearly everything that we have under construction is already pre-leased on very, very favorable terms. So our total guidance for capital this year is probably approaching $1.8 billion and with about approaching $150 million of that being recurring. The vast, vast majority of the growth is for data center. And I think you should probably expect something of that order or so going forward in light of the signings that we've had and the amount of capacity we'll be bringing online under those pre-leased agreements. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the pacing of when you expect some of the construction to come on board? It wasn't a ton of sequential revenue growth in the data center business. And obviously, there was a huge signing quarter relative to what we saw in the last couple of quarters. So I want to know if you could just give us -- I know it's lumpy on the signings side. And obviously, you have to put something into commission that you're actually -- the customers using it in order to generate revenue. Can you give us a little bit of an idea of how we should think about that pacing into the fourth quarter? And then in general, over the next year or so, how are -- how is that looking -- are you looking to bring a lot of new capacity or new data centers actually into service? William Meaney : Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo for the question. So there's a few pieces in there. So let me start, first of all, about the signing this quarter, the 9 megawatts. And as you alluded to, and I think we said in the last call, there was some that kind of we expected in Q3 last time that landed in Q2. We still feel very good with the pipeline that we have to land at 130 megawatts or maybe a little bit better for the year because of lumpiness of some of these large hyperscale contracts that you mentioned. But we're really pleased with the -- these two contracts that we signed or the two that I mentioned on the call, for instance, because these are more co-lo (ph), which obviously attract very high margins. So we feel really good about the overall guidance for the year. I think in terms of the revenue growth and the pickup that you mentioned is the commencements are actually driving this. So we actually see an acceleration of revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially as we head into the fourth quarter, which is really going to set us up well as we get the momentum to continue to carry this strong double-digit or in center case, north of 20% CAGR in the growth of that business as we go into 2025. And that's reinforced by the fact that we announced it since the close of the quarter, but in Q4, we've already purchased more land to build out a campus in Richmond, Virginia that Barry mentioned in his remarks. So we feel really good about the setup as we go into 2025. The fourth quarter will be very strong. And I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything. Barry Hytinen : Sure. Well, the only other color I suppose I would provide is, you would see in the supplemental that we did commence into revenue generating and finished construction, if you will, on quite a few megawatts. But the vast majority of that was right at the end of the quarter. So it really contributed almost very de minimis amount of revenue to the headline results. And so that's one of the reasons why we have a high degree of visibility to something in the neighborhood of probably $20 million plus or more of incremental data center revenue in the fourth quarter versus the third. That incidentally is up from our prior guidance, so reflecting the fact that our team is doing a great job with keeping construction on budget and on time. And as you would see in the supplemental, we've got quite a few commencements coming over the next couple, three, four quarters. So you should be anticipating ramping levels of data center revenue from us going forward. And I'll just point out that, as we said before, the returns we've been writing have been improving. Pricing, obviously, in data center has been getting better for quite some time now. And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing the margins step up sequentially, and we expect that trend to continue. So we feel quite good about where we are. Next question? Operator : Your next question will come from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead. Nathan Crossett : Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us your expectation for RIM volumes in 4Q? And maybe into next year, what should we expect for RIM pricing? And then one on the Richmond land, is that power provisioned already and maybe when can we see start developments on that site? William Meaney : Thanks, Nate. Let me start with the Richmond land. Yes, that is power provided. And as we said, that will be north of 200 megawatts of critical IT load, so we're really pleased with that expansion. And I'll let Barry talk about the RIM volume and pricing. Barry Hytinen : Sure. Hi, Nate. As you would see in the supplemental, we continue to expand our total physical volume in the quarter and we expect that trend to continue certainly in the fourth quarter and going into next year. The team is doing a great job capturing market share and growing our physical volume. Pricing, revenue management, we were clearly focused, as I mentioned, on driving value for our clients and with that value. And I think we're really on provider that can serve clients, especially our larger clients in the ways that we do. And we're offering new offerings that make the value that much higher, things like Smartstore, Image on Demand, our DXP platform among numerous other offerings that drive value for clients. So you would see that the total revenue in global RIM on the storage side was up a little over 7% organic in the quarter, and that was very much in line, in fact, a little bit ahead of what we were expecting as the team continues to do very well driving that value. Thank you. And I would say you mentioned about for next year. Our long-term outlook continues to be that our physical volume will be flattish to slightly up. I see no reason why, at this point, that would be any different next year. And similarly, I think as long as we're continuing to drive value for clients as we are, you should be anticipating our revenue management opportunities to be of the same order that we've been speaking about for some time, which is that mid to upper-single digit. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, I guess, hey, Barry, I think you talked to kind of revenue and EBITDA at the upper end of the range last quarter too. It looks like you beat by a little bit in the quarter. Any thoughts as to just why it was reaffirmed as opposed to not take it up with one quarter left in the year? Was that FX? Any puts and takes on that? Barry Hytinen : Hi, Kevin, so good morning. Really appreciate the question. Appreciate the kind words. I would say, we have been saying all year long that what our year guidance was, and we've just taken it to the high end. And frankly, if you work through the guide, you'd find that we're probably going to be a little bit above the high end for revenue and EBITDA based on our fourth quarter projection. And then AFFO and AFFO per share kind of works out to right at the high end of the guidance. Of course, you are right, FX has been a headwind to us all year, probably at least as much of a headwind in the fourth quarter as it was in the third quarter in light of the dollar strength. And I know that it may sound a little bit -- just getting into the weeds, but that may sound a little counter to what you expect when you look at, say, the pound and the euro. But don't forget, we have a fair amount of exposure in Latin America. We've got a great business there. And incidentally, our Latin America business is doing phenomenally well, really growing bookings in our digital business, taking off dramatically in LatAm. But with that, we are exposed to the Argentine peso, the Chilean currencies or the Brazilian real. And so all of those you would see have had a really tough go versus the dollar. So that's disproportionately impacting our revenue and our EBITDA. But look, we feel really good about where we are and our outlook is very favorable. And as we said before, we are running well ahead of our long-term target for a CAGR of 10% that we issued at Investor Day. We're probably running 200 basis points, 300 basis points or more above that for the first few years of that target, and we continue to expect to be at or above those levels and driving considerable profitability. And that is based on -- our growth portfolio that Bill spoke about, we expect that growth portfolio to continue to grow it in excess of 20% for a long period of time. That's ALM, digital and data center, coupled together with the strength of our global RIM business. Next question? Operator : Next question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, everybody. Question on InSight. You caught my ear with the 22 wins on the InSight DXP platform. I wanted to know if Iron Mountain is getting revenues for InSight? I know kind of initially that wasn't the strategy, more of a cross sell. So if you're not getting much revenues, what's kind of a typical revenues you're getting from new storage contracts that are bundled with the InSight capability? And if 22 a large number of InSight wins, like, why should we understand this to be important? William Meaney : Thanks, Andrew. I appreciate the question. So first of all, it's 24, but who's counting, but just -- first of all, we don\u2019t do anything for free. So these are -- when I say highly profitable, these are the typical kind of double-digit service contracts that you're used to watching us. Think of these things, depending on the length of the contract, depending on how much productivity we build in during the length of the contract, but think of them somewhere between 20% and 40% gross margin contracts. The nice thing about these with the DXP platform, not only are we tracking those contracts, I mean, you've been watching the company for a long time, when we start off our digital business is that we were doing relatively little in the area of workflow, much more feeding their data links by the digitization of physical documents. This DXP platform, not only part of it is -- there is a digitization part. But more importantly, when I'm talking about the 20% to 40% margin, depending on the length of the contract, and how much productivity we can build during that course is lots of times, it's taking in data that's completely digital, it's foreign digitally. And we're putting that into our SaaS platform, creating metadata automatically and putting workflow around that. So I think I highlighted the savings bond example. Recently, that was the precursor to DXP, where we took 2 billion microfiche images of historical savings bonds where they couldn't find the owners. And 96% of them we were able to process with the precursor of DXP, which we called InSight and without a person in the loop and identify the owner. So it's that kind of power in this platform. And of course, we've taken it the next step further, and it's a fully SaaS-based platform. But we like the profitability of this business. We really like the growth of the business. And generally, I think you know me well enough. I don't do anything for free. Operator : Your next question will come from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. Maybe you could just touch on kind of some of your longer-term aspirations with ALM. I know at your Investor Day a couple of years ago, you talked about getting to $900 million or so of revenues by 2026, that's obviously a pretty massive ramp from where you're currently at. So I just wanted to confirm if that's still your stated goal? And maybe how you can kind of bridge from where you're at today, call it, just north of $400 million in annualized revenue to that number, whether it comes from component pricing, volume or incremental M&A that you may or may not do? Thank you. William Meaney : Let me -- thanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. So I think, yes, we still very much have line of sight to the targets that we set out on Investor Day. Now obviously, that's a combination of organic growth. And as Barry pointed out, we had very, very strong organic growth this quarter. We continue \u2013 although, it was up over 50% this quarter, we continue to guide that we can maintain over 20% growth because there's obviously some fluctuation in the pricing of components over time, and we saw that 1.5 years or 2 years ago. But if you look at the volumetric trends that we see in that business, whether it be on enterprise, whether it be on hyperscale data centers or even enterprise data centers decommissioned is the amount of volume because people have a different need as they refresh their equipment than maybe they had 10 years ago, both environmentally and from a security standpoint. We see the volumetric trends. So that's a really strong double-digit growth business. And in addition, we \u2013 like, the acquisitions we highlighted that we did in Q3, we see that there's a number of these acquisitions that we'll continue to build. So we feel really good about the targets that we outlined on Investor Day. I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything. Barry Hytinen : I think, Eric, the top line target that we provided for the whole company was 10%, and we're obviously running, as I mentioned earlier, a couple of hundred -- 200 basis points, 300 basis points ahead of that. I think our growth portfolio continues to outperform and our global RIM business, also is considerably ahead of where our projections were at that time in the scenario that you're referring to. I'd just underscore, ALM is a really big category. And the TAM there is immense. We're already one of the, if not, the largest player. And I think both from an organic and inorganic standpoint, we can become the market leader in that space. And you saw us doing that both on the organic side as well as with a couple of recent complementary deal. So we feel quite good about ALM. It is very much on track with our strategy for cross selling and driving more value for our clients. Next question, please. Operator : Next question will come from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I want to stick with the ALM theme. Can you just give us some more details around Wisetek and APCD in terms of their geography and their product offering, maybe the customer focus between enterprise and hyperscale? And also the appetite you have for larger acquisitions, instead maybe some of these bolt-ons? William Meaney : Thanks, Brendan for the question. So let me -- I'll talk a little bit about the categories and geographies they bring. So Wisetek really helps us expand our portfolio, primarily, in Europe and North America. So they have good presence in both markets. In addition, they also bring strong customer relationships, both on the enterprise, but also we picked up a new hyperscale customer the acquisition of Wisetek, which was great. This is a customer that we have a relationship in some of our other businesses already. But having -- picking up the hyperscale relationship on the ALM side, in addition through the Wisetek acquisition was really great. I think also, obviously, the acquisition we did in Australia does build out our capabilities in Australia, which has always been a strong and important market for Iron Mountain, but it allows us to actually broaden our portfolio of services for our customers there. I don't know, Barry, if you want to talk a little bit more about\u2026 Barry Hytinen : Hi, Brendan. Good morning. We didn't really disclose financial terms on these couple of smaller deals, but I will tell you that, combined, they probably represent in the vicinity of $75 million, $80 million run rate revenue and they -- Wisetek is based in Ireland that has decent sized operations as Bill was mentioning both in Europe as well as U.S. and a little bit in Asia. APCD, as I mentioned, is based in Australia. And the thing about Australia is that's a large data center market, as I know you know, because you follow the data center industry so well. So that is an underpenetrated opportunity for us, both in terms of enterprise as well as decommissioning. And so we feel very good about these opportunities. You've seen what we've been able to do, even still early on with our Regency acquisition. I think all of these create more scale, more capability and more reach for us to serve our global client base much more effectively. And as you mentioned, are we open to larger deals? The thing about this is there's really -- I mean, we're already the larger player. So actually, you get past us and a couple of others that are, say, half our size, they -- all the players that are in space are relatively small, Brendan? So you're thinking like $100 million revenue or less. And so, I don't think you should anticipate anything large in that space. And -- but frankly, we're doing quite well on the organic side, and we're very happy to welcome the team from Wisetek and APCD to our company. So thank you for the questions. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
